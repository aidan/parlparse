<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-01_spopq0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>How their commitment given at European Union level in May "promoting a 10-year work programme on sustainable production and consumption with the aim of reversing the trends in the loss of natural resources and promoting the decoupling of economic growth from environmental degradation" will be drawn to the attention of consumers.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Lord Whitty): </B>  My Lords, the Government and the European Union are seeking agreement at the World Summit on Sustainable Development to a 10-year work programme on sustainable production and consumption. Clearly, informing consumers about the outcomes of the world summit will form part of the EU's communication strategy. Raising consumer awareness of the environmental pressures remains integral to our promotion of environmental policies, programmes and campaigns.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-01_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply. However, the Government have made very little effort to inform consumers of what exactly their goals are and how consumers could translate that in terms of exercising a good choice on the high street. Does the Minister agree that not many Members of your Lordships' House have heard of last year's DEFRA campaign, "Pick the daisy", which was about choosing products with an EU eco-label? Does he agree that that is not fair to manufacturers, who are trying to up their game and produce products that use fewer natural resources, or to consumers, who are unable to implement any buying power in order to make a better environmental choice?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, it is unfair to say that the Government have not taken initiatives in this area. We have, in conjunction with industry, greatly improved the commitments involving the provision of environmental information to consumers. There are examples in the area of domestic appliances. Eco-labelling is only one aspect of that information. We have not developed a nationwide eco-labelling scheme partly because the European eco-label, with a daisy, is being developed at that level. It is important in an internationally traded sector to have a Europe-wide <P>


<a name="column_816"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 816</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>system. Wider promotion of information on energy consumption and material consumption is also part of the system, and not a simple label.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall: </B>   My Lords, the Question on the Order Paper relates to decoupling of economic growth and environmental degradation. The Government are to be congratulated on reducing the energy coefficient of growth, which is the relationship between GDP and the growth of energy consumption&#151;growth is now slower. However, does the Minister agree that we have not so far succeeded in reducing the waste coefficient of growth? Do we know why that is and why the price mechanism is not reducing packaging and other coefficients of growth? If the tax and price mechanism is not somehow giving the right signals, do we face the dilemma that the alternative is regulation, which in other respects is not now a popular policy?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend is correct to say that we have reduced the energy coefficient. I believe that 30 or 40 years ago it was more than 1; in other words, we used more energy for every 1 per cent of growth in GDP. The figure is now substantially lower in the UK and worldwide. We have also reduced the total resource coefficient. Over the past 30 years, UK consumption of resources grew by about 12 per cent, whereas GDP and income grew by nearly 90 per cent. We had least success in the waste area. We must address information and consumer behaviour in that area and, ultimately, regulation and price. A combination of those instruments is needed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   My Lords, as someone who has in the past sold daisies to Japan, I will concentrate, as did the noble Lord, Lord Lea of Crondall, on the second half of the Question. Exactly how do the Government propose to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation other than waste?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I have already indicated that we have had some success in terms of reduction and the relationship between total use of resources and growth in GDP. That reduction must continue. We have had substantial success in relation to energy. In conjunction with industry, we are looking at various market transformations, particularly in the area of domestic appliances, to allow consumers to make choices that minimise energy use and waste content. Our main approach is to raise awareness and work with market solutions, but it is clear that better labelling and a degree of regulation also play a part.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Palmer: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that, if the Government were to give active support to a vibrant bio-fuel industry, that would resolve an enormous amount of their commitments?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, as noble Lords know, we are committed to the development of renewable energies of many sorts. On the issue of bio-fuels, as the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, knows, the department is <P>


<a name="column_817"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 817</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>seriously considering the possibilities of various forms of renewable energy through crops, in respect of bio-mass and liquid bio-fuels.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-01_spnew8"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Hereford: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that consumers learn about sustainability issues but that they tend to do so rather slowly? Introducing one sector after another is quite a wise policy. People have already learnt to look for recycled paper and glass products and, when people buy something that is made of wood, they look to see whether it has come from sustainable forests. Does the Minister agree that to attack the question sector by sector is a wise approach? What area of manufacturing do the Government plan to look at next?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, in one sense, that is a sensible approach, in that we must establish in people's consciousness the information for which they must look. We have had substantial success in relation to the energy consumption of domestic appliances. The scale of A to G has now been reduced because people buy only the top three, most energy efficient appliances. Both the Government and industry are focusing on providing better consumer information, based on energy consumption, in that area.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-01_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that the Government have been a little slow in considering some of these issues? As a result, we are experiencing tremendous problems with mountains of fridges. Soon, that will also be the case in respect of televisions. Many European directives are giving us enormous problems of which the general public are not aware.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the European directives are geared to reducing waste and the damaging effects of waste, particularly in relation to fridges. We are tackling that problem. Long discussions have been held in various places about the effectiveness of the directive concerning fridges. There is a difficult, short-term problem relating to the dumping of fridges, but we are tackling that problem and overcoming it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Clark of Windermere: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest as chair of the Forestry Commission. Will the Minister remind or announce to consumers in the House that the state forestry service in Britain is the first in the world to be accredited as sustainable? Can he give assurances to all our consumers in Britain that by-products from the state forestry service will, indeed, be from sustainable forests?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I accept both the declaration of interest and the serious commitment of the Forestry Commission to sustainable timber. My department has given very clear advice to consumers on the choice of timber-based materials. Purchases of wood are an important contribution to that end.

<P>
<A NAME="20711-01_spopq1"></A><B> Lord Rix </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What steps they are taking to implement the commitment made in the White Paper Valuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century (Cm 5086, paragraph 7.16) to promote supported living for people with a learning disability living with older parents aged 70 and over.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </B>  My Lords, the Government are committed to the implementation of the White Paper. They have issued Section 7 guidance and promoting supported living for people with a learning disability living with older carers is one of the priorities for both the revenue and capital elements of the £42 million learning disability development fund.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. Can he confirm that the Department of Health and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will issue joint guidance to local housing authorities and social services to ensure that they increase their efforts to provide such services and such housing for people with a learning disability who live at home with parents or a parent aged 70 or over? Will the Minister comment on how he feels that the joint guidance will be accepted? I should like to point out to your Lordships that, in view of the debate in another place yesterday, I use the word "joint" in its meaning of "togetherness".

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, this Government are always together. The Department of Health and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister hope to issue guidance very shortly. I believe that local authorities will find it helpful and supportive. The guidance will give a great deal of good advice on how they should develop their strategies. In doing so, we are particularly anxious that local authorities pick up the pressing need of older carers who have devoted their lives to their children with learning disabilities and worry about the future. We intend to monitor how local authorities take forward those plans and proposals.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   My Lords, people with an appalling disability should be a priority group but they have been neglected. Is it not likely that the Government's guidance will also be neglected? Can my noble friend say whether Section 7 guidance is mandatory?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, so far as concerns Section 7 guidance, the courts have held that local authorities are required to follow the path charted by the Secretary of State's guidance. They have liberty to deviate from it where they judge, on admissible grounds, that there is a good reason to do so but they do not have the freedom to take a <P>


<a name="column_819"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 819</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>substantially different course. I believe that that makes the position absolutely clear. As my noble friend suggests, I acknowledge that the record of local authorities in this area has been very patchy. That is why local partnership boards will be required to produce housing strategies in the winter of 2002&#150;03. Those will be informed by the local assessments of needs, which are being reviewed at present, and by the guidance that I have already mentioned.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that village communities are the cheapest and happiest places for people with learning difficulties to live in? Anything that the Government can do to stimulate the creation of further village communities will do most to solve this problem.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I am aware of the noble Lord's deep concern about the value of village communities and his wish to ensure that such provision is available. He will know that the White Paper specified that village communities are one option which local partnership boards, comprising local authorities and other statutory agencies at local level, will take into account. I recognise that, for some people, village communities offer a genuine option. Equally, we expect the local partnership boards to consider other options as well, including supported living and other approaches that have been shown to work well.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, what guidance do the Government intend to give to people in their fifties, for example, whose children with learning disabilities live with them? Can the Minister say something about future planning? Thankfully, the life expectancy of those with learning disabilities is being raised all the time. However, that means that over time the problem to which I refer will increase.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, that point was made in the recent report by Mencap, which criticises local authorities for dealing only with the problem of older carers when perhaps one carer has died or a crisis point is reached. Clearly, the more we plan in advance the better. The local partnership boards are now undertaking an assessment of those kinds of needs in order to be able to plan for the future.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Morris of Manchester: </B>   My Lords, can my noble friend tell the House whether the Government will now be urgently reviewing the availability of local authority funded housing support places for this priority group, since at the present rate of progress&#151;227 places a year&#151;it will take 30 years to meet the needs of people with a learning disability now living with parents aged 70 and above?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, the precise point of the Section 7 guidance is to ensure that local authorities within the partnership boards develop a local housing strategy. It is our expectation that in the light of their assessment of local needs of people with <P>


<a name="column_820"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 820</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>learning disabilities and their carers, local authorities will develop a housing strategy this winter, which we shall carefully review.
<P>

<a name="20711-02_para0"></a>We are keen to emphasise to local authorities that while they need to look at special provisions, much of the availability of social housing could well prove to be attractive to people with learning disabilities. It is important that all options are considered.

<A NAME="20711-02_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Blaker </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What are their current policies towards Zimbabwe.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Amos): </B>  My Lords, there is a strong international consensus opposed to the actions of the Zimbabwe regime. We shall work to strengthen that consensus, while supporting credible regional efforts&#151;in particular the joint initiative of South Africa and Nigeria&#151;to restore democratic legitimacy to Zimbabwe.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Blaker: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister confirm that at their June meeting, the European Union foreign ministers decided not to intensify the sanctions against Mr Mugabe and his cronies? Can she also confirm that at the recent G8 conference in Canada the documents issued by the conference contained no reference to Zimbabwe, nor did the Statement on the G8 conference given by the Prime Minister last week in another place?
<P>

<a name="20711-02_para1"></a>Is the disappearance of Zimbabwe from the Government's radar screen the result of the fact that in the new treaty for the African union great importance is attached to human rights and good governance and not least to peer pressure to remedy any backsliding? Is the Government's policy now to leave any effort towards remedying the situation in Zimbabwe, which is causing ruin in most of Southern Africa, to African countries alone?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-02_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, Zimbabwe has not disappeared from the Government's radar screen. We have discussed Zimbabwe on many occasions in this House and sought to make clear the UK position. Clearly, I have not been successful in that. Perhaps my communication skills are at fault.
<P>

<a name="20711-02_para2"></a>I shall repeat the Government's position. We deplore the violence and intimidation in Zimbabwe. We deeply regret the economic mismanagement which has led to a food crisis. That means that nearly 50 per cent of the population could need supplementary feeding by the end of the year. We have worked consistently to ensure international consensus on the issue. At the Commonwealth "troika" meeting, Zimbabwe was suspended from the Council of the Commonwealth. We have pressed the importance of human rights and good governance through the G8 <P>


<a name="column_821"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 821</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>process. The G8 Africa action plan contains several strong statements about the importance of good governance and the rule of law. I hope that noble Lords will read that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, the Government's policy on Zimbabwe is broadly right. However, a solution to the problem will have to come from the African countries. Is my noble friend aware that our efforts should therefore be concentrated on trying to influence the African countries which can put pressure on Mr Mugabe to change his policies? I refer in particular to the South African Government. They persuaded Mr Smith to change his policies. Perhaps they will have the same effect on Mr Mugabe.
<P>

<a name="20711-02_para3"></a>My noble friend spoke of starvation in Southern Africa. Which policies are the Government in a position to implement in relation to the starving people in Zimbabwe? How will we get the food to them?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-02_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, I agree with my noble friend. The leadership shown from within the African continent is essential in helping to resolve the issue. I have spoken on many occasions about the importance of peer pressure from the countries around Zimbabwe, particularly as they suffer from the economic mismanagement in Zimbabwe. In that context, the Southern African Development Community, including South Africa, is important.
<P>

<a name="20711-02_para4"></a>As regards the food crisis in southern Africa, and in particular Zimbabwe, it is important that a different kind of economic management and a sustainable and transparent land reform process are put in place. Clearly, distribution of food will be a problem. However, we remain committed to working with our international partners, including the World Food Programme, on that issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, did the Minister note the action of the southern African churches on the UN international day in support of victims of torture, at which numerous testimonies were given of rape, violence and torture? Did she note also the suggestion made in South Africa that sooner or later there will have to be a truth commission to deal with those events? Will the Government support an international initiative to collect and validate witness statements so that in due course such a truth commission would be armed with the fullest possible facts?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-02_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, I am aware that not only the South African churches but other NGOs are concerned with the situation in Zimbabwe and, in particular, victims of torture. At present, our focus is not only on creating a political consensus but on dealing with the immediate humanitarian crisis. I am aware that discussions are ongoing, particularly in the NGO community, about the possibility of a truth commission. Those are not discussions in which we as a government are currently engaged. However, once we get through the current crisis, we shall seriously consider the matter.

<A NAME="20711-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Howell of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware&#151;I am not sure that she was when we pressed her on sanctions earlier in the week&#151;that the Foreign Secretary undertook to review the whole operation of travel sanctions at a meeting to be held on 22nd July, which is the week after next? Is she also aware that he stated there is a strong case for an extension of the measures? We agree with that. I urge the Minister to urge her colleagues, as vigorously as possible, to get on with an extension of the sanctions, which have not worked well. We must bear in mind that we are dealing with personnel led by Mr Mugabe, who are heading for the destitution of Zimbabwe, the undermining of the entire region's prosperity and the starvation of millions of people.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, I think that the noble Lord, Lord Howell, is referring to the GAC meeting on 22nd July. The sanctions are EU sanctions. There will be discussion at that GAC meeting. It is for that meeting to reach a decision on whether or not it wants to extend those sanctions.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para0"></a>I do not agree with the noble Lord that the sanctions have not worked well. I have been pressed in this House on the attendance of Robert Mugabe, for example, at the World Food Summit meeting in Rome. I hope that I have made it clear to the House that there is an exemption for attendance at international UN meetings. That applies across the board. It does not apply only to Robert Mugabe, but to other world leaders who face travel bans for other situations.

Where there has been any attempt to frustrate, or to be disobliging to your Lordships or to any MP in another place, of course we shall insist that proprieties are observed.

<A NAME="20711-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, can my noble friend confirm that it is thanks to the Labour Government's Data Protection Act 1998 that individuals have a much greater right to know what personal data are held about them by government departments? That is a welcome development, the benefits of which should be offset against the opportunities for a bit of point scoring.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Macdonald of Tradeston: </B>   My Lords, I agree with my noble friend in principle. However, it inevitably makes for uncomfortable moments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, are there any plans to submit evidence on not answering parliamentary Questions, or on giving evasive replies&#151;although, of course, I do not have in mind any Member of this House on the Government Front Bench?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Macdonald of Tradeston: </B>   My Lords, departments will remind staff of their responsibilities. It is a matter that is taken seriously by the Government. As I said earlier, the Department for Education and Skills has already taken steps to remind its staff.

<P>
<A NAME="20711-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Macdonald of Tradeston: </B>   My Lords, from my experience at ministerial level they are neither discouraged nor encouraged.

The noble Lord touches on a point which came up recently. I was looking at a submission which had rather personalised&#151;I thought&#151;profiles attached, which talked about an eccentric from that great cradle of eccentricity, and named a certain school. I protested about that, but was told that it came off the Internet and was pulled off one of the commercial suppliers. So I do not think that we can blame the Civil Service for information that is readily available on most of your Lordships' shelves.

<A NAME="20711-03_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions   (Baroness Hollis of Heigham): </B>  My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall now repeat a Statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the Minister for Work and Pensions. The Statement is as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<a name="20711-03_para4"></a>"I would like to make a Statement on the Pickering report that was published this morning.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para5"></a>"The report is the culmination of nine months of hard work by Alan Pickering and his team. I would like to thank him and also everyone who took the time and effort to submit their views&#151;some of whom are here today.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para6"></a>"In his report Alan Pickering acknowledges the encouragement he received not only from my right honourable friends for Edinburgh Central and Makerfield, but also from the right honourable and honourable members opposite for Hitchin and Harpenden, Havant and Northavon.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para7"></a>"I believe pensions simplification has to be at the heart of any strategy to encourage greater pension provision. We need to deal with the complexities built up over the years by successive governments.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para8"></a>"Alan's report makes 52 recommendations. Among the key ones are: a new pensions Act to consolidate all existing private pensions legislation; a new, more proactive, regulator; a better, more targeted approach for communicating with pension scheme members; more flexibility to modify schemes; allowing employers to make membership <P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=3>of their occupational pension scheme a condition of employment; and the ending of compulsory indexation for defined benefit pensions and compulsory survivors' benefits.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para9"></a>"The report, together with Ron Sandler's proposals&#151;announced by my honourable friend the Financial Secretary on Tuesday&#151;represents the first stage of a comprehensive review of occupational and personal pension provision in the country.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para10"></a>"The Government will take a radical look at the issues, together with the results of the Inland Revenue review of tax simplification, when that is completed. In the autumn we will come forward with our proposals in a Green Paper.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para11"></a>"This will initiate a wide-ranging consultation. It will look at private pensions policy in the round, including the opportunities open to people around retirement, and will set out the Government's proposals to enable people to build up more pension savings.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para12"></a>"Alan Pickering's report covers some complex issues and includes some tough choices&#151;the inevitable dilemmas faced by all simplifiers.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para13"></a>"The report presents challenges to us all&#151;to employees and their unions, to employers and commercial pension providers, to government and opposition.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para14"></a>"I believe we need to be guided by the following principles and objectives, grounded in a long-term approach; fairness, security in retirement, informed choice for consumers, simple and proportionate regulation, ensuring incentives are effective and well understood, promoting employment among older workers and flexibility to give individuals more choice over the pace at which they retire from the labour market. I hope that we can secure all-party agreement to these.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para15"></a>"The Government believe that pension provision should be based on partnership, which can secure lasting buy-in from all key players.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para16"></a>"We must strike the right balances between sometimes competing goals. We want the simplicity that enables people to make informed choices, without stifling product innovation and competition. We want a proportionate regulatory framework that provides sufficient security for savers while making it worthwhile for employers and commercial providers to make available good pension products. We need to ensure that we remove unnecessary barriers to employer provision and employer contributions. We need to make it easier for people to save and easier to sell savings products, as Ron Sandler's report proposed on Tuesday. We need to achieve all of that and more against the remorseless arithmetic that tells us that because we are living longer and want to maintain a good standard of living in retirement, we need to save more, work longer, or achieve a combination of both.

<P>

<a name="20711-03_para17"></a>"We wanted Alan Pickering to present a strong challenge to the degree of regulation of private pensions. He has done that; he has made some valuable proposals for simplifying pensions legislation and reducing administrative burdens on  both schemes and employers&#151;cutting costs and simplifying choices for individuals. His recommendations also present some tough choices.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para18"></a>"Let us consider, for example, his recommendation that employers should have the choice to make joining a company pension a condition of employment. Some 16 per cent of people who could benefit from a company pension scheme presently choose not to do so. Compelling people to join would restrict those people's choice. But we must balance against that the beneficial effects for schemes and the overall effect of extending pension coverage.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para19"></a>"Alan has also made a number of specific recommendations for easements of legislation, especially to repeal Section 67 of the Pensions Act 1995. Again, that throws up a tough choice. That recommendation would mean that if employers faced funding constraints with their scheme, they could have an option to reduce future funding costs rather than to close the scheme. That would remove an absolute guarantee against the consequences of change but might well secure a better outcome for members and the future of the scheme, when set against the alternative of its closure. Alan also recommends an end to compulsory indexation of pensions and the removal of compulsory survivors' benefits as a condition of contracting out.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para20"></a>"On first reading, those proposals are not attractive. They go against the drive for the past 30 years to price-protect pensions and enhance survivors' benefits. But, in the light of Alan Pickering's report, we will need to consider all the consequences.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para21"></a>"As well as the big themes and recommendations to which I have referred, a number of more modest issues are addressed to my department and to others: for example, improving how contracting out is administered, streamlining procedures and reducing general administrative burdens; considering ways to provide better advice through the workplace; and improving information given to pension scheme members. Those recommendations have considerable merit and, subject to the response that we receive to the report, I intend to implement them.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para22"></a>"In conclusion, Alan Pickering's report offers clear options for simplification and makes a valuable contribution to the debate that we must have about the next stage of pension reform. We must face up to the tough choices that he sets out. In seeking to simplify in future, we must also face up to what is in many ways the harder challenge of simplifying the past, in the sense that we need to simplify the different regulations that have built up over the years. Otherwise, we will end up adding yet another layer to the existing layer cake of regulation and complexity.

<P>

<a name="20711-03_para23"></a>"Alan Pickering's proposals are radical, ambitious and pragmatic. I urge the House, the public, employers, trade unions and pension providers&#151;all those whose partnership is essential for effective pension reform&#151;to give them full and constructive consideration. The Government will certainly do so. The acid tests for the Green Paper must be what will increase the level of savings for retirement and make a secure occupational pension accessible to as many people as possible."
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para24"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, first, I thank the noble Baroness for repeating the Statement made in another place and declare an interest as the chairman of an occupational pension scheme. We certainly welcome the report and congratulate Mr Pickering&#151;as I prefer to refer to him, rather than in the informal manner used by the Minister. Of course, Mr Pickering and his team benefited from widespread consultation, including that with my honourable friend Mr Willetts in another place.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para25"></a>Having said that, the terms of reference of the report were restrictive. For that reason, it does not convey the present sense of crisis in pension provision. Neither does it analyse the causes of that crisis, other than in a passing reference to the problems of FRS 17, which have, I hope, been at least deferred, and the minimum funding requirement.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para26"></a>About five years go, the Government rightly paid tribute to the tremendous contribution made by company schemes, calling them the jewel in the crown, and so on. But, since then, they have suffered one blow after another&#151;most notoriously, of course, the Chancellor of the Exchequer's attack on them in his first Budget. How much worse off does the Minister think that pension schemes now are as a result of that? Does that not now amount to more than £35 billion?
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para27"></a>Nor does the report refer to other specific examples, such as the deterrent effect that the minimum income guarantee related to earnings may have on people who may otherwise contribute to pensions. That is especially true of defined contribution schemes. The noble Baronesses shakes her head. What size of pension fund would be necessary to lift people above the level of benefit provided by the minimum income guarantee?
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para28"></a>As the report makes clear, it must be considered against the Sandler report, which we discussed last Tuesday. Sandler was enthusiastic about stakeholder products, which we must consider against the background of the stakeholder pension. That has been disappointing in terms of reaching its target audience of about 5 million people. As a result of how it has operated, only a small proportion of those whom the Government hoped to help&#151;some estimates are as low as 2 per cent&#151;may have benefited.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para29"></a>In that context, I am concerned by the expression used by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury when she referred to such products as "a safe haven". Would the noble Baroness refer to the stakeholder pension as <P>


<a name="column_828"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 828</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a safe haven? In my view, such a statement is akin to mis-selling. If someone invested, say, £1,000 in a stakeholder pension, is that likely to be worth more or less now?
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para30"></a>I warmly welcome some parts of the report. In a paragraph to which the Statement did not refer, but which is none the less important, it considers whether trustees should have more flexibility in giving advice to their beneficiaries. That is a real problem. Pickering envisages that most in the context of whether they could recommend a particular pension. But trustees are also inhibited by the current legislation from expressing a view on, for example, what someone who has had an additional voluntary contribution policy with Equitable Life for the past couple of years or so should do about that. Trustees may well know more about that than the independent financial advisers to whom they otherwise necessarily must refer their beneficiaries.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para31"></a>That brings us to the question of compulsory membership. It is estimated that about 16 per cent of employees do not join company schemes. That is a question of communication, but it is extraordinary that not everyone who is entitled to join even the best scheme does so. That is a cause for concern, although whether compulsion is the right answer is debatable.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para32"></a>The report also rightly draws especial attention to the problems of regulation. Basically, it distinguishes between the administrative burden placed on company schemes&#151;which is great and has steadily increased in recent years&#151;and what Pickering refers to as prescription on design, that is to say, on what should be the terms of the pension scheme. He draws particular attention to the effect on defined benefit schemes and questions whether they should be required to be indexed and to include survivor benefits. Those are difficult areas and will require careful consideration.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para33"></a>There is a slight counsel of despair in Pickering's observation that such provisions may have to be abandoned because of the difficulties that companies are facing in the present climate. The report refers also to the reduction in the different types of pension, where a balance must be struck. There are advantages in simplification but if the number of schemes is reduced too much, consumer choice will be limited.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para34"></a>In recent months we have seen something almost approaching panic, with companies closing defined benefit schemes and moving towards defined contribution schemes&#151;the effect of the factors that I have mentioned and of a decline in the stock market. If that trend continues unabated, there may be little left of the company pension scheme that has been admired for such a long time.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para35"></a>I urge the Government to react quickly to the report. The Statement promises a Green Paper in the autumn, but one was published shortly after the Government came to office. It aimed at reversing the proportion of private to public schemes to 60 per cent and 40 per cent. Since then, the proportion has moved steadily in the wrong direction. It is important that the Government's response should not be unduly delayed. <P>


<a name="column_829"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 829</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The consultation with Mr. Pickering has been extremely helpful, but if the present situation is not to deteriorate further, it will be necessary to set a tight timetable for assessing the proposals made in the report&#151;which I say again is extremely helpful.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_time3"></a><H5>3.52 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-03_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness the Minister for repeating the Statement and welcome this extremely interesting and thought-provoking report.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para36"></a>It is easy to view the report in a particular way against the current crisis, when many of its proposals are for the longer term. It is incumbent upon the House to look at the design and intention behind some of Mr. Pickering's proposals.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para37"></a>There is much in the report for careful and thorough consideration, such as the proposals for survivor benefits. The report describes the changing nature of relationships and employment. From earlier debates on pension policy, it is clear that a crisis exists in relation to pensions for women. For the foreseeable future, women will earn much less than their male counterparts&#151;so their pension purchasing power will inevitably be lower. What efforts will be made in the consultations to focus on women's pension problems?
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para38"></a>The report's second most important proposal concerns indexation. Mr. Pickering observes that a pension is a pension is a pension. However, in many cases a pension scheme promise is not worth the paper that it is written on. The settlement as between private and state pension provision is falling apart. It is difficult to see how some of the indexation proposals can be taken on board to achieve the report's stated objective of increasing confidence in occupational pensions and savings.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para39"></a>Some aspects that are not part of the report, such as an analysis of the healthcare costs of retirement, must be part of the Green Paper. I hope that that paper will not make the mistake of confusing mortality with morbidity. The prospect of a large number of older people living much longer at considerably higher healthcare costs must be taken into consideration when devising a long-term pensions policy.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para40"></a>My one strong criticism of the report is that it greatly overestimates the power of employees individually or collectively to challenge pensions provision decisions made by their employers. In recent months, we have seen what it takes for even informed bodies of workers to mount a legal challenge. The report's proposals rest on extremely well-equipped and powerful employees. I am not sure that that situation will exist in future.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para41"></a>The report offers the potential for a wholly new contract for occupational pensions. Equally, because the proposals are tentative, there is the potential for a complete disaster or dog's dinner. What will the consultation document contain about the timing of implementation&#151;on which many of the proposals and transitional arrangements rest?
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-03_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I too find it difficult to talk about Alan. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, and the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, for their constructive approach. If we are to find ways through difficult situations with staying power, there must be consent. Informed criticism is a different aspect. I much welcome the consensual tone evident so far and hope that it will be perpetuated.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para42"></a>The noble Lord asked about the cost of ACT to pension schemes. About £5 billion a year came back to the Exchequer as a result of no longer having the tax defamation that was ACT&#151;of which about £3.5 billion fell directly on pension schemes. British companies, unlike American companies, were paying as a result of a tax distortion too much in dividends while not making enough of the investment on which long-term jobs and the pensions of future generations depend. We are delighted to see that, since that change in the tax structure, investment in companies has increased, which means that it is having the effect that we hoped for.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para43"></a>Secondly, the noble Lord asked about pension credit. He asked what size of fund would be needed to raise somebody above MIG. In fact, it will not work like that. Pension credit has addressed that issue, and the noble Lord's question is a pre-pension credit question. For example, for someone who has a full state retirement pension and an occupational pension of £100 a week, that occupational pension would not raise them above MIG. We can work out what the pension pot would have to be for that £100. Under pension credit, that pensioner would keep £60 of the £100, and the figure would go up to something like £113 a week, as opposed to the current figure of £100 a week. Therefore, the question will not be relevant once the pension credit system is in place next year.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para44"></a>The third point that the noble Lord raised was about stakeholders. I simply disagree with him about the success or otherwise of stakeholders. So far, something like 815,000 people have joined a stakeholder scheme. The vast majority of those people are the people of working age whom we hoped to help. Because those products are low cost, transparent trackers of the index, they are safer, cheaper and more readily available than the products on the market hitherto.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para45"></a>The noble Lord also raised a query about the Government's response to the move from defined benefit to defined contribution schemes. As I said, they are safer, they are low-cost, and they are transparent trackers. The safest product of all is one that does not relate to any volatility on the market and is simply guaranteed by the taxpayer&#151;the retirement pension and similar savings vehicles. Among funded occupational schemes, the stakeholder product, given its low cost, its transparency and the fact that it tracks the index, is likely to be safer and more reliable than others currently available to people of modest income.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para46"></a>The noble Lord's last major point was about the DB-to-DC schemes. He will know that, with the move from DB to DC schemes, there is a transfer of risk. The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, said that a pension <P>


<a name="column_831"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 831</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>promise was not a pension promise when it was not delivered. For many years, employers have enjoyed a pension contributions holiday and have not had to meet the pension promise behind the defined benefit scheme. Even last year, half of all companies had either suspended or reduced pension contributions. The moment that employers are required to pay the full sum implied in the pension promise, some of them, encouraged by financial directors, vote with their feet and move into defined contribution schemes and use that as an opportunity to reduce their pension commitment from an average of 12 to 15 per cent to 5 to 7 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para47"></a>The key thing is whether not only employees but employers pay at the levels that we need to establish decent retirement incomes in old age. We will consider whether Pickering has the right solution. But there is no dispute about the fact that what matters is that, over time, if the same level of contribution is kept up and if we make the same assumptions about the stock market, a DC scheme and a DB scheme should not produce strikingly different outcomes. The trouble is that employers are using the opportunity to cut contributions, which means that outcomes will be very different.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para48"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, pressed me on two major points, the first of which was timing. We will have a consultation document, and it will probably&#151;it is a matter for others, not for me&#151;lead to legislation. Were that to be the case and should there be consensus, we would be talking about the year after for consultation with the industry, and we would have to give two years' notice and so on. The noble Baroness is right about that. Changing pensions structures takes time because people invest in them for 40 years or so. It is right that we should get a consensus for change and, as far as possible, consider all the aspects properly, rather than going for a hasty solution.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para49"></a>The noble Baroness also asked about survivors' benefits and whether we were considering the situation properly. I am happy to repeat the undertaking that the Secretary of State gave earlier today. The consultative document will consider all implications for the gender balance properly and thoroughly. Obviously, Pickering considers the three balances: that between employers and employees; that between pension providers and consumers; and that between employees with a pension and those without. However, the Government must take two other balances into consideration. One is the gender balance and the other is the intergenerational contract between current pensioners, who may be open to Section 67 changes, and those who are deferred pensioners or current employees. That is part of the wider context, wider than the issues that Pickering addressed.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para50"></a>The noble Baroness will know that, according to the Association of British Insurers statistics, something like 80 per cent of those buying a money purchase pot go for flat-rate single life products because they prefer to have the money up front. That is a consideration because, if one is not careful, one simply pushes the problem of poverty further into old age. That is particularly the case for women. That is why we must <P>


<a name="column_832"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 832</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>consider whether we can encourage women not only to come into the labour market, as we do, but to build up a proper, independent pension provision, including pension sharing on divorce for those whose relationship ends, something of which the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, was a prominent advocate. There is also the question of the roles of the state second pension and the stakeholder scheme.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para51"></a>The Government have produced ways to help women to compensate for the fact that they have lower earnings and earn for a shorter time, although they live longer. That produces a complex of pension issues that are sharper than those experienced by men.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para52"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, teased us about the previous Green Paper on pension reform, published, I think, in December 1998. He asked what we had done. In the foreword, the Prime Minister said that we needed an assurance of a decent income through the new minimum income guarantee and that that income should rise in line with earnings. We have done that; it will become the pension credit. The Prime Minister also called for dramatically better pension provision for those on low incomes and those unable to work because they are carers or are disabled. We have delivered that; it is called the state second pension. The third thing that he called for was a better deal for middle and higher income earners through low-cost and flexible personal stakeholder pensions. We have delivered that; it is called the stakeholder system.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para53"></a>The previous Green Paper led to three pieces of legislation. I hope that the consultative document, which may lead to legislation, will not lead to quite so much.

<A NAME="20711-03_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for making the Statement. I welcome the Pickering report. It is interesting, and it floats many ideas that need serious consideration. I declare my interest. For many years, I was a member of the Occupational Pensions Board, the precursor to the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority. I am a current member of the council of OPAS, the Pensions Advisory Service.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para54"></a>The report, I am glad to say, refers to member-nominated trustees. Trustees play an important role in representing members' interests in schemes. It is important that trustees should have proper training and support to carry out those functions. I was also  interested by&#151;and I support&#151;the report's recommendation that it should be possible for firms to make it a condition of employment that people belong to the occupational scheme. On previous occasions on which we discussed pensions, I put down amendments to that effect but never managed to get them carried. It is an important matter. A situation in which employees are bound by contract to contribute to a scheme gives us further reason for having a good regulatory mechanism to ensure that the schemes in which they invest their earnings and in which the employer also invests should be safe.
<P>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 833</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para55"></a>One of the problems is that recent scandals have caused the public to lose faith, to some extent, in pension provision. That is a great pity. Occupational pensions are one of the great successes of the past century. Because of occupational pension provision, many pensioners now retire on higher incomes than they would have had had pension provision not existed.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para56"></a>I disagree with Alan Pickering on the issue of indexation. In my experience, schemes index, if at all, to a maximum of five per cent per annum anyway. It is a fairly moderate system of indexation, which does not take account of the possibility of a higher rate of inflation. If people are to have faith in their pension provision, they need to have faith in the fact that it will keep pace with rising costs in the future.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para57"></a>Another interesting recommendation made by Pickering is that there should be multi-employer schemes. It is worth considering the case for small employers to group together, perhaps on a geographical basis, to provide schemes for employees in their areas. It is important that we have an opportunity for full discussion of those issues.
<P>

<a name="20711-03_para58"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, raised two very important issues; namely, provision for women and interaction with the state scheme. I welcome the Minister's assurance that there will be a Green Paper and an opportunity for full consultation and further discussion.

<A NAME="20711-04_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend dissented on two propositions&#151;that affecting survivors' benefits and that eradicating RPI from occupational pensions. I remind my noble friend that, under Pickering, those would be optional proposals that could be part of an employer's scheme. It is Pickering's belief that what encourages employers to leave DB schemes and transfer to DC schemes is the fact that the better the scheme, the more regulated and onerous it may appear. Therefore, if one strips it down to a bare bones scheme and makes it cheaper, there will be a greater willingness by employers to both support and access it. The problem is that that concept is counterfactual; one does not know whether or not it is true. That is precisely why we need the consultation for which my noble friend has called.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Clark of Kempston: </B>   My Lords, in view of the fact that the amount of pension paid depends on the size of the pension fund, will the Minister say whether the recent tax changes relating to dividends to pension funds have assisted or damaged the funds?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-04_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I thought I had answered that question fairly fully when I responded to the noble Lord, Lord Higgins. The noble Lord may disagree with my answer, but I certainly addressed the issue. I said that the reason for abolishing ACT was that, as it stood, it deformed the pattern of investment in companies through tax privileges, compared with the United States; and your Lordships can see evidence of that.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20711-04_para0"></a>My second point&#151;pressure of time did not permit me to make it initially&#151;is that the Myners report, as the noble Lord will know, said that what mattered was not the tax protection of ACT, but the asset allocation decision by good fund managers, which he reckoned was 10 times more important.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Lipsey: </B>   My Lords, as Director of the Personal Investment Authority, I spent more years than I care to remember mired in the muck trying to sort out the pension mis-selling scandal. I therefore welcome the fact that, particularly for occupational pensions, some simplification is at last being advocated in this report.
<P>

<a name="20711-04_para1"></a>Will the Minister agree that so long as pension providers are allowed to sell on the back of a lie, the lie being that in real terms investments can grow at six or eight per cent per annum, whereas four or even two per cent would be nearer the realistic mark, we shall have intermittent crises and problems in the field of pensions and will tempt people to under-provide for their pensions?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-04_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend is absolutely right that we should all take more seriously, as I am sure we will, the health warning that investments can go down as well as up. All the evidence that I have looked at from 1955&#151;the same is true of all European OECD countries&#151;is that over time, provided dividends and such like have been reinvested, equities have performed much better than either cash or government bonds. However, there is some volatility, but if one starts a pension fund at a sufficiently young age, as one should, that volatility should even itself out over 40 years.
<P>

<a name="20711-04_para2"></a>My noble friend is right. No one can expect to revert to the years of six or eight per cent real return. We need to have much more realistic expectations, not only about what the Stock Market will return but, given longevity, about how much we need to save for the time we hope to spend in retirement. It is no longer the case that two people can expect to spend 30 to 40 years in retirement on the basis of one person working for 35 years.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-04_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Davies of Coity: </B>   My Lords, I welcome this report on pensions, as I would any report that tends to provide some answers to the increasing problems in the field of pensions.
<P>

<a name="20711-04_para3"></a>One of the issues of great importance concerns people who have an opportunity to join occupational pensions but do not do so. It is estimated that 16 per cent do not, which means that 84 per cent, the vast majority, do. However, recognising that 84 per cent represents millions of people, 16 per cent represents hundreds of thousands of people. If one considers the beneficiaries of an occupational pension, such as husbands, wives and children, one runs into a large number of people.
<P>

<a name="20711-04_para4"></a>When I was a trade union officer, I received all kinds of answers from people who were informed that the joining of a pension scheme was a condition of their employment. Unlike the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, they gave answers, such as, "I shall not live that long" <P>


<a name="column_835"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 835</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>or "I want my money now, I do not want it in the future"&#151;very short-term approaches, which they could not exercise because it was a condition of their employment. I do not envisage any difficulty in reintroducing that kind of provision. I hope the Government will embrace the recommendation that an employer should be able to insist on an occupational pension scheme as a condition of employment. In that way, the fund will grow.
<P>

<a name="20711-04_para5"></a>The Minister referred to pension holidays. Pension holidays have taken place. However, as I recall&#151;I was involved in pensions in my own trade union&#151;in those days many employers were driven to introduce pension holidays after securing major improvements to their funds because otherwise there was a threat of  taxation, which the previous administration introduced.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-04_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My noble friend has expressed views on the choice of employers to insist that an employee should join their company schemes. I recognise and respect that view, which is shared by many of our colleagues. That is exactly the kind of issue on which we shall need to seek consensus when we publish the consultation document.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-04_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hayhoe: </B>   My Lords, it is difficult to consider pensions in the round without referring to the very extensive pensions in the public service&#151;the Civil Service, the Armed Forces, the health service, teachers, local government, the police and other groups, which make up a very significant proportion of our country's employed people.
<P>

<a name="20711-04_para6"></a>Public service pension schemes have tended mainly to be index-linked and to have had survivor benefits. I imagine that at least some of those who are looking forward to receiving public service pensions may be worried by press reports of this report, indicating that there are now questions marks over whether index-linking and survivor benefits will be continued. In those circumstances, will the Minister give some indication of the Government's view of the size of that matter? Such pension schemes, of which there is a wide variety in the public service, are often not funded. It is therefore necessary to take them fully into account, as I hope the proposed Green Paper will.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-04_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I should like to respond by making one or two brief points. First, this is an independent report to the Government; it is not the Government's report. A whole range of proposals have been put forward&#151;some 52 in all. We agree with some of them because they are self-evidently virtuous while others are more provocative and we shall want to seek consent for them. The noble Lord, Lord Hayhoe, will understand therefore that we are not in a position to endorse every proposal.
<P>

<a name="20711-04_para7"></a>Secondly, as the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, pointed out, we have to look at this in the context of the sound recommendations of Myners and the forthcoming autumn review. We need to contextualise this matter.
<P>


<a name="column_836"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 836</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20711-04_para8"></a>I turn now to the points raised with regard to public service pensions. I should like to say first that no existing pensioner could be affected by anything in Pickering. The report proposes an option for employers to make available to their employees. Thus it would be for the trustees, employers and employees of public sector firms to decide whether that is the way they wish to go and to trade, if you like, value asset in terms of the benefits of the scheme with cost of access and entry. Thus different schemes may reach different decisions. For example, I understand that the terms and conditions of the Civil Service scheme may be very different from those pertaining in my former university scheme. That is a decision made by the participants.
<P>

<a name="20711-04_para9"></a>However, given the suggestions made in the Pickering report, it is not expected that the Government would require firms to strip advantages such as index linking and survivors' benefits out of their schemes against their current will. That has not been suggested in the report and nothing said today by my right honourable friend would suggest that either.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-04_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may invite the Minister briefly to decontextualise for a moment and to respond to one question. Rightly she has deplored the dangerous trend whereby companies have been cutting the employers' contribution at the same time as they are moving away from defined benefit contribution schemes. What, if anything, will the Government do about this?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-04_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I cannot answer the question because it falls into the same extremely difficult category as that of making pensions compulsory. If one followed the noble Lord's thinking, one would need, first, to make all pensions compulsory on employers and, secondly, to force all employees to join such compulsory schemes. Thirdly, the schemes would require a minimum contribution from employees and, fourthly, they would require a substantial minimum contribution from employers. Finally, agreement would have to be reached on difficult issues such as index-linking, survivors' benefits and so forth.
<P>

<a name="20711-04_para10"></a>If the noble Lord is seeking to press me on what we are going to do about all five issues, then I cannot tell him. Those are not government decisions. What must be done is to build a consensus with regard to what people are willing to trade for what. Are they willing to pay for higher benefits? Are they willing to work longer for higher benefits? Are they willing to seek a second income in the household to buy those benefits? Finally, what securities and compulsions would they wish to see underpinning such schemes? As result, now is not the right time for me to ad lib in regard to some of the most difficult questions on which no government have been able effectively to reach a consensus over the past quarter of a century.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Paul: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend on the Front Bench for repeating the Statement. The <P>


<a name="column_837"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 837</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>question of pensions is turning into a nightmare. I should declare an interest as chairman of Caparo Group Ltd, which recently has generated a certain amount of news in the press.
<P>

<a name="20711-05_para0"></a>I welcome the Pickering report, although I have not yet had a chance to look at it in detail. It is time to clarify matters so that everyone understands the outcomes of their pension schemes rather than having different results. Indeed, it is now becoming more difficult to run a company's pension scheme than it is to run the business itself. I ask the Government to look at what they can do to simplify the system as soon as possible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-05_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, clarity and simplicity were precisely the terms of reference governing the Pickering report. My right honourable friend has already made it clear that the Government are extremely supportive of all moves towards greater simplicity.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Prior: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Baroness aware that the Government's arguments in favour of taxation of dividends on pension funds are now running a little thin? They must have been thought up by a wizard in the Treasury who knew very little about how management works. Is there any hard evidence to suggest that investment, in particular in manufacturing industry, has increased as a result of the Government's actions?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-05_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I cannot talk specifically about the manufacturing sector because the noble Lord will know as well as I do that different sectors grow or do not grow at different rates, thus influencing issues surrounding the European currency and so forth. Thus I am not able to give him any detailed information with regard to the manufacturing industry.
<P>

<a name="20711-05_para1"></a>However, I can tell him that I have received assurances that, as a result of the changes that we have introduced, investment in industry has increased. Perhaps I may repeat what I said earlier. Obviously pensioners would like extra money through tax privileges. However, from our point of view it is equally important that the bedrock of pensions, reflected by the health of the companies that fund them, is protected. That is best secured by ensuring that companies continue to reinvest.
<P>

<a name="20711-05_para2"></a>I should like to make a further point. The tone of noble Lords opposite would suggest that there is no government support for private sector pensions. At present I believe that we are spending something in the order of £45 billion on the range of state sector pensions; we are supplying £11 billion in NICs contracted-out rebates that help to fund occupational pensions. In addition, a sum in the order of £14 billion of taxpayers' money goes into tax reliefs, rebates and the like, sustaining and supporting the occupational pension industry.
<P>


<a name="column_838"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 838</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20711-05_para3"></a>I do not think that the noble Lord, Lord Prior, should regard the occupational pension industry as under-supported by the current fiscal regime, particularly given that in this country we now have one of the lowest corporation tax levels on record.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-05_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Christopher: </B>   My Lords, before going on to make one or two remarks, perhaps I may ask my noble friend on the Front Bench to reconsider the response she made just now in relation to public service pensions. If I recall correctly, she said that there was nothing in the Pickering report that could affect current members of company pension schemes. I hope that my noble friend Lord Paul is not listening to this, but it seems that this report may give a number of employers many ideas. We may well see some acceleration of changes in those pension schemes currently in payment.
<P>

<a name="20711-05_para4"></a>I turn now to the brief points that I wish to put to my noble friend. First, the Statement refers to striking a balance between "innovation, competition and simplicity". As every Chancellor of the Exchequer proves with every Budget, innovation and competition add to greater complexity. We must ensure that, so far as we are able, we move forward with simple and worthwhile schemes.
<P>

<a name="20711-05_para5"></a>Perhaps I may presume to offer a little advice. I should imagine that all noble Lords who have spoken in our debate are concerned about the problems with regard to survivors' benefits and indexing. Were I to give any advice at all, it would be to say quickly that the Government should not be minded to accept those recommendations. The Government will receive a far more positive response in that regard, certainly from the trades unions and the TUC, if they know that those recommendations have been put out of the way.
<P>

<a name="20711-05_para6"></a>Lastly, it is my opinion that pension provision will be one of the big issues of the next general election. There is a pensions crisis. Unusually, it is not related solely to the vast bulk of working people. I should declare an interest here, but those looking forward to an "equitable life" are finding that it will be less so. There is a real problem here. Certainly we are going to see long-term problems with regard to the concept of the stakeholder pension. To that end, would my noble friend on the Front Bench consider approaching the Trades Union Congress? Good examples can be cited from the past, in particular in Israel with Histradut; that is, to have a scheme that is effectively endorsed and run by the trade union movement as a whole, with a view to providing the kind of pension systems which are badly needed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-05_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I look forward to reading my noble friend's contribution to the consultative document. No doubt the trade union movement will be active in promoting its views through that medium.
<P>

<a name="20711-05_para7"></a>My noble friend knows well that I shall not give any undertakings with regard to the Government's response to one or two of the proposals. However, I listened with care to his points with regard to pension schemes and pensioners. I said earlier that the <P>


<a name="column_839"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 839</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Pickering report made it clear that it was not referring to existing pensioners. However, that is not to say that Pickering does not believe that Section 67 of the Pensions Act 1995 may need to be amended to allow for alterations to schemes for the benefit of schemes as a whole. That is one of the proposals being put to us. We will consider it and see whether the problem is the size that Pickering believes it to be.
<P>

<a name="20711-05_para8"></a>My noble friend Lord Christopher said there was a pensions crisis. There is a problem of longevity. Every decade people live two years longer. There is the medium-term problem of the stock market. I suspect that if it were trading at 6,000 to 6,500 there would not be some of today's concerns. There is a more immediate problem of lack of confidence in the pension industry built up through years of mis-selling, together with what happened at Equitable Life and the like. We are hoping that that combination of simplification and regulation will allow us, with Myners, in co-operation with the industry to develop a range of products that people will see as safe and secure vehicles for protection against poverty in their old age. The state is a partner; employers are a partner; and the industry is a partner.
<P>

<a name="20711-05_para9"></a>I hope that many of your Lordships who have spoken in this interesting debate will contribute to the consultative process. I do not doubt that we shall return to the issues.

"( ) For the purposes of this Part, a body corporate may have a criminal lifestyle."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20711-05_para19"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving the amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 4 and 6. The amendments raise a short issue that should have been raised at an earlier stage. I regret that the question did not occur to me until Report stage, when I realised that there was a problem with the definition of what constitutes a criminal lifestyle.
<P>

<a name="20711-05_para20"></a>The question is: can a company have a criminal lifestyle? I raised this matter briefly in debate, but the Attorney-General gave an off-the-cuff response and did not have time to give a considered response. I have therefore tabled the amendments to ensure we receive a proper expression of the Government's views.
<P>

<a name="20711-05_para21"></a>The idea of a corporation having a lifestyle is odd. "Lifestyle" is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a way or style of living".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20711-05_para22"></a>A corporation is a person in law, but it cannot be said in any real sense to live. Only a living person can have a lifestyle. In deciding for the purposes of Clause 76 whether a defendant has a criminal lifestyle, "defendant" must mean a living defendant. A company cannot have a lifestyle. If that is so, there is a big hole in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20711-05_para23"></a>Many offences under Schedule 2&#151;quite apart from many that are not included but could be made the basis of a criminal lifestyle&#151;can be committed by a body corporate. In such cases, the body corporate is usually the person who makes a profit and against whom a confiscation order needs to be made if it is to be effective.
<P>

<a name="20711-05_para24"></a>It is clear that the Government intend the Bill to cover corporations that commit crimes and not just individuals. But it is far from clear that the Bill has that effect. On Report, the Attorney-General relied on the principle that the word "person" in a statute includes a body corporate under the Interpretation Act 1978. But that is subject to a context showing a contrary intention. The reference to "lifestyle" could be read by a court as showing such a contrary intention, particularly in view of the principle that a statute that imposes penalties must be read strictly in favour of the person against whom the penalties are claimed.
<P>

<a name="20711-05_para25"></a>The definition of criminal lifestyle does not use the word "person". It refers to the defendant who has a criminal lifestyle, not the person who has a criminal lifestyle. Therefore, in interpreting Clause 76 a court would have to proceed without relying on the definition of "person" in the Interpretation Act.

<a name="20711-05_para26"></a>I am aware that this is a technical and legalistic argument. But unless the Government accept the amendments, a prosecution will face this argument sooner or later and could lose it. We have always made it clear that we wish to strengthen the Bill where it needs strengthening. We believe that in this case it needs clarification to strengthen it. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, we have considered carefully the issues put persuasively by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, but we believe there is nothing in the point. As the noble Lord knows, for the purposes of the Bill, "criminal lifestyle" is defined not in the Oxford English Dictionary but in the Bill itself, in particular in Clauses 76 and 226, which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A defendant has a criminal lifestyle if (and only if) the following condition is satisfied",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20711-06_para0"></a>which is that it is an offence of a particular type, or a number of offences committed over a period of time. There is no difficulty in understanding that, and there would be no difficulty in a court interpreting the definition in that way.
<P>

<a name="20711-06_para1"></a>The noble Lord rightly refers to Clause 6, which states that the court must decide whether the defendant has a criminal lifestyle. However, Clause 89(3) defines a defendant as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a person against whom proceedings for an offence have been started".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20711-06_para2"></a>Schedule 1 to the Interpretation Act 1978 states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"'Person' includes a body of persons corporate or unincorporate".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20711-06_para3"></a>It follows, there being nothing in the context that suggests to the contrary, that references to the defendant in Clause 6 and elsewhere in the Bill already include bodies corporate.
<P>

<a name="20711-06_para4"></a>I believe that the noble Lord and the Government are seeking the same end. We believe that the amendments would serve no useful purpose. Indeed, they would be damaging, because they would cast doubt on every instance in other legislation where a person is referred to. If we state explicitly that a person includes a corporation in the Bill, we will invite other statutes that use the term to be construed as referring only to a natural person.
<P>

<a name="20711-06_para5"></a>I am afraid that for those reasons, while we share the aim, we are unable to support the amendments. I hope that having heard my explanation, the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw Amendment No. 2.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, I do not believe for one moment that the amendment would cast any doubt on the general interpretation of the word "person". What is unusual here&#151;and the reason the amendments were tabled&#151;is the specific use of the word "lifestyle". That is where the difficulty arises.
<P>

<a name="20711-06_para6"></a>However, I welcome the fact that the Government have made it clear that in their view there is no ambiguity. That statement may be relied on if, in a future case, it is argued before a court that there is an ambiguity. To that extent my purpose in bringing forward the amendments has been satisfied. In those <P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20711-06_para19"></a><P>

<a name="20711-06_para20"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, the substantive amendment is Amendment No. 8, the next amendment on the Marshalled List.
<P>

<a name="20711-06_para21"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to improve the Bill in two respects. First, it seeks to remove the risk of a serious injustice. It enables a man who has been accused of crime to defend himself in the normal way before a judge and jury. Secondly, it seeks to make Part 5 of the Bill less vulnerable to attack under the Human Rights Act. It is a waste of everyone's time to enact legislation which one can see will fall at the very first hurdle. It is surely wrong to wash one's hands of all responsibility for that result, as the Liberal Democrats, if I may respectfully say so, seemed inclined to do at Report stage by saying that it was better to leave the Government to stew in their own juice. That is not my phrase but that of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. Surely we can do better than that and seek to remove now the most obvious objections which will be raised under the Human Rights Act.
<P>

<a name="20711-06_para22"></a>In returning to the first point, I shall not of course repeat the argument that I put forward on Report. That would be tedious and unnecessary. In a few moments I shall deal with the arguments put forward by the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General by way of reply, but, first, it may be helpful to stand back a little from the Bill and take an overall view of what Part 5 seeks to achieve.
<P>


<a name="column_843"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 843</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20711-06_para23"></a>The Bill itself deals with the proceeds of crime&#151;and I emphasise that word at the outset. It is true that Part 5 refers to "unlawful conduct"&#151;a somewhat woolly expression&#151;but, fortunately, unlawful conduct is defined in Clause 244 as conduct which would be unlawful under our criminal law. So we can safely forget about unlawful conduct and talk simply about crime.
<P>

<a name="20711-06_para24"></a>Under Clause 246, proceedings can be brought against anyone who holds what is called "recoverable property". Recoverable property means property obtained by a person through crime, whether his own crime or someone else's crime. That is the combined effect of Clauses 245 and 308. So unless a crime has been committed, and unless that crime has been proved, the judge simply has no power to make a recovery order. So far, all is clear and must be common ground.
<P>

<a name="20711-06_para25"></a>Next, it may be helpful to follow the likely course of these so-called civil proceedings. I shall assume that they are being brought against the kind of person that the Government seem to have most in mind&#151;that is, the major criminals who are at the centre of a criminal network but who are said to be untouchable by the criminal law. We are told that there are 400 such people known to the police. That number was often referred to in earlier stages of the Bill, both in this House and in the other place.
<P>

<a name="20711-06_para26"></a>Let us assume that these proceedings are being brought against such a person and a claim form is duly served. What happens next? The first thing the defendant will do is to ask this simple question: "Through whose crime do you say these proceeds were obtained&#151;my crime or someone else's crime&#151;and what is the nature of the crime which you allege?" Unless the defendant gets an answer to those questions the civil proceedings will simply be struck out. The defendant is entitled to a fair trial in civil proceedings, just as he is entitled to a fair trial in criminal proceedings. No High Court judge of whom I have knowledge would allow civil proceedings to continue unless the crimes alleged are particularised. Again, that must be common ground.
<P>

<a name="20711-06_para27"></a>Let us suppose that the allegation is that the proceeds were obtained through the defendant's own unlawful conduct&#151;for example, by his dealing in drugs. Let us suppose next that the defendant denies the allegation, as he surely would. He might say, "You have got the wrong man". I have no idea what his defence may be, but, surely, if he denies that serious offence, he must as a matter of elementary justice be entitled to have that question decided on a criminal standard of proof by a judge and jury.
<P>

<a name="20711-06_para28"></a>The noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General said that that would be a most unfortunate state of affairs. It would mean that a lot of criminals would escape. "We know who they are", he said. "It is plain from our intelligence". I am paraphrasing from the speech that the noble and learned Lord made on 25th June, col. 1270 of Hansard: "It is plain from their lifestyle, their luxury homes, their yachts and fast motor cars, which do not appear to have been acquired <P>


<a name="column_844"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 844</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>by any lawful activity on their part". He continued at col. 1271, "It is true that there is not enough evidence to convict them of specific crimes, but it is as plain as a pikestaff that their money has been acquired as the proceeds of crime".
<P>

<a name="20711-06_para29"></a>I find that a most remarkable statement to have fallen from the lips of the noble and learned Lord. Those 400 people may indeed be the subject of grave suspicion on the part of the police, but happily we do not live in a police state. We shall not know those people to be criminals until they have been charged and convicted of a crime. Anyone familiar with the criminal courts will be able to tell noble Lords from their own experience about cases that seem as plain as a pikestaff to the police but that fell apart when they came to court. Then there are those unhappy cases that should have fallen apart but did not and instead have resulted in grave miscarriages of justice.
<P>

<a name="20711-06_para30"></a>That is why we rightly insist on the higher standard of proof where the liberty of the subject is concerned&#151;proof beyond reasonable doubt. Once we allow the civil burden of proof to intrude we shall conduct a grave disservice to the cause of justice.
<P>

<a name="20711-06_para31"></a>The noble and learned Lord then says that none of that really matters because the proceedings are not aimed at an individual but aimed at his property. That is col. 1271. He is not being accused of anything; the proceedings will not result in a conviction; and in any event he cannot be sent to gaol. But I protest. He is being accused of something. He is being accused of drug dealing. Unless it is found "as a fact"&#151;not my phrase but that of the noble and learned Lord&#151;by the judge that he is guilty of drug dealing, the judge has no power to make a recovery order. The noble and learned Lord says that there is a distinction between being found guilty by the judge and being convicted. I venture to suggest that that is a distinction that would not be readily apparent to the defendant. It is certainly a distinction that is lost on me and appears to be lost to the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary.
<P>

<a name="20711-06_para32"></a>Lastly, it is said that this amendment, if accepted, would be unfair. The noble and learned Lord said that the "little man" would be subjected to the full force of Part 5, but that the big wheel, suspected of far worse crimes&#151;crimes that cannot be proved&#151;would go scot-free. If the crimes cannot be proved, is there anything so surprising about the defendant going scot-free?
<P>

<a name="20711-06_para33"></a>I shall summarise the first point&#151;the second point is much shorter. A person who is accused of very serious crimes as part of the so-called civil proceedings is surely entitled to have the matter of his guilt decided by a judge and jury on the criminal standard. If he is acquitted, that should surely be the end of it. That is the purpose of the first five paragraphs of my amendment.
<P>

<a name="20711-06_para34"></a>The second point is quite brief and is a Human Rights Act point. No doubt, when the legislation is in force it will be attacked under the Human Rights Act on numerous grounds. One ground stands out a mile. In a case where the alleged offender is before the court and is found guilty by the judge of a crime committed, <P>


<a name="column_845"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 845</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>let us say, 12 years ago, Part 5 allows the state to recover the proceeds of that crime from that day to this in a way that was not possible when the crime was committed. That is retrospective legislation of the most obnoxious kind and it is directly prohibited by Article 7 of the Human Rights Act. Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time that the criminal offence was committed.
<P>

<a name="20711-06_para35"></a>It is said by the noble and learned Lord that a recovery order is not a penalty imposed for an offence, but that it is compensation claimed by the state for loss suffered by the state as a consequence of that offence. That is the plainest nonsense. The state has suffered no loss as a consequence of the offence and is not entitled to compensation. It is the victim, if anyone, who has suffered a loss and not the state.
<P>

<a name="20711-06_para36"></a>That horse will not run. As it happens the horse ran in the case of Welch v. United Kingdom. It ran and it fell. That was the very point that was decided against the United Kingdom in Welch. It is true, as the noble and learned Lord will point out, that that was after a conviction. I hope that by now I have persuaded your Lordships that there is no distinction to be drawn between a conviction and a finding of guilt. That is certainly not a distinction that would find any favour at Strasbourg.
<P>

<a name="20711-06_para37"></a>The purpose of the last paragraph of the amendment is simply to confine the retrospective effect of Part 5 to those cases where it has at least a chance of being upheld; that is to say, where the offender has not been before the court because he is overseas or because he is dead or in some other way unavailable. By confining the retrospective effect of Part 5, I suggest that this House will make a significant improvement to the Bill. In that spirit, I put forward this amendment as a compromise. It falls far short of what I would have wanted, but I put it forward as a form of compromise which I hope may still be accepted, although I have no strong expectation. I beg to move.

<A NAME="20711-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, I earnestly hope that the Government and your Lordships will support the amendment moved by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick. We have to remember that he has moved it in the light of his great experience as a Law Lord. I shall be brief. There is not much need to repeat the arguments that the noble and learned Lord has used, but I want to emphasise one point. The trouble is that Clause 246 ignores the difference in the burden of proof in several criminal cases.
<P>

<a name="20711-07_para0"></a>I remind your Lordships that in civil actions the burden of proof is based on the balance of probabilities, but in criminal cases there is a stronger burden of proof&#151;a burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt. Although Clause 246 deals with civil cases and criminal cases, that difference is ignored. Amendment No. 7 would put the matter right.

<A NAME="20711-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   My Lords, on Report my noble friend Lord Goodhart indicated that the Government should stew in their own juice, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, pointed out. But he also gave strong support to these amendments. From these Benches, I do not propose to repeat the arguments so eloquently made by the noble and learned Lord, but the Government's response on Report was a familiar one: we all know what is going on. We know that such people are guilty; we have intelligence to that effect. It is the same kind of sentiment as was expressed recently by the Chief Constable in North Wales. He remarked that it was tragic that 63 per cent of people who appeared on trial before the Crown Court in North Wales were acquitted. We were not sure whether he was blaming the juries, the defence lawyers or his own force for failing to bring forward adequate evidence.
<P>

<a name="20711-07_para1"></a>That is the point. Adequate and proper evidence needs to be brought forward before these draconian remedies are brought into effect. Ordinary standards of the criminal law ought not to be set aside. Suspicion of crime is not enough. We on these Benches will again strongly support the amendment.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-07_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Bledisloe: </B>   The noble and learned Lord has made an extremely eloquent case. First, perhaps I may ask him a technical question. The "unlawful conduct" can, we see, be conduct committed outside the United Kingdom. How is an English criminal court to try an offence which was committed outside its jurisdiction&#151;in a foreign jurisdiction&#151;which it has no jurisdiction to try as a criminal offence? That is my technical question.
<P>

<a name="20711-07_para2"></a>Perhaps I may now become bolder and suggest a possible fallacy in the noble and learned Lord's argument. He said that unlawful conduct is defined as the commission of a crime. He then used the word "crime" instead of "unlawful conduct". But surely there is a difference between being certain that a person has accumulated his wealth by criminal activity and being able to prove a specific crime by which he acquired it. You may not be able to prove that he smuggled in X quantity of drugs on a certain day and sold them on the street the next day. But you may be able to prove&#151;and perhaps you ought to have to prove beyond reasonable doubt&#151;that he could not possibly have accumulated the enormous wealth that he has without ever going to work, without ever going to a casino, and without ever going to the horse races&#151;and how on earth did he get his wealth, especially if he absolutely declines to prove it and if you can prove that in the past two years he has flown 14 times to and from Colombia and cannot explain what those journeys were for?
<P>

<a name="20711-07_para3"></a>Surely there will be many cases in which it could be proved, even beyond reasonable doubt, that a person's wealth had been accumulated by unlawful conduct, <P>


<a name="column_847"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 847</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>but you could not prove any specific time with the full particulars necessary to enable you to obtain a conviction.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Lloyd of Berwick: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, as the noble and learned Lord has the right of reply and as we are at Third Reading, it may be better if he answers the question at that time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-07_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   My Lords, the intellectual quality and persuasiveness of the speech by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, ought by now to have convinced the Government to accept his amendment.
<P>

<a name="20711-07_para4"></a>The Government's objective under Part 5 of the Bill is in principle a laudable one. It is to deprive drug traffickers and other criminals of their ill-gotten gains. The trouble is that, in doing so, they have succeeded in expropriating the right of the British citizen to trial by jury.
<P>

<a name="20711-07_para5"></a>Our initial instinct on these Benches was to adopt the approach taken by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart; that is to say that we disapproved of the approach taken by Part 5 but thought that it ought to be left to the courts to settle the matter. Our view changed, in the course of the Bill proceedings, for three reasons. First, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, as he rightly said, convinced us that this was a negative approach. We want, if possible, to make Part 5 work. That is precisely what the noble and learned Lord has done.
<P>

<a name="20711-07_para6"></a>The second thing he did was to persuade us that, if someone is entitled to a right to trial by jury in circumstances where the evidence is strong enough to convict that person, he or she ought to be entitled to that same right in circumstances where the evidence is not strong enough to convict them. The right to trial by jury is a fundamental building block of our constitutional freedom. It is wholly undermined by Part 5 of the Bill. There is no real distinction between a confiscation order under Part 2 and a recovery order under Part 5; yet Part 2 provides the guarantee of trial by jury and Part 5 does not.
<P>

<a name="20711-07_para7"></a>There is a final reason why I am convinced that your Lordships should accept the amendment. It is one that I gleaned, in the course of the past few days, from the Committee stage of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill. In Clause 4 of that Bill, the Government seek to deprive individuals, born in the United Kingdom, of their citizenship if their conduct seriously prejudices the vital interests of the United Kingdom. The Home Secretary determines the existence of that situation on his own subjective judgment.
<P>

<a name="20711-07_para8"></a>I regard that as a step further down the undesirable road sign-posted by Part 5 of this Bill. I applaud the objectives of the Government under Part 5, just as I applaud the objectives of the Government under the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill. But the Government are seeking to achieve the results that they want by wholly undermining the criminal law of this country built up over many centuries. Surely the <P>


<a name="column_848"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 848</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>right way to get the result under Part 5, as indeed under Clause 4, is to define the offences more clearly and more precisely in criminal law so that the proper criminal procedures in the criminal courts can be used.
<P>

<a name="20711-07_para9"></a>The noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General&#151;who is looking at me with a bewildered expression&#151;himself referred to 400 criminals in the country who could not be prosecuted by the prosecuting authorities. Surely in those circumstances it is up to the Government to define the offences more precisely, so that these criminals can be dealt with through the criminal courts.
<P>

<a name="20711-07_para10"></a>For all those reasons, I support the amendment moved by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, and trust that the Government will accept it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-07_spmin0"></A><B>The Attorney-General  (Lord Goldsmith): </B>  My Lords, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, has throughout made plain his opposition to the new civil recovery scheme in Part 5 of the Bill. He is entirely consistent in continuing to oppose it. That is not something that can be said of the approach of the Front Bench opposite and&#151;I think, although I am not entirely clear&#151;from the Liberal Democrat Benches.
<P>

<a name="20711-07_para11"></a>I remind the House, and indeed the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, of what was said at Second Reading, when the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, made it very clear that this:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"will signal a will and a wish to assist the Government in producing a workable and effective piece of legislation".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20711-07_para12"></a>
She said specifically in relation to Part 5:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>" . . . we do not want to obstruct the key objectives of the Bill, that is a real concern. We want to see those who have committed criminal offences deprived of their ill-gotten gains. [Official Report, 25/3/02; cols. 19-23.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20711-07_para13"></a>I shall not mince my words. The amendment proposed by the noble and learned Lord, which we debated fully on Report although we did not divide, will not improve the Bill. It will not be workable in the way that he proposes. I give way to the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-07_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the Minister, not only for giving way but also for promoting me in the Peerage. I believe he referred to me as "the noble Earl".
<P>

<a name="20711-07_para14"></a>The noble and learned Lord may not have been listening to my opening remarks. I hope that he will accept that I said at the outset that our instinct was to leave the matter to the courts. It was as a result of the debate in your Lordships' House and the skilful ingenuity of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, that our position moved. However, our view remains as the Government said their position remained: that people should be deprived of their ill-gotten gains as a result of their criminal activities&#151;so we may prosecute them for their criminal activities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-07_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, if I attributed such peerage to the noble Lord, I am not sure whether to apologise to him or to those who have that dignity. But I do not apologise to him for saying what I have said and will continue to say on the amendment. If the <P>


<a name="column_849"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 849</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendment were passed, it would not improve the Bill. It would prevent Part 5 from being effective. With your Lordships' leave, I shall explain why.
<P>

<a name="20711-07_para15"></a>Perhaps I may deal, first, with one point. Throughout there has been reference to the European Convention on Human Rights and whether or not the process involved would be held to be a civil or criminal process. That is a technical question. I shall not weary your Lordships with the arguments about it now. The simple approach taken by the Government is this. We are not seeking compensation for the state. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, suggested that I had said that we were seeking compensation for the state. I do not recall ever saying that. What I have said repeatedly is that this is about saying to people who are holding property which they have no right to hold because it is the proceeds of drug trafficking, bank robbery or other serious crime, "You have no right to this property and therefore this property is to be taken away".
<P>

<a name="20711-07_para16"></a>By his amendment, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, accepts that in relation to all people except those who are said themselves to have committed the unlawful conduct.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-07_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Lloyd of Berwick: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble and learned Lord for giving way. Yes, but surely in the case of the bank robbery the property belongs to the bank not to the state.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020711/text/20711-08.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, as is clear from the Bill, if the bank can demonstrate that that it is its property it will be able to recover it.
<P>

<a name="20711-08_para0"></a>One of the difficulties&#151;with respect, the noble and learned Lord did not deal with this point, although the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, made it well and clearly&#151;is the fact that there are people in relation to whom it is not possible to say, "You committed this particular crime". But it may be possible to say that what they plainly possess in terms of property is the proceeds of crime. Precisely which crime&#151;a bank robbery on this day, a drug trafficking offence on that day, proof of which is required by the criminal law&#151;cannot be demonstrated.
<P>

<a name="20711-08_para1"></a>The noble and learned Lord rightly puts the High Court judge before us as an object of admiration and fairness. If a High Court judge is persuaded&#151;otherwise no order is made&#151;that property held by someone is the proceeds of unlawful conduct, the question is whether or not that property should be taken from that person who has no right to keep it.
<P>

<a name="20711-08_para2"></a>What is the burden of proof in such circumstances? I have dealt with this matter at every stage&#151;Second Reading, in Committee and on Report. No one has ever gainsaid what I said. It is this. Although the civil standard applies&#151;that of the balance of probabilities&#151;the decisions of the courts make very clear indeed that where the issue is serious misconduct, although that is still determined on the balance of <P>


<a name="column_850"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 850</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>probabilities, because of the inherent unlikelihood that serious criminal conduct has been committed the courts require more cogent proof.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, is the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General contending seriously that under the Bill as it now stands it would be possible for a court, without any evidence that any particular unlawful conduct has occurred, to come to the conclusion that the assets of the respondent must have been acquired by some unspecified unlawful conduct? That is not how I read the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, a High Court judge will have the duty to consider whether or not a particular property which is identified is the product of some unlawful conduct. What evidence the court will be persuaded by will be a matter for the court. I do not disagree with the example given by the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, of someone who plainly has very substantial means, has never done a day's work in his life and cannot explain&#151;that is a part of it&#151;where any of it came from when questions are put. It is the easiest thing for someone to say, "You say that these are the proceeds of crime. I can tell you that I acquired this in this or that way". But he puts forward no credible explanation for that; and there is other evidence which suggests that he has been mixing in criminal circles: he has been taking aeroplane flights to Colombia, or whatever it may be. The judge will have to decide.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry to intervene again. Under Clause 244, the matter the court has to decide on the balance of probabilities is whether it is proved that any matters alleged to constitute unlawful conduct have occurred. That makes clear that a matter which constitutes unlawful conduct must have occurred.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-08_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, there will be certain cases where no doubt specific unlawful conduct is identified. The point I make is that there will be cases where, for example, it will be apparent that the property someone is holding may be the proceeds of a bank robbery or of drug trafficking. One cannot tell which it is but one can be satisfied&#151;not the police; it is not a police state; not me; not the director&#151;but the court is satisfied that those are the proceeds of unlawful conduct. In those circumstances, the court will be able to make the order.
<P>

<a name="20711-08_para3"></a>I remind noble Lords of what I said about the standard of proof. It is important for two reasons. Because it is so important, I hope that noble Lords will bear with me while I read again these words that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"When assessing the probabilities the court will have in mind as a factor, to whatever extent is appropriate in the particular case, that the more serious the allegation, the less likely it is that the event occurred and, hence, the stronger should be the evidence before the court concludes that the allegation is established on the balance of probability. Fraud is usually less likely than negligence. Deliberate physical injury is usually less likely than accidental physical injury . . . built into the preponderance of probability standard is a generous degree of flexibility in respect of the seriousness of the allegation".

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 851</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The court would have to be satisfied&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-08_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for giving way. Would he bear in mind that Clause 244(1) refers to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"conduct occurring in any part of the United Kingdom is unlawful conduct if it is unlawful under the criminal law of that part"?
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20711-08_para5"></a>As criminal law is brought into operation there, surely the principle of the burden of proof, which, as was said by the noble and learned Lord, has for centuries been beyond reasonable doubt, should apply.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-08_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, as I explained on Report&#151;it has not been contradicted by the noble and learned Lord&#151;time and again in the civil courts an allegation of a criminal act is made in the context of a civil proceeding. In those circumstances, what the court does is precisely what I have just read from the words of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead. It decides that question on the civil standard, but applying the preponderance of that probability taking account of the need for more cogent evidence.
<P>

<a name="20711-08_para6"></a>I have previously given examples. That happens in any libel actions and it happened in Re. H itself. The allegation underlying a care proceeding was that the father was guilty of raping the daughter. The whole question in the case was whether that allegation had to be determined on the criminal standard or in relation to something less. Obviously, the finding even in civil process would be very damaging to the father. Your Lordships' House in its judicial capacity held that on the balance of probabilities, but that more cogent evidence was required.
<P>

<a name="20711-08_para7"></a>As it happens, the noble and learned Lord, Lloyd of Berwick, was on the panel. I have with me what he said. On that occasion, interestingly, he had no difficulty with the proposition that a civil court might find somebody guilty of a criminal offence in the sense that it found that he had committed that criminal offence. In fact, the noble and learned Lord was in a minority in suggesting that one should not have that heightened standard. His view was that the standard of proof should merely be a simple balance of probabilities. One understands why the noble and learned Lord said that. There is a critical difference between a criminal process and a civil process. In a criminal process, someone is convicted and goes to gaol or is at risk of going to gaol. That is not the case when someone is found in a civil process to have committed some disreputable act. At Report stage I gave the example of a case, which the noble and learned Lord tried when he was a puisne judge and I was a junior member of the Bar, involving forgery, deceit and lying. There was no suggestion at any stage that, despite the importance of those allegations, they could be dealt with only before a criminal court.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-08_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that it is not the case under the Bill that mere possession of property, which is thought to <P>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 852</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have been obtained dishonestly in some way or other, is sufficient for the provisions to come into effect? Clause 244 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Conduct occurring in any part of the United Kingdom is unlawful conduct if it is unlawful under the criminal law of that part".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20711-08_para8"></a>It continues:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The court or sheriff must decide on a balance of probabilities whether it is proved . . . that any matters alleged to constitute unlawful conduct have occurred".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20711-08_para9"></a>It is not for the person to explain where his property came from; it is for those seeking to recover that property to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that unlawful conduct&#151;that is, unlawful conduct under the criminal law&#151;has actually occurred. The response of the noble and learned Lord has given an entirely different impression.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-08_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, I have been absolutely consistent throughout. Clause 308 is where one needs to start in this regard. It states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Property obtained through unlawful conduct is recoverable property".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20711-08_para10"></a>That is what the court is considering: whether the property is obtained through unlawful conduct. I stand by what I said. The court might be satisfied to that heightened standard that the property was the proceeds of unlawful conduct, but it could not be said whether it involved the proceeds of the bank robbery on 14th June 1963 or on 16th June 1980. It might even be satisfied that the person had committed both. But which are the proceeds of crime? What has the person done with the proceeds in the mean time? On the question whether one can trace that back to the Midland Bank as opposed to Barclays Bank: no, the court would not have to do that.
<P>

<a name="20711-08_para11"></a>On the European Convention, I respect the fact that the noble and learned Lord takes a different view from that of the Government. I have throughout said that we recognise that we are to some extent in uncharted territory. The Government's view&#151;the better view&#151;is that this matter will be held to be civil, not criminal. That is under the Strasbourg jurisprudence. I draw support from the fact that there are decisions from your Lordships' House, the Privy Council and Strasbourg supporting that result. The Government have said throughout that we accept that this is likely to be challenged. The sort of people who we are talking about, if we are right about them, will have pots of money, which they will not want to give up without a fight and they will challenge the decision. The Government should&#151;this line was previously and rightly taken by the Opposition&#151;be able to propose the legislation, have it tested in the courts and establish whether we are right, as we believe we are, not on a wing and a chance but because we have looked at the matter very carefully and concluded that we are right and will be held to be right. If there is something wrong with that, let us have the judgment of the court so that we can amend it in a way that makes sense and which reflects what the problem is; it should not be dealt with in some other way.
<P>


<a name="column_853"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 853</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20711-08_para12"></a>In order to emphasise what is so extraordinary about the amendment of the noble and learned Lord, I want to contrast two different people. The first is someone who is not said to be the person who has committed the unlawful conduct but who is holding the property, such as a wife or an associate. The amendment would accept that that person can be proceeded with under Part 5, with all the rigours of that part. One could go back 12 years and the case will be decided on the balance of probabilities, the standard of proof that I have identified. Part 5 will operate. If the person is said to be the culprit or is likely to be the culprit&#151;not the person who is less culpable&#151;under the amendment of the noble and learned Lord, that person cannot be proceeded against at all.
<P>

<a name="20711-08_para13"></a>I shall explain why I say, "not at all". As I have made clear throughout the Bill's passage&#151;it is very clear that this will be the position&#151;there will be a hierarchy of proceedings. If it is possible to pursue criminal proceedings, they will be pursued. A decision will be made by the prosecutors about whether to proceed without regard to the fact that there is a civil process as well. Only if the prosecutors form the view that it is not possible to proceed will the civil process come in. After that, there are the taxation provisions.
<P>

<a name="20711-08_para14"></a>What would happen under the amendment of the noble and learned Lord? The amendment says that if the person who is proceeded against is someone who is said to be guilty of unlawful conduct, that person is entitled to insist on going to the Crown Court. But for what would they go to the Crown Court? For a trial? But the prosecutor has already decided that it is inappropriate to proceed by way of trial. That cannot happen. But what if the prosecutor proceeds? What if the reason why it is not possible to proceed against the person is because he has sufficiently distanced himself from the actual criminal acts? The court may be absolutely convinced that he is holding the proceeds of a bank robbery but it may not know whether he is a bank robber, a conspirator or simply a fence&#151;someone who is holding the property. He cannot be convicted on any of those grounds because one cannot convict him when one does not know which of those applies. He is entitled to keep all of that money although a court is satisfied that he was guilty.
<P>

<a name="20711-08_para15"></a>What about the situation raised by the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe? What if the clearest possible evidence is that the person was guilty of committing a fraud outside the United Kingdom which we cannot prosecute? That is a very common problem these days because, as noble Lords well know, crime is global. If there is drug trafficking or human trafficking in a foreign country, we cannot bring the relevant person to the Kingston Crown Court or the Old Bailey. That person is entitled to say, "You cannot try me in the Crown Court, therefore I can keep all of this property". Those are considerable loopholes.
<P>

<a name="20711-08_para16"></a>The extraordinarily absurd result is that one can proceed against the wife, someone who is not really culpable, but not against someone who is culpable. That is a manifest nonsense. Why is that said to be justified? On the basis that there is a right to trial by <P>


<a name="column_854"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 854</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>jury? There is a right to trial by jury for criminal offences, but this is not a criminal conviction. One does not go to gaol, the matter does not go on one's rehabilitation of offenders record and one has an appeal to the Court of Appeal. It is a civil process like any other civil process.
<P>

<a name="20711-08_para17"></a>With respect to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, I say that it is impossible to describe this amendment as improving the Bill. If it is agreed to, it will mean that it will not be possible to proceed against a person who is holding the proceeds of crime even though a court can be satisfied of that by convincing evidence, unless one can convict that person of a specific crime.
<P>

<a name="20711-08_para18"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, considers that to be right because he does not believe that Part 5 should stand part of the Bill. As I said, I respect that. The Government happen to take a different view about it. But for the Opposition to say that the amendment would make the Bill more workable when they are driving a huge hole through it is simply false; it simply is not possible to maintain that point of view.
<P>

<a name="20711-08_para19"></a>I turn to the final point&#151;the Article 7 point&#151;of the noble and learned Lord's amendment concerning retrospectivity. We debated this matter on Report at considerable length. Again, I invite noble Lords opposite to consider the consequence of this part of the amendment. It would mean that it would not be possible to proceed against a person who was currently holding the proceeds of a crime committed in the past. Therefore, if the amendment were agreed to, the provision would operate only in relation to crimes committed in the future. We are talking about a grossly denatured remedy because the provision would apply only far off in the future and the effect of the act would be gravely reduced.
<P>

<a name="20711-08_para20"></a>The Government take the view that the provision is not contrary to Article 7 of the European convention. I explained on Report&#151;I do not want to weary your Lordships now&#151;why that is so. The noble and learned Lord referred to the case of Welch. As I said on that occasion, there are five distinguishing features. While one could argue about one or two of them, one could not do so in relation to the others. The most important of them is that in Welch there was a penalty because the individual had already been convicted of five counts of conspiracy to supply class A drugs. Welch was sentenced to 22 years in prison and, on top of that, the court said, "What's more, there will be a confiscation order". The Court in Strasbourg said, "That's a penalty". That is not the process that is taking place here.
<P>

<a name="20711-08_para21"></a>Again, I recognise that there is a difference between us concerning what the Court in Strasbourg will say&#151;if we get that far. But, having considered the matter extremely carefully, the Government's view, contrary to, and respecting fully, that of a former Law Lord, is that the Government will prevail in the courts. It is right that the Government should be allowed to proceed. I believe that many Members of your Lordships' House are of the view that it is important, as the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, said, that we <P>


<a name="column_855"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 855</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should be able to deprive criminals of the proceeds of their crime; otherwise, as the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said at Second Reading, leaving criminals with the working capital of crime would have a corrosive effect on society. If noble Lords agree that depriving criminals of the proceeds of their crime is the objective that we seek to achieve, they will reject the amendment.

<A NAME="20711-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lloyd of Berwick: </B>   My Lords, I thank noble Lords on the Conservative and Liberal Democrat Front Benches for their support. As to the noble Viscount's first question concerning offences committed abroad, it seems to me that that illustrates very well the type of difficulties which will occur over and over again when Part 5 of the Bill is put into practice. As the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General pointed out, that is one reason that I have been opposed to Part 5 from the start.
<P>

<a name="20711-09_para0"></a>As to the second question, the noble Viscount meets me half way in urging the criminal standard of proof. I am very glad of that. But I still do not savour the concept of a person being accused of criminal activity in general, even a particular kind of criminal activity in general. In that respect, I must beg leave to differ from the noble Viscount.
<P>

<a name="20711-09_para1"></a>As to the noble and learned Lord's response, I have now listened to him on three occasions. I am grateful for the trouble that he has taken each time. I have not been persuaded; indeed, if anything, and if it is not offensive to say so, I feel even less persuaded now than I was at the start. In those circumstances, I feel obliged to test the opinion of the House.

"246A PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT UNDER SECTION 246: DEFENCE OF RESPONDENT
<br>
(1) Where proceedings are brought against a person under section 246, and that person (the respondent) is the person through whose unlawful conduct the property is said to have been obtained, the following provisions of this section shall apply.
<br>
(2) If the respondent denies that he is guilty of the alleged unlawful conduct, he shall be entitled to have the question whether he is so guilty determined in a separate trial by the Crown Court, and the proceedings in the High Court shall be adjourned.
<br>
(3) If he is acquitted by the Crown Court, the proceedings in the High Court shall be dismissed.
<br>
(4) If he is convicted by the Crown Court, the Court must proceed under Part 2 of this Act, and the proceedings in the High Court shall stand adjourned until the proceedings in the Crown Court have been conducted whereupon the proceedings in the High Court shall be dismissed.

<br>
(6) If the respondent is found guilty of unlawful conduct under subsection (5), and the court is satisfied that he is in possession of recoverable property, the court shall make a recovery order in accordance with this Part of this Act, save that the recovery order shall not include property obtained by the respondent through unlawful conduct committed by him before the coming into force of this Part, and section 320(3) shall to that extent not apply."

<A NAME="20711-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith </B>   moved Amendment No. 9:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 171, line 31, after "is" insert "withdrawn or"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20711-10_para0"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, on Report the Government brought forward an amendment to make clear that the three-month period during which an application for compensation must be made does not begin until any appeal proceedings are finally concluded. The noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, argued that this did not take account of the case where an application for leave to appeal was withdrawn or where an appeal was abandoned. I said then that I would consider the matter. We have considered it and we have brought forward Amendment No. 9 to put the issue beyond any doubt that might arise in the case of a withdrawn application. We do not think that any further provision is necessary where an appeal is abandoned as the abandonment of the proceedings would mean that they would be finally concluded within the meaning of Clause 286(3).
<P>

<a name="20711-10_para1"></a>The noble Baroness also argued that we should be referring to permission to appeal rather than leave to appeal. While we agree that "permission" is the more modern expression in relation to England and Wales, it is not correct usage in relation to the rest of the United Kingdom. As Part 5 applies throughout the United Kingdom we need to retain references to "leave" so that it can work in Scotland and Northern Ireland and, as there can be no possible doubt about what "leave" means, it is unnecessary to depart from the simple solution of using a single word.
<P>

<a name="20711-10_para2"></a>Amendment No. 10 corrects a minor drafting error. It replaces the word "sum" with the word "currency" in Clause 303. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-10_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   My Lords, I wish to thank the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General for responding to our concerns expressed in Committee and on Report regarding Clause 286. I entirely accept his point with regard to use of the word "permission" versus "leave". It is rather refreshing to hear that for once the Government are refraining from the need to modernise. Thank you very much for that report.

<a name="20711-10_para6"></a>Clause 312 [General exceptions]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Goodhart </B>   moved Amendment No. 12:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 199, line 24, at end insert "or an employee of his"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20711-10_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Clause 313(3) of the Bill gives the Government a right to claw back from a plaintiff damages paid to him or her out of recoverable property which has been obtained when the damages have been paid under a judgment of the court.
<P>

<a name="20711-10_para8"></a>We believe that that is grossly unfair because it is punishing the innocent plaintiff, not the person against whom the recovery order is made. It also creates plain anomalies. If the claim, for example, is a claim for damages for negligence, the plaintiff can keep the money awarded to him or her under the judgment if the damage is caused by a negligent act which is also a criminal offence, for example, careless driving. But the plaintiff cannot keep the money if the damage is caused by a non-criminal form of negligence. If damages are paid by an insurance company, the plaintiff can keep the money because it is not paid for out of recoverable property. At least, that is the view of the Government. I am not certain that that is the case if the insurance premium was paid out of recoverable property. If, on the other hand, the damages are paid personally by an uninsured defendant, there may be a right to claw them back.
<P>

<a name="20711-10_para9"></a>There will be plain inconsistencies between situations which have nothing to do with the plaintiff. When a similar amendment to this was moved by us on Report, the Government raised what seemed to me a fair point; that is, that a payment made out of recoverable property to, for example, a former spouse in the course of matrimonial proceedings, should remain recoverable. We have therefore tabled a revised amendment which prevents a claw back only in the case of claims for payment of a debt or for damages, and would not prevent the claw-back in the case of an order for payment of a settlement of matrimonial property.
<P>

<a name="20711-10_para10"></a>That seems to me to be an amendment which is plainly just and fair. It will prevent what could be a serious injustice to a successful plaintiff. I also find it extraordinary, and, indeed, unprecedented, to be able to recover damages which have been not only ordered but paid under an order of the court in cases other than ones where there has been fraud or some other serious default on the part of the plaintiff. To that extent, it establishes thoroughly bad precedent. Therefore, I hope, though I fear I do not expect, that the Government will see the justice of the case and will accept the amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, I shall explain the context in which the amendment arises. Clause 309 enables the proceeds of unlawful conduct to be traced. That principle is not assailed. Giving away dispositions, for example, or other dispositions, does not prevent the property from continuing to be recoverable and therefore recovered. But there must be exceptions.
<P>

<a name="20711-10_para11"></a>Perhaps the most important exception is in Clause 312(1). Where someone acquires the property in good faith for value and without notice, he can keep <P>


<a name="column_860"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 860</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>it. That concept is well known to lawyers. It is often called "equity's darling". There are three elements to that. If a person has acquired in good faith, for value and without notice, the property is tainted in that way.
<P>

<a name="20711-10_para12"></a>However, another exception which the Government thought important is contained at present in Clause 312(3). That is in circumstances where the very nature of the proceedings is on the basis of the respondent's unlawful conduct. In those circumstances, it is likely that the claimant will realise that the property is recoverable because he is saying either, "The property has been taken from me by fraud", or if not that very property, "That is the sort of person who takes property dishonestly from other people". That is why the exception, as presently drafted, is necessary. Therefore, if I am defrauded, I sue for fraud and I receive back my money. The fact that I knew that the property which is coming to me was the proceeds of crime does not and should not prevent the recovery order from operating.
<P>

<a name="20711-10_para13"></a>It would be wrong in those circumstances that the director should recover; the victim would take priority. However, the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, wants to extend that to the proceeds of any judgment for debt or damages, subject only to the proviso that it is made in good faith, and therefore would not apply the two other elements in Clause 312 without notice that it is recoverable property or that it is for value. That would put the judgment creditor in a favourable position. Indeed, subject to other parts of the Bill, the person who had obtained a judgment for a debt would be in a better position than the person who had simply had the debt paid on this analysis without the need to go to court.
<P>

<a name="20711-10_para14"></a>I emphasise that that does not undermine the judgment. The judgment will remain. If someone has a judgment, there is nothing wrong with him saying, "The respondent has chosen to meet that judgment by using my money or other property to which he is not entitled". The true owner&#151;in this case the state, because that is the philosophy behind Part 5&#151;is entitled to say, "That is property which should be mine. This judgment has to be settled with some other property". There is nothing absurd or wrong about the principle.
<P>

<a name="20711-10_para15"></a>My fundamental proposition is that Clause 312(1) adequately meets the cases which should be met. I understand that the noble Lord accepts that if a judgment is met there is a disposal, so that part is satisfied. He presumably sees no difficulty in the concept of good faith because that is the concept he wants to apply. Presumably, he has no difficulty with the concept that it was without notice that it is recoverable property. He continues to question whether or not a person who has obtained a judgment may be giving value. That is where he and I differ.
<P>

<a name="20711-10_para16"></a>I invite the noble Lord first to consider a case in which a person has supplied goods, has a claim for a debt and that debt is paid before court proceedings. There can be no doubt that value has been given because value was given at the time that the money was lent, the goods were sold or whatever gives rise to the <P>


<a name="column_861"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 861</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>debt. There is no less value given when the money is paid following a judgment. Equally, if there is a claim for damages, the person who has that claim as a result of an injury sustained possesses something which is a chose in action in legal terms. It is a right of action which is given up at the time that the judgment is satisfied. One cannot obviously keep both the right of action and the proceeds of the judgment.
<P>

<a name="20711-10_para17"></a>Therefore, I do not have difficulty in seeing that in the right case the concept of Clause 312 can apply to proceeds after a judgment. It will be for the court to be satisfied that value have been given. That would always be the case. Researches have identified the Chancery Division case of Taylor v. Blakelock. That was a breach of trust. When the property was then passed from another trust to the person who had the claim in relation to the trust, it was held to be a disposition for value. One is not surprised by that because the real distinction is between a volunteer and someone who has given value. Someone who has a claim for damages, which is satisfied by the court, is not an innocent volunteer. That would be for the court to decide, but I suggest that there is not the problem that the noble Lord suggests.
<P>

<a name="20711-10_para18"></a>The amendment is not necessary in order to meet the category of case with which he is concerned. However, there is a further problem, which goes beyond the considerations set out under Clause 312; that is, equitable considerations. That does not include the requirement of absence of notice or the requirement of value in some other sense. If the noble Lord accepts my argument, we have dealt with that point. It does not deal with the "without notice" issue. If someone has a judgment&#151;even if a bona fide judgment&#151;and knows that it is being satisfied from the proceeds of a robbery, why should he be able to keep the property? He will say, "No, you must pay me out of money which is clean".
<P>

<a name="20711-10_para19"></a>I refer to a second problem. In Part 5 we have been attempting to have a civil process, which follows the same kind of rules as a civil process. A concept such as bona fide purchaser for value without notice and in good faith is entirely what one would expect in a civil process. The courts would be used to dealing with that. To introduce a novel concept which simply depends upon good faith would be to introduce an unusual approach. That could give rise to serious difficulties as to how this is supposed to apply.
<P>

<a name="20711-10_para20"></a>I hope that the noble Lord feels that that explanation&#151;although we have covered some of this ground before&#151;is of some reassurance. I invite him to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-10_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, I am inclined to accept the argument of the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General so far as it applies to actions in debt. To that extent, I agree that the wording of my amendment, which refers to debt, is probably superfluous. However, there remain serious problems as regards actions for damages.
<P>


<a name="column_862"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 862</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20711-10_para21"></a>Let us assume that there is an action for damages for personal injury. A plaintiff who is injured by the negligence of the respondent is not interested in the question of whether or not any claim for damages is likely to be satisfied out of recoverable property.
<P>

<a name="20711-10_para22"></a>It is not like a contract where one knows that one is dealing with a particular person. One may or may not know that that person is involved in crime. If one does, it is reasonable that the property acquired from him should be treated as being recoverable. I turn back to the case of someone injured by the negligence of the respondent. Let us assume that at the time of the injury that the injured person does not know anything about the respondent whatsoever, except that his conduct has injured him. The noble and learned Lord tried to argue that one could get around that issue by saying that when the plaintiff is injured he acquires a chose in action&#151;a right in action. When he gets the payment of damages he disposes of his right of action for value and in good faith. I regard that as an extremely narrow and technical argument.
<P>

<a name="20711-10_para23"></a>On Report the noble and learned Lord raised against me the argument that the cause of action is extinguished by the judgment. On this occasion I would raise that against him because by the time one gets one's damages judgment has already been given, obviously. So one no longer has a cause of action&#151;when one gets the damages one has nothing of which one can dispose. I do not wish to rely on that exceedingly technical argument.
<P>

<a name="20711-10_para24"></a>If the noble and learned Lord is right&#151;when one gets judgment in an action for damages, and when that judgment is satisfied one provides value to the person who paid the damages&#151;the whole of subsection (3) would be unnecessary. If the claimant's claim is based on the defendant's unlawful conduct, there must be a right of action for the unlawful conduct which is being given up, in exactly the same way as would be the case if it is simply an action for damages for negligence.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goldsmith: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for giving way to me. In that circumstance the claimant will have noticed that it is recoverable property. That is why Clause 312(1) would not work in that situation. That is why the existing clause is necessary.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, the point about the notice is a bad one. I return to the case of someone injured by negligence. At the time of the injury, he has no idea that the respondent is involved in crime. By the time the judgment is satisfied he has found out quite a good deal more about the respondent. If that is the case, on the noble and learned Lord's interpretation of Clause 312(1), the conditions cannot be satisfied because by the time that the judgment is satisfied the plaintiff has notice that the property might be recoverable. Surely, it should make no difference whatever if an entirely innocent plaintiff, with a good cause of action in damages against a respondent is defeated simply because at some stage before the judgment is satisfied he comes across the otherwise irrelevant information that the respondent is a no-good type against whom a recovery order might be <P>


<a name="column_863"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 863</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>made. It is unjustified to say that that is a deciding factor in whether or not the plaintiff is entitled to keep the damages which he has been paid. This is a wholly unjustifiable objection.
<P>

<a name="20711-11_para0"></a>I am unhappy with the Government's response. Nevertheless, I have the feeling that we are arguing in terms of some fairly narrow technicalities. I should be reluctant in the circumstances&#151;although I remain convinced that my point is good&#151;to press the matter to a division. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Goodhart </B>   moved Amendment No. 12:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 199, line 24, at end insert "or an employee of his"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20711-11_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 12, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 13, 14, 15 and 16. The amendments are based on the belief that the most effective way to ensure that the regulated sector observes high standards in relation to money-laundering is to make its employers liable to prosecution for misconduct or negligence of their employees, whether or not the directors of an employer company have been guilty of it.
<P>

<a name="20711-11_para4"></a>If employers face a hefty fine for a breach of money-laundering by their staff, that ensures that their staff are not only properly trained but are selected as people who have the capacity to do the job, are properly monitored and are not grossly overworked.
<P>

<a name="20711-11_para5"></a>Amendment No. 12 substantially strengthens the Bill. In addition, it eliminates the need to make employees personally liable for a negligent failure to spot a suspicious transaction. It is unfair to make a junior employee liable for failure to spot a suspicious transaction if he did not realise that it was suspicious.
<P>

<a name="20711-11_para6"></a>There is a specific defence provided in the Bill for employees who have not had proper training, but it is not a defence if they fail to notice that a transaction is suspicious because they are exhausted by overwork or because they are simply not up to the job. That potential unfairness to employees who may find themselves with a criminal conviction for negligent conduct was a matter of great concern to members of all parties in Committee in another place. An offence of careless driving is a criminal offence of negligence, but does not normally attract the kind of stigma that would be attracted by a conviction for money laundering, which may be a crime of serious dishonesty.
<P>

<a name="20711-11_para7"></a>The amendments would strengthen the Bill by giving employers a real incentive to ensure the maintenance of high standards in watching for money laundering and would remove a potential injustice to their staff. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   My Lords, I rise to support the amendments. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, will recall, in Committee we tabled amendments of a slightly different nature to the clause. Our approach was to reduce the penalty for the negligence offence to one below the custodial threshold. That did not find favour with the noble and <P>


<a name="column_864"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 864</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>learned Lord. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, took the message and has come up with a different approach.
<P>

<a name="20711-11_para8"></a>The Government's approach is both ethically wrong and operationally futile. It is ethically wrong for the reasons explained by the noble Lord. A criminal penalty of that nature should not be the consequence of negligent conduct in which an officer in an institution does not do what he ought to do, according to the required standard. Equally, the existence of the penalty will make no difference to the conduct of those who are, to use the modern expression that I do not much like myself, but which seems the most evocative, at the workstation.
<P>

<a name="20711-11_para9"></a>I hope that the Minister will reflect on the matter. I do not say that our solution is necessarily the best; nor that that of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, is the best; but the Government should think again about the issue. So something needs to be done. The Government have got the balance wrong and they should take the opportunity, while the Bill is still alive, to come up with a better solution.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-11_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, we share a considerable number of goals with noble Lords on both Front Benches on the matter, but I earnestly ask both of them to consider what they are proposing under the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20711-11_para10"></a>For example, let us suppose that a one-man solicitors firm has trained all of its staff and has systems in place, as required under the money laundering directive that is to be introduced. That one-man firm will be caught by the directive and by the clause. He has trained; he has the system; he is careful. As the result of the negligence of one of his employees, there is a breach of the provision. Under the amendment, the employee will get off but the solicitor, who is completely blameless in that respect and has done everything required of him, will end up being liable for a criminal offence that carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison.
<P>

<a name="20711-11_para11"></a>Having put the ethical case, I cannot believe that noble Lords intended that, but that is the amendment's consequence once the second money laundering directive is introduced and solicitors are caught by it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-11_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble and learned Lord for giving way, and I shall be telegraphic. I agree with much of what he said, but the Government are equally at fault in their position. That is why I asked them to come up with a different approach. The Government have criticised both of our approaches, but they have not done anything to improve their draft.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-11_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, that draft involves blameworthy conduct in the sense of negligence before a crime is committed, whereas the draft proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, which the noble Lord supports, involves conviction for an offence without any blameworthy conduct.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20711-11_para12"></a>We all agree that our goal is high standards for reporting coupled with appropriate penalties for wrong-doing. We cannot possibly support what would in effect be strict liability for professionals who were completely blameless. From what the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said, I detect that he does not support that conclusion either. We think that we have the best solution.
<P>

<a name="20711-11_para13"></a>The Money Laundering Regulations 1993 require all businesses within the regulated sector to have systems in place to provide for the training of employees, the identification of customers and the keeping of records for five years. The penalty on conviction for failing to comply with the regulations is a period of imprisonment of up to two years or an unlimited fine. Most companies are diligent in that respect and comply fully with the regulations' requirements, but a company director can already be brought to book for failing to take the regulations seriously. That is important because of the high standards that we seek.
<P>

<a name="20711-11_para14"></a>In effect, the amendments would mean that even if an employer has done everything in his power to ensure that his employees have been correctly trained to be alert to money laundering, where an employee fails to make a disclosure because he did not know or suspect that money laundering was going on, the employer would have to take full responsibility for the negligent behaviour of his employees. It does not end there. In the circumstances that I have described, by virtue of Clause 338, the employer could find himself subject to a period of imprisonment of up to five years.
<P>

<a name="20711-11_para15"></a>For the reasons that I have given, that cannot be right. The employer will have done nothing wrong at all; on the contrary, he will have done all that he can to protect his company from money laundering activity and yet, through wilfulness or sheer laziness on the part of his employee, he may still face a longish term of imprisonment.
<P>

<a name="20711-11_para16"></a>Separately from the ethical point, how would the amendment work in practice? Where the employee knew or suspected money laundering, the prosecutor would seem to have a choice whether to prosecute the employer or the employee. It is not right to have the option of prosecuting the employer in cases where the employee deliberately fails to report money laundering. In cases in which there was no knowledge or suspicion, the employee would have a defence to the offence, so the prosecutor could pursue only the employer.
<P>

<a name="20711-11_para17"></a>However, in practice it may not be clear at the outset whether there was actual knowledge or suspicion or simply reasonable grounds for it. In order to secure a conviction, the prosecution would need to put both the employee and the employer in the dock and see whether the employee successfully made the defence. That could lead to the employer being prosecuted in the most inappropriate cases.
<P>

<a name="20711-11_para18"></a>The simple fact is that, under the amendments, the prosecutor would be reluctant to bring a prosecution against a company except in the most blatant cases of <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>a company's disregard of proper procedures. In most such cases, the company would be liable to prosecution under the money laundering regulations in any event. We should be no further forward in trying to bring about a higher degree of diligence within the regulated sector.
<P>

<a name="20711-11_para19"></a>So we would end up with unfairness and would not produce the high standards that we seek. In those circumstances, I firmly ask the noble Lord to reconsider and to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="20711-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, I found the noble and learned Lord's response far from convincing. He raised the argument of the one-person solicitors firm and said that the threat of a five-year term imprisonment for the breach of the money laundering rules by an employee of the solicitor would be inappropriate. Of course that is so but there would be no chance in those circumstances of any term of imprisonment being imposed. A five-year term would be almost equally inappropriate for a new young employee who, despite being properly trained, failed to notice something that an experienced employee would have noticed and became liable for negligence.
<P>

<a name="20711-12_para0"></a>Equally, where the employees of a large firm or an incorporated business commit a series of breaches, plainly there is something wrong with the way that the employer runs the business and a fine&#151;possibly substantial&#151;would be entirely appropriate. Strict liability is a way of ensuring high standards in the commercial sector, so there are several fields in which employers are subject to strict criminal liability for breaches of law by their employees.
<P>

<a name="20711-12_para1"></a>I would have been minded to press the amendment to a Division except that it would impose a considerable potential liability on any organisation that falls within the regulated sector now or may do in future. It would be inappropriate to press the amendment to a vote without more thorough consultation with the business sector potentially affected than we have been able to undertake. In those circumstance, while I remain convinced that the amendment is a much better way of proceeding, it is not appropriate to press it now. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3>City that were not reported to law enforcement. For the City's financial reputation and standing, here and overseas, it is of utmost importance that the United Kingdom should be seen to demand the highest standards of diligence. I was recently able to reassure representatives of the Law Society concerning the operation of the provisions in Part 7. One of their concerns was that a problem might arise if NCIS is unable to consent to a transaction quickly and a client brings an action for negligence&#151;for example, where there is urgency in completing a conveyancing transaction.
<P>

<a name="20711-12_para7"></a>Although it would ultimately be for the court to decide, in our view it is highly unlikely that a company that is in dialogue with NCIS would be found negligent in those circumstances. Where a report is sent to NCIS and the matter is urgent, I am looking into establishing a follow-up hotline within NCIS to operate during daylight hours, so that the discloser is not left in the difficult position of neither being able to effect a transaction nor inform the client that a report has been made to NCIS. The Bill's time limits will be helpful but there will inevitably be cases where consent to a transaction needs to be given before seven calendar days, as provided in the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble and learned Lord for making that point. The original Law Society proposal for a two-day time limit presented obvious difficulties and might have led to NCIS refusing permission without the opportunity to consider the matter properly because the two-day limit was approaching. The formula devised by the noble and learned Lord and the Law Society is the right way to proceed.

<P>

<P>

<a name="20711-12_para8"></a>I alerted your Lordships to the need for Amendment No. 17 on Report. Its effect is to provide a power to make rules of court for proceedings under Clause 380, which makes provision for the Director of ARA to apply to a judge for a letter requesting evidence from overseas relating to confiscation investigations. The person under investigation will also be able to request such evidence for use in their defence. The amendment is required because applications under this clause will be made to a judge, not to a court, and therefore specific rule-making provision within the Bill to make rules of court will be required.
<P>

<a name="20711-12_para9"></a>Amendment No. 18 is a purely drafting amendment. Part 5 of the Bill refers to "interim receiving orders" for England and Wales and to "interim administration orders" for Scotland&#151;reflecting the different terminology in the two jurisdictions. The same terminology is used in Part 8. Amendment 18 simply adds a reference to "interim administration orders" to the interpretation provision for Part 8. I beg to move.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20711-12_para55"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, at the very last gasp we plead for the third time for the Government to adopt the simple proposal to subject the extension of criminal offences to new groups of people to full parliamentary scrutiny by the mechanism of the affirmatory procedure&#151;which was the recommendation of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee.
<P>

<a name="20711-12_para56"></a>Clause 463 imposes a considerable burden on businesses that are designated in Part 1 of Schedule 9 as the regulated sector. Criminal responsibility is placed upon any person involved in that sector who has information that may be apposite to money laundering. The Government's response on Report was twofold. First, they said that it was necessary to implement the second European money laundering directive&#151;which would extend the scope of the schedule to accountants, auditors, tax advisers, lawyers, estate agents, casinos and dealers in high-value goods. One only has to consider that last group to wonder what sort of businesses are included in dealers and high-value goods. How are they to be defined? The extensions should be fully debated and accepted affirmatively.
<P>

<a name="20711-12_para57"></a>Secondly, the Government said that minor technical changes to the money-laundering regulations have already been made from time to time and that technical changes do not require the expenditure of a considerable amount of parliamentary time.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, we are still not minded to accept the noble Lord's amendment or the recommendations of the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform in this respect.
<P>

<a name="20711-13_para0"></a>As the noble Lord said, we intend to implement the Second European Money Laundering Directive by a revision of the 1993 Money Laundering Regulations, which will include an extension of the regulations to cover the areas of business specified in the directive. Changes to the regulations will be subject to a full three-month period of consultation. On Report, I said that the regulations&#151;and hence the criminal law&#151;would be amended simply in order to fulfil our international obligations, as set out in the directive, which has, of course, been considered and cleared by scrutiny Committees in both Houses.
<P>

<a name="20711-13_para1"></a>At that stage, the noble Lord stated that he was not satisfied with that argument, because the directive did not lay down a requirement as to the length of sentence for failing to report suspected money laundering. I must point out that the European directives and other international documents represent a minimum standard. In order to maintain the strong reputation of our financial sector, the UK must be seen as a leader in the field, with strong, effective anti-money laundering provisions in place.
<P>

<a name="20711-13_para2"></a>As set out in paragraphs 84 and 85 of the Home Office's memorandum, the Treasury can, at present, change the definition of business in the regulated sector set out in the Money Laundering Regulations 1993 by order subject to the negative resolution procedure under the European Communities Act 1972. That covers issues such as the requirement to establish systems for suspicious transaction reports, keeping records, undertaking training and appointing designated money laundering reporting officers.
<P>

<a name="20711-13_para3"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, made the point that the European Communities Act could not be used to create offences for which the penalties were more than two years and that we should, therefore, not argue that the Schedule 9 power should have the same procedure as the Money Laundering Regulations, which are made under the European Communities Act and contain only penalties of two years. I still disagree with that line of argument. It is clear that we are not trying to say that the provisions in the Bill are the same as the Money Laundering Regulations. Neither are we creating offences by way of secondary legislation. We would be making changes to what constitutes the regulated sector for the purpose of the Act and changes to the list of supervisory authorities. It has already been accepted that the regulated sector will be extended to additional types of <P>


<a name="column_871"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 871</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>business, such as accountants and tax advisers, and that they will, consequently, be subject to the failure to disclose offence and the penalties that that offence attracts.
<P>

<a name="20711-13_para4"></a>The important point is that we must ensure that the two definitions of the regulated sector are kept the same for practical purposes. It would not be sensible to have one definition of the regulated sector for the purpose of the Money Laundering Regulations but another definition for the requirement in the Proceeds of Crime Bill to make suspicious transaction reports when there were reasonable grounds to suspect involvement in money laundering.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, that must be the weakest argument ever. After all, the House is used to making identical sets of regulations for, say, England and Wales, on the one hand, and Scotland, on the other. The regulations may be identical, but they will be in different instruments. It is perfectly possible to do exactly the same here.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   My Lords, it would be perfectly possible to do it, but it is equally possible that it would not be done. It is for the House to judge the strength of the argument. If we make one order subject to affirmative resolution, there would be the potential for the definitions to get out of step, while we wait for the affirmative order to be approved. The amendments would also create the rather odd and undesirable position in which amendments to Part 1 of Schedule 9&#151;the definition of the regulated sector&#151;would be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, while amendments to Part 2 of the schedule&#151;the list of supervisory authorities&#151;would be subject to the negative procedure.
<P>

<a name="20711-13_para5"></a>I hope that what I have said will reassure the noble Lord and that the amendment will be withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-13_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   My Lords, I must take up that final point. I emphasised that the thrust of the amendment was that we should deal with the extension of criminal offences to new groups of people. The Minister says that that does not create new criminal offences, but there are dealers in high value goods who today do not commit an offence by failing to report matters that come to their attention but who tomorrow, when the regulations are passed, will commit a criminal offence if they fail to disclose information. That is creating new criminal offences.
<P>

<a name="20711-13_para6"></a>We are wholly unsatisfied with the explanation given. However, for the moment&#151;indeed, for the end of the Bill in this House&#151;we will not press the amendment to a Division. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

"( ) the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20711-13_para13"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, before I speak to the amendment, I shall take a moment of the House's time to thank the Minister and all his team for their care and patience in handling our amendments from day one. We have had many meetings outside the Chamber as well as long and interesting debates in it. I feel&#151;perhaps slightly conceitedly&#151;that the Bill has been given a serious and thorough examination. That examination has been treated courteously, carefully and diligently by the Government.
<P>

<a name="20711-13_para14"></a>I return to the amendment. The arguments for the proposed change have been made two or three times. The amendment refers to the remit of the chief inspector of criminal justice and to the areas that he should inspect. There is, as I shall hear shortly from the Minister, common ground between us. We agree that the list is not complete. It is also common ground that there are powers for the Secretary of State to add to the list. However, I must make the point a last time. There are organisations in Northern Ireland that are, clearly, part and parcel of the judicial system. Unlike certain noble Lords, I shall not pick on one. Noble Lords will know that people feel more strongly about some of those organisations than they do about others. I sincerely hope that the logic will bear fruit in due course and that we will see a comprehensive list of organisations that will be inspected by the chief inspector of criminal justice. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-13_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </B>   My Lords, I support the amendment, but, before I proceed with the debate, I join the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, in expressing gratitude to the Minister and to his colleague, the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland of Asthal, who, I understand, has to be in Brussels today. Both have been exceedingly courteous.
<P>

<a name="20711-13_para15"></a>I hope that, in the passage of the Bill through Committee and Report, we have managed to exchange ideas and concerns to the extent that the Bill will benefit society in Northern Ireland. I listened carefully as the noble and learned Lord the Lord Privy Seal assured us again and again that the Bill would not be implemented or the relevant matters devolved until the situation was right and that nothing would be done that would jeopardise that tender plant, the devolved arrangement in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="20711-13_para16"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, I am concerned that there are 19 organisations under the scrutiny of the Chief Inspector of Criminal Justice, which, despite having been asked as long ago as February to consult and consider that particular matter, have been unable four months later to respond positively. I cannot believe that all 19 organisations <P>


<a name="column_873"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 873</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>under consideration have been as reluctant. I therefore cannot understand why names have not been put forward. It appears to me that the Police Ombudsman, whose task is to ensure transparency and openness in terms of policing in Northern Ireland, would not wish to be seen as reluctant to be open and transparent in the way in which her duties and those of her office are carried out.
<P>

<a name="20711-13_para17"></a>Will the Minister therefore indicate the reason for four months of wavering and indifference on the part of those organisations, or some of them? Will he at least give your Lordships an assurance that, subsequent to today's proceedings, there will be no opportunity for any of those 19 organisations to opt out of their responsibilities to participate in the scrutiny procedure to which this clause of the Bill relates? It would be a matter of particular concern should any of the organisations be able to say, "We are not prepared to participate in the scrutiny for which this Bill makes provision".
<P>

<a name="20711-13_para18"></a>The noble and learned Lord knows that I still have considerable concerns with regard to the remainder of the Bill. However, he has endeavoured to reassure me on many matters. I appreciate the correspondence that I have received from him. I hope that he is able further to reassure me today.

<P>
<A NAME="20711-13_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </B>   My Lords, I am conscious that we are revisiting unfinished business in more ways than one. In that context, I must apologise to your Lordships' House that in my final speech on this matter at Report stage a week ago I appear by some Fawkesian slip to have said "5th November" when I meant to say "5th February", which will have made my speech extremely difficult to follow.
<P>

<a name="20711-13_para19"></a>To make sense of what I had made a nonsense, the true chronology was that Mr Browne in Committee in the Commons on 5th February had said that he might complete the consultation that underlies this amendment by Report stage in the Commons. The latter occurred on 4th March, and the noble and learned Lord the Minister revealed on Report here on 1st July that Mr Browne had written to the consultees on 28th February, four days earlier. As we now know, that consultation has still not been completed, four months later. I acknowledge that the bodies already on the face of the Bill had two years of consultation. By comparison, therefore, four months is a bagatelle. Equally, however, Mr Browne's original estimate of four days was perhaps a little optimistic.
<P>

<a name="20711-13_para20"></a>As the Bill has moved towards the slipway leading to enactment, another drama has been played in parallel. At this elegiac moment in the Bill's progress, I hope I shall be allowed the indulgence of saying that, however sorry I may be that the Government's consultation in this instance has taken four months and may take up to two years altogether, I am delighted that they have taken longer than the period of less than two weeks taken by Queen's University, Belfast to consult on its decision to end the teaching of <P>


<a name="column_874"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>Greek, Latin and classical studies. If any of your Lordships wonder at the relevance of that, some of us who had small parts to play in the 30 years of the Troubles have been aware of their classical resonance. The great Seamus Heaney, who won a Nobel Prize for Literature, even before John Hume and David Trimble won theirs for Peace, adapted a Sophoclean episode from the 20 Homeric years of the Trojan Wars into a contemporary play.

I regret the decision to end classical studies at Queen's University, Belfast, which was a most distinguished department. Of course, I do not lay that at the Government's door, but I hope that their consultation has a happier outcome than the one I have just described.

<P>
<A NAME="20711-14_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, I recognise that the noble and learned Lord made it clear at Report stage that a consultation period is still taking place. However, it is strange that the Police Ombudsman, who, above many others, must be seen to be connected with criminal justice, has still been unable to reply. It is equally extremely difficult to believe that, when she does answer, she could answer other than by saying that she would be prepared to submit herself to the inspector's remit. I make a last plea to the Government to consider putting the Police Ombudsman on the list, on the assumption that, no person thinking properly about her duty to criminal justice could very well do otherwise than say that she will submit herself.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-14_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Privy Seal   (Lord Williams of Mostyn): </B>  My Lords, I am very grateful for the courteous remarks introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, and echoed by other noble Lords. I shall respond, because it has never been a requirement for any of us to be relevant when speaking to any amendment on the face of this Bill.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para0"></a>We are reaching the end of a difficult journey. The noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, who I am pleased to see in her place, expressed serious, reasoned concerns about the Grand Committee procedure. I am happy to pay tribute to all who participated. It was a model of its kind; the House authorities were excellent in providing us with proper accommodation after the first two days; and I believe that in the scrutiny of this Bill we have done our duty properly to the people of Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para1"></a>I have reminded myself of the areas in which improvements have been made: the judiciary; the lay members of the commission to declare in writing their commitment to non-violence, exclusively peaceful and democratic means; that the pool of candidates is to be reflective of the community; that appointment can be made only on merit; the roll-out in an orderly way of the new Public Prosecution Service; the designation of the DPP under Sections 75 and 76 of the Act; that we <P>


<a name="column_875"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 875</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>listened particularly carefully to the concerns expressed on community safety partnerships, about which we have tabled amendments; and, not least, that the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, achieved his requirement that the Secretary of State should be obliged to publish reports. Without being unduly self-congratulatory, we have done good work.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para2"></a>Perhaps I may say also that I am pleased to see the noble and redoubtable Baroness, Lady Park of Monmouth, back with us after her recent indisposition. Furthermore, I welcome in particular the generous and good-hearted words of the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis. He does not agree with me on all occasions; indeed, he has not agreed on any occasion, but throughout we have had a civilised discourse and debate.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para3"></a>I turn now to Amendment No. 1. I can confirm for the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, that there is no question of any organisation being able to opt out or to have a veto. We are continuing with our consultations. They are lengthy, but we have approached the matter on the basis that it is better to have a willing rather than an unwilling co-operator. That is the key to what we are doing. Some organisations have proved to be reluctant. Some claim to have sent letters to my honourable friend Mr Browne. I had better not mention one which claims that its letter has been lost. I shall leave noble Lords to draw their own ignoble conclusions as regards whose letter might have been lost in the post.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para4"></a>Noble Lords are entitled to something more definite than I have said in the past. What I am undertaking is this: the Secretary of State does intend to use this power and there is no prospect that the present limited list will remain. I have said privately to the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, and I repeat for the benefit of all noble Lords the following. In the first week back after the Recess I shall undertake to write an update letter to all noble Lords and to place a copy in the Library of the House. That will set a terminal point at which decisions will have to have been made.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para5"></a>On that basis, I hope that the noble Lord will feel content that he has achieved his substantial purpose.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble and learned Lord for that explanation which very generously he gave me earlier today in his office. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="20711-14_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, perhaps I may take this opportunity to reiterate what has been said by other noble Lords. The deliberations on this Bill have been lengthy&#151;indeed, on occasion they have been too lengthy&#151;but ultimately the legislation has come through well. On Second Reading I said that I felt that we were creating an overly elaborate judicial infrastructure, and I am still not persuaded on that point. However, I wish the Bill well. I think that some parts of it are excellent, in particular the provisions dealing with the treatment of young offenders. They are truly pioneering and I hope that they will be extended throughout the United Kingdom once they are up and running in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para9"></a>Overall, we welcome the Bill. Its enactment will properly devolve judicial arrangements to Northern Ireland. I wish to add my thanks to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Privy Seal. His discussions with all noble Lords have been of the highest order.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-14_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Thornton: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. From the outset I wish to declare my interest as someone who works as an adviser to the Co-operative Group and as a member of the Co-operative Party.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para19"></a>I am honoured to move the Second Reading of the Employee Share Schemes Bill and I should like to take the opportunity to pay tribute to my honourable friend Mark Lazarowicz, who piloted the legislation through its stages in the other place with such skill that he succeeded in persuading the Government to join with him in extending the scope of tax advantages in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para20"></a>The Bill was originally introduced to remedy an anomaly in the current legislation with regard to the operation of tax advantages available to employee share schemes. Ironically, the very businesses that provide for a high degree of employee ownership and involvement and are totally or partially employee controlled are often unable to distribute shares to the employees on a tax-effective basis because of their employee-based structure. That anomaly acts as a deterrent to the wider extension of employee ownership. This Bill seeks to address that problem.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para21"></a>Perhaps I may describe briefly the purposes of the Bill. It will encourage wider employee ownership in the UK and will do so by extending the tax benefits for employee share schemes for companies that wish to encourage widespread employee ownership.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para22"></a>It will facilitate the transfer of shares to an employee trust by companies that want to make a significant move towards employee ownership and transfer a large part of the company into a trust at the outset. At present, this action may be discouraged because to do so would not offer corporation tax benefits otherwise available when such shares are transferred on a year-by-year basis. Thus, provided that at least 10 per cent of the company's ordinary share capital is held on behalf of the employees by trustees, the Bill provides for corporation tax relief to be granted "up front" in respect of such shares.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para23"></a>In addition, the Bill seeks to make it easier for employee trusts which hold shares to elect employees as trustees of that shareholding, and so give employees a direct voice in the ownership of the businesses in which they work.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para24"></a>Clause 1 states that the Bill will amend Schedule 8 of the Finance Act 2000, covering the introduction and operation of share incentive plans. Clause 1(2) adds a provision to the SIP legislation, which gives a clear pointer to companies setting up an SIP that elected employees may become trustees. Clause 1(3) seeks to support the position of companies and, in particular, business owners who want to make a significant move towards employee ownership. It grants corporation tax relief up front where a significant block of shares&#151;10 per cent or more&#151;is transferred to an employee trust. Clause 1(4) ensures that the availability of the corporation tax deduction should be linked to the <P>


<a name="column_878"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 878</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>distribution of shares in order to maintain the link between productivity and employee benefits. This also ensures that a proportionate part of the deduction will be withdrawn in respect of any shares which may for whatever reason be awarded to a non-Schedule E taxpayer.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para25"></a>Clause 2 proposes changes to the Finance Act 2000 which are consequential on the other changes resulting from the Bill. Clause 3 provides that shares held in an SIP by trustees with the benefit of up-front corporation tax relief will not be subject to income tax on dividends and other distributions or capital gains tax for so long as the trustees hold them, during a period of up to 10 years. This extends the period for relief otherwise available under the SIP legislation, which is usually limited to two years. This measure is designed to ensure that the enacted provisions of the Bill operate in the same way as the provisions for existing legislation governing SIPs.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para26"></a>Clause 4 gives the Bill its title: Employee Share Schemes Act 2002. Clause 5 states that the Bill will become law on 6th April 2003. The Bill represents a milestone in rewarding long-term commitment by employees. There is no better incentive and motivation for employees than for their work to be recognised and for them to share in their firm's success. Research has shown that businesses with widespread employee share ownership outperform their rivals. The combination of employee share ownership and employee participation yields the best results for everyone.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para27"></a>I read with great pleasure the commitment that my honourable friend the Paymaster General gave to the issue in her remarks on Report in the other place. She said,

<A NAME="20711-14_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </B>   My Lords, I rise to welcome the Bill. As a former Liberal Democrat candidate it has been mother's milk: a say and a share in the place where you work. I do not declare an interest, but I have an interest in the other sense. I was an initial director of Job Ownership Limited, which has been involved with the Bill. It is a further step towards wider share ownership.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para31"></a>The gist of the Bill is that major tax relief is available. That should encourage proprietors and employees. During the time I was involved with Job Ownership, 20 years or so ago, I became interested in the theology of employee-owned organisations. There is quite a span. The major element is whether the <P>


<a name="column_879"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column 879</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>employee ownership is collective or individual. I am in favour of letting many flowers grow, but I wonder whether there will be an opportunity to review the arrangements and see that there is a level playing field in terms of the fiscal arrangements of the organisations trying to encourage greater employee ownership; particularly the tax incentives.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para32"></a>In the other place there was discussion about the John Lewis Partnership and some of the possible concerns of that firm in relation to the Bill. There are occasions when we nudge matters, and this is a nudging Bill. There is further help and assistance for employee ownership in the Bill and I rise to encourage that. I hope that the further nudge eventually goes through. Perhaps there should be an opportunity in the not-too-distant future to consider further nudges.

<P>
<A NAME="20711-14_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, I am happy to support the Bill. The noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, has done us a service in picking it up from the honourable Member for Edinburgh North and Leith.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para33"></a>I am speaking in this House on the Bill because I have been involved in encouraging employee share schemes, both when I was Minister of State for Small Firms in the Government of my noble friend Lady Thatcher and also later when I was in the Treasury. I am a longstanding supporter of small businesses and of employee share schemes. I agree with the remark of the noble Lord, Lord Shutt of Greetland, about many flowers blooming. There are many different ways in which such schemes may be encouraged, which work well in different circumstances. It should not be a function of government to persuade organisations to use one form as opposed to another.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para34"></a>The noble Lord also referred to the important outstanding matter of the John Lewis Partnership and other firms arranged on the same lines. As we all know, John Lewis is an outstanding example of employee share ownership. It is far more longstanding than any of the schemes of either the present or previous Government&#151;of which I was a member&#151;on this matter. It would be astonishing and wrong if John Lewis was to be excluded from the benefits of the Bill because of the arrangement of its partnership.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para35"></a>So far we have had only expressions of sympathy from the Government on that point. With regard to John Lewis and similar companies it is an example of what passes for activity by the Government: every assistance short of actual help. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure us either today or in later stages on that aspect.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para36"></a>The Bill is a finance Bill in all but name. It is about tax. It amends the Finance Act 2000 and does nothing else. It was handled in another place by my successor as Her Majesty's Paymaster General, Dawn Primarolo, who was also my parliamentary neighbour. It is excellent that we are being allowed to discuss the Bill completely, not only today but in its later stages, and to discuss amendments should noble Lords wish. I look forward to the later stages being conducted in a full and proper manner as befits a Bill, even if it is a finance Bill in all but name.

<A NAME="20711-14_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate my noble friend Lady Thornton on bringing the Bill before the House. I am not sure that I share the exulted enthusiasm displayed by the noble Lord on the Opposition Benches, who delighted in the fact that this is a quasi-finance Bill and therefore felt that we should take extra delight in the proceedings. I have rather more respect for finance Bills in the other place not to develop a certain shudder about Bills on which discussion often went on long into the night under the old regime. Let us rest assured that, as the noble Lord, Lord Cope, described, the Bill amends the Finance Act; but it began as a Private Member's Bill in the other place and is being read in that vein here.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para37"></a>As my noble friend said in her opening remarks, employee share ownership is at the heart of the Government's drive for improved productivity and enterprise. In July 2000 we introduced the Share Incentive Plan and enterprise management incentives. The noble Lord, Lord Shutt, is right that the body of which he has fond associations, Job Ownership Limited, played its part in the Bill's development. So too did the Co-operative Party; I congratulate both organisations on their contribution.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para38"></a>As has been indicated in all parts of the House, the Bill enjoyed support on all sides of the Commons. The Government's proposals on share incentive plans and enterprise management incentives were developed in consultation with industry and both are proving very popular. For example, more than 600 companies have applied for Inland Revenue approval of their share incentive plans. This demonstrates our very real commitment to employee share ownership. But we are not complacent. The need for development will be monitored. Both the share incentive plan and enterprise management incentives will be fully evaluated in 2005-06, although there will be some preliminary findings available before then.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para39"></a>The Government have also made a commitment to look at the corporation tax treatment of share schemes to make it simpler, particularly for small companies&#151;a matter to which the noble Lord, Lord Cope, referred and which I know is dear to his heart. This should provide further encouragement to introduce employee share schemes. The Government welcome the aims of the Bill to encourage employee participation and employee ownership. Research shows that companies with widespread employee ownership and participation out-perform their rivals.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para40"></a>The Government accept the idea of providing in the Bill a framework for employee representation on the share incentive plan trust for those companies that wish to use it. Inland Revenue officials are working with my honourable friend Mark Lazarowicz and his team on a trust deed that would provide for this with a view to making it available alongside a model trust deed already offered by the Revenue.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para41"></a>The Government fully support the transfer of shares into employee ownership. The new early corporation tax deduction will complete the measures that the Government have already taken to facilitate the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>transfer of shares from individuals such as family owners into the share incentive plan. Capital gains tax roll-over relief is already available for individuals on the gain made when they transfer shares to a trust that holds at least 10 per cent of the ordinary share capital of the company. Shares that were held in a qualifying employee share ownership trust on 21st March 2000 can be transferred to a share incentive plan without the immediate corporation tax deduction being lost.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para42"></a>An additional tax advantage is given in the Bill by allowing share incentive plan trustees to be exempt from income tax on dividends and from any capital gains tax that might arise on disposal of the shares throughout the 10-year period they have to award the shares to employees.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para43"></a>The Government share the widespread enthusiasm for the measure which has been shown today. The noble Lord, Lord Cope, asked about the John Lewis Partnership. The noble Lord is right, discussions are still on-going in respect of that company, which, because of its structure, raises particular issues in regard to this legislation. Not all the issues have as yet been resolved. But that is not through a want of co-operation by the Government and work is progressing constructively on that front.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para44"></a>I am aware of how much hard work has been put into the Bill by its proponents. They have worked with the Government to settle on a series of provisions that enjoy joint support and I am grateful for that. I affirm the Government's support for the Bill. Once again I congratulate my noble friend on the perceptive way in which she introduced the Bill and the clear way in which she outlined its issues. I am sure that she will ensure that the Bill has a satisfactory passage.

<A NAME="20711-14_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Thornton: </B>   My Lords, I should mark the fact that I have been allowed out to play without my noble friend Lord Graham. He would have spoken in support of the Bill today but he is on his way to Manchester on Co-operative business. I should also mark the fact that I have had a great deal of support from Job Ownership and the Co-operative Party in preparing myself to deal with the technicalities of the Bill. Tax issues are not my speciality in this House, as noble Lords will know, and I am very grateful for their support.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para45"></a>I shall have to discuss with them the issue of John Lewis. I am sure that noble Lords will be aware that the Minister said on 21st June that the Government are taking the issue very seriously indeed and are trying to resolve it. I hope that they will succeed.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para46"></a>As to the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, about the legal and tax regime in general for Job Ownership&#151;and, indeed, for Co-operative and other social ownerships&#151;I believe that very soon we shall see some developments from the Government in that area in terms of strategic issues concerning the whole regime. I hope that Job Ownership will take the Government's general statement of intent in this area as an opportunity to push for the kind of reforms we would like to see on a broader front. The Bill is not designed to do that, as noble Lords will know.
<P>

<a name="20711-14_para47"></a>With grateful thanks to the noble Lords, Lord Shutt and Lord Cope, and to my noble friend Lord Davies, I hope that the House will give the Bill a Second Reading.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-15_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Howe </B>   moved Amendment No. 71:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 29, line 41, after "a" insert "married"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20711-15_para2"></a><P>

<a name="20711-15_para3"></a>The noble Earl said: The amendment brings us to perhaps the most politically contentious issue in the Bill: whether unmarried and same-sex couples should be permitted by law to become adoptive parents.
<P>

<a name="20711-15_para4"></a>There are no two ways about this proposition&#151;you are either for it or against it. That is not the same thing as saying that those who take one view have a closed mind about the other. I hope that noble Lords will not accuse me of that when I have completed my remarks.
<P>

<a name="20711-15_para5"></a>On these Benches, we have reached the conclusion that it is right to restrict the pool of potential adopting couples to those who are married. However, in arriving at that view, we do not in any way belittle the alternative case, which we recognise is advanced out of equally sincere conviction.
<P>

<a name="20711-15_para6"></a>The amendments I have tabled would reverse those carried in another place and would exclude unmarried and same-sex couples as adoptive parents. Why do we believe that these amendments are worthy of approval?
<P>

<a name="20711-15_para7"></a>Clause 44, on the suitability of adopters, does not say very much, but one thing it troubles to spell out is the need for stability and permanence in the relationship of an adopting couple. There is a risk in what I am about to say that I shall be accused of passing judgment on certain types of relationship. I ask the Committee to accept that I am not doing so.
<P>

<a name="20711-15_para8"></a>If we believe that stability and permanence are vital for the well-being of children, the statistics on the durability of unmarried relationships are indisputable. A recent authoritative survey found that the average length of a cohabiting relationship is two years. Of course, people can, and do, live together for much longer than that, but 83 per cent of cohabitations break up within 10 years. Cohabitation is, by definition, a temporary relationship in which neither party is willing to make a permanent commitment. According to the Office for National Statistics, cohabiting couples are six and a half times more likely than married couples to split up after the arrival of their first child.
<P>

<a name="20711-15_para9"></a>The question that needs to be answered by proponents of the Bill in its current form is this. If we are looking to give permanence and stability to an <P>


<a name="column_GC228"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC228</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>adopted child, why should we take that significant extra risk? There is no manual that tells a social worker or a court that this couple is less or more likely to split up than that one. As we were saying a week ago, you can ask as many questions as you like but, in the end, it comes down to a subjective judgment.
<P>

<a name="20711-15_para10"></a>The key point is that social work, in many of its manifestations, rests on the art of reducing risk. One of the ways in which risk can be reduced in adoption is by not placing an adoptive child in a family where there is already a child of the same age. Statistically speaking, to break that rule of thumb is asking for trouble.
<P>

<a name="20711-15_para11"></a>Similarly, the state should not consciously and deliberately place a child with a family in which there is a markedly higher chance of the parents splitting up. The best indicator of stability in a relationship is where a couple have made a public commitment to each other for life by getting married. If we look at unmarried couples who never marry&#151;and these are Office for National Statistics figures&#151;they show that the number of such couples who split up within five years of the arrival of their first child is 52 per cent. Of couples who cohabit and later marry, the figure is 25 per cent who split up within five years following the birth. Of those who were married at the time the child arrived, only 8 per cent. split up after five years. That is why I speak of a very significant extra risk.
<P>

<a name="20711-15_para12"></a>With gay relationships the risks are even greater. The average length of a so-called "closed" gay relationship is 21 months. That is according to a study funded by the Department of Health. "Closed" in this context means that sexual fidelity had been maintained during the past month. Studies have been done on the levels of educational attainment among children of homosexual couples. Those studies show unequivocally that such children tend to do much worse than those of married parents. Children with lesbian or gay parents experience a much higher incidence of relationship problems with other people because of the knowledge of their parents homosexuality.
<P>

<a name="20711-15_para13"></a>It is an unfortunate fact that children can be very cruel to one another. So if we are looking at the issue from the point of view of children&#151;and not just children, we should remind ourselves, but often very damaged, challenging and difficult children&#151;I ask again why we should consciously expose children to those additional risks. To that the following may be said. If I believe, as I do, that lone individuals should continue to be able to adopt children, why on earth should I deny the partner of such an individual the opportunity to adopt as well? Why should two unmarried people or two homosexual people be debarred from adopting as a couple?
<P>

<a name="20711-15_para14"></a>There is a very powerful argument as to why. The law of property as it relates to marriage is well established. If a married couple decides to get divorced it is for the matrimonial court to decide how the assets of the couple should be divided. In that process the children's welfare is protected to the extent that a court will usually decide on a division of property that ensures that children of the marriage will be housed and supported. Children of unmarried couples do not <P>


<a name="column_GC229"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC229</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>enjoy the same protection. Other than for the shared house, a cohabitee has no legal right to sue for an order to share the other partner's financial assets. Until such time as we invent a form of legal partnership that mirrors this legal aspect of marriage, children of cohabiting partners will be disadvantaged.
<P>

<a name="20711-15_para15"></a>I agree that there will always be children born out of wedlock and that many unmarried couples are admirable parents. But I ask again, why consciously and deliberately expose adopted children to this additional hazard when there is absolutely no need for us to do so?
<P>

<a name="20711-15_para16"></a>There is no need because there is no shortage of married couples who would like to adopt. For a number of years we have had a system that frustrates the wishes of such couples to become adoptive parents. It frustrates their wishes by erecting hurdles of various kinds that put many couples off before they have properly begun. One of those hurdles is the absence of adoption support. We hope that this Bill will rectify that particular omission. So we should not imagine that a shortage of potential married adopters somehow obliges us to cast the net more widely. There is no such shortage.
<P>

<a name="20711-15_para17"></a>These amendments are about avoiding unnecessary risk for children. Children who are looked after are already the product of broken relationships. If we know, as we do, the risks of breakdown in unmarried and same-sex relationships, we surely cannot look ourselves in the mirror as we read Clause 1 and argue that, by placing a child with an unmarried couple, we are doing our best for that child's welfare throughout his life. We cannot argue that. If we do, we are allowing ourselves to entertain the notion that the needs of children are not paramount after all. I beg to move.

<A NAME="20711-15_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Gould of Potternewton: </B>   It is with regret that I feel that I must stand up and oppose the noble Earl, Lord Howe. I hope that, just as I appreciated the sincerity of his comments, he will understand the sincerity of those who disagree with him, and appreciate that we do have the welfare of the child at heart and can look in the mirror and say of Clause 1, "Yes, we have got it right".
<P>

<a name="20711-15_para18"></a>Many noble Lords present today, although not all, attended out sitting last Thursday. It is perhaps a pity that not everyone attended the whole of that debate, which was a very important and thoughtful discussion on the criteria that should be in place to provide an adoptive child with a loving and caring home. Those criteria should be based not on whether adopters are married, but on their ability to provide stability and permanence for a child. That is what this debate is about for me. It is about the vulnerable child to whom the noble Earl, Lord Howe, referred. I hope that we shall concentrate on that.
<P>

<a name="20711-15_para19"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, referred to cohabiting couples splitting up after two years. He has clearly been reading a slightly different article from the one I read at the weekend, which said that cohabiting <P>


<a name="column_GC230"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC230</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>couples tend to get married after two years. That puts rather a different emphasis on his point. The question is how best to find stable and permanent homes for the maximum number of children currently in care. The only way is by extending the pool. I will come back to the points made by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, about that not being necessary.
<P>

<a name="20711-15_para20"></a>If we accept the fundamental premise of the Bill that the welfare of the child is paramount, we have positively to do something for the 14,000 children who have been in care continuously for more than five years. We have to do something for the 5,000 children nationwide who are waiting for a suitable adoptive family. We have to think about the large number of boys aged between five and 10 whom nobody has suggested that they are prepared to adopt. We have to think about the children who come out of care with poor educational qualifications and those who are likely to be homeless for longer than other children. That is why we have to extend the pool. Of course we have to make sure that all suitable adopters, married or unmarried, have to qualify under the most stringent criteria to be applied by the agencies, social workers and courts.
<P>

<a name="20711-15_para21"></a>I agreed with the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Young, on Second Reading, and I am sorry that she cannot be with us today. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, reiterated some of the attitudes of social workers and the need to reduce some of the bureaucratic barriers. That is necessary, but it would only marginally extend the pool. There is no evidence that the pool would be substantially increased&#151;and we need a substantial increase.
<P>

<a name="20711-15_para22"></a>We have to look not only at the obstacles that are in place, but also at some of the current anomalies that tell against the interest of the child. As we have previously discussed, a cohabiting or same-sex couple can adopt, but only one of the partners can be the legal parent. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, explained why he felt it was important to keep the possibility of adoption for single people. I want to look at the situation from the eyes of a child living in a loving and stable environment, but without the added security of having two parents. Research by MORI shows that 41 per cent of unmarried couples would adopt, but only 6 per cent do so because only one of them can be the legal guardian. Surely that is not a good environment to bring a child up where one of the partners is the legal guardian and the other can have no say about the responsibilities for that child.
<P>

<a name="20711-15_para23"></a>The situation is even more anomalous for unmarried foster carers who are jointly assessed and found to be suitable to foster a child with joint responsibility and who then find, if they wish to adopt, that only one parent can do so. A child who has been part of a loving family for a number of years with two parents can suddenly find himself with only one legal parent because they want to make a permanent home for him. That cannot be right for the child or in their interests. It must have destabilising psychological effects. Nor can it be in the interests of the family. One <P>


<a name="column_GC231"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC231</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>can imagine the conflicts that could occur in a family in those circumstances. That is a farcical situation and it is the child who ultimately loses out.
<P>

<a name="20711-15_para24"></a>I listened with interest to the question asked by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, about matrimonial property. Not everybody owns property, so we are not talking about the entire married population in that respect. Also, many cohabiting couples come to agreements about the property and their resources in case they split up. The noble Earl did not mention that, but merely implied that they just split up, disappear and cause chaos. That is completely untrue.
<P>

<a name="20711-15_para25"></a>The Bill as it stands provides a necessary guarantee of the child's legal right of relationships with both parents and provides the security of two legally recognised parents. Under the current provisions, if the one legal parent dies or becomes incapacitated, does the child who has lived with those people for a long time have to go back into care? Having had a loving, stable relationship with two people whom he loves dearly, the child loses one of them because they have died then has to leave the other one and go back into care, losing his permanent home altogether. What is the effect of that on the child? It goes completely against their interests. I find it very difficult to comprehend how anybody can accept such a devastating trauma on the child and the possible consequences for the rest of its life.
<P>

<a name="20711-15_para26"></a>The Bill provides legal grounds for either parent or both to provide consent for medical care, to make education, healthcare and other important day-to-day decisions on behalf of the child&#151;to make collective decisions as a family should. While there is only one person who has that legal responsibility, those collective decisions are not being made, which is not good for family life.
<P>

<a name="20711-15_para27"></a>A number of points were raised on Second Reading about things such as possible bullying in the school playground and the possible psychological problems that can develop from that. I would like to know where some of the evidence referred to earlier by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, came from. I do not know of evidence to support that claim. We know that many cohabiting couples have children at school. Are they bullied in the playground because their parents are cohabiting? Do the children know the parents are not married? I find those sort of arguments difficult to cope with.
<P>

<a name="20711-15_para28"></a>Another argument which has been put to me in the last few days is the question of the child's name&#151;what will the child be called? Many children now do not necessarily bear their parents' name. That is quite normal. I have a nephew who is married with two children. He and his wife decided that one child would take his name and one child would take her name. Many young couples are taking that sort of stance. Therefore, the argument about names is completely irrelevant .
<P>

<a name="20711-15_para29"></a>I could respond to some of the other points that were made on Second Reading about certain effects on children and their future gender behaviour, but perhaps I shall come back to those if they are raised again.

<P>

<a name="20711-15_para30"></a>The choice for me is simple: is it not better and right that a child should have constancy and security and the opportunity of a real home than to remain in care? The amendments that we have before us will ensure the second option and I am not prepared to accept that.

<P>
<A NAME="20711-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   I have great sympathy with the amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and my heart in some ways lies with it. However, I do not believe that I can go along with it. I do not believe that adoption by an unmarried couple or a homosexual couple is in any way the optimum. However, the alternative to adoption in the case of a child who has been in care is so infinitely worse than adoption into a home which is less than ideal that I believe that the risk is justified even if it results in only a handful of children being adopted who otherwise would remain in care.
<P>

<a name="20711-16_para0"></a>We hear endless conflicting evidence as to the effects on children of adoption by unmarried and homosexual couples and it is very difficult to sort out what is right and what is not. However, as far as a child in care is concerned, even a much less than ideal family is preferable to remaining in care, which, as I have said before, is one of the worst fates that can happen to any child.
<P>

<a name="20711-16_para1"></a>I would like some indication that, where other considerations are equal, a married couple will be preferred to an unmarried or homosexual one.
<P>

<a name="20711-16_para2"></a>The noble Earl has raised the question of how property would pass in the case of an unmarried couple. The noble Baroness, Lady Gould, pointed out that a legal arrangement could be made where property is involved. However, I do not know whether a couple who have no legal status as a couple can, as an entity, be parties to a legal process such as adoption. I am not a lawyer. Legal advice needs to be considered over this.
<P>

<a name="20711-16_para3"></a>Finally, I entirely agree with the noble Baroness about names. At the age of 16, my eldest daughter changed her name from Ramsay to Fraser because she was going to be the heir to the chiefship of the Frasers. When her son was born, he was called Fraser, not Nicolson, for exactly the same reason. That has never been any problem to anybody.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-16_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   That is a lovely note to try to follow. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, put the situation before us very clearly. I agree with him that one either agrees or disagrees with these amendments. I do not agree with them. The Government have already announced their intention of having a free vote for their supporters on these issues. I suspect that there will be a division of opinion among all the parties and groups. We have to deal with that as best we can.
<P>

<a name="20711-16_para4"></a>I support the Government's approach in the Bill. I also support the view of the noble Baroness, Lady Gould, that there is a lack of couples willing to adopt. The noble Baroness brought this out clearly by rehearsing the figures. I will not follow that through. Although the general figures are difficult to analyse, the General Register Office seems to suggest that the <P>


<a name="column_GC233"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC233</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>number of children adopted fell between 1997 and 1998 and then rose quite slowly and have still not reached the 1997 level.
<P>

<a name="20711-16_para5"></a>That does not suggest that there are many parents desperately trying to adopt difficult children with serious emotional, psychological or physical difficulties&#151;or sometimes all three, because these things seem to go together. We have to remember that those are the kinds of children that we are trying to place in adoption because we know that their chance of turning out to be reasonable citizens are so much better in a family than they are in a home.
<P>

<a name="20711-16_para6"></a>We must be careful before we say that certain sorts of families are not good enough to undertake this work, which is so important to the children and to society as a whole. Of course, all couples will get the same rigorous assessment of their stability and their ability to provide safe and loving care.
<P>

<a name="20711-16_para7"></a>When the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, spoke to Amendment No. 7 at a previous sitting, he suggested a reference in the Bill to the rigorous assessment that needs to be carried out on all couples. I know that the Government do not like doing this, but there are occasions when it is valuable to put a point of this sort on the face of the Bill&#151;and well up in the Bill&#151;so that people can see the connection between the interests of the child and the rigorous assessment of the couple. Therefore, I ask the Government to think again on that issue. It could make quite a difference. Indeed, the knowledge that this rigorous assessment will take place would be a reassurance to everyone.
<P>

<a name="20711-16_para8"></a>Much has been said and written about the relative stability of married and unmarried couples. Some of these statistics fall into that famous definition whereby you end up with "Damned Lies and Statistics", or whatever it is. It is terribly difficult if you take, say, two or perhaps three years, because that does not tell us about those couples, both married and unmarried, whose relationships survive for longer. That is what this rigorous assessment will be considering. Those conducting the assessment will not say, "We're placing a five year old", and then ask, "Will the couple still be together when the child is 10?" No. They will say, "We're placing a five year-old"&#151;perhaps a difficult five year-old&#151;"one who has already been rejected from nursery school as being totally uncontrollable, and we are wondering whether this couple will still be together in 15 years?" That is the important factor for the child. It is a different set of statistics.
<P>

<a name="20711-16_para9"></a>I am not sure that we have a statistical base for judging the stability of married and unmarried couples where a child has been adopted. Perhaps the Minister can tell us whether such statistics exist, because I want to make the point that adoption is not at all the same as having a child in the normal course of your life. Couples have their own children for a number of different reasons, for example: because they are married and it is the natural thing to do; because they have decided&#151;married or unmarried&#151;that they want to have a child, and now is the time to have it; because <P>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC234</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>one member of a couple has cheated on the other member; or perhaps by way of a mistake. There are all sorts of reasons, but they are all private reasons.
<P>

<a name="20711-16_para10"></a>However, adopting a child is not a private decision. It is a decision taken by two people in public. It is a public commitment that is tested by the system of assessment: you take on someone else's child and love and care for it as though it were your own. To me, that is a very admirable thing to wish to do. If there are couples who do not fall into the traditional definition of a "married couple" who are willing and able to do just that, it seems quite wrong that we should reject them for such a reason. I do not wish to say any more because no doubt other people will put forward more statistically-based and accurate reasons. I just wanted to put it into the human context.

<A NAME="20711-16_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I should like to make three prefacory comments before addressing the arguments advanced by the noble Earl, Lord Howe. The first, with which I hope all the Committee will agree, is to regret very much the absence of the noble Baroness, Lady Young, and to wish her all good health from us all.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-16_spnew3"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Hear, hear!
<P>

<a name="20711-16_para11"></a>The second is to offer to Members of the Committee the apologies of my noble friend Lady Barker, who is presently busy in the Chamber dealing with the Statement on pensions, but will be here later. The third is to say that I am in full agreement with the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, that this issue should be resolved on the Floor of the House. However, as all parties seem to be stating their positions, it is probably best not to be left out of the debate.
<P>

<a name="20711-16_para12"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, concentrated exclusively for much of his argument on one point; namely, the rate of splitting up among couples. I speak as the child of divorced parents, as everyone who reads the newspapers probably knows. It was not particularly easy, but the noble Earl is making an enormous assumption that splitting up is the only, or even necessarily the worst, evil that can happen to a child.
<P>

<a name="20711-16_para13"></a>My parents were happily married for many years and gave me a good and loving home from which I believe I benefited. Then came the earthquake. Twelve year-olds are notoriously egocentric, but even as an egocentric 12 year-old I was not so selfish as to wish them to stay together after that earthquake had taken place. It was a cruelty of which even then I was incapable.
<P>

<a name="20711-16_para14"></a>All the statistics comparing the result of stable unions with the result of broken unions are in effect comparisons between happy people and unhappy people, since most couples who remain married are happy, though not all. When we say that happy people tend to produce happier children than unhappy people, we are not saying anything particularly startling. That is because we do not have a proper sample for our research. If we need to consider the <P>


<a name="column_GC235"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC235</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>effect of splitting up, we need to compare unhappy couples who split up with unhappy couples who do not.
<P>

<a name="20711-16_para15"></a>It is very difficult to get the statistical base for proper academic comparison. Until we do, we should not talk with quite as much confidence as we regularly do about the argument that cohabitation is bad for children because the parents split up. Among my pupils I have encountered a good many psychological problems. Some of the worst have been from couples whose children suffered because the parents remained married when extremely unhappy and fought their battles by proxy through their children&#151;Mummy's boy fighting Daddy's girl. I have seen that do no end of harm in a family. We should therefore approach this with a little more becoming uncertainty.
<P>

<a name="20711-16_para16"></a>I also read with interest a letter published in Community Care on 24th May this year, which said that the sample which argued that cohabiting couples split up more easily was considerably distorted by a small number of people who were very rapid serial cohabiters on what I might describe as the Hollywood model. If those people were taken out of the statistics, the rate of break-up among cohabiting couples was not particularly different from that among the rest of the population.
<P>

<a name="20711-16_para17"></a>I speak here also on behalf of my two sisters-in-law, both of whom chose to cohabit rather than to marry. Having observed their relationships and the relationships of their children fairly closely over a long period, I cannot see the difference between the relationship they have had and the relationship that my wife and I, as a married couple, have had. It is in all respects, as far as I can see, the same thing.
<P>

<a name="20711-16_para18"></a>I was grateful to the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun of Abernethy, for making her point about the change to the name of Fraser. My father made me familiar with that concept when I was a child. Many of his friends had changed their name on marriage or by their parents' wills in order to inherit property. His favourite example was a couple where this had happened many times and they had ended up as Johnson-Thompson-Clatterby-Randall. I shall not forget that very easily.
<P>

<a name="20711-16_para19"></a>When the noble Earl, Lord Howe, talks about cruelty to children in the playground because their parents are not married, he is talking of a world that I do not recognise, except in the single case of gay couples, to which I shall return.

<A NAME="20711-17_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My remarks were in the context of gay couples, not unmarried couples.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-17_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   In that case, the noble Earl is suffering from the case of John Stuart Mill's maxim of the inability of the unanalytic mind to recognise its own handiwork. A great many people&#151;most of them supporters of this amendment&#151;have strongly resisted the idea that gay life should be regarded as in any way equal to heterosexual life. If one puts that view over for long enough it is inevitable that some people will believe it. If they believe it, it is inevitable that in treating their school contemporaries they may react to <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>it and behave accordingly. They ought to think about whether they are bringing about the situation of which they complain and, if they mind the resulting situation, whether the best thing they could do might not be to try and change it.
<P>

<a name="20711-17_para0"></a>There has been a colossal change of culture on this issue. My younger son, to my great pleasure, is about to get married. They have decided they are going to buy the house first. They have just completed the deal and moved in last week. They are blissfully happy about it. They say that now they have moved in and have a house they are going to think about marriage. That is exactly the opposite way round from the way it used to be when I was young. This is a general change in society. If I were to talk to my pupils about it, they would not understand why anybody should insist on an amendment such as this. If the law gets out of line with public opinion, there is a point beyond which it becomes unenforceable.
<P>

<a name="20711-17_para1"></a>We have a question about the protection of property of unmarried couples. There is such a thing as a pre-nuptial agreement, which California has made famous. There is also a Bill for civil partnerships, standing in the name of my noble friend Lord Lester of Herne Hill, which I believe is still formally before this House during this Session. Most of the answers to that question are in that Bill. If people have any different answers to it I am sure they will be considered. Among reasonable people agreements can be reached.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-17_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Seccombe: </B>   Is the noble Earl aware that the British Social Attitudes survey found that 84 per cent of the public are against homosexual men adopting children?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-17_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   Is that perhaps the result of the amount of propaganda that has been put out to keep Section 28? If so, would it be a good idea to think about the effects that that propaganda is creating? That information can be used in more than one way.
<P>

<a name="20711-17_para2"></a>One should not treat being homosexual as if it were in some way contagious. After all, by definition all homosexual people are the children of heterosexual couples, so it is equally possible that the children of homosexual couples may turn out to be heterosexual. In any event, they deserve the right to choose. For the moment I will leave it at that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-17_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </B>   I am aware of the eloquence of the previous speeches. I want to try to avoid repeating points that I might have made which have been made much better by others. However, I want to repeat, from a different angle, some of the arguments about the evidence base of the statistics, because that is crucial to making a decision on evidence rather than on feeling. There is a huge amount of feeling in this debate.
<P>

<a name="20711-17_para3"></a>We do not have any true evidence-based statistics on whether adoptive families are more likely to break down. However, if we had that evidence, it is likely that the figure might be higher, because children in adoptive families can be much more difficult and are placed from very complex family backgrounds. I have <P>


<a name="column_GC237"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC237</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>spoken with people who are working in this field. A post-adoptive service in the Midlands had a group of married mothers who were initially supported through their adoption with their partners. By the time they were working through to the end of the placement, they were applying as single people because their marriages had broken down&#151;their partners having said that they choose between the children, to whom they had become committed under the placement, and themselves. However, it is not always a choice between one or the other. If one did not allow those people to continue with their adoption, the choice in that situation would be to remove children who had already made permanent relationships with one partner. I believe that there are real complications when looking at statistics, and when considering who is making adoptions.
<P>

<a name="20711-17_para4"></a>I reiterate the points made about the kind of families that we are counting, how we are counting them, and who is taking the evidence forward. I repeat: when this is all over, I hope that we continue to gather evidence. If I were wrong, I should like to take the evidence and base it in the future, so that we make the best placements for children. Placed as I am at the moment, taking evidence, if you like, from my practice and from the experience of others to whom I have spoken, it is my view that children need good, permanent family homes and that those permanent homes are not easy to find.
<P>

<a name="20711-17_para5"></a>Certainly, there are many waiting-lists for babies who do not have disadvantage and who are not disabled. Many families wish to adopt that sort of child. The children with whom I usually deal have often worked through a number of placements. They are highly disruptive, and often have psychological problems that require support. This is why we talk all the time about the need for post-adoption support, because many of these children will tax the families to the nth degree. In this, I bring no blame to those children. They have usually had extraordinarily difficult experiences. I am absolutely clear that, with their experiences, I would have been equally difficult to place in a home. Therefore, we do not have these ideal children for whom there are long waiting-lists.
<P>

<a name="20711-17_para6"></a>Most of all, these children need constancy, love, support and continuity. For that, they need the best families we can find. The problem is that they are often placed in these families, first, as adoptive children. They grow fond of their adoptive parents, some of whom might well be cohabiting families or single-sex families. I have personal experience of a youngster. She knew that people were concerned because she was living with a lesbian couple, but she became extremely fond of those two women. To have removed that child, therefore, would have meant taking away the only constant relationship that she had ever known. It was her wish that she should remain with the two people whom she recognised as her family.
<P>

<a name="20711-17_para7"></a>When one comes to decide on adoption, one may well have an adolescent who has had several placements but who has succeeded in a foster home where the family has decided to make a commitment <P>


<a name="column_GC238"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC238</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to that child, even though they are not what you might call a perfect, "married-with-a-licence" family; they are a different sort of family. There is a fantasy that social workers are going out and finding all these families that are not what we would call the "perfect" family. Life does not run like that. One is desperately trying to find that good, solid placement for a child who has had hardly any good, solid consistency in his or her life.
<P>

<a name="20711-17_para8"></a>Finally, I realise that there are other agendas, but I know that there is a sort of belief that, if these provisions go through, they will undermine the institution of marriage. I do not believe that to be true. In my view, despite other statistics, large numbers of people in this country continue to marry and often do so after having lived together for a considerable time. I had intended to raise the same statistic as was mentioned earlier; namely, that people do not necessarily split up after two years, or so. They often get married.
<P>

<a name="20711-17_para9"></a>So there is some confusion in people's minds. This part of the Bill will not undermine the institution of marriage. Opposing the provisions for that reason is to lose sight of children. We should listen to children in these situations and hear what they tell us. They do not want to lose the few relationships that they have managed to forge because of some dogma or principle that has not to do with their lives, their future and all that we can try to give them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-17_spnew5"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   It seems to me that the Bill is not about propping up the institution of marriage, but about getting these wretched children out of care and into families.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-17_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I support my noble friend, Lord Howe, in his main claim, which was to restrict the pool of those who wish to adopt to married couples. Stability and permanence was the other thread of my noble friend's case. Like him, I believe that those are important issues. As my noble friend said, the statistics show there is a higher chance of break-up among unmarried couples. If people are unwilling to make a legal commitment to each other in marriage, the end result proves to be lack of security and an increasing chance of breakdown.
<P>

<a name="20711-17_para10"></a>I accept that everybody is speaking from a passionately held point of view, which I do not take away from anybody. One thing that unites us all is that there should be a suitable placement for a child who is to be adopted and, as far as possible, that placement should offer stability and security. The sheer evidence of the record that we have so far of both married couples and unmarried couples, whether heterosexual and/or same-sex simply does not argue the case for anything other than the amendment of my noble friend.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-17_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Howells of St Davids: </B>   I have listened to the noble Lady and suggest that hers is a very ethno-centric view. There are many stable cohabiting relationships in the Caribbean and here because of the <P>


<a name="column_GC239"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC239</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>legacy of slavery, when black people were not allowed to marry each other. To have an ethno-centric view in a multi-racial society is very damaging.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-18_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I in no may meant to offend the noble Baroness or to make an ethno-centric point. I am not an expert in these matters and I can only use the ONS statistics. The vulnerability of such children who are available for adoption calls on us all to look positively for a placement that knowingly reduces the risk of future insecurity. The statistics provided by my noble friend Lord Howe, from the ONS report, bear that out.
<P>

<a name="20711-18_para0"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Gould of Potternewton, rightly referred to cohabiting couples who tend to get married after two years. There should not be a problem with adopting children if they eventually make a commitment to marry.
<P>

<a name="20711-18_para1"></a>I am enormously grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Russell, for what he said about my noble friend Lady Young. We all wish to be associated with his wishes. I know that she is making some progress, but is still too weak to attend this Committee. Reference was made to my noble friend on the subject of removing barriers. One of the good things about the Bill is that it should go a long way to removing barriers to adoption. That will receive universal support around the House. However, my noble friend was referring not only to the bureaucratic barriers mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Gould, but to philosophical and prejudicial barriers and even to politically correct attitudes. The Minister rightly said on Second Reading that there are many married couples who would like to adopt children but the system stands in their way. Some 90 per cent of applicants are put off or rejected after inquiring. The Prime Minister's review found that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"As a general rule-of-thumb, 1-in-10 of initial enquiries would result in an approved adopter."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20711-18_para2"></a>So, a great many suitable people are lost in the process.
<P>

<a name="20711-18_para3"></a>The Prime Minister's review noted that responses to enquiries were "unfriendly, unsupportive or even insensitive". Vast numbers of married couples are being turned away on frivolous grounds; they are, for example, too rich, too fat, too tidy, too conventional, have too many books or go to church too often. As my noble friend Lord Astor of Hever said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Many married couples would like to adopt. The problem is the delays that occur between each stage of the system. Worse still are the manifestly unjust and irrelevant recommendations on adopters' lifestyles that have been identified by the Government's Performance and Innovation Unit."&#151;[Official Report, 10/06/02; col.73.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20711-18_para4"></a>This Bill will go a very long way towards resolving some of that.
<P>

<a name="20711-18_para5"></a>Those who support adoption by two parents&#151;whether married, unmarried, heterosexual and/or same-sex couples&#151;raise a number of issues. A married couple will have made a legal commitment to each other as well as to the child or the children that they adopt. Unmarried couples, heterosexual or same sex, will not even have made a legal commitment to each other. As I said earlier in response to the noble <P>


<a name="column_GC240"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC240</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Baroness, Lady Gould, if they make a legal commitment, heterosexual couples have no fear; they will be free to adopt. However, why should anyone expect them to have a stable and permanent commitment to the child?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-18_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   Does the noble Baroness understand that some people may refrain from marriage simply because people are attempting to compel them to make a legal commitment?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-18_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Nobody is compelling them to make a legal commitment. However, in the interests of the child, we have a duty to follow the record of statistics&#151;which I shall repeat in a moment&#151;that couples who make a commitment to marriage offer a child greater stability and security. At the end of the day, that has to be our concern.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-18_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Gould of Potternewton: </B>   The noble Baroness said that if the couple are married, they can adopt; but they cannot adopt just like that. They have to undergo the same rigid criteria as everyone else. We must get away from the idea that anybody can adopt just because they are married.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-18_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I absolutely agree. It does not pre-empt or say that just because they are married, they are suitable people. There is a rigorous process which I absolutely support. However, because of this amendment, we are talking about whether people seeking to adopt should be married or unmarried and whether we should discount, for the purposes of adoption, same-sex couples.
<P>

<a name="20711-18_para6"></a>In their survey of seven years in the lives of British families, Berthould and Gerhsuny concluded in the British Household Panel Survey that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"children born to cohabiting parents are much more likely to see their parents split up and much more likely to experience a period in a one-parent family, than children born within marriage".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20711-18_para7"></a>That is yet another survey. It goes on to make the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Gould, on the issue of parents going on to marry. If they do, however, it is not a problem as long as they are suitable people to adopt.
<P>

<a name="20711-18_para8"></a>The statistics used by my noble friend Lord Howe should be repeated. After five years following the birth of a child, 52 per cent of couples who were cohabiting but never married had split up; 25 per cent who were cohabiting but later married had split up; but only 8 per cent of couples who married after five years had split up. The statistics speak for themselves.
<P>

<a name="20711-18_para9"></a>I should also refer to the anomaly in Clause 139 where it refers to married couples. The clause provides that the two adult adopters, other than a married couple, must not be related to each other. This gives rise to the following example. A brother and a sister cannot adopt, but the brother living with a gay lover could adopt. Two sisters could not adopt under the Bill, but the sister living with a lesbian lover could adopt. A mother and a daughter who have shared a house for 20 years cannot adopt, but two women living next door who happen to be lesbian lovers could adopt. Is that really what we expect from the Bill?

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20711-18_para10"></a>At the end of the day a placement should offer as far as possible long-term stability and security and, given all the evidence that we have from the Office for National Statistics in its survey of married and cohabiting couples with children, we know that a married couple offer the best possible chance of long-term stability and security. I support my noble friend Lord Howe.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-18_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Alli: </B>   Before the noble Baroness sits down, perhaps I may ask her a question. I approve of marriage, but I believe that it is destructive in the context of this debate to try to compete between married and unmarried couples and gay couples. Essentially, we have all agreed that this debate is about the welfare of children. What does the noble Baroness say to the point made by the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun of Abernethy, that we have a shortage of people who want to adopt and that living in institutional care can be the most horrific experience for children? Is she saying that she would never give an unmarried couple or a gay couple the opportunity to help a child in institutional care when there was no other couple available? Is that what the noble Baroness is saying?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-18_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   One can believe whatever one wants to believe, but I simply do not believe that there is a dearth of married couples who wish to adopt. I simply do not believe that. We have already given a number of examples&#151;I gave them in my speech just now and others have given them, and the record book is littered with them&#151;of good, suitable, married people who wish to adopt but who find that they are thwarted by the system. It is my view, and I support it&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-18_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </B>   Every time this point has been raised I have tried to tackle the issue. The Government have looked at the matter and a number of other people have looked at it. There is a huge amount of mythology but very little fact as regards people in a range of situations&#151;fat, thin, smokers, non-smokers&#151;who have been found unsuitable to be adoptive parents. Good assessment involves looking at quite different issues. It is a great pity that social workers are again blamed for making inappropriate assessments. They are sometimes faced with certain pressures within local panels, often in relation to the placement of black children. However, that matter has been tackled recently. I need to make the point yet again that it is erroneous to suggest that all these examples are valid when the evidence that I have shows that they are not.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-18_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I can only speak from experience. I have two very good friends who, after two and a half years of consideration, were deemed to be too old at 45 to adopt a child. Their children had passed through their teenage years and they were considered too old to adopt a child. That child had already been with foster parents, then with this family and then it was shunted on to foster parents yet again. I am sorry but I do not regard that as an acceptable experience for that child.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20711-18_para11"></a>I return to the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Alli, many of which I agree with. I believe that institutional care is something that we should do what we can to avoid. However, I do not believe that there is a dearth of married couples who wish to adopt. I believe that the Bill will go a long way to remove some of the barriers to suitable adoptive parents being able to adopt. I am simply referring to statistics. If we knowingly place a child in a situation where the risks of family break-up, instability or insecurity are much greater, it is not responsible to go down that road. I believe that it is better, as far as is possible, to place a child where there is the greatest chance of stability and security.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-19_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   I hesitate to come in at this point. We discussed the importance of marriage for children at great length two or three years ago. At that time I looked to see what might be learned from experience abroad. I noted that in one of the Scandinavian countries the incidence of unmarried couples separating was far lower than in our country. That suggests to me that in countries which support families better there is less break-down in families, whether the parents are married or unmarried.
<P>

<a name="20711-19_para0"></a>It seems very clear from the figures that marriage is an important resilience factor. It is not surprising that a couple who are prepared to make a legal commitment to one another will often offer a longer term and more stable relationship. As I say, marriage is an important resilience factor but it is not the only factor; there are other considerations to be borne in mind.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-19_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Gibson of Market Rasen: </B>   I want to begin by saying that I respect the commitment of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, with regard to supporting adoption. I would certainly never accuse him of any kind of duplicity in this matter. I know that he has spoken sincerely. However, on this occasion I cannot agree with him.
<P>

<a name="20711-19_para1"></a>I want to bring in a slightly different point which I think is important in the context of this debate. I hope that others will agree. I am not going to quote surveys or statistics. I want to concentrate on what actually happens when an adoption is occurring. It has already been said that no one has a right to adopt, nor should they have. We have talked of the couples involved in adoption, married or unmarried, and we have talked of family. Here I want to say that a family is comprised of more than just the couple involved. I want to share with the Committee&#151;as I did at Second Reading&#151;my and my husband's experiences when our daughter and her husband adopted a child.
<P>

<a name="20711-19_para2"></a>I am pleased to say that we jumped through all the hurdles. Of course, my daughter and her husband were rigorously questioned, as they should be. They wanted to be parents and they wanted to look after a little human being. It is right that questions are asked. However, it is not just the couples themselves who are questioned but also some other members of the family. That included me, my current husband and my ex-husband. My ex-husband and I divorced when my <P>

<a name="20711-19_para3"></a>I do not believe that we have talked about this matter before in this context. However, if we are talking about families and family support, it is important to share that experience with the Committee to show that it is not just the couple themselves who are questioned and have letters written to them by the adoption authorities but rather the family as a whole. I believe that the key to the whole of this issue is the word "family". Children should have the opportunity to grow up as part of a loving family. I refer not just to the adoptive parents but to the wider family. I understand the concerns in this area but I repeat that adoptions are not entered into lightly. Many years passed before my daughter and her husband decided to adopt. As I say, adoption is not entered into lightly. Those who seek to adopt are closely scrutinised by those whose responsibility it is to assess whether or not they are suitable to undertake that. Great care is taken in these matters, as it should be.
<P>

<a name="20711-19_para4"></a>I make these points because I am sure that, just as married couples or a single person who seek to adopt are rigorously assessed, single-sex couples and their families would also be rigorously assessed. I believe that all children should have a loving family unit. That is why I cannot support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   Nearly all the points have been made today in a quite remarkable series of speeches. We have a clear division of opinion in the Committee. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, made his case in a forensic and balanced way although the temperature rose later in the debate. I characterise his approach as the risk management approach. That is appropriate for matters such as airline safety or financial services regulation but it tars all those in a particular category with the same brush. That is how I see him categorising all those unmarried couples because, statistically, they are eliminated from the potential pool of adoption. The same applies to gay couples. Although the statistics are by no means particularly well grounded, as some Members of the Committee have pointed out, they are, nevertheless, all tarred with the same brush on the grounds of risk management because of the possibility&#151;not probability&#151;that certain relationships will not survive for longer than a certain period of time. That is why they are eliminated from the pool of those couples appropriate to be even considered as suitable adopters.
<P>

<a name="20711-19_para5"></a>The second approach, which I make no bones about, is the balance of benefit approach. We are talking about whether individual children can benefit. We must set this against what I regard as being the rather pseudo-statistical approach that is being used, not only by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, but also by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch. There will be an argument between us as to whether there really is a pool of unmarried couples and gay couples ready to take on the responsibilities of adoptive parents; or <P>


<a name="column_GC244"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC244</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>whether, as a result of the more enlightened proposals in the current legislation, married couples will come forward in great numbers.
<P>

<a name="20711-19_para6"></a>However, that is not the point: the point is that these older children who are in care desperately need to be brought into adoptive families. Quite frankly, I do not want an experimental period where we have only married couples for a period of years, while we wait and see whether or not the pool comes forward. Quite honestly, I want to give those children the best possible chance from the day that this legislation is passed.
<P>

<a name="20711-19_para7"></a>A number of points have been made during the debate. I shall not trade with the noble Earl, Lord Howe, on all the issues that he raised. However, he made an interesting point on the property issue. He said that, except in the case of the house, there is no proper arrangement for resolving property issues for children. However, the house is most people's main asset. Most people do not have stocks and shares, and all sorts of other assets. Therefore, the issue of the house as between unmarried couples&#151;and, indeed, as between gay couples&#151;can be resolved, provided that one of them has, or both of them have, beneficial ownership.
<P>

<a name="20711-19_para8"></a>I fail to see the logic for using the property argument in these circumstances as an argument for saying that it is preferable for children to be adopted by one person, as opposed to an unmarried couple. Again, I fail to see the argument in life, but I certainly fail to see the argument even more when it comes to incapacity or death. Indeed, that point was made most powerfully by the noble Baroness, Lady Gould.
<P>

<a name="20711-19_para9"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, referred to the evidence of problems in the playground. I do not know on what basis he put that forward. Similarly, I do not know where the evidence comes from. It seemed to me to be some kind of cultural issue that the noble Earl was positing. To use another term, we have something of the Heisenberg effect here. Obviously, observed behaviour will change over time. If we believe that it is right for unmarried couples and gay couples to be able to adopt, we should try to ensure that society recognises that fact. After all, we do not want young children running around playgrounds talking about nutters, loonies, and so on, in mental health terms, no more than we want people talking about gay people and unmarried couples in derogatory terms. We have a responsibility to make sure that we have the right culture in our playgrounds. We certainly do not use that as an excuse, or an argument, for not allowing adoption by unmarried or gay couples.
<P>

<a name="20711-19_para10"></a>Nowadays, the culture on surnames has entirely changed. In her inimitable way, the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, made the case in a very aristocratic way. After all, my father had a different surname from my grandfather. My grandfather doubled the barrel of my father's surname. So, there we are, we all have family secrets that we can reveal in Committee between these four walls. I do not believe that my father felt any stigma in probably one of the toughest public schools in the country where Dr Arnold was rife in the 19th century. I do not think that it did him any harm. So that is certainly not an argument either.

<P>

<a name="20711-19_para11"></a>All this is about suitability. The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, in his humane way, put his finger on the point in the previous debate&#151;it is about suitability. If we have arguments, let them be about suitability. Put "suitability" in either secondary or primary legislation, or in guidance, or in the assessment procedure which the Minister talked about at our previous sitting. Then we can really see what we are talking about. However, we should be utterly frank about this. Mr Andrew Lansley, in the Commons, put it rather well. He said that it is wrong of those who support marriage to use the adoption of children as bait.
<P>

<a name="20711-19_para12"></a>We should not be penalising those who do not wish to marry. If they do not wish to become married, that does not, ipso facto, eliminate them from the pool of those wishing to adopt. At least that is the argument on these Benches. It is highly circular to say that unmarried couples have not made a legal commitment to each other and are therefore unsuitable. That is begging the question of this debate. I very much hope that, on Report, we will make it utterly clear that the wording of the current provision is as we want it.

<P>
<A NAME="20711-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Adebowale: </B>   I hesitate to add to the eloquent contributions to this debate. For me, the argument was made very clear by the noble Earl, Lord Russell.
<P>

<a name="20711-19_para13"></a>In supporting the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, I should say that&#151;having sat and listened to those who supported the amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Howe&#151;I find the use of statistics truly worrying. Earlier, the risk management approach very ably described. On that basis, and using statistics from the Office for National Statistics, I believe that it is very likely that social workers would not allow poor people to adopt. On the basis of the statistics on marriage and sustained partnerships among poor people, poor people would not be allowed to adopt.
<P>

<a name="20711-19_para14"></a>Let us also take the statistics on certain geographical areas of the country, where marriage fails more often than not because of poverty. Those people also would not be allowed to adopt. Let us consider certain professions. I am the chief executive of a charity. However, I am not sure that chief executives of charities have a brilliant track record on marital relations. So we would not be allowed to adopt either.
<P>

<a name="20711-19_para15"></a>I think that we are on a slippery slope if we take such a general, blanket approach to statistics in arguing a case. In some ways it hides a deeper and&#151;with all due respect to the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and his supporters&#151;somewhat sinister approach to this debate. We all agree&#151;no one has disagreed&#151;that this Bill is all about providing stable, loving, supportive families for children. That is not a problem. However, those who supported the noble Earl's amendments seem to have rushed over some unintended consequences.
<P>

<a name="20711-19_para16"></a>Two points in this debate have been rushed over. The first was the idea that some of the remarks made by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, were ethno-centric. Although I accept that they were not intended <P>


<a name="column_GC246"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC246</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to be ethno-centric, they were ethno-centric. If the amendment is passed, those remarks will not only remain ethno-centric; they will be enshrined in law. Similarly, I accept that the remarks of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, were not intended in any way&#151;as he himself said&#151;to denigrate those who are homosexual or homosexual couples. Unfortunately, there is an unintended consequence. If the amendment is passed, those people will be denigrated.
<P>

<a name="20711-19_para17"></a>As the noble Earl, Lord Russell, aptly said, the amendment connects the issue of homosexual couples and their status as stable relationships with the bullying of children in schools. I was brought up in Wakefield and, as a black pupil in a predominantly white school, was bullied at school. The argument, therefore, could be used against allowing black couples to adopt, as their children may well be the object of bullying.
<P>

<a name="20711-19_para18"></a>The arguments in favour of the amendment are weak. They have not dealt with the issue of unintended consequences. I can understand that some members of the public would like to live in a world where everyone was the same and everyone agreed that there was only one way of living. Although they think that such a world would be wonderfully smooth and acceptable for everyone, that is not the reality. If we do not accept the reality, we shall create a situation for children&#151;I have seen it too often&#151;in which their lives are blighted by the opinions of people whom they have never met. That is absolutely unacceptable. It is outrageous and inhumane.

<A NAME="20711-20_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   Having seen so many young people become involved in crime after having been brought up in care, I feel that such outcomes might not happen if those young people had had the love and support of a home they could call their own. Sometimes the birth parent or parents do not want to place them for adoption. I ask the Committee what we can do about that. It is a very big problem. I am sure that I am right in saying that older and disabled children are the more difficult children to place. Can the Minister tell us the numbers of children currently awaiting adoption?
<P>

<a name="20711-20_para0"></a>I should add that I have two names&#151;it is all very complicated&#151;and that our two adopted children had yet another name. That caused no problem at all&#151;it was just one of those things. But it is terribly important to have a home to call one's own.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-20_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </B>  This has been a quite remarkable and high-quality debate. I pay tribute to all noble Lords who have spoken. I join other noble Lords in saying how sorry I am that the noble Baroness, Lady Young, is not able to join us, and how much we look forward to her resuming her place when we come back to this issue at Report stage.
<P>

<a name="20711-20_para1"></a>We touch on a very sensitive matter on which each noble Lord will reach their own judgment. It is undoubtedly clear that our discussion this afternoon can only help in enabling noble Lords to make that <P>


<a name="column_GC247"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC247</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>judgment. Although this issue of unmarried couples is important, I should like to place it in its proper context. We are now in our fifth day of Committee. What has united all noble Lords who have spoken in those sittings is the determination to see a much enhanced adoption service put in place. The noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, put that point very well indeed.
<P>

<a name="20711-20_para2"></a>We know that outcomes have not been good for children in care compared with children who have not been looked after by local authorities. Looked-after children have poor chances of leading successful settled lives when they leave the care system, and we know that adoption can provide a new start in life for many children. All too often adoption has been seen as a last resort for those children when it should have been considered as the first resort.
<P>

<a name="20711-20_para3"></a>Too often the adoption system has let children down. I readily acknowledge that council performance is too varied. In some councils, 10 per cent of looked-after children are adopted; in others, the figure is less than 2 per cent. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, that, overall, the system, including the courts, can be slow, cumbersome and unfair. The average time taken to adopt a looked after child is two years and nine months&#151;an eternity in a child's eyes. That is why we have to change it and that is why we are all so hopeful that the passage of the Bill will lead to a dramatic change in the lives of so many young people.
<P>

<a name="20711-20_para4"></a>It is therefore important that we place this question of unmarried couples in its appropriate context, considering current practice. At the moment only married couples may adopt children jointly. Single people may adopt as individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation. That is the position under the Adoption Act 1976. Adoption by single people was accepted practice under the previous Government as much as under the present one.
<P>

<a name="20711-20_para5"></a>Some of those single people who adopt will be in a long-term, stable relationship, whether heterosexual or homosexual. If a person in such a relationship applies to adopt, the couple are currently assessed jointly. However, only one person may adopt the child. The other person may seek a residence order, but while the holder of a residence order may exercise parental responsibility, he or she does not become the child's legal parent.
<P>

<a name="20711-20_para6"></a>An interesting question was asked about how many children are currently adopted by unmarried couples. The simple answer, as with many questions in relation to statistics, is that we do not know because such adoptions are currently recorded as adoptions by single people. The BAAF adoption statistics project, which I am informed is a robust statistic analysis, found that 95 per cent of local authority adoptions in 1998&#150;99 were by married couples. We do now know how many of the remaining 5 per cent of adopters were living on their own or as part of an unmarried couple, but we know that 43 per cent of single adopters who adopted during 1998&#150;99 were already fostering the children, as opposed to only 11 per cent of the couples.
<P>

<a name="20711-20_para7"></a>Noble Lords will be aware that a free vote, at least on the Government side, on a Back-Bench amendment to allow unmarried couples, whether of the same sex or <P>


<a name="column_GC248"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC248</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the opposite sex, to apply to adopt children jointly was held on Report in another place on 16th May. Members of Parliament from all sides voted in favour of the change. What were the reasons for that? I suggest that it is based on experience of adoption practice over many years. It is essential that the adoption placement reflects the child's needs and best interests. Let me give an example in which the amendments made to the Bill in another place would surely come into play in the child's best interest. If a child has been cared for by an unmarried couple&#151;for example, in a foster placement&#151;it may be in the best interests of that child to remain with that couple permanently. However, under the current legal framework only one person may adopt the child in such circumstances.
<P>

<a name="20711-20_para8"></a>Our first objective surely is to improve security for the adopted child. I have already stated that if an unmarried couple applies to adopt, they are assessed as a couple, yet only one person may adopt the child. Arguably this denies the child the permanence and security of having two legal parents.
<P>

<a name="20711-20_para9"></a>The Government's second objective is to increase the number of vulnerable children who have the opportunity, through adoption, to grow up as part of a loving, stable and permanent family.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-20_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   Perhaps I may ask the Minister a question for clarification. If a consent form needs to be signed, say, for a child to have an operation, is it only the legal adopter who can sign it? If that person is absent, can the operation not take place?
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-20_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   Yes, except that, if there is a residence order, the person who is party to the residence order also has parental responsibilities. However, residence orders are often time-limited and they certainly do not provide the stability of that person being regarded as a parent, although he or she may have parental responsibilities for a set time.
<P>

<a name="20711-20_para10"></a>A large range of evidence was given in support of the change in Standing Committee in another place. In a letter to all MPs on 12th March, the British Agency for Adoption and Fostering said that the amendment would improve the life chances of more children by widening the pool of potential adoptive parents and by enabling those children who are placed with unmarried couples to enjoy the security of a permanent legal relationship with both parents rather than with only one of them. The letter from BAAF to MPs was signed by many organisations, including the Law Society and the Family Law Bar Association.
<P>

<a name="20711-20_para11"></a>My department has also received correspondence from children expressing views about joint adoption by unmarried couples. One letter was sent by a child living with her natural parent and the natural parent's same-sex partner. This child was concerned that, should anything happen to her natural parent, she did not have the security of a legal relationship with her parent's partner and she might not be able to continue living with her.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20711-20_para12"></a>It is noticeable that the wording of the amendment tabled in another place introduced a tailor-made definition of "couple", which would apply for the purposes of this Bill only. By avoiding terms such as "cohabiting" or "living as husband and wife", the new definition avoided any confusion with the position in existing legislation. This definition does not attempt to define the legal relationship between the two adults and therefore does not encroach on or pre-empt the wider work on civil partnerships being carried out across government. The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, and the noble Earl, Lord Russell, are quite right to refer to the Private Member's Bill of the noble Lord, Lord Lester, which has been debated in your Lordships' House. In a sense, part of the answer to the issues on inheritance raised by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, must rest in this wider work that is currently taking place across government.
<P>

<a name="20711-20_para13"></a>Noble Lords have understandably raised questions about how certain we can be that only those who are suitable to adopt should be allowed to do so. The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, particularly focused on suitability. As I said on other important amendments last week, nobody has a right to adopt. That is the position under existing legislation and under the Bill. It is the job of adoption agencies and the courts to decide whether a couple is suitable to adopt.
<P>

<a name="20711-20_para14"></a>We debated last week how such a decision would be made. I do not want to repeat everything I said, but it bears reiterating that for any couple to become adoptive parents they need to prove not only that they can provide a loving a stable family relationship for a child, but that their own relationship is sound and likely to be lasting.
<P>

<a name="20711-20_para15"></a>We have given a clear commitment to make regulations under Clause 44 to require adoption agencies to consider the stability and permanence of the relationship between a couple, whether they are married or unmarried, as part of the adopter assessment process. I said in Committee last Thursday that I would consider sympathetically whether the regulations should be considered under the affirmative procedure. We are undertaking a review to consider the range of criteria used for the assessment of potential adopters and the consistency of their application across the country.

Clearly, the robustness of the adopter assessment process is a critical factor in ensuring that we have a robust system in place. As I explained last week, a home study over several months is part of the current adopter assessment process. A designated social <P>


<a name="column_GC250"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC250</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>worker visits the prospective adopters at home to establish a detailed view of them, as well as any family members and other people living in their home.
<P>

<a name="20711-21_para1"></a>In addition, adoption agencies ask for confidential personal references about prospective adopters and personal referees are usually asked to comment on all aspects of the relationship between the prospective adopters, including the amount of time they spend together and the leisure and recreational activities they share.
<P>

<a name="20711-21_para2"></a>The feedback we receive from those who have gone through the process is that it is pretty tough and rigorous and sometimes people feel it can be over-intrusive. The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, spoke about delays in the system. There are some delays that we need to eradicate. However, it is also a product of the fact that the system is very vigorous, robust and detailed in assessing whether people are suitable for adoption.
<P>

<a name="20711-21_para3"></a>We need to bear that in mind when we come to the issue of the outcomes for children of unmarried parents in comparison with those of married parents. Surely this must be seen in the context of the increase in the number of cohabiting couples in our society. In 1986, they accounted for 5 per cent of families. By 1998, that had risen to 14 per cent. In 2000, around 40 per cent of births were outside marriage, compared with 30 per cent in 1990.
<P>

<a name="20711-21_para4"></a>Some noble Lords have suggested that marriage should be accorded a special status among all the other important and valuable relationships that exist. From that, it is argued that placement with a married couple should, therefore, be the first choice of adoptive placement.
<P>

<a name="20711-21_para5"></a>The Government's position on marriage is quite clear. The Government support the institution of marriage. They recognise that marriage is a sure foundation for raising children, and remains the choice of the majority of people living in our country. However, we also recognise that not all children are born to parents who are married, and that many unmarried couples have stable relationships in which children are brought up exceedingly well.
<P>

<a name="20711-21_para6"></a>The Fostering Network put it right when it wrote to all noble Lords, saying:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Family life in Britain has changed dramatically since the last adoption legislation was produced and current legislation will probably be in place for at least another 25 years. More people will live in a relationship which is not confirmed by marriage and yet has all the components of it in terms of commitment to one another and the capacity to provide a home for children in need . . . The foster care service has provided a model. Unmarried couples and gay and lesbian carers have given children excellent care often for many years, until adulthood. These children have benefited from the love and care provided, and the security of the relationship. Many of the placements have been made of children with special needs who may not otherwise have benefited from family care had there been a need to wait for the perfect married couple to come forward."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20711-21_para7"></a>Surely that was the substance of the remarks made by the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas.
<P>

<a name="20711-21_para8"></a>When it comes to making individual judgments about a couple who have applied for adoption, the critical issue is how suitable that couple are to take on <P>


<a name="column_GC251"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC251</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>parental responsibilities. Our starting point in considering this suggestion is that the adoptive placement of choice should reflect the needs and best interests of the child. In relation to unmarried couples, the noble Earl, Lord Howe, asked whether Clause 1 could really be said to apply. I say that it does.
<P>

<a name="20711-21_para9"></a>Established adoption agency practice shows that it can be in the best interests of some children to be placed with single adopters. Indeed, research has shown that girls who have been abused do particularly well when placed with single women. As I mentioned earlier, in some cases it may be in the best interests of the child to be adopted by an unmarried couple; for example, where a child is already being cared for by an unmarried couple, such as unmarried foster parents. Again, perhaps I may quote from the Fostering Network, which says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"From our experience of supporting a growing number of same sex couples we have noted a trend that suggests that these couples are more prepared to adopt 'harder to place' children and more open to support to make these placements work. This openness to support results in more successful placements for these children."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20711-21_para10"></a>We have discussed married life, and the importance of marriage as an institution. But let us be honest: some marriages may not provide a suitable environment in which to bring up children, just as some unmarried couples can be successful in providing a loving and stable family environment. That is why the adopter assessment process is important in ensuring that only those who are able to provide a secure home for a child are approved as prospective adopters.
<P>

<a name="20711-21_para11"></a>This is not a debate about the reasons why unmarried couples are unable to marry, or chose not to do so; it is a debate about increasing the number of vulnerable children who have the opportunity to grow up as part of a stable, loving and permanent family. It is the adopter assessment process, and, ultimately, the courts that will decide whether a couple are suitable to adopt. That process will provide the necessary safeguards in order to protect the child.
<P>

<a name="20711-21_para12"></a>Throughout my response I have laid a great deal of stress on the robustness of the adoption process. I know from comments that have been made today, particularly by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, and by other noble Lords during the passage of the Bill, that there is concern about current patchy provision of adoption support services. That is why Clause 3 places a new clear duty on local authorities to make arrangements to provide adoption support services.
<P>

<a name="20711-21_para13"></a>In relation to adoption services generally, I have already given a commitment to noble Lords that we will have a comprehensive performance assessment system for social services, which includes both in-year and end-year monitoring, including performance in relation to adoption. We have already agreed that from April 2003 voluntary adoption agencies will be inspected and registered by the National Care Standards Commission. Local authority adoption services will also be inspected by the commission. We can always intervene if a local authority fails to perform its functions adequately.

<a name="20711-21_para14"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, also mentioned political correctness. Although allegations have been made about political correctness and blanket bans, the PIU report found no evidence that such blanket bans exist. However, there is a perception in certain areas of the media that they do. Sometimes that is based on a misunderstanding of agency practice. For example, in placing a very young baby agencies would need to consider the age of the adoptive applicants with a view to them being able to cope with a child as it grew up. As I said on Second Reading, the figures for 1999 show that the average age for adoption couples was 37 years and eight months, that the average age for single adopters was 40 years and four months, and the maximum age in the sample was of a person of 59 years and one month. The Cabinet Office PIU report said that there was no evidence of blanket bans, although there is certainly a perception that they exist.
<P>

<a name="20711-21_para15"></a>I shall not deny that there have not been examples of thoroughly bad practice or insensitive approaches. I go back to the adopter assessment issues. I know that sometimes prospective adoptive parents have been concerned about the way they have been questioned, often because it is not explained to them why certain questions, which may be regarded as intrusive, are being asked. I do not deny that we need to do much to improve the performance of those social workers, but I never seek to knock social workers in general. It is all too easy to do.
<P>

<a name="20711-21_para16"></a>When one thinks about the awesome decisions that fairly junior staff in social service departments have to make, who of us would ignore the fact that those decisions are very hard? I would not defend bad practice among social workers, but I recognise that many of them work tremendously hard under great strain and do their very best. Of course we want them to do better. That is why we set up the General Social Care Council to make the profession of social work much better supported. We have extended the training period for social workers. I am confident that, with the development of an adoption service, with the clear standards we are laying down, with inspection by the National Care Standards Commission, with the work that we are doing to improve and boost the status of social workers and their professional qualifications, we will be able to ensure that the adoption assessment process will work effectively, and that, as far as you can ever be certain about a couple when it comes to couples being assessed, that as much care as possible will be taken to assess those couples.
<P>

<a name="20711-21_para17"></a>At the end of the day, we will all make our own individual decisions on this matter. I believe that the case is very strong to accept the Bill as it now stands. The fact is that at the moment it is perfectly legal for adoption to be undertaken by single people who none the less are in stable relationships, whether of an opposite-sex nature or a same-sex nature. It is also clear that where such a single person is in such a relationship the adopter assessment process will assess both people in that relationship, even though only one person can adopt. The logic of that argument is clear. We would provide greater stability for an adopted child in those circumstances by allowing both of the <P>


<a name="column_GC253"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC253</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>parties to that couple to adopt. I am absolutely convinced that as a consequence we shall enable more young people to be adopted&#151;often young people who in the current circumstances find it very difficult to find suitable adoptive parents. Of course we will debate this matter again on Report.

<P>
<A NAME="20711-21_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   May I ask a question on that point? What is the score roughly? How many children are in care waiting for adoption? The information was not clear. How many prospective adopters, be they single or joint, are now wanting to adopt children? I am trying to get the size of the problem and I could not pick it up from the debate. I do not seek an answer now.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I can answer the first point raised by the noble Lord. The latest figures I have are from March 1999, when almost 3,000 adoptive placements were made. However, at the same time there were nearly 2,500 children waiting to be adopted with no adoptive family having been identified. I do not think that we have the statistics available with regard to the second point, but I will see if we do and will write to the noble Lord.
<P>

<a name="20711-22_para0"></a>I do not think that there is anything more I need to say. Clearly we will make up our own minds. I conclude by paying tribute once again to all Members of the Committee who have spoken in what has been a splendid debate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-22_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   I begin by echoing the Minister's final words; I agree that this has been an excellent debate. I do not intend to draw out our proceedings today, particularly as he indicated that we cannot bring the matter to a final conclusion today in the nature of the rules of Grand Committee. I hope that the Committee will forgive me if I do not address every single point that has been raised.
<P>

<a name="20711-22_para1"></a>I said earlier, and I repeat now, that I understand and respect the arguments on the other side. The slightly sad part for me is that, with the notable exception of the Minister, I have not heard much from those who have attacked me to demonstrate that the same applies in reverse. I have been called various things today&#151;sinister, ethnocentric and inhumane. I shall, of course, reflect on those words. To the extent that my position is regarded as out of line with mainstream opinion, I would ask the Grand Committee to reflect on the following fact. The majority of European countries allow adoption only by married couples. Some countries, it is true, have legal partnership schemes but these specifically exclude joint adoption. Until recently the Government were of the same opinion as that which I was trying to advance earlier today. So I hope we can avoid too much talk that might suggest to those reading Hansard that I had taken up some kind of freakish position.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-22_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Gould of Potternewton: </B>   I am sorry to interrupt but one or two Members of the Committee who spoke, including myself, recognised the noble <P>


<a name="column_GC254"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC254</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Earl's sincerity. I believe that he should correct the implication that, somehow or other, we all spoke as he implied.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-22_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   I readily concede that and I am grateful to the noble Baroness. The point I was seeking to make was that I did not hear much in the way of accepting some of the points I was making. In fact, I do not believe that any of the points I made were accepted. I concede that my own sincerity was not in question and for that I am grateful.
<P>

<a name="20711-22_para2"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Gould, picked me up on what I said about the bureaucratic barriers in the adoption process. She questioned the significance of those barriers and said that reducing them might have only a marginal effect on the number of adoptions. I would point out to her, however, that in the Prime Minister's review there was a finding that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"As a general rule of thumb, one in 10 of initial inquiries would result in an approved adopter".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20711-22_para3"></a>That statement suggests to me that there are many people who are willing to adopt&#151;though not all of them may be suitable&#151;who are somehow put off during the process.
<P>

<a name="20711-22_para4"></a>In the White Paper on adoption it is noticeable that there were no proposals to change the eligibility grounds for adoption. The White Paper listed the 10 most serious problems with children's services and adoption but a shortage of married couples to adopt was not even on the list. Again, therefore, I question those who say that we need to widen the pool for the reasons that the noble Baroness indicated.
<P>

<a name="20711-22_para5"></a>The noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, stated her view that adoption by an unmarried couple or a homosexual couple was not the optimum solution but, that nevertheless, she would be prepared to entertain it as an option. I note that she is not in her place but I make the point that, if the Bill is not amended back to its original state, there will be one obvious consequence: the law will not distinguish between types of union for the purposes of adoption. All types of union will be considered equally valid.
<P>

<a name="20711-22_para6"></a>From that will develop an approach to applicants wishing to become adopters based on those coming forward, rather than on the needs of the child. Supposing 30 couples needed to be assessed and let us suppose that 10 of those are unmarried and 20 are married. As all of those couples are seen to be equally valid, this may lead to the 10 unmarried couples being assessed alongside only 10 married couples, leaving the other 10 married couples to wait. That will lead to a disproportionate number of unmarried couples being assessed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-22_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Alli: </B>   I do not understand the point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-22_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   The point is that married couples who, as the Minister said, are, generally speaking, in the majority among those who are coming forward to apply for adoption, may, nevertheless, be sidelined because it will be the legal duty of the adoption agency to consider all types of couple as equal for the purposes of assessment. Resources are limited and it may be that <P>


<a name="column_GC255"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC255</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>they choose, therefore, to treat equally a group of 10 unmarried couples and a group of 10 married couples. That will skew what would otherwise be a bias in favour of married couples. That is my point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-22_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Alli: </B>   I believe that I understand. If the resources available only allowed a certain number and there were 30 couples, 20 of whom were married and 10 of whom were same sex or unmarried couples, the noble Earl is suggesting that that would disadvantage the married couples.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-22_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   It is a very simple point that concerns me in the context of Clause 1. The noble Earl, Lord Russell, added to the brickbats hurled in my direction when he accused me of having an unanalytical mind. If that is so, I have to live with it. However, what I do not have is a prejudiced mind. Some of my best friends are unmarried couples. I have good friends who are gay and live together. The issue of whether certain lifestyles are intrinsically more or less worthy than others is an issue for another day. It is not the territory that I am on, or feel the need to be on. The issue that should occupy us throughout the debate is what is best for children. We are all agreed on that; we just do not agree on how to get there.
<P>

<a name="20711-22_para7"></a>As I have said, unmarried and gay people can already legally adopt a child. Therefore, those who believe that only married couples and lone individuals should be allowed to adopt a child cannot be accused of wanting to exclude unmarried or gay people from the adoption pool. I certainly do not wish to exclude such people.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-22_spnew8"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I accept the logic of what the noble Earl says; namely, that this cannot be intended to exclude unmarried or gay people from the pool. However, is it meant to exclude couples from the pool? That is the obvious logic of what the noble Earl is saying.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-22_spnew9"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   Of course, but I do not want to rehearse the arguments that I went through earlier. I do not want to take up the Committee's time unnecessarily. That is indeed my position.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-22_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   I am sorry to interrupt the noble Earl again, but I have reflected on his earlier point about the approach that could be adopted by an adoption agency. The more I think about it, the more extraordinary I find the point. The noble Earl was speculating on the fact that out of 30&#151;20 married couples, and 10 unmarried couples&#151; things would inevitably be balanced out by taking 10 of each. If no difference is made in the status of married or unmarried couples, and gay couples, why not use a chronological first-come, first-served approach? If resources are limited, those who apply to the adoption agency can be taken in the order in which they have applied.
<P>

<a name="20711-22_para8"></a>The noble Earl is erecting some kind of bureaucratic administrative model that is only one of many that could be adopted. It certainly does not prove his case&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-22_spnew11"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   Perhaps I may put the point more starkly. Does the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, <P>


<a name="column_GC256"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC256</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>believe that there should be no discrimination between married couples and unmarried couples when an adoption agency comes to assess? I take it from that exchange that he clearly believes that there should be no discrimination. But I wonder&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-22_spnew12"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   I thank the noble Earl for giving way. Judging by what was said earlier, it is plain to me that it is desirable&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-22_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   Could the noble Earl move closer to a microphone?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-22_spnew14"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   Yes, of course. I thank the Minister for that invitation. As regards the procedures that will be set out in regulations for determining who is to adopt, or not to adopt, a child, would it be possible for such regulations to state that married couples would be preferred and that weight is likely to be given to the fact that a couple are married when reaching a decision? Alternatively, is that possibility completely ruled out by this current debate?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-22_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   The Government would certainly rule that out. It takes us back to the earlier argument about a hierarchy of acceptable relationships. The Government's view is that each couple has to be assessed on their own merits irrespective of whether they are married or unmarried, because there are many married people who would be wholly unsuitable to adopt. That is why they need to go through the same process.
<P>

<a name="20711-22_para9"></a>The other point is the issue of 30 people applying but only a few being able to be processed at any one time. I draw the attention of the Noble Earl, Lord Howe, to Section B of the National Adoption Standards for England which talks about the clear process that needs to be gone through and the clear written time scales for each stage. He raised the point about people having to wait in the context of whether gay or unmarried couples should be treated differently from married couples. The real issue in the prospective adopter process is how to speed up the process while not losing sight of the need for rigour at every stage within it.
<P>

<a name="20711-22_para10"></a>The standard published in the National Adoption Standards is aimed at doing that, so that we can avoid forcing people to have to wait unduly. We want to make information available to whoever applies to adopt about the time scales they can expect to apply to them throughout the adopter assessment process.

<A NAME="20711-22_spnew16"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   Forgive me for being so slow in understanding this. To be quite clear, is it correct that no account will be taken of marriage as an important resilience factor in relationships? It will be one important resilience factor among many, as relationships between married couples are generally more likely to last. I know that we had this debate earlier. I should like to be quite clear that there will be a point in the process when the endurance of a <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   If the noble Earl, Lord Howe, will allow me, I shall respond to that. The general argument seems to be that there will be a more successful outcome if the couple is married, and that there should therefore be a hierarchy whereby married couples come top in every situation. I think that that is the logic of where we are going. However, it cannot be that way. There has to be an individual assessment of each couple. The issue in the assessment is the strength of that relationship, and the assessment as to whether that couple&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-23_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   Is it fair to say that it does not strengthen the relationship to say that it lasts "till death do us part" if death be by murder?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-23_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   Oh, my Lords!
<P>

<a name="20711-23_para0"></a>If a couple have been happily married, and that is apparent in the assessment process, that will of course be a strong recommendation to the adoption agency undertaking the assessment. It is strong ammunition to suggest that, among other factors, that couple will make jolly good adopter parents. However, one cannot then say that because married couples' outcomes are better overall, married couples should be given priority in every situation as against unmarried couples.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-23_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   During this debate the question that has occurred to me is whether the wishes of the birth parent will be taken into consideration. For instance, she might want a certain religion, or she might want the parents to be married. Will that be taken into consideration?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-23_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   One must be wary of allowing pre-set conditions. However, in most cases of adoption the birth parents will have given their consent. Where they have not given their consent and the final stage of an adoption order has been reached, the natural parents can ask for the leave of the court to make objections should they so wish. The Bill also describes the circumstances in which parental consent can be over-ridden in the interests of the child. However, we have to be very wary of going down the route of pre-set conditions which say that only one category of adopter parent will be admitted.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-23_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   Can we get this absolutely plain before we go any further? Marriage is relevant for the purpose of assessment. Once you are assessed, it ceases to have relevance as part of a system of gradation. Is that the situation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-23_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   I thought that the Minister had very helpfully clarified the position in answer to the noble Earl, Lord Listowel. The simple fear I expressed was that the Bill as currently drafted will lead to a disproportionate number of unmarried couples being assessed. I am ready to be shot down on that, but I <P>


<a name="column_GC258"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC258</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have not actually heard a knock-down argument that does so. Perhaps between now and Report noble Lords will provide those arguments.
<P>

<a name="20711-23_para1"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Russell, suggested that splitting up was not the ultimate evil. As a product of divorced parents myself, I am prepared to agree with him. However, he will surely concede that splitting up, though not the ultimate evil, is equally not an end devoutly to be wished. The question not answered by the noble Earl is why, with our eyes open, we should expose children to the additional risk of splitting up to which I referred earlier. My approach is the risk management approach. I make no apology for that. I do not apologise because of Clause 1. We should not be in the business of countenancing serious and significant additional risk when Clause 1 of the Bill takes us through a catalogue of considerations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-23_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   I shall, if I may, answer the question posed by the noble Earl. Why expose them to risk? If one is not prepared to be exposed to risk, ones does not marry at all.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-23_spnew8"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   If the noble Earl's argument were accepted, we would scrap Clause 1 and just accept any couple who came along. Of course, there are risks that are more important and significant than others. I was chided by the noble Lord, Lord Adebowale, about poor people. He suggested that if my argument were followed, then poor people should not be allowed to adopt. I am sure that even he would agree that, in the assessment process, the ability of a couple to support and bring up a child is important, actually. That does not mean that poor people should not be allowed to adopt, but it is a consideration in whether the child would be properly looked after.
<P>

<a name="20711-23_para2"></a>My position, therefore, can be easily rubbished in terms that amuse everybody. However, I have not heard anyone seriously attack me or repudiate my earlier arguments about risk. In reply to the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, I am certainly not saying that certain sorts of family are unsuitable for adoption. I am saying that there are clear and proven risks. Why take them? Although we can talk all we like about rigorous assessment and the stability of a relationship, rigorous assessment makes the process sound like a science.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-23_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   I should like to press the noble Earl further. Taking his risk management approach to its logical conclusion, we could decide that the divorce rate in a particular town&#151;Berkhamstead, for example&#151;was so high that the risk of placing people for adoption there with married couples was too great, so we had better exclude all adoption in Berkhamstead. Is that not the ultimate conclusion of the risk management approach?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-23_spnew10"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   Not at all. The noble Lord is falling into the trap I was indicating earlier. His argument has nothing to do with real people.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-23_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   Is that not the point of the argument here? The noble Earl's argument is that, because of the general statistics that show that married couples tend to stick together more than cohabiting couples, no unmarried couples should be able to be adopters. If Clause 1 is right and the paramount consideration is the child's welfare, we must consider each child and each potential couple on their own merits.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-23_spnew12"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   Yes, indeed we must, but there is no magic formula to enable anybody, however professional and however experienced, to assess whether this couple or that couple is more or less likely to split up. It cannot be done. It is a subjective judgment. Noble Lords may airily dismiss the statistics&#151;and the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones may refer to them as pseudo-statistics&#151;but they are published by the ONS.
<P>

<a name="20711-23_para3"></a>The study published in 1999 concluded:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In general, across most European nations children are less likely to see their parents split up if they are born to married parents than to cohabiting parents".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20711-23_para4"></a>
An analysis of the subsequent British Household Panel Survey said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Cohabitees who have children are more likely to split up than those who do not. The evidence therefore points to the likelihood that placing an adoptive child with an unmarried couple will increase the likelihood of their relationship breaking down".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20711-23_para5"></a>
That is more or less the only point I was making. It is very simple and noble Lords have not fully answered me, though they have tried to.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-23_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   I shall try one final stab at the noble Earl. The point is surely that that does not deal with real people. The noble Earl is dealing with statistics, probabilities and risk management. He is not dealing with individual couples who put themselves forward as adoptive parents.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-23_spnew14"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   But I am. I am dealing with real people with real children. That is what the statistics are based on. It is not where they live or what their name begins with, which are irrelevant considerations. It is real people with real children who split up. Statistically, married people split up less often. I do not believe that the noble Lord has got to the heart of my argument.

<P>

<a name="20711-23_para18"></a>We all welcome the provision in Clause 1, which introduces the welfare principle into all decisions by adoption agencies and courts relating to the adoption of a child. This will ensure that, whatever the competing interests in the adoption process, the welfare of the child is ultimately at the top of the agenda.

<a name="20711-23_para19"></a>However, Clause 51 brings with it a related concern. We see in subsection (1)(b) what apparently amounts to a simple welfare test for dispensing with parental consent. This has caused considerable disquiet among experienced professionals in adoption, including the BAAF and the Law Society. Adoption is different from any other plan for the vulnerable child because it involves lifelong consequences. An adoption order triggers an irrevocable severance of the relationship between the child and his or her parents and wider family. It therefore constitutes the most fundamental interference with the right to family life from the point of view of the child's birth family.
<P>

<a name="20711-23_para20"></a>For these reasons, it is important to ensure that, when it comes to overriding parental wishes in adoption cases, the manner in which welfare is interpreted is subject to particular scrutiny, to show that adoption will bring significant advantages that cannot be achieved by any other plan. If those significant advantages cannot be demonstrated, the child's welfare may be better served by securing his placement by another legal route, which does not involve such irreversible finality for all parties.
<P>

<a name="20711-23_para21"></a>The Adoption Act 1976 contained provisions to ensure that adoption cannot be imposed by the state on non-consenting parents without there being grounds to dispense with such consent. However, the wording of Clause 51(9)(b) removes any consideration of the parents' consent to adoption, because dispensation will be based entirely on judicial interpretation of what will, on balance, best promote the child's welfare. While that closely mirrors the grounds for orders made under the Children Act, it does not distinguish between adoption and, for example, a residence order or special guardianship order, even though the consequences of each differ substantially.
<P>

<a name="20711-23_para22"></a>I ask the Minister to seek advice on European case law, which has established that there must be exceptional circumstances to justify permanently severing the parent-child relationship. The Bill does not give appropriate weight to the irrevocability of adoption in contrast to other orders. In step-parent adoptions, where the court is being asked to dispense with parental consent, an adoption order may be <P>


<a name="column_GC261"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC261</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>granted in cases where there is no finding of parental failure to protect their child as in cases where children are adopted from care and adoption is in the child's interests only on balance.
<P>

<a name="20711-23_para23"></a>The proposal in Amendment No. 76 is that the circumstances should be exceptional enough to justify the state severing the parent-child relationship against the parents' wishes, following which the welfare principle in Clause 1 would be applied by the courts to determine whether adoption is the best course for the child. Without such an amendment, there will be no test for dispensing with parental consent and too little encouragement to the courts to consider alternative proposals when parents are withholding their consent. That was one of the recommendations in the 1992 interdepartmental working group report to Ministers.
<P>

<a name="20711-23_para24"></a>Amendments Nos. 77 and 78 can be covered very briefly. Amendment No. 77 is closely related to the point that I have just made. Consent by birth parents to an adoption order must be fully informed consent. This is not just a matter of making sure that the finality of the adoption order has been impressed on them. It is also a matter of making sure that the alternatives to adoption have been thoroughly explored and explicitly rejected. Special guardianship as a half-way house may be appropriate in some cases. Birth parents have to know about it and consider it.
<P>

<a name="20711-23_para25"></a>Amendment No. 78 relates to Clause 51(5). What do we mean by consent? The clause says,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"'Consent' means consent given unconditionally and with full understanding of what is involved"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20711-23_para26"></a>That is obviously right, but it should also mean consent that is freely given without any suggestion of duress. Nor should consent be obtained on the back of any financial or non-financial inducement. In each case the process has to be open, honest and transparent. I very much hope the Minister will be sympathetic to these arguments. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-24_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   I interpose very briefly. Amendment No. 76 makes a presumption of pre-eminence of the parental wish on withholding consent. That is the situation in the case I referred to on Second Reading. I am not being critical of my noble friend, there is a misunderstanding. This is not a simple welfare provision. It is the antithesis of a simple welfare provision. The simple welfare provision was established in the case of In Re W, and this is in total conflict with it. That is why I oppose the amendment. Amendment No. 77 is hardly appropriate.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para0"></a>Amendment No. 78 makes no sense. It refers to "improper duress or inducement". The parent is there. In In Re W the young girl was there and gave evidence. There was no question of duress. If there was any hint of duress the judge would get on to it very quickly indeed. This is a wholly unnecessary provision. It would not matter if we put it in the Bill because it would not do anything. Amendment No. 76 would alter the whole structure of parental consent and I therefore oppose it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   I shall be brief. I am not going to trade the effect of Amendment No. 76 too greatly <P>


<a name="column_GC262"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC262</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway. That could take far too long. He is right that it would considerably alter the impact of the clause. That is the intention. I shall revert to the usual pattern of this Committee and support the amendment of the noble Earl, Earl Howe.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para1"></a>The noble Earl set out his stall extremely effectively. It would simply be a matter of underlining the reason for our previous amendments, which were in the nature of how placement orders are made. This is very cognate. It is the finality of adoption which again is so relevant. If placement orders were made in every case through a court process, this would not be necessary. The finality of the adoption order process means that a different test is needed in these circumstances. This formulation would give greater protection and would not mean that the sole welfare ground would allow that parental consent to be dispensed with.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-24_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </B>   I, too, support amendment. I recognise that the Government wish to speed up adoption. In many circumstances that is right, bearing in mind the ethos and press that the Bill takes forward.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para2"></a>I began my career in social work under the Children and Young Persons Act 1963, which developed ideas and projects to prevent the breakdown of family life. It was the era of good social work support and financial intervention, ensuring good community intervention and housing for vulnerable families. In the late 1980s and 1990s, we saw the erosion of the support to local authorities. Many of those principles and programmes were lost.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para3"></a>Not all birth families are appropriate for the placement of children. I have spent most of my life dealing with child protection and family violence and abuse. Where possible, we should make every effort to ensure that the families have had support. I hope that the amendments put forward by the noble Earl would help that to happen.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para4"></a>The Department of Health's consultation document about effective adoption support says very little about local support for groups of birth parents. As I have said before, if we are to keep this balance we have to remember that there are many women&#151;certainly single mothers&#151;who have said that if only they had had the support that seems to be available post-adoption under the present regime, they may have been able to provide a home for their child.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para5"></a>I simply caution the Government in this. We must pay real attention to having checklists that provide for birth parents to be properly investigated. We must give them every opportunity. In the long run, the birth family will be able to give all that the child needs.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-24_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   On Amendment No. 76, would the wishes of the natural mother be over-ridden if she wanted her child to go to a specific family of her religion? Whatever the modern life is, some people feel very strongly about their religion. What would the noble Earl's amendment mean in that respect?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-24_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Earl, and pleased that he has received such reassuring support on this amendment. I was worried about the injuries he received with the last amendment, because we all know him to be a most splendid fellow.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para6"></a>This debate will not generate as much passion, although there will be a different sort of passion. There are more technical arguments to be had here.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para7"></a>I will deal with this in a little detail because it raises important questions. It is at the heart of the Bill. There can be nothing more serious than enabling a child to be removed from the parent and placed with another family.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para8"></a>I assure the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, that we are not concerned with speed here. We are very much concerned that the right decision is made in terms of the rights of the birth parent and the rights of the child. Our intention is to strike a balance. I shall explain why we believe that our clause is right.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para9"></a>The clause covers the definition of consent and the circumstances in which it may be dispensed with. In the context of adoption, we are talking about changing lifelong legal effects, which is why we need to be so certain. Therefore, we recognise that the appropriate test for dispensation is critical. It is very difficult.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para10"></a>I pay tribute to the people in the stakeholders groups and in the Committee who have wrestled with these definitions and with the attempt to strengthen what they see as the problem of rights while maintaining the balance. We have wrestled over the past few years to get this right so we do recognise the sincerity of the concerns but we believe that the formulation already in the Bill is more appropriate and preferable.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para11"></a>The broad principles have been alluded to by the noble Earl already. I refer to the founding principle set out in Clause 1 which commands all-party agreement and which underpins the Bill, as it does the Children Act; namely, that the child's welfare should be the paramount consideration and the deciding factor for courts and adoption agencies in coming to any decision relating to the adoption of a child. That is the great step forward that we are making in the Bill. At the same time we have given appropriate assurances that the views, interests and capabilities of parents and relatives are essential elements of that decision.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para12"></a>The second principle that has shaped our approach is one of process. It is the need to set out in legislation a clear and broad framework for the courts themselves that indicates the test that needs to be met&#151;in this case that the child's welfare requires parental consent to be dispensed with. The fundamental matter that they must address in coming to any decision to make that dispensation is the welfare checklist that is set out in Clause 1.
<P>


<a name="column_GC264"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC264</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para13"></a>We do not want to make that framework overly prescriptive. We want to avoid reducing or fettering the court's discretion to consider and weigh up the detailed circumstances of each individual case that comes before it. That point was well made by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, on Second Reading.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para14"></a>Amendment No. 76 seeks to alter the provisions in Clause 51(1). As currently drafted, the clause provides that the court may only dispense with a parent or guardian's consent in two circumstances. The first is relatively simple. It is where the parent or the guardian cannot be found or is incapble of giving consent, perhaps because of a serious mental or physical illness. Perhaps I should say that we would certainly expect the courts to be satisfied in the first instance that reasonable steps appropriate to the situation would have been taken to find the parent or guardian. Last week in Committee we discussed in passing the sadness of babies found abandoned on the steps of Temple Church. In that situation I suspect that it would be difficult to find either the father or the mother, but there will be many situations where the process will be far easier.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para15"></a>The second circumstance where parental consent may be dispensed with is where the child's welfare expressly requires consent to be dispensed with. I want to stress the term "requires". I have been concerned by what has been said this afternoon. Some concern has been expressed that this test in Clause 51(1) is a trivial one which will be easily met, that it is a simple welfare test and that it might indeed lead to adoptions being made against the parents' wishes in difficult or marginal cases.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para16"></a>I want to reassure the Committee that we do not believe that that is the case. The court has to judge the child's welfare, which includes its mental, physical and emotional needs&#151;a harsh set of criteria&#151;not just its wishes and feelings. We are requiring the court to dispense with parental consent to adoption. That is not a judgment that can be taken lightly. I see the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, nodding her head in agreement. It is not a decision that is taken lightly. It is not a test that would be met in marginal cases.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para17"></a>That is the provision that will now apply in contested placement orders or adoption orders. It is linked to Clause 1 which puts the welfare of the child at the heart of the Bill. It is a different test from that currently set out in Section 16 of the 1976 Act and we believe that it is a better test. Under current legislation the court may dispense with the consent of the parents where it considers that that consent is being withheld unreasonably. The court considers in such cases what a reasonable parent would do in the particular circumstances of that individual case. Case law has established in In Re W&#151;in which the noble Lord, Lord Campbell, was such a distinguished participant&#151;and in subsequent judgments, that in determining what a reasonable parent's attitude would be the welfare of the child was a leading consideration. The parents become the focus of the decision but the welfare of the child is the critical factor. By making the welfare of the child paramount in the Bill we are again moving forward from this position. Ultimately, even in these <P>


<a name="column_GC265"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC265</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>most difficult of contested cases, the paramountcy principle must hold and must be considered as the central overriding concern.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para18"></a>Again I would stress that scrutiny is implied in the term "welfare" and in the checklist. This is not a vague notion of a general well-being; we are talking about range and complexity of needs. We have heard this afternoon in a previous debate of challenging, difficult, hard to place children with complex histories of abuse and trauma. Those needs have to be assessed against the test I have mentioned. It is clear that the consideration of the views, wishes, rights and interests of the parents, and their capacity to care for the child, as defined in Clause 1(4)(f)(ii), is a critical factor. We define that capacity as, for example, the relationship the child has with parents or relatives, the prospect of that continuing and the willingness and ability of parents or relatives to develop a secure environment in which the child can flourish.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para19"></a>It is also worth remembering that the court is not limited to making a placement or an adoption order, it can make a variety of orders; it can make a residence order. I address the point raised about the finality of adoption and the difference between placement and adoption. Indeed, there is a significant difference between a placement order and a final adoption order. However, we are aiming at consistency across the two types of orders.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para20"></a>When the court comes to judge whether the child is ready for adoption and whether to make an adoption order, there will be other considerations which the court will have to take into account. It is not just a matter of the list; the list is a starting point. There will be many other considerations which will be different from the considerations that are made under a placement order. We believe that that is properly left to the courts. As regards contested placement order or adoption order cases, we have not just provided in the welfare test for the criteria to be weighed up as fully as possible; there is also an extra safeguard.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para21"></a>I come to another point raised by the noble Earl. He expressed concern about the application of the Human Rights Act. I reassure the Committee that we are entirely clear that the provisions of the Bill are consistent with the Human Rights Act and that the courts will have to apply the provisions of the Bill when it is enacted in the context of ECHR case law and obviously in relation to Article 8 which refers to respect for family and private life. Any interference in those rights must be necessary and proportional. To quote the case law on this, the leading case is Johanson v. Norway [1996] which makes it clear that
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Deprivation of parental rights and access should only occur in exceptional circumstances and would be justified if motivated by an overriding requirement pertaining to the child's best interests".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20711-24_para22"></a>Therefore, it is not a case of trivial criteria applying. That consideration will be observed by the court.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para23"></a>I turn again to the amendment. The structure of the Bill provides an appropriate test for protecting the rights of parents but in a way which is consistent with the paramountcy of the welfare of the child. We do not <P>


<a name="column_GC266"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC266</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>believe that the amendments we are considering would achieve that. Amendment No. 76 would alter subsection (1)(b) of Clause 51 so that instead of the courts being able to dispense with parental consent to adoption because the child's welfare required it, they could do so only if they concluded that adoption would be so significantly better for the child than any other option as to justify overriding parental wishes.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para24"></a>The two arguments that emerge from the logic of the provision is that, first, it will ensure that proper weight is given to parents' wishes and their rights in respect of the child, and, secondly, it will provide a clear threshold for dispensing with consent. I have addressed the first argument in the sense that I have identified three different ways in which the parents' rights are protected: first, the requirement argument; secondly, the fact that there is explicit protection of parental interests in Clause 1; and, thirdly, because the courts will have to observe European law and the Human Rights Act. Those safeguards are in place. The latter were recognised by the British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering, when it gave evidence on this issue last March to the Select Committee.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para25"></a>On the second argument, we come to the form of words which has been specifically chosen. We believe that those words carry the risk of cutting across the principle and the operation of paramountcy of a child's welfare. As I have said, we fully recognise the difficulty that has been addressed and the thought that has gone into finding a better form of words, in the view of the noble Earl. However, simply put, it is very difficult to be clear as to what,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"so significantly better . . . to justify overriding the parent's wishes",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20711-24_para26"></a>actually means, and how it would work.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para27"></a>To take what might be seen as a parallel, provision in Section 33 of the Children Act that applies to care orders provides a clear threshold. A care order cannot be made unless the court is satisfied that the child is at risk of "significant harm". Of course, that is the same threshold that applies to placement orders, because one cannot make a placement order unless the child can be seen to be at risk of significant harm, or already has a care order. However, the problem is that "significant harm" is a tangible concept but "significantly better" is not.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para28"></a>"Significant harm" encompasses a body of evidence that provides parameters and definitions. It is defined in the Children Act as a starting point. The term "so significantly better" implies a relative judgment with the court invited to make a comparison between a hypothetical situation and not one judgment, but three. Is adoption itself better? Is it significantly better? Alternatively, is it so significantly better that it justifies overriding parental consent? We have to ask, better than what? On what basis is this judgment made? Are we talking about material grounds here, and about what can be offered to the child in terms of resources? Are we talking about emotional grounds? Moreover, when does "better" become "significantly better"? What is the scale of significance? What are the break points? What are the bench-marks?
<P>


<a name="column_GC267"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC267</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para29"></a>I am also unclear about what it would add to the process itself. At the end of the day, the court would need to consider precisely the range of factors set out in the welfare checklist. There is no "better". That is established by the Children Act. It is expanded in the context of adoption, but it is the same tried-and-tested provision. None of that is defined for the court; there are no starting points. The danger is that it would be a subjective test with little guidance for the court. It is difficult to discern whether it could provide the kind of clear test that we want to see. I do not want to be pejorative to lawyers&#151;it is too dangerous in this place&#151;but I cannot imagine that it would do anything but generate a lot of profit and pleasure. It might even have the effect of raising the legal threshold. Indeed, it might actually make it even more difficult to place children for adoption.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para30"></a>Our deep concern in the context of the Bill is that we believe this could put at risk the paramountcy principle. It would be difficult to hold the notion that the child's welfare is paramount while at the same time directing the court's attention to a potentially additional nebulous test. We have put a lot of thought into this matter. We feel that we have a better solution, which will protect the rights of parents, both explicitly and robustly, in a way that is consistent with what we want to see in this Bill for children. I cannot, therefore, support the proposed change. I am tempering my kind words to the noble Earl by saying that I cannot accept the change that he suggests to the clause.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para31"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 77. The literal effect of this amendment would be to enable the court to dispense with the parents' consent for adoption; in other words, to make an adoption order even if the parents were opposed, provided that the courts were satisfied that the parents had received written information on the alternatives. That cannot have been the intention. It is possible that it is intended to highlight the importance of proper counselling, which is something about which we are serious. I have a two-page briefing note in my file that outlines the process of counselling and support for parents. I believe that my noble friend alluded earlier to the fact that that is a very rigorous process.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para32"></a>In addition, our National Adoption Standards make it clear that adoption agencies and local authorities should make every effort to ensure that birth parents have a full understanding of the process, and of the legal implications involved. Where adoption is considered for a child in care, we would expect the social services department in its work with the birth family to discuss all the implications. Again, we have talked about ways of raising performance and improvement in that area.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para33"></a>The Schedule 2 report which, under current court rules, the local authority must complete for every adoption order, obliges the local authority to report to the court the results of its investigation into the case, including an account of the alternatives that have been considered. It is envisaged that the reports the adoption agencies will have to provide under Clause 42 and those that local authorities must provide under <P>


<a name="column_GC268"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC268</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Clause 43, will also cover this point. So the courts can be secure in the knowledge that the alternatives to adoption have been considered.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para34"></a>Finally, any consent to placement for adoption and to an adoption order must, of course, be witnessed by the CAFCASS officer, who, as we have discussed at other stages of the Bill in relation to placement, will have an obligation to ensure that the parents understand what they are agreeing to and the seriousness of the step, and must, as stated in Clause 99(1), report that to the court. I reiterate, therefore, that we are committed to ensure that all the alternatives are properly explored and that the parents are counselled and fully aware of the alternatives.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para35"></a>Amendment No. 78 expands on the definition of "consent", as set out in subsection (5). I take the point robustly put by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, that the amendment suggests that "consent" should be defined as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"consent given unconditionally without improper duress or inducement and with full understanding of what is involved".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20711-24_para36"></a>I sympathise with the intentions, but I suggest that the Bill already provides a clear definition. My first concern is with the words "improper inducement". I believe that they might even risk giving the impression that there was a concept of "proper inducement". We might think of it as unconditional, but the reference to "duress" risks confusing the picture.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para37"></a>Perhaps I may reassure the noble Lord. In law, duress, alongside mistake and fraud, is already one of the legal grounds on which consent can be vitiated, so it is not necessary to mention it explicitly. On that basis, I hope that Members of the Committee will understand why we do not believe it is a helpful addition to the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para38"></a>It has been a very thoughtful debate. I am grateful that we have had had this opportunity. Again, I seek the forgiveness of the Committee for having gone into such detail. But it is important to have that on the record, not least for stakeholders outside this House to know that we have addressed their concerns seriously and have thought hard about how we can deal with the balance of what the Bill attempts to do.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-24_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   The noble Baroness need make no apology whatsoever for having given us such a clear and helpful reply. I should point out to her that that is the point of this Committee proceeding. Indeed, if it enables us all to understand what the Bill is saying, as well as the Government's intention, it may obviate the need to bring amendments back on Report. I do not promise anything at this stage because I wish to read the noble Baroness's comments carefully. I thank the Minister for her extremely helpful and illuminating response.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para39"></a>I also congratulate the Minister on her secret weapon in the form of my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway, whose opinions and experience we all respect. I would never seek to belittle the force of existing case law. However, as I am sure my noble <P>


<a name="column_GC269"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC269</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>friend will understand, my remarks were directed in the context of parallel considerations, particularly in the context of European law. I am delighted that the noble Baroness was able to cover that aspect so comprehensively. She suggested that the phrase "so significantly better" was too vague and too insubstantial to be inserted in the Bill. I shall have to think about that.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para40"></a>I still believe that the test in relation to dispensing with parental consent, as proposed in the Bill, is somewhat broad. As it reads, it gives too little encouragement to consider alternative options. The point of tabling the amendment was to seek a way of inserting a clearly defined threshold to be crossed before parental consent can be dispensed with. The court needs to ask itself what are the needs of the child, what is the scale of potential advantage to the child of having a new family, and whether it is satisfied that the likely benefit of adoption is so significantly better when compared with other options as to justify the adoption order.
<P>

<a name="20711-24_para41"></a>The Minister suggested that this would give rise to a lawyers' field day. An alternative view might be that judges are there to judge and that that is their job. They do it all the time, they do it very well, and they do it on the strength of the evidence presented to them. Nevertheless, I thank the Minister again. It has been a very helpful debate. I beg leave, for the time being, to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="20711-25_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Andrews </B>   moved Amendment No. 78ZA:

<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 31, line 28, leave out "prescribed form" and insert "form prescribed by rules"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20711-25_para0"></a><P>

<a name="20711-25_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall move this short amendment very briefly. I am happy to move it as it has been beneficial in previous discussions. I think that it will be welcomed.
<P>

<a name="20711-25_para2"></a>The effect of the amendment is to make it clear that the form for withdrawing of consent to placement for adoption under Clause 18, or advanced consent to adoption, under Clause 19, is to be prescribed in court rules. At the moment, it just says "prescribed". It will be important that there is certainty as to when consent of placement or advanced consent to adoption has been withdrawn, because from that point the agency is under an obligation to return the child under Clauses 30 and 31. That is why Clause 51(8) provides that any such withdrawal needs to be given to the agency either using the prescribed form as set out in subsection (8)(a), or otherwise through a written notice as set out in Clause 51(8)(b). "Notice" is defined in Clause 139 as "notice in writing".
<P>

<a name="20711-25_para3"></a>In this amendment, we seek absolute clarity and the removal of any chance of confusion as to who is to prescribe the form for withdrawal of consent. As with the form of consent, the placement and advance consent to adoption, it will be prescribed in court rules by the Lord Chancellor. It will be important that <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-25_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Howe </B>   moved Amendment No. 78A:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 31, line 30, leave out subsection (9).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20711-25_para5"></a>The noble Earl said: I beg to move Amendment No. 78A. I shall speak also to Amendment No. 78B. This again is a human rights issue relating to parental consent. The effect of Clause 51(9) and (10) is that the other parent, usually the father, is credited with a far-reaching previous decision to which he has not been a party, and is thereby excluded from opposing the adoption application under Clause 46(4), (5) and (7).
<P>

<a name="20711-25_para6"></a>I seriously question whether this is sustainable under the Human Rights Act. One situation which is not uncommon is for the father of the child to be identified late in care and adoption proceedings, for him to express a wish to be heard on issues relating to his child. His exclusion under these subsections seems to offend against natural justice. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-25_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   I wish briefly to support the noble Earl, Lord Howe, on Amendments Nos. 78A and 78B. It is extraordinary that the consent of the other parent is presumed under subsection (10), in particular. It does seem, without putting it to the test, that this is something that could be challenged under human rights legislation. That is the reason for the deletion.
<P>

<a name="20711-25_para7"></a>I should be interested to hear how this provision can be justified. As the Minister has been extremely good so far in justifying a number of provisions the Bill, I am sure that she is charged up for this particular amendment. The provision does seem to go against natural justice, as the noble Earl, Lord Howe, has made plain.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-25_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   The amendment is slightly complicated and my response will reflect that. Amendments Nos. 78A and 78B seek to remove the provisions in clause 51 that cover situations whereby a mother with parental responsibility has consented to a placement for adoption under Clause 18 and another parent subsequently acquires parental responsibility. It can happen in a variety of ways. The obvious way is when the unmarried father later marries the mother, but it can also happen when he obtains responsibility by agreement or through a court order under Section 4 of the Children Act.
<P>

<a name="20711-25_para8"></a>We are doing this essentially to ensure that there is more stability with the placement. To put it bluntly, that is what I understand to be our&#151;genuine&#151;reason for doing this. At the moment, subsections (9) and (10) of Clause 50 provide that in such situations the father will for the purposes of the adoptive placement be deemed to have given his consent under Clause 18, as has the mother. Having acquired parental responsibility, he also is free to withdraw his consent to the placement for adoption at any time until the prospective adopters apply to the court for an adoption order. He will be entitled to receive notice of <P>


<a name="column_GC271"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC271</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the final adoption hearing and seek leave to oppose the making of the adoption order. I believe that that will cover the human rights point which has been raised. He can oppose the adoption order, as can the mother.
<P>

<a name="20711-25_para9"></a>The amendment seeks to remove this provision. That is the effect of deleting subsections (9) and (10). The effect would be that, from the point at which the father acquires parental responsibility, legal authority for the placement for adoption will cease because he has not given consent in the first place under Clause 18. That is where the element of instability and discontinuity would occur.
<P>

<a name="20711-25_para10"></a>Such provision would cause severe problems. For example, the adoption agency might not necessarily be aware that the father had acquired parental responsibility; that might have been concealed from it by the mother. This can happen in a variety of circumstances. It might happen after consent to placement was given. The mother may decide not to keep in touch with the agency. A whole set of circumstances may surround children in care which makes it difficult to know what relationships continue between the mother and the father.
<P>

<a name="20711-25_para11"></a>The result would be that the agency could unknowingly proceed with a legally invalid placement. We can only imagine the destructive consequences. The whole arrangement could unravel if that came to light at a much later stage. It could come to light after an adoption order had been made under Clause 46(4), the order having been based on everyone's assumption that the consent to placement was valid.
<P>

<a name="20711-25_para12"></a>When the Committee debated the position of unmarried fathers earlier, I promised that agencies would be under a duty in regulations and guidance to seek out and properly involve unmarried fathers in the process of determining whether a child should be placed for adoption. That again addresses in a positive manner the human rights argument. Where agencies are aware of the unmarried father, they are already under a duty to do that under regulation 7.3 of the Adoption Agencies Regulations 1983 so far as is reasonably practicable. That will be extended.
<P>

<a name="20711-25_para13"></a>However, we cannot cater for every case, particularly when the unmarried father is not on the scene at the time of placement but returns later, has a view, and the agency is not made aware of that fact. In those circumstances, the best approach must be that currently taken in the Bill&#151;to preserve the validity of the placement while giving the father full rights to withdraw consent at the stages which I have identified.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-25_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   I understand the Minister's point that subsections (9) and (10) are there in order not to invalidate the placement. In retrospect it might be that the appropriate consent had not been given. Nevertheless, assuming the other parent has given deemed consent under this section, all the other aspects apply, so that the withdrawal of any presumed consent by that other parent is ineffective if given after an application for an adoption order is made under Clause 51(4). We are also back to the arguments about the court having to give consent if withdrawal of consent applies. We made those arguments when we <P>


<a name="column_GC272"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC272</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>were talking about the reasons for a placement order. The situation would be cured much more effectively if placement orders were given in every case.
<P>

<a name="20711-25_para14"></a>Because the other parent who did not give consent but is now deemed to be giving consent under subsections (9) and (10) is dealt with in that way, the other two conditions apply in the same way that they apply to the original parent who gave consent. They cannot withdraw it except under those two conditions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-25_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   I have a slightly different question. I think the Minister said that Clauses 9 and 10 say that the other parent was deemed to have given consent, and therefore, because of "in the same terms" in subsection (10), if he turned up later he was also able to withdraw his consent under the same terms as the first parent who had given her consent. Is that what that clause means? It is very difficult to work it through, but that is what I understood from her answer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-25_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   Just to amplify that, the same terms are hedged about with considerable restrictions under the terms of the legislation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-25_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   There are a number of issues here that collude in notions of change of circumstances and what either parent can do under the circumstances. This is very technical and I would prefer to write a reasoned reply that would take account of the points raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, and the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-25_spnew8"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   I am very grateful once again to the Minister. I particularly appreciate her offer to write. I think she understands that I am uncomfortable with the implication of these subsections. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, for the way in which he pinpointed the discomfort that we share. The subsections imply that once in the system a child becomes the property of the system. I know that is not  the Government's intention, but in certain circumstances it could be the result.
<P>

<a name="20711-25_para15"></a>I believe the Minister referred to Clause 46(4), which says that it was possible for a parent or guardian to oppose the making of an adoption order. As I understand it, the parent or guardian has no absolute right; he may only seek leave to the court to do that. I am not sure whether that is sufficient protection. I understand her argument that the validity of the placement needs to be preserved, but between now and Report I need to consider whether the Bill provides the best way of approaching that objective. If possible, we need to look at other solutions. This has been a most helpful debate. For the time being, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="20711-26_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever </B>   moved Amendment No. 79:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 32, line 29, leave out "may" and insert "must"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20711-26_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: I rise to move Amendment No. 79, which would make the provision of the necessary information about a child to prospective adopters obligatory rather than discretionary before they accept a match that the agency suggests. The extent of this problem was demonstrated by Local Authority Circular (98)20, which had to point out to local authorities that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is unacceptable for adoption agencies to withhold information about a child to the extent that the picture of a child provided to prospective adopters is so lacking in substance as to bear little relation to reality".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20711-26_para1"></a>If we are to promote stability for adopted children everything must be done to avoid unnecessary moves, including disrupted adoptions. Misinformation, or lack of information, is a factor in disruptions. Amending Clause 53 is an opportunity to strengthen the need for candour on the part of local authorities.
<P>

<a name="20711-26_para2"></a>If a prospective adopter is well informed, he or she can be well prepared. That preparation will make all the difference at a difficult and an emotional time. If prospective adopters are to be sensitive to the needs of a child, they must be given as much information as possible about those needs, be they learning or behavioural difficulties, physical disabilities, challenging psychological experiences from a past home environment, or the problems that the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, mentioned earlier.
<P>

<a name="20711-26_para3"></a>Clause 53 leaves "prescribed circumstance" and "prescribed information" to the regulations to define. The new National Adoption Standards state, in Chapter C2, No. 3, that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"agencies should give full information about the child in writing . . . adopters to sign to say they have received this information . . . [and that the] agency should have written guidelines on the information to be provided".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20711-26_para4"></a>However, the guidelines are not available in advance of the Bill. Therefore, we should like to see some safeguard on the face of the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-26_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   I rise very briefly to make the case that this is not the customary argument held in Parliament between "may" and "must". This is something more than that, because it imposes a duty on adoption agencies to disclose information. The amendment has arisen because of past experience and practice. It is not isolated experience; it is representative of the experience that adoptive parents have had. The issue which the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, has raised is one that has come increasingly to prominence, particularly over the last 10 years or so. The nature of the children being adopted has changed dramatically and the importance of the history of particular children to adopters has become more important than it ever was previously.
<P>

<a name="20711-26_para5"></a>I hope the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, will correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that the purpose behind the proposed insertion of this word on the face <P>


<a name="column_GC274"></a>

<B>11 Jul 2002 : Column GC274</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the Bill is to set an absolute mark against practice and culture within agencies, which has been mentioned previously as being a particular problem. It is not universally a problem but it may be a problem within particular agencies. The adoption standards, to which the noble Lord referred in his opening remarks, bear out the fact that the Government believe this to be best practice and hope to see it become prevalent practice. This is to make sure that the power exists to eradicate bad practice. That is why I believe this is slightly more than our usual knockabout "may" and "must" argument.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-26_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I do not disagree&#151;subject to reading it in Hansard&#151;with a word that either the noble Lord, Lord Astor, or the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, have said. I am sorry to have to tell the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, that I am afraid I believe I can show her that it is a "may" or "must" issue and it is the kind of "may" or "must" issue with which I have been dealing in this House for nearly 20 years. For 14 of those years, I used to argue that the "may" should be turned into "shall", and for the past five years I have been arguing that it should not. So the Committee will hear the experience of five years rather than the experience of 14 years.
<P>

<a name="20711-26_para6"></a>I can give the assurance that is sought. The Government are committed to providing adopters with the information they will need in order to decide whether to adopt a child. We shall bring forward these regulations and we shall consult stakeholders in the adoption field, including groups representing adopters. We have not done so because the consultation has not yet taken place or, at any rate, is not complete. The Government tabled these amendments in Commons Committee precisely to ensure that we have the powers to bring forward regulations.
<P>

<a name="20711-26_para7"></a>The regulations will give the powers to ensure that there is full and appropriate information in three stages: first, when a link between a child and prospective adopters is suggested; secondly, when a match is being considered; and, thirdly, in preparation for the placement of the child. Therefore, I assure the Committee that that is not the problem.
<P>

<a name="20711-26_para8"></a>What is the problem about "may" and "shall"? We can bring forward the regulations, but Parliament is sovereign and we cannot be sure that the regulations will be acceptable to either this House or the other place. If the regulations were rejected and if we had the word "must" in, the Secretary of State would be given a duty that he could not fulfil. That is the only issue between "may" and "must", and that is why parliamentary counsel insist that we should say "may" and not "must". However, everything that has been said, with which I very much agree, is still true.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711-26_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever: </B>   I welcome the Minister to Grand Committee. We look forward to more of his humour. I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, for her support. I certainly agree that there have been many bad experiences of information not being given to prospective parents.

<P>
<UL>
<P>
Whether they intend to publish the report of the independent investigation into the circumstances of Paul Wright's death at Leeds prison on 7 November 1996, ordered by Mr Justice Jackson on 27 June 2001.[HL5247]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20711w01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   We welcome this report, which is today being placed in the Library together with our response to the five findings and 20 recommendations made in the report. The Prison Service has previously accepted partial liability for the death of Paul Wright because failure to provide proper medical treatment was a contributory factor to his death, and in October 2000 apologised to the family, followed by an out-of-court settlement in December 2000. This independent investigation provides a very thorough review of the circumstances surrounding the death of Paul Wright and associated issues. Two of the findings reflect conflicts of evidence that are unlikely ever to be resolved.
<P>

<a name="20711w01_para3"></a>This was a unique investigation in circumstances unlikely to be repeated, largely because changes made since 1996, including: provision of healthcare services in prison has been changed through a partnership between the Prison Service and the NHS at local, regional and national level; procedures for recruitment and supervision of prison medical officers have been improved, with training and qualification requirements tightened; and all self-inflicted deaths in prisons are now routinely investigated and investigation reports disclosed to families. In addition, a clinical review of the treatment provided to a prisoner dying in custody from natural causes routinely now takes place. Procedures for investigating all deaths in prison custody are currently under review. In parallel, a wider Home Office and government review of investigations and inquiries is taking place against a background of emerging jurisprudence from both the domestic and European courts. This investigation has provided some valuable insights which will help inform this debate, specifically in relation to the introduction of independence in future investigations.
<P>

<a name="20711w01_para4"></a>We hope that the changes which have been made show that we are trying to learn from what has happened as a result of our failure to look after Paul Wright in the way that we should have done.
