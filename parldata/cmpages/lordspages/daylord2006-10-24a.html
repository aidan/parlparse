Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector of Prisons published the report of her

on26 July. In line with the protocol agreed between the
Immigration and Nationality Directorate and the chief inspector, an

Government&#146;s decision to keep the inspectorate independent,
after the case so well argued by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, and
others? Does she not agree that the seriousness of the situation at
Yarl&#146;s Wood is underlined by the fact that when the chief
inspector made a visit early last year she made 42 specific
recommendations on what should be done? When the inspector returned
early this year, virtually nothing had been done on the 42
recommendations.</p><p><a name="06102454000020"></a>As I am sure my

the plight of children&#151;the number of children and the length of
time they were there. She found it difficult to reconcile with our
obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child as ratified
by the United Kingdom in 1991. Are children in Yarl&#146;s Wood
regarded as children or not? If they are, why are the obligations under
the convention not applied in spirit as well as letter at this

periodically, perhaps every quarter, she was to publish a specific
progress report on each of the 42

in fact two visits by the chief inspector to Yarl&#146;s Wood in
February, the second being concerned with healthcare. The report on

experience of action plans is that often much is stated on paper but
not all of it is carried out. I am worried about the children in
Yarl&#146;s Wood, but there are also children in other detention
centres. Is anyone in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate
responsible for overseeing the treatment of children wherever they are
held in the system and therefore for overseeing the action plans and
the spreading of similar good practice throughout all the places in

this is very much part of IND&#146;s work. Indeed, the
recommendations for children have had a beneficial effect. For example,
the system for IND to provide a centre with secure and risk information
on detainees arriving from prison is now in place. The examination of
processes for handling torture reports from centre doctors is under
way. Detainees now have access to mobile phones. There are now
activities and classes specifically for women. Youth leaders have been
employed to organise children&#146;s activities and revise the
programme. Children&#146;s PE and games have been introduced. A
comprehensive range of educational books and materials is supplied.
Many things have been pursued directly as a result of recommendations.
Those recommendations have been beneficial and have helped this agenda
very much.</p>

Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, the number of
journeys by bus has been falling since the 1950s. This is due primarily
to the continuing increase in car ownership and usage. Although in
recent years London has seen an increase in bus use, the trend has not
been reflected in most areas outside the capital. The Government are
currently carrying out a review of bus issues to see where changes can
be made that could increase bus

money to subsidise bus services but have no control over service

Will my noble friend ensure that one of the options in the review will
be for local authorities to franchise bus services, rather as they do
trains? That would not only bring in competition but enable local

formal franchise will be looked at seriously. He will recognise that

of the country, and they would further agree that some of the big
groups,by abusing their dominant position, are frightening off
small competitors by targeting fare cuts andbetter services
whenever a competitor arises and subsequently withdrawing them. Will
the noble Lord please ensure that, in reviewing the bus industry, the

Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, certainly the bus
plays a crucial part in the rural economy, and it will be recognised
that we have taken measures that will increase the demand for buses.
The concessionary fares scheme, which will be universal in 2008, should
result in an increase in patronage, and we are helping young people
still in education who use buses. My noble friend is absolutely right
that the bus is a crucial form of communication and transport for those

Government designate postbuses in the same way as they have designated
the rest of the British Post Office&#151;as dispensable? Will he
reassure me that the Post Office will be a stakeholder? It could

Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, my noble friend

to our rural problems may lie in ensuring that those who provide one
service are able to extend their activities to provide other services.
The postbus is an important concept in that respect and will be taken
into
account.</p><p><a name="06102454000044"></a><b><a name="61024-0001.htm_spnew24"></a><a name="06102454000966"></a>Lord
Elton:</b> My Lords, would not a simple way of
getting people into buses on motorways be to extend the park-and-ride
principle to a 50-mile circle round London and all other major cities?
Large car parks there would make life much easier for commuters, who
could get into a coach and do their work on it, instead of sitting
behind a
wheel.</p><p><a name="06102454000045"></a><b><a name="61024-0001.htm_spnew25"></a><a name="06102454000967"></a>Lord
Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, that is an
interesting concept, although the noble Lord will recognise that
identifying destinations in London for bus routes from 50 miles outside
would present significant problems. The noble Lord is right in that
this is what is happening in places such as Cambridge, where car use is
restricted in the city centre and buses have access, and it is expected
that the park-and-ride scheme will be widely utilised. The more that
such schemes are developed, the more that both transport and the
environment in which people live and work in cities will be
improved.</p><p><a name="06102454000046"></a><b><a name="61024-0001.htm_spnew26"></a><a name="06102454000968"></a>Lord

great promotional measure for the London Stock Exchange and the

there is an increasing danger of regulatory creep from American
regulators that threatens our own light-touch approach to financial
regulation and some duplication of company reporting as well? For
instance, companies with over 300 shareholders resident in the United
States can be called to account by the Securities and Exchange
Commission; it is not unlikely that the London Stock Exchange will
become a subsidiary of NASDAQ next year, bringing US regulation to the
heart of the City; and there have already been a number of visits to
British companies by the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.

why the Government have announced that they intend to introduce a Bill

places more emphasis on the application of principles rather than rules
to provide flexible but robust standards. The combined code is the
result of that process. However, we need to be mindful that, whether it
is Sarbanes-Oxley or the UK approach through the combined code, this is
about getting good corporate governance. Along the way on issues of
fraud, we must get out of the habit of thinking, as I believe some have

whole chapter on the need to reform the science syllabus in schools.
The Minister referred to the piloting, which has been extremely
successful and warmly welcomed by head teachers and science teachers in
a great many schools. Does he accept that the new syllabus can offer
pupils the choice of doing three separate science subjects, and is that
not one of its very valuable points? However, does he also accept that,
if this is to work successfully, more resources will need to go into
giving teachers the money and the time to undertake continuous
professional development?</p>

Adonis:</b> My Lords, I am very grateful for the
noble Lord&#146;s welcome for the new science syllabus. He is
absolutely right about the need for more resources for continuing
professional development, and we are providing those resources. For
example, we have our outstanding &#163;50 million partnership with
the Wellcome Foundation to establish the network of science learning
centres throughout the country which has been much appreciated by
teachers and is substantially improving the quality of in-service
training for teachers.</p><p><a name="06102454000066"></a>The
noble Lord is also right about the availability of the three individual
sciences at GCSE. As he knows, earlier this year we announced policies
to promote the availability of the three individual sciences at GCSE,
including a new entitlement for all pupils who reach level 6 at key
stage 3&#151;the higher-performing pupils at the age of 14&#151;to
study the three individual sciences; and a new availability from 2008
for the three individual sciences to be taken in all comprehensive
schools that have a science specialism. At the moment, there are 292
such schools, but that number will rise. We agree with all the points
that the noble Lord has made, and we are seeking to advance both
in-service training and the availability of the individual
sciences.</p><p><a name="06102454000067"></a><b><a name="61024-0001.htm_spnew46"></a><a name="06102454000988"></a>Lord
Turner of Ecchinswell:</b> My Lords, does the

Science</I> does an extraordinarily good job of presenting science in
general and physics in particular as relevant to everyday life, there
remains a need to cater also&#151;additionally and perhaps
separately, with appropriately qualified teachers&#151;to the smaller
number of students who have an aptitude for the mathematical, analytic
character of the physical sciences, which can often seem arcane to the

designed?</p><p><a name="06102454000068"></a><b><a name="61024-0001.htm_spnew47"></a><a name="06102454000989"></a>Lord

Lord. That is why we are keen to make the three individual sciences
available. It is also why we are promoting the study of mathematics
much more vigorously in schools, including the take-up of further
mathematics at AS and A-level. Numbers have significantly increased at
AS-level, and that is very welcome. As the noble Lord will know, we are
also introducing a new maths GCSE to further stimulate students who
show most capacity in the area he described from the age of 14 and not
simply leaving it to the individual sciences at GCSE or AS and
A-level.</p><p><a name="06102454000069"></a><b><a name="61024-0001.htm_spnew48"></a><a name="06102454000990"></a>Baroness

that <I>Twenty First Century Science</I> provided a good background on
which to take A-levels. As we are extremely concerned about the fall in
the number of pupils taking some of the sciences at A-level,
particularly physics and chemistry, can he give us any indication of
whether the pilots showed that those who were stimulated by the novelty
of the new curriculum went on to study them at
A-level?</p>

Adonis:</b> My Lords, the picture at post-16 is not
quite as straightforward as the noble Baroness suggests. She is
absolutely right that the numbers studying the three sciences to
A-level have declined, but the numbers studying at AS level have risen
quite substantially. Between 2001 and 2006, the number studying biology
at AS level has risen from 51,000 to 59,000; the number studying
chemistry at AS level has risen from 35,000 to 41,000; and the number
studying physics at AS level has also risen, although only marginally,
from 29,174 to 29,659. The issue is in part one of progression from
GCSE to AS, and the results of the pilot have been encouraging.
However, the issue also&#151;in some ways, more substantially for the
immediate future of getting more pupils up to A-level&#151;is to
encourage those who start on the AS course to continue into the second
year of sixth form to take the
A2.</p><p><a name="06102454000071"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew50"></a><a name="06102454000992"></a>Baroness

addressing later. The number studying three individual sciences has
risen. The new entitlement, which I described to her noble friend
earlier, will see the availability of the three sciences significantly
extended over the next few years. The number of pupils gaining level 6
or above in the key stage 3 science tests was 259,000 this year. That
is the group to which we will be extending the entitlement in two
years&#146; time.</p><p><a name="06102454000073"></a>We will not
achieve anything in this area unless we have enough highly qualified

opposite left us with a massive deficit of highly qualified teachers in
this area. We have increased the supply of science teachers by 30 per
cent since 1997, but we have to make good decades of under-investment
in this area. Neither I nor any other Minister can wave a magic wand
and suddenly make things happen. It has taken decades of

secondary schools must provide sex and relationship education as part
of the basic science curriculum&#151;it is therefore a statutory
requirement. He repeated that statement in the letter that he sent to
the noble Baroness, Lady Gould of Potternewton, on 11 October. In that
letter, he also raised concerns that, if PSHE were to be made a
statutory part of the curriculum, it would raise intense debate and
controversy among other subject champions who want their subjects to be
made statutory and compulsory up to 16.</p><p><a name="06102454000111"></a>Danger of an intense
debate is not a good reason not to do the right thing. However, the
Minister was right that there is an intense debate, not least in
yesterday&#146;s newspapers, and there was an intense debate in your
Lordships&#146; House, in which this argument were supported by Peers
from all sides of the Chamber. Today&#146;s amendments, which were so
ably moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Gould of Potternewton, on that
occasion, are supported by the Advisory Centre for Education,

published a new report based on detailed research, the conclusion of
which was that PSHE, including sex and relationship education, should
become a statutory subject in all primary and secondary schools in
England and Wales. It also called for more information on parenting and

concluding that the status quo, in which the subject is non-statutory,
is failing comes from a number of facts. First, Britain has the highest
rate of births to teenagers in Europe; the rate here is nearly
one-fifth higher than that in Latvia, which is the second country in
the list. The Government&#146;s claim that the rate is falling refers
to only a very tiny fall. Secondly, one in three 15 year-olds did not
use a condom during their last sexual intercourse. Thirdly, levels of
genital diseases&#151;chlamydia, genital herpes and
syphilis&#151;among British teenagers have increased greatly in the
past 10 years. Fourthly, over the past50 years, the average
age of first sexual intercourse fell from 20 for men and 21 for women
in the 1950s to16 by the mid-1990s. The proportion of young
people who are sexually active before the age of consent rose from less
than 1 per cent to 25 per cent in the same period. Fifthly, in 2001-02,
38 per cent of the UK&#146;s15 year-olds had sexual
intercourse&#151;that is the highest incidence in Europe, as far as
we can tell.</p><p><a name="06102454000113"></a>Julia Margo, who is
a senior research fellow at the IPPR concluded
that:</p><ul><a name="06102454000292"></a>&#147;our education
system must respond and start teaching children about the risks
involved in sex before they even consider taking those
risks&#148;.</ul><a name="06102454000269"></a>PSHE is not
just about sex education; it is about a great deal more than that. The
QCA describe it as,
<ul><a name="06102454000316"></a>&#147;giving children and young
people the knowledge, skills and understanding they need to lead
confident, healthy and independent lives. It aims to help them
understand how they are developing personally and socially and how to
develop the skills and positive attitudes needed to tackle many of the
moral, social and cultural issues that are part of growing
up&#148;.</ul><a name="06102454000270"></a>So I can
reassure the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, that it is about a great
deal more than sex&#151;it is about life skills. In a nutshell, that
is what he is concerned about. But no doubt we will hear more in a
moment. <p><a name="06102454000114"></a>Research and surveys
have shown that children and their parents want PSHE taught in schools.
The Government have made it clear that they believe that emotional and
social skills are fundamental to school improvement, improving
behaviour and attendance at school. So why will they not show that
commitment by making PSHE compulsory? PSHE provides the right vehicle
for delivering the Government&#146;s agenda&#151;the <I>Every Child
Matters</I> outcomes for children. Typically, it has been seen to be
driven by problems such as teenage pregnancy, substance misuse, smoking
or obesity, which need to be solved.</p><p><a name="06102454000115"></a>At best PSHE is well co-ordinated in the
school, but at worst it can be a number of topics that jostle with one
another for time in the curriculum. That is not surprising, because the
aspects of learning and development in PSHE are not joined up at
national level. Currently, we have SEAL, or social and emotional
aspects of learning, for primary schools, with SEBS, or social,
emotional and behavioural skills, being piloted in secondary schools.
The DfES delivers those. Some elements of drug education come from the
Home Office and the healthy schools initiative comes from the
Department of Health.</p>

pm</h5><p><a name="06102454000116"></a>If PSHE
were used as a framework through which these different initiatives were
delivered, it would provide coherence for schools. Currently, the
Government acknowledge that PSHE needs improvements but do not accept
that making it statutory would make schools and teacher/trainers take
it more seriously. Instead, they have chosen various levers that they
hope will drive up standards. I have a number of questions for the
Minister about these.</p><p><a name="06102454000117"></a>Through the new
inspection arrangements, the Government believe that PSHE will be
better inspected and that that will drive up standards. But the new
inspection regime is very short and, unless the Government are explicit
that PSHE is the main vehicle for achieving the <I>Every Child
Matters</I> outcomes, it is unlikely that inspection will have much
impact. In addition, few Ofsted inspectors are PSHE specialists. Those
schools that are good academically will get a good Ofsted report
anyway, even if their PSHE is diabolical. Will the Minister commit to
commissioning Ofsted to deliver a special thematic report on
PSHE?</p><p><a name="06102454000118"></a>Secondly, PSHE is now
in the initial teacher training curriculum. However, the curriculum is
so packed that I understand that in some cases only an hour is
dedicated to the subject. Therefore, training has to come through
continued professional development. The continuous professional
development programme aims to train only 2,000 teachers and nurses a
year in PSHE. As there are over 20,000 schools, it will take many years
before every school has at least one trained teacher. Will the DfES
work with the Training and Development Agency for Schools and others to
improve the training of newly qualified teachers in PSHE?</p><p><a name="06102454000119"></a>The QCA produced good end of key stage
statements in 2005. It is currently reviewing the whole curriculum,
including PSHE. Will the Minister consider asking the QCA to develop
PSHE within the framework of the five outcomes for children so that it
is the main vehicle for their delivery by
schools?</p><p><a name="06102454000120"></a>All
schools should be healthy schools by 2008&#151;I believe that that is
the target. However, there are still many thousands of schools which
are still to convert to that status. Making PSHE statutory would help
to ensure that all schools become healthy schools sooner. What
sanctions will apply or, preferably, support be given to schools with
poor PSHE provision, regardless of the academic attainment of the
pupils, so that they can all become healthy schools
sooner?</p><p><a name="06102454000121"></a>Finally, I challenge the
Government's basic premise that aspects of PSHE, such as sex and drug
education, are already statutory because they are covered in biology or
science lessons. As a former biology teacher and form tutor delivering
PSHE, I tell the Minister that the ethos of a biology lesson, where
there is a curriculum to be examined in a public examination, and the
ethos of a PSHE lesson, where young people are encouraged to discuss
and explore difficult issues, are totally different. It is not possible
to work on the important relationship aspects of the subject in science
lessons.</p><p><a name="06102454000122"></a>PSHE is vital
alongside the more factual work. We need both and we need every child
to receive both. PSHE covers the emotional and social aspects,

and positive attitudes. That being so important, if the Government
still resist the call of so many in this Chamber and beyond to ensure
that all children receive good-quality PSHE as of right, how will the
department evaluate the use of the levers, which I have just described,
that they propose to use and over what period will that be done? Will
we still be in the terrible position described by the list of
statistics that I gave earlier, which were published by the IPPR only
this weekend? I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06102454000123"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew66"></a><a name="06102454001008"></a>Lord
Northbourne:</b> My Lords, I support Amendments Nos.
91A and 91B and shall speak to Amendment No. 92. Unfortunately, I was
unable to be in my place when the noble Baroness moved her amendment in
Committee, as I was chairing a conference on the implementation of the
<I>Every Child Matters </I>programme in my county of Kent. In spirit, I
supported the amendment; I wrote to the Minister about it and received
a very helpful reply, for which I am most
grateful.</p><p><a name="06102454000124"></a>I have carefully read
the <I>Official Report</I> of the debate. Somehow, it seems to have
been entirely hijacked by sex education and health education. I admit
that sex education and health education are probably much more fun than
what I am going to talk about, which I believe to be another very
important aspect of personal, social and health
education.</p><p><a name="06102454000125"></a>When she opened the
debate in Committee, the noble Baroness pointed out that the
non-compulsory elements of PSHE are being crowded out of the curriculum
by other compulsory subjects&#151;especially, of course, those that
will improve the school&#146;s position in the dreaded league tables.
I remember&#151;was it 10 or 12 years ago?&#151;with what high
hopes we fought to get PSHE into the syllabus. It is sad that it is
still not being well delivered in schools. I strongly support the
Government policy to train more PSHE teachers, but that will not solve
the problem if the non-compulsory elements of PSHE are crowded out of
the work programme, especially in the most vulnerable
schools.</p><p><a name="06102454000126"></a>If, on reflection, the
Minister is prepared to accept Amendments Nos. 91A and 91B, I shall be
very content. If not, perhaps my amendment, Amendment No. 92, may
suggest a basis for compromise or a different way to look at the
problem. If accepted, it would ensure that personal and social life
skills would have to be taught and learnt in all schools, at least in
key stage 4. I must admit that it would be better still if they had to
be learnt in all key stages, because those skills should start to be
learnt early and developed throughout the child's life at
school&#151;and before. I am sorry that I did not frame my amendment
to give effect to that; I may do so at the next stage of the Bill if
that becomes relevant.</p><p><a name="06102454000127"></a>Personal
and social life skills and education are important because they are
essential in the workplace and in the family. In short, social
education is about the skills that one needs to get on with other
people, and personal education is about the skills that one needs to
get on with oneself. A child&#146;s ability to be comfortable in
their own skin is fundamental to 



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1093"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1093</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>success in school and in later life. It is vital to develop enough
self-esteem and communication skills to be able to listen, to express
oneself, to negotiate, to resolve conflict, and to establish and
sustain effective and positive relationships with adults and within
peer groups, as these are the most crucial skills of all in life,
whether in the workplace, the family or elsewhere. Most children start
to learn these skills very early on in the family but, for those who
are not so lucky, it is crucial that the school is ready to move in and
fill the gap.</p><p><a name="06102454000128"></a>The noble
Baroness, Lady Walmsley, has given several examples of what is going on
at present. Research shows that, in most disadvantaged families today,
verbal and social ability has deteriorated since 1999&#151;a
statistic that the noble Baroness did not give us. In her studies on
child health, Professor Stewart-Brown has shown that relationships in
the home during childhood are a determinant of mental and physical
health in childhood and in adult life, and that this effect is
independent of socio-economic factors. That also applies to
relationships at school. The National Autistic Society has told me that
it surveyed 35,000 parents, almost all of whom put better teaching in
personal and social education first in meeting the needs of autistic
children.</p><p><a name="06102454000129"></a>Family breakdown,
domestic violence, anti-social behaviour, school failure and bullying
at school can be traced back in many cases to poor communication and
negotiation skills. It is at least arguable that, for the most
disadvantaged children in our society, better interpersonal and
communication skills are the key that could unlock the prison of
exclusion, frustration and
hopelessness.</p><p><a name="06102454000130"></a>In his amendment
to Clause 6, the Minister has introduced a duty on local authorities to
provide or procure out-of-school activities for all young people. I
welcome this proposal. Out-of-school activities are an excellent way of
developing self-confidence and teaching personal and social skills, but
they should be additional to, not instead of, an obligation on all
schools to provide effective PSHE, especially to the most
disadvantaged. Unless someone is obliged to deliver this subject, some
of the most vulnerable children will fall through the
net.</p><p><a name="06102454000131"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew67"></a><a name="06102454001009"></a>Baroness

My Lords, I support Amendments Nos. 91A

in your Lordships&#146; House. I appreciate his commitment to the
subject, as well as the developments that have been made since this
matter has been his responsibility. Those developments include the
<I>Teacher&#146;s handbook</I>, the guidelines for the 12 subjects
that make up PSHE, and the establishment of the first PSHE subject
association&#151;an association for teachers of PSHE to share
examples of good practice and to promote PSHE through the healthy
schools initiative. We should also appreciate that 5,000 teachers have
benefited from the PSHE certification programme, although, as the noble
Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said, that is nowhere near enough. Teachers
must have far more understanding of the importance of PSHE teaching. I
cite one example 



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1094"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1094</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to justify that point. I recently asked a headmaster of a boys&#146;
school in London about the PSHE programme in his school. He replied
that the school did not need PSHE teaching because it was a
boys&#146; school. I do not understand that logic, but the idea is
all too prevalent that subjects such as this mean that we are talking
only about girls, but of course we are not; we are talking about the
need for boys, too, to have that
training.</p><h5><a name="06102454000335"></a>3.30
pm</h5><p><a name="06102454000132"></a>I want to give three
definitions from Government documents that support the case that we are
all making. I make no apology for quoting back to the Government some
of the things that they have said. The <I>Teacher&#146;s handbook</I>
defines PSHE as,</p><ul><a name="06102454000317"></a>&#147;a
planned programme of teaching and learning that promotes pupils&#146;
personal and social development, their health and well-being. It helps
to give children and young people the knowledge, skills and
understanding they need to lead confident, healthy and independent
lives. It ... helps them understand how they are developing
personally and socially, tackling many of the moral, social and
cultural issues that are part of growing
up&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06102454000133"></a>On the national
curriculum, the Government state that the aim of the school curriculum
is to,</p><ul><a name="06102454000318"></a>&#147;promote
pupils' spiritual, moral social and cultural development and prepare
all pupils for the opportunities, responsibilities and experiences of
life&#148;.</ul><a name="06102454000271"></a>Finally, the
<I>Teacher&#146;s handbook</I> also
states:<ul><a name="06102454000293"></a>&#147;Effective sex
and relationship education is
essential&#148;&#151;</ul><a name="06102454000272"></a>I
repeat,
&#147;essential&#148;&#151;<ul><a name="06102454000319"></a>&#147;if
young people are to make responsible and well informed decisions about
their lives. A successful programme will help young people learn to
respect themselves and others, and move confidently from childhood
though adolescence and into
adulthood&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06102454000134"></a>If we were
to take those words as they are written, there would be no need for
this argument, because the Government have presented their own case for
making the subject statutory. If those aspirations had become reality,
we would see better pupil behaviour, attendance and attainment, a
reduction in bullying, improved levels of physical and mental health, a
greater ability to stay safe, a decrease in early sex and a reduction
in teenage pregnancy, which are all values to which the Government are
committed.</p><p><a name="06102454000135"></a>This morning, I spoke
at a conference on teenage pregnancy. There was a speaker from
Gateshead, where the level of teenage pregnancy has declined quite
substantially. The speaker said that one of the main reasons for its
decline was that children are taught PSHE and SRE in their schools.
Again, there is no better case for the argument that we are making.
</p><p><a name="06102454000136"></a>In Committee, the Minister said
that many aspects of PSHE are already statutory, such as SRE and drug
guidance, and that a number of requirements on schools support PSHE,
such as policies on bullying and child protection. I follow the noble
Baroness, Lady Walmsley, and say politely to my noble friend that that
is a rather disingenuous argument: only elements of SRE and drug
education are a part of the statutory science curriculum. The teaching
is too biological and infrequent and it completely ignores the
relationships and emotions that the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, so
clearly identified. I refer again to the teenage pregnancy argument
from the &#147;deep 



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1095"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1095</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>dive&#148; activity, which confirmed that in all those areas where
there is effective teaching there is a reduction in the level of
teenage pregnancy. Similarly, evidence from Stonewall shows that the
answer to homophobic bullying in schools is effective and statutory
PSHE in all our schools, thus enabling young people to discuss the
different relationships and families that are reflective of the world
in which we live.</p><p><a name="06102454000137"></a>My noble
friend also said in Committee that this is not a straightforward issue,
which is true. The current complexity means that there is confusion and
nervousness among teachers on what they can legitimately teach, what is
statutory and what is optional. I hope that my noble friend will agree
that, surely, the answer is to make PSHE in its entirety a statutory
subject; if that is done, you get over that complexity and
confusion.</p><p><a name="06102454000138"></a>The noble Baroness,
Lady Walmsley, cited a number of organisations that have supported this
demand. I should like to mention one or two more: the Catholic
Education Service, the Church of England Board of Education, Mencap,
the Methodist Church, the Mothers&#146; Union, the Parenting Forum,
Relate, the Independent Advisory Group on Teenage Pregnancy and the
organisation that I chair, the Independent Advisory Group on Sexual
Health and
HIV.</p><p><a name="06102454000139"></a>I
understand that there are many other demands to make subjects
statutory, which of course must cause a dilemma for the Government. But
I challenge my noble friend to identify any other subject where the
demand is greater and the breadth of the organisations making that
demand is as wide as it is on this subject. I do not believe that the
Government&#146;s argument is sufficient. I sincerely believe that
while PSHE remains a non-statutory part of the curriculum and while
there are an inadequate number of trained staff&#151;be it teachers
or school nurses&#151;the teaching of PSHE will remain patchy, with a
continuation of bullying and risky behaviour, and a lack of respect of
pupils to one another, so that the best intentions of the Government
will be lost.</p><p><a name="06102454000140"></a>Finally, we need
to learn from the experience of European countries that have overcome
many of the problems that we face. The difference is that those
countries are characterised by an open attitude towards discussing sex
and relationships; they have comprehensive sex and relationship
education in all their schools and there is easy access to the sexual
health services and advice that are required. A part of what I have
quoted has come from a government document about learning from Europe.
I quote the Government&#146;s words back to them and ask: when is it
all going to
happen?</p><p><a name="06102454000141"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew68"></a><a name="06102454001010"></a>Lord

HIV/AIDS. Our message was basically, &#147;Don&#146;t die of
ignorance&#148;. We used television advertising, posters and we sent
a leaflet to every household in the 



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1096"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1096</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>country. Among some it was regarded as controversial. I remember meeting
the Chief Rabbi, who complimented me on the urgency of the campaign but
set out no fewer than 14 different reasons why he opposed it. One of
his arguments was that it encouraged promiscuity by introducing
children and young people to ideas of sex entirely unknown to them. I
did not agree with that argument. Indeed, I think effective prevention
is&#151;or should be&#151;one of the goals of any government. As it
happened, we were not flooded with a vast number of complaints after
the campaign&#151;in fact we had very few indeed&#151;but the
figures showed that knowledge increased very radically and infection
went down at the same time, not only HIV/AIDS infection but sexually
transmitted diseases generally.</p><p><a name="06102454000143"></a>However, 20 years on, I
am concerned by just how much those lessons have been forgotten. If you
ran a commercial company and conducted a major advertising campaign,
and then went off the air for the next 20 years, everyone would think
you were fairly eccentric. But that is exactly what has happened; there
has been no effective follow up. Because of medical advances, young
people may not now be dying of ignorance, but certainly they are
continuing to suffer in increasing numbers because of ignorance. That
is basically why I support the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06102454000144"></a>The degree of
ignorance in this country is of enormous concern to anyone who has
looked at this issue. The European survey carried out for the European
Commission, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, referred,
showed startling ignorance about how HIV/AIDS is spread and a startling
avoidance of some of the most obvious methods of preventing it. It is a
sad truth that for most young people today television, the media,
playground gossip and rumours are their primary source of important
information about issues such as pregnancy, sexually transmitted
infections and HIV. And yet countless surveys in this country have
shown that young people would like to see taught&#151;and better
taught than it is&#151;much more sex and relationship education. As
we have been told, some aspects of sex and relationship education are
currently taught as part of the biology curriculum, but we also know
that maintaining good sexual health involves far more than an
understanding of basic
biology.</p><p><a name="06102454000145"></a>Currently, I think that
provision is extraordinarily patchy. Some schools teach good-quality
sex and relationship education, in others it is poor quality and some
do not teach it at all. It should not be left to individual schools to
make the decision or to make the case for it. It is quite a difficult
case to make locally, where it does not necessarily come at the top of
people&#146;s priorities. Therefore, it is a responsibility directly
upon Government to make that case nationally and locally. I should like
to see the Government&#151;this one or whichever one
follows&#151;face up to the
challenge.</p><p><a name="06102454000146"></a>There
is an excellent document on the website of the Department for
International Development entitled <I>Talking about Health, Sex and
Pregnancy</I>. It sets out

health and rights in developing countries, and
says:</p><ul><a name="06102454000294"></a>&#147;People
need the knowledge and skills to make choices and safe decisions about
their sex lives. Sex education does not increase the number of sexual
partners among young people. In fact, it helps them make safer choices,
including delaying first sex, and reducing the number of sexual
partners they
have&#148;.</ul><a name="06102454000273"></a>To support and
fund good-quality personal, social and health education around the
world, as it clearly helps young people to make sensible, safer choices
to protect their own well-being, is an eminently sensible approach. It
seems reasonable to ask the Government to show the same concern for
young people in the United Kingdom and to ensure that all our young
people get high-quality personal, social and health education as part
of the national curriculum.
<p><a name="06102454000147"></a>This is a vastly important subject; it is
right that it should be raised at this stage, and I very much hope that
as a result of the Bill, we can at long last do something about
it.</p><p><a name="06102454000148"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew69"></a><a name="06102454001011"></a>Baroness

not take
long.</p><p><a name="06102454000149"></a>I can
see no good reason why citizenship should be statutory and PSHE should
not be when there is so much overlap in relation to personal and social
skills. I have seen the impact of PSHE in schools. I was a senior
teacher in charge of health education, as it was then, in a school in
south London, and I am now a governor of a school with a strong
programme of PSHE. In both cases, the programmes have undoubtedly
affected the ethos and behaviour in the schools. My noble friend Lady
Gould referred to bullying; I have seen bullying tackled and strong
personal and social skills developed in schools where there is a
programme.</p><p><a name="06102454000150"></a>Every school should
be enabled to have a strong and consistent programme of PSHE at every
stage of the curriculum. The noble Lord, Lord Fowler, correctly pointed
out that people forget, and we need to repeat messages if young people
are to retain those which are important for their health and
well-being.</p><p><a name="06102454000151"></a>In my experience,
five things are needed for such a programme and they may happen in all
schools only if a subject is statutory. The noble Lord, Lord Fowler,
talked about the patchiness of the provision. This is a difficult issue
because although some schools put the subject high on the agenda,
others do not. The first thing that is needed is strong support from
the head teacher and senior staff. Secondly, there should be a
designated teacher in charge of co-ordinating PSHE. Thirdly, teacher
training must be high on the agenda: teachers cannot just go into a
PSHE lesson using formal methods and hope that they will succeed in
instructing people how to behave. You cannot teach people how to make
decisions; they have to learn how to do it themselves. Fourthly,
schools need good resources to teach PSHE&#151;again, some schools
have them and make their own, some do not. Finally, there needs to be
information to parents about the programme. Some schools do these
things brilliantly, including the school where I am a governor. But
many do not and will not until PSHE is statutory and there is a policy
for it in every school.</p>

have always strongly supported the national healthy schools standard
programme. It, too, has achieved a great deal. However, it is mainly
about health and not about relationships, which are part of
decision-making for good health and valuable in helping young people to
learn how to make decisions for their own benefit. A comprehensive
approach to PSHE is required, and I strongly support it being a
statutory programme in
schools.</p><h5><a name="06102454000336"></a>3.45

Wedderburn of Charlton:</b> My Lords, does my noble
friend agree that to her five admirable requirements should be added a
sixth which we appear not to dare name; that is, the absence of the
religious lobby, which has prevented the matter being properly taught,
as the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, said, over the past 20
years?</p><p><a name="06102454000154"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew71"></a><a name="06102454001013"></a>Baroness
Howe of Idlicote:</b> My Lords, I have listened to
the admirable speeches that have been made on this subject and, even if
I had not been persuaded by this whole debate, I certainly am now. I
hope that the Minister will be,
too.</p><p><a name="06102454000155"></a>As some
of your Lordships will know, I was appreciative of citizenship being
made a statutory part of the curriculum. I remember our debating how
important it would be to teach parenting&#151;not just how you got on
with your own parents, but what your thoughts were when you became you
became a parent and what you reckoned your responsibilities were, as
well the enjoyment you were going to get out of it. There seems to be
no reason why all these subjects, which are very important in
today&#146;s world, are not clearly joined up and made a compulsory
part of the curriculum. Far more importantly, they should be taught
together so that they are not spread about in other parts of other
people&#146;s lessons, thereby preventing the message coming across.
I agreed with my noble friend Lord Northbourne when he said that
children should emerge from the education process feeling comfortable
with themselves. That will be important in how they negotiate their way
through the world.</p><p><a name="06102454000156"></a>However, they
will learn so much within their own community about they can be a more
effective part of it and how they can be tolerant of what happens in
their own groupings. Bullying was mentioned. It is horrifying to hear
how often people who are involved in such activities as caring for
disabled, disadvantaged or drug-ridden parents get bullied because they
are not in attendance the whole time or for whatever reason they are
picked on.</p><p><a name="06102454000157"></a>I hope that the
Minister will give strong consideration to all three of these
amendments. All three of them are important. I remember the time when
the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, acted on the HIV/AIDS scare. For the first
time, you could see action being taken&#151;it had a very good effect
indeed. In other areas, the same preventive measures were not taken,
and we know what happened.</p>

Hylton:</b> My Lords, we have heard
several eloquent speeches in favour of the first two amendments. I
shall support the third amendment, Amendment No. 92, in the name of my
noble friend Lord Northbourne. He was right to emphasise pupils&#146;
self-esteem. There are surely ways of achieving it. If children can
excel at something or other in the course of their school lives, there
is hope that they will emerge as confident adults. Amendment No. 92 is
not in any way in competition with the other two amendments in the
group. It is parallel and supports them at a different level in the
scheme of the curriculum.</p><p><a name="06102454000159"></a>Unless
individuals acquire self-esteem, they will be continually subject to
bullying and will feel obliged, quite often, to prove their own
virility, perhaps by fathering unwanted children, and will have
continuing problems through the rest of their lives. What we should aim
for is self-respect and individuals taking responsibility not only for
their health but for their relationships. I hope that Amendment No. 92
will commend itself to the
Government.</p><p><a name="06102454000160"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew73"></a><a name="06102454001015"></a>Baroness
Howarth of Breckland:</b> My Lords, I support
Amendments Nos. 91A and 91B and, very briefly, want to add another
dimension. I support it because I think it is what the children need. I
say that having listened and talked to hundreds of children during my
time at Childline and having read case
notes.</p><p><a name="06102454000161"></a>If the Minister looked at
the lists in the Childline report, he would find that many children
call about relationship problems across the whole spectrum. Some of the
answers that they come up with themselves&#151;I was reminded of this
by the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Fowler&#151;they have gleaned
from the media or television and are frankly sometimes bizarre. I would
much rather that they had that information from a good PSHE teacher,
could discuss those issues with their peer group and could be given
answers with greater clarity than some of the bizarre answers about
sex, social life, relationships and other families that I have heard
from children down the years.</p><p><a name="06102454000162"></a>I
do not want to say more than that. I should like to know what the
argument is for not making PSHE teaching compulsory in
schools.</p><p><a name="06102454000163"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew74"></a><a name="06102454001016"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, I shall first deal with
Amendment No. 92, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne,
which would make personal and social skills a foundation subject at key
stage 4. While we agree that personal and social skills can and should
be developed across the school curriculum, they are usually taught
discretely through personal, social and health education. We are
discussing that issue under Amendments Nos. 91A and 91B. I hope,
therefore, that the noble Lord will allow me to address my remarks to
PSHE, as I see the two amendments as being in competition with each
other in that
sense.</p><p><a name="06102454000164"></a>As the
noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, and my noble friends said, we have had a
non-statutory framework for PSHE in place since 2000. We believe that
the right course is to strengthen the teaching of PSHE and
not 



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1100"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1100</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to create a new statutory subject. On the strengthening of PSHE, we
absolutely share the commitment set out by the noble Baroness, Lady
Walmsley, the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, and my noble friends. The issue
is not whether we should strengthen PSHE significantly, because we are
doing that&#151;and I shall set out in a moment how we are. I take it
for granted that we should strengthen the subject and I simply echo all
the remarks that have been made about its importance. The issue under
the amendments is, rather, whether at this stage it would be desirable
to make it a statutory subject&#151;or, perhaps I should say, a more
statutory subject than it is at the moment because, as I said in my
remarks in Committee, many aspects of PSHE are already statutory
elements of the curriculum, including sex and drugs education. There
are also statutory provisions relating to careers guidance and a number
of statutory requirements on schools that support PSHE, such as the
need for policies on bullying, promoting race equality and child
protection.</p><p><a name="06102454000165"></a>To make PSHE
statutory would be a complicated business of unpicking existing
statutory provisions to replace them with a new one. But there is
another aspect&#151;and I shall be frank on this matter. Later we
shall discuss making science in a different way statutory and
compulsory. We have had debates about modern languages in that regard.
This is not the only subject about which there is an intense debate on
making it statutory and compulsory; it applies to many other subjects.
If we were to take this step, I am sure that we would face an
equivalent argument that we should follow exactly the same course in
respect of a number of other subjects. That would get us into a further
set of very prescriptive requirements on schools from the centre of a
kind which in other contexts noble Lords have argued against throughout
our debates on the Bill. We need to balance the steps that it is right
to take to improve the take-up of PSHE in schools with the specific
issue of whether at this stage it is right to make it a further
statutory requirement on
schools.</p><p><a name="06102454000166"></a>In respect of what we
are doing to promote

Wedderburn of Charlton:</b> My Lords, will the

for which, as I took it, equal argument could be made? It is a very
important statement. I am sure that he has a list of subjects and that
he will be able to measure the Government&#146;s case by looking at
the strength of those which he thinks are as strong as this
one.</p><p><a name="06102454000168"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew76"></a><a name="06102454001018"></a>Lord

amendments of the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, on science. The noble
Lord may wave his hand but he asked me a question which I seek to
answer. On the previous day of Report, amendments on modern foreign
languages were discussed. The noble Lord, Lord Dearing, whom I am glad
to see is present, is considering that issue. There is strong support
from a wide spectrum for a more prescriptive regime. Every time I meet
my colleagues representing the history and geography communities there
are calls, including

that the case for other subjects is equally strong. The noble Lord may
not form that view, but strong views on those subjects are
held.</p><p><a name="06102454000174"></a>We have actively sought to
improve PSHE. My noble friend Lady Gould mentioned the healthy school
standard, as did my noble friend Lady Massey. Our target is that over
half of schools should have achieved the healthy school standard by the
end of this year. Some 48 per cent have already achieved it. I believe
that we shall exceed the target of over half achieving it by the end of
this year. More than 75 per cent of schools are engaged in the
programme. To achieve the healthy school standard&#151;in which
weare investing more than &#163;12 million this year, up
from &#163;5 million in 2003-04&#151;the first criterion is
evidence of how the school delivers personal, social and health
education, including sex and relationship education and education on
drugs, including alcohol, tobacco and volatile substance abuse. The
healthy school status guide is made available to all schools. As I say,
48 per cent of schools have achieved the healthy school standard and
many others are coming through. All the opening sections of the guide
relates to PSHE. It states that a healthy
school:</p><ul><a name="06102454000295"></a>&#147;1. uses the
PSHE framework to deliver a planned programme of PSHE, in line with
DfES/Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA)
guidance;</ul><ul><a name="06102454000296"></a>2. monitors and
evaluates PSHE provision to ensure the quality of teaching and

school nurse, sexual health outreach workers and drug education
advisers&#148;.</ul><a name="06102454000275"></a>The noble
Baroness will know that we have a target of every cluster of schools
having a school nurse in place by 2010. A healthy school
also,<ul><a name="06102454000321"></a>&#147;ensures
provision of appropriate PSHE professional development opportunities
for staff ... has mechanisms in place to ensure all pupils&#146;

the whole school environment, including those with special educational
needs and specific health conditions, as well as disaffected pupils,

its PSHE activities. <h5><a name="06102454000337"></a>4

place for PSHE teachers. The noble Baroness said that we have further
to go, and I accept that, but we have 5,000 teachers in place at the
moment. We have 2,000 enrolled in the programme, we are continuing to
sustain training at that level, and the certificate is at present
entirely free. We are building up a larger body of PSHE-trained
teachers. We are also establishing, as my noble friend Lady Gould
mentioned, a PSHE subject association to provide a network of support
for PSHE teachers and to increase their
confidence.</p><p><a name="06102454000176"></a>The noble Baroness,
Lady Walmsley, asked about the role of Ofsted. At the moment, it is
reviewing the delivery of PSHE in schools. It will be issuing a report
on PSHE by the end of the year, and we will look carefully at its
findings. I would not wish to rule out further statutory underpinning
for PSHE in the future; it needs to be kept under review. It is a vital
area of education in schools, and in due course it may well be
appropriate to bring in a statutory framework. However, at this stage
the priority is to continue to make real improvements on the ground and
to invest in training, support and incentives for PSHE rather than to
seek statutory changes that will be seen as nationally prescriptive and
run against our desire to have fewer, not more, statutory burdens on
schools. For those reasons, while we wish to see much stronger support
for PSHE in schools, the Government do not support the

reply and all other noble Lords for their supportive remarks. The
picture that I painted through the statistics that I listed in my
remarks is one of ignorance, with major serious consequences for the
lives of many young people in this country. It affects not just
individuals but the country as a whole. We need to take the long view
and use, at this point, the lever of compulsion, because none of the
other levers has worked. I am afraid that the Minister has not
convinced me that the levers that he is proposing will work.</p><p><a name="06102454000178"></a>He painted a very
confusing picture of how schools are delivering elements of PSHE and

other subjects,

equations every day of my life; people do not make decisions about the
lifestyle of the frog or how much coffee is grown in Brazil every day
of their lives. But the majority of citizens of this country make
decisions every single day of their lives&#151;large decisions and
small decisions&#151;which could be affected by good-quality PSHE

give all children the right to study three separate science subjects
until the age of 16; and the second group, which will give all
maintained schools the right to offer the rigorous IGCSE as an
alternative to the current option.</p><p><a name="06102454000192"></a>Taken together or separately, the first
cluster of amendments would reform science teaching in our schools.
Amendments Nos. 96 and 97 seek to confirm the policy pledges of the
Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his science and
investment framework initiative from this year&#146;s Budget.
Amendment No. 96 attaches an entitlement to study 



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1106"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1106</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the three sciences as separate subjects to those who attain level 6 at
key stage 3. Amendment No. 97 goes further and ensures that all
specialist science schools would provide that entitlement. Her
Majesty&#146;s Government have already pledged to achieve those aims
by 2008 in line with our amendments, so I hope that the Minister will
not shy away from the opportunity to cement that pledge in the Bill. To
me, Amendment No. 95 is of the utmost importance. It will allow all
pupils to study the three sciences as separate subjects until the age
of 16.</p><p><a name="06102454000193"></a>Noble
Lords will be extremely familiar with this debate. I was hugely
encouraged by the support for this topic from all Benches in Committee
and I have followed the recent media interest in giving an entitlement
to study the three sciences with great interest, not least because I am
so pleased that it has been given a place in the national debate that
it deserves. We are at the pinnacle of that debate today. We have an
opportunity to make a difference to our children&#146;s future
opportunities and to our children&#146;s future place in the world
economy.</p><p><a name="06102454000194"></a>We face a threat to
the future of science in this country. The problem is not a new one,
but it is acute. We live in a world where our competitors will stride
far ahead of us. The <I>Economist</I> recently ran a 15-page special
report on the &#147;The Search for Talent: Why it&#146;s getting
harder to find&#148;. It tells us of the problems facing a world that
is not educating its scientists adequately; and it tells of a world
where our competitors in Shanghai have established a human talent
market and where a Singaporean statesman, Lee Kuan Yew, recognises
that,</p><ul><a name="06102454000322"></a>&#147;trained talent
is the yeast that transforms a society and makes it
rise&#148;.</ul><a name="06102454000277"></a>Yet our
teaching of the most important subjects outside numeracy and literacy
has been demoted&#151;it is the privilege of those who must prove
their achievement at a young age.
<p><a name="06102454000195"></a>It is not acceptable to segregate
children from a proper science education should they seek one, purely
because they do not get the grades when they are 14 years old. Whatever
a child&#146;s ability, the children whom we are educating for the
future need to have the option to undertake a rigorous course of
study&#151;a course that teaches the learning of hard, empirical
fact, that teaches how to analyse that fact, that teaches how to
formulate an argument based on that analysis and, what is more, that
teaches young adults how to assess rigorously the success or otherwise
of that process of learning, application and analysis.</p><p><a name="06102454000196"></a>The relative merits&#151;or lack
thereof&#151;of this new single science course are widely publicised.
The narrowing of the curriculum is patronising at best, and incredibly
damaging at worst. The rector of Imperial College London, Sir Richard
Sykes, stated on BBC news
that,</p><ul><a name="06102454000323"></a>&#147;for those who
really want to go on and study a subject in depth, and particularly go
to a good university like Imperial, then they'll never get there unless
they study the individual subjects and take A-levels in these
individual subjects&#148;.</ul>

forgive me if I do not today analyse the virtues of studying a module
entitled &#147;You and your genes&#148;. It sounds rather like a
fashion module that has found its way on to the science curriculum. I
was appalled to read the words of Andrew Hunt, who has personal overall
responsibility for developing the new so-called <I>Twenty First Century
Science </I>curriculum, including the single science course. He stated
in a public
e-mail:<ul><a name="06102454000302"></a>&#147;What Twenty
First Century Science also offers in 'Science' is an engaging course
for students who will not take their Science
further&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06102454000197"></a>I do not
accept that the amendment will incur a spending commitment. The study
of the three sciences will take up a maximum of 10 per cent extra
curriculum time over and above the 20 per cent taken up by the dual
award, or the new single-plus additional science syllabus. I do not see
why an extra science could not be chosen in lieu of another subject.
Furthermore, in answer to the Minister&#146;s concern about teacher
numbers, I accept that there is a dearth of science teachers today, and
applaud the creation of new incentives. However, all schools offer the
dual science awards now. There is much that can now be achieved on the
available resources.</p><p><a name="06102454000198"></a>We know
from an Answer in another place over a year ago that Her
Majesty&#146;s Government expect that at least 80 per cent of
students should do at least two science GCSEs. That is to say that, at
the very least, 20 per cent of pupils will study the single sciences
course. This is a course whose own creator has acknowledged is useless
outside the classroom; it will do nothing to prepare our children for
the realities or facts of a world that will demand far more scientific
attention on the environment and energy provision than ever
before.</p><p><a name="06102454000199"></a>Aldous Huxley got it
right when he
said:</p><ul><a name="06102454000303"></a>&#147;Facts do not
cease to exist because they are ignored&#148;.</ul><a name="06102454000279"></a>Let us not ignore the facts today. I
hope that the Minister can act in the spirit of consensus with noble
Lords from all Benches, and allow this important entitlement into the
Bill. I beg to move.

Walmsley:</b> My Lords, we are minded to support this
amendment. We accept that it does not make all three sciences
compulsory, but it gives children a choice in how to study
science.</p><p><a name="06102454000201"></a>I am
afraid that we do not agree with comments of the noble Baroness, Lady
Buscombe, about the <I>Twenty First Century Science </I>curriculum. It
is a perfectly appropriate option for some young people. We are,
however, concerned about the drop in the number of young people
choosing science at A-level. For certain young people, studying
separate sciences would be preferable. While the new science curriculum
is so young and new, it would be dangerous to get rid of the three
sciences&#151;not allowing young people to make that choice&#151;as
it is evaluated.</p><p><a name="06102454000202"></a>There may be some
practical difficulties. Not every school currently has people suitably
qualified to teach the three separate sciences. However, if the
Government are serious about encouraging schools to work together in
federations, in groups within a trust and with colleges in the local
environment, I see no reason why the 



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1108"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1108</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>separate sciences should not be offered by that group of schools to a
young person who wants to take them. He may not be able to study each
under a qualified teacher in his own school, but I am sure that, by
working together in the sorts of ways that the Government have already
envisaged, schools would be able to do it. They do so already, with
their sixth-form provision; schools often offer subjects in the sixth
form by working together so that some subjects are delivered in one
school and some by the school down the road. That could also be done at
key stage 4.</p><p><a name="06102454000203"></a>What we really should
do is train more properly qualified science teachers, but will we
achieve that by taking away the option to study the three separate
sciences? I am not convinced about that. In the early stages of the
<I>Twenty First Century Science </I>curriculum, until we are sure that
it will increase the number of young people taking separate sciences at
A-level, which they will need if they are going to go on to science
careers, we should not throw the baby out with the bathwater. That is
why we are minded to support this
amendment.</p><p><a name="06102454000204"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew87"></a><a name="06102454001029"></a>Lord

admirably with the chapter about science education in the report of the

chaired the sub-committee, and we did not initially intend to have a
chapter about education. However, we received so much evidence from all
sides that much of the problem of the alienation of the public from
science starts in the schools that we decided that we needed to address
the subject as part of our wider study. I am very glad we did, because
the people who devised this new syllabus&#151;they were working
independently from us&#151;told me very early on that they applauded
us for addressing the subject. We agreed that, as the new syllabus
emerged, it would closely reflect the philosophy of the Select

two long meetings with him in the past week. In the end, he agreed that
we are fundamentally trying to achieve the same objective. However, not

does not meet the need for pupils to study the three sciences
separately. I must say to my noble friend, with the greatest of
respect&#151;as they sometimes say in the courts&#151;she has
misdirected herself. I have a note from the Nuffield Foundation, which

clearly:</p><ul><a name="06102454000304"></a>&#147;Science

My Lords, I want to intervene briefly,
as my noble friend has suggested that I am wrong. I hope that I made it
clear in Starred Questions earlier this afternoon that, in relation to
the <I>Twenty First Century Science </I>syllabus, the separate sciences
will be offered only to high achievers from 2008. I am asking this

not think that I can make myself clearer.</p><p><a name="06102454000211"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew89"></a><a name="06102454001031"></a>Lord

say from my study of this subject is that for many pupils the academic

writes:</p><ul><a name="06102454000306"></a>&#147;Alongside
our scientific literacy GCSE we are offering two versions of additional
science to prepare for more advanced study. One is more
academic&#151;the other more applied and work related. The applied
science GCSE has turned out to be very successful in many
schools&#151;including schools in &#145;deprived&#146; areas. In
London there are a lot of schools in Hackney, Lewisham and Tower
Hamlets that have adopted the programme. Haggerston School in Hackney
was a particularly successful pilot school.</ul><ul><a name="06102454000307"></a>A very important point is that by

immensely sensible approach. My noble friend shakes her head. You
cannot teach the rigours of the separate sciences unless pupils are
motivated to take them and understand how they will fit into their
lives. That is the principal benefit of this new syllabus and it
relates to why so many of us have shared concerns about the reduction
in the number of pupils taking science A-levels and those going to
university, and the decline in the number of university courses
available. We have all been concerned about this and, as we pointed out
in the <I>Science and Society</I> report, the disenchantment starts in
the schools because the syllabus has not encouraged children to
understand the nature of
science.<p><a name="06102454000213"></a>The new syllabus does
that and it should be roundly supported. I do not disagree with my
noble friend&#146;s second amendment, Amendment No. 96, which seems
to express it perfectly. It
states:</p><ul><a name="06102454000327"></a>&#147;a pupil in
the fourth key stage who attained at least level six in assessments in
science for the purposes of the National Curriculum at the end of the
third key stage shall be entitled to follow a course of study in
science which leads to separate qualifications in the three
sciences&#148;.</ul><a name="06102454000285"></a>That
sounds very sensible. We certainly need the rigour&#151;the hard
graft&#151;necessary in physics, chemistry and biology if we are to
create the next generation of scientists to take over from those who
are currently carrying the
load.<p><a name="06102454000214"></a>That syllabus has a
great deal to commend it. I was grateful for the support of the
Minister and from all parts of the House this afternoon at Question
Time, because this is a notable advance. If I may say so, it is not
presented in a way more suitable for the pub than the classroom.
Unfortunately, that was a sound bite that the press found themselves
totally unable to resist, so it was repeated in a great many newspapers
and other media sources, but it is not true. The new syllabus simply
would not have the support of so many eminent scientists and scientific
bodies if that were all it was. It is much better than that and it
deserves our
support.</p><p><a name="06102454000215"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew90"></a><a name="06102454001032"></a>Baroness

out from the people at Nuffield, the word &#147;alongside&#148; was
used&#151;alongside the new syllabus, as I understand it, there will
be two further grades: one that is more applied and one that is more
academic. As I understand the letter, all of those will be offered at
GCSE alongside one another. What does &#147;alongside&#148; mean?
Does it mean that people may choose whether to take the syllabus
intended to make them scientifically literate but not scientists or
take either a more practical application of science or the full,
rigorous, three separate subject academic and experimental science to
which we are accustomed? Or is it that, in some schools, it will be
legitimate to offer only the scientific literacy syllabus, which seems
to be more a matter of discussion than laboratory
work?</p><p><a name="06102454000216"></a>I need that cleared up

expertise in this area and my mind is rather transfixed on modern
foreign languages right now, but I was involved in this matter when I
was chairman of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. I have
great sympathy with the concern of the noble Baroness to develop our
capability in sciences at the highest level. I should like to clear my
mind on some points.</p><p><a name="06102454000218"></a>Reference
has been made to A-levels. One can take the individual sciences at
A-level. The three amendments concern key stage 4. They state that if a
pupil has reached level 6 at key stage 4, he or she may have the option
of pursuing not general science but the individual sciences. My
understanding is that the only duty of the school in relation to key
stage 4 science is that the pupil should have followed the programme of
study in the 21st century science curriculum. There is no obligation to
take the GCSE in it, but they must cover the programme of study. The
expectation is that they will do the single-science paper, but they can
take any other single science they wish at GCSE. They can, for example,
take a single science as an additional science, which can be in an
individual science.</p><p><a name="06102454000219"></a>If the pupil
chooses at the end of key stage 3 to study the individual sciences, as
I understand it, there is nothing to stop that pupil taking the GCSE in
all three sciences, provided that he or she has covered the syllabus of
the 21st-century science. In doing those three sciences, apart from
some geology and astronomy, he or she will have done so. It therefore
seems that the opportunity is there for the pupil to do an individual
science, and I am keen that there should be that
opportunity.</p><p><a name="06102454000220"></a>When I was chairman
of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, I used to knock
respectfully at the door of the Royal Society and ask about the
individual sciences. There is such a gap between general science at
A-level and individual sciences that we are not getting the through-put
to A-level from the other sciences. The Royal Society used to tell me
that it was so important for pupils to have a general understanding of
science and that it was worried that, if individual sciences were
offered, girls would choose biology and not do physics or chemistry. I
used to leave abashed and defeated and say that I could not contest
against the Royal Society. I understand that the situation has changed
since then and that the only obligation now is to have covered the
syllabus for the general science&#151;the 21st-century science.
Provided the pupil does that, they can do all three sciences or take
the syllabus for the general science for one and do one or two of the
others. There are many
options.</p><p><a name="06102454000221"></a>There is nothing
between my objectives and those of the noble Baroness, who says that
the cut-off point should be whether the child has reached level 6 at
the end of key stage 3. That is a bit above average, but nothing
spectacular. When I was revising the national curriculum, there were 10
levels. I recommended reducing it to eight levels, because the high
levels were covered by the GCSE. The noble Baroness
proposes

think I agree with the noble Lord that a general understanding of
science is the important part of education. I would regret it if level
6 was regarded as adequate.</p><p><a name="06102454000222"></a>My
main point&#151;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong; indeed, I
am watching the officials&#146; eyes and mouths to see whether I am
getting it all wrong&#151;is that there are opportunities to pursue
the individual sciences. I cannot contest with the noble Lord or
comment on the value of 21st-century science, but I take his word for
it. I wanted to clarify what I believe to be the reality of the
options.</p><p><a name="06102454000223"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew92"></a><a name="06102454001034"></a>Lord
Sutherland of Houndwood:</b> My Lords, there are
clearly educational needs for at least two kinds of course in this
area. One is to provide an understanding of science for those who will
not become specialist scientists. There is a desperate need for that in
our culture. Many of the issues on which voters will vote in the next
election and in subsequent elections have a scientific content that
requires a basic understanding, for example, of where we go on GM crops
or nuclear power&#151;I could list the issues. There is a great need
for such education. Equally, there is a need for education in
specialist science areas. The question is how we reconcile the two. As
ever, my noble friend Lord Dearing is right&#151;we are not divided
over the objectives; the question is how we get
there.</p><p><a name="06102454000224"></a>My worry is that the
amendment would in effect compel the school to provide, in so far as it
entitles the child. The alternative, of course, is to compel the child
by loading up the core curriculum, which is what we used to do. What
this amendment proposes would create the same problem that affects
modern languages. We want to persuade people to opt for these courses,
and the way to do that is not to compel the school to provide them but
to ensure that teaching is improved and is of the highest quality. I
have to say that the statistics given earlier about the recruitment of
science teachers are very important. My feeling is that we tackle the
issue in the wrong way by compelling schools to provide. We should look
at ways to improve the quality of science education so that it becomes
attractive.</p><h5><a name="06102454000341"></a>4.45

Lewis of Newnham:</b> My Lords, I should like to add
one or two points. I agree with quite a lot of the discussion that has
been put forward today. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of
Roding, that we need the type of course being suggested. Having looked
into this&#151;not in detail, I must admit&#151;and having spent
the past 40 years involved in syllabus corrections and curricula
dealings in chemistry, I can look at it with a degree of objectivity.
</p><p><a name="06102454000226"></a>One problem is quite simple: we
have two different sections of the community, as we have heard. We need
to recognise that there is a need within the public to understand
science. However, my experience has been that the correlation between
that course and the 



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1113"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1113</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>A-level is a big step. A big difficulty that we face is that if we are
to do this course as well, we should reconsider the A-level. This
cannot be dealt with in a piecemeal fashion. In response to a question
earlier from the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, the Minister said
that a larger number of people are taking AS level, but those people do
not necessarily go on to take A-level. They are encouraged to take AS
level because, say, chemistry attracts them. When they start AS-level
or A-level chemistry, they find that it is not the same animal at all
and that it is a much more difficult animal to deal with, so they very
often drop it like a hot potato at that stage.</p><p><a name="06102454000227"></a>We cannot consider the
curricula in bits, as we do. There is a continuum that must go from
GCSE to AS-level to A-level and, perhaps I may dare say, to
universities. In many ways, universities are the culprits in this
because they set the standards of entry. Very often, they set the
standards by saying, &#147;We want the old A-level type of
result&#148; and do not recognisethe problems which have now
become inherent in the whole concept of modern day society; namely,
that we must educate people in a general way and then allow for
specialisation to come forward. I have great sympathy with the
suggestion being made. I believe that the only way we will deal with
the present AS/A-level is by having specialisation at earlier stages.
In my mind, the correct answer is to look now at the AS and the
A-level.</p><p><a name="06102454000228"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew94"></a><a name="06102454001036"></a>The
Earl of Listowel:</b> My Lords, I should like to put
a question to the Minister. I was a schoolboy science enthusiast and
had my first chemistry set at the age of eight or nine. I have been
stimulated by this tremendously important debate. Conducive to the ends
of this debate, what is being done to enable pupils to have access to
science laboratories during the school day and after school so that we
can motivate and engage them to go into further and higher levels of
study? It was valuable for me to be able to go to my science lab to
conduct experiments at break time all through my schooldays. I hope
that that question is helpful.</p><p><a name="06102454000229"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew95"></a><a name="06102454001037"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, this has been an immensely
useful debate. I should like to say to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin,
whose speech I greatly appreciated, that if every time I saw a
tendentious front page of a newspaper I cancelled my subscription to
it, I would be reduced now to reading House of Lords <I>Hansard</I>.
Important as that publication is, one probably needs a slightly larger
diet in order to survive from day to day. But the point that he made
about the misreporting of the new science syllabus was correct: it was
very poorly reported in the publication to which the noble Lord
referred.</p><p><a name="06102454000230"></a>I was delighted to
hear the support that has come from all sides of the House for the
science syllabus. We believe, as do Nuffield, Wellcome and others, that
it could play a very substantial role in boosting interest in science
among young people and in making it more interesting and exciting to
teach. Motivation

subjects, in the way that the noble Earl described. We stand by that
syllabus, which has been well received in the
schools.</p><p><a name="06102454000231"></a>I
am able to offer a correction to the noble Lord, Lord Dearing. It is
the first time in my life it has ever happened and I simply cannot
resist doing so. I have received advice from the Box that although it
is true that schools are obliged to ensure that students follow the
programme of study, there is also a statutory duty on schools to put
pupils in for public examinations for which they have been prepared.
Therefore there is a duty on schools to put pupils in for at least the
first of the science GCSEs. Wherever possible&#151;which will be in
the great majority of cases&#151;we wish pupils to be put in also for
the second general science GCSE. Indeed, we are about to introduce a
performance indicator from next year which will publicly identify,
school by school, the proportion of pupils who are entered for the two
science GCSEs. This is in response to concerns that the take-up of the
second science GCSE needed to be
improved.</p><p><a name="06102454000232"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew96"></a><a name="06102454001038"></a>Baroness
Walmsley:</b> My Lords, I am sorry to interrupt the
Minister but we need a little clarification on these Benches which will
be quite crucial to the decision that we make. Did I understand the
Minister to say that students who have taken the Nuffield science
course&#151;for which, I repeat, we have enormous
respect&#151;cannot take separate sciences at
GCSE?</p><p><a name="06102454000233"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew97"></a><a name="06102454001039"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> No, my Lords, absolutely not. I shall
come to the issue of the three individual sciences in a moment. Pupils
have an entitlement to the two new science GCSEs and the programme of
study that goes with it.</p><p><a name="06102454000234"></a>As to
the issue of the three individual sciences, which the noble Baroness,
Lady Buscombe, is seeking to promote, there is a great deal of unity of
purpose across the Chamber. I need to describe our policy because it
accurately reflects what both the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, and the
noble Lord, Lord Lewis of Newnham, set out in their criteria for how we
should approach the
subject.</p><p><a name="06102454000235"></a>Taking up the point
that the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, made earlier, there has been no
statutory entitlement to the three individual sciences. Before 1988, in
the national curriculum there was no entitlement whatever&#151;that
was part of the great problem with the education system. There was an
entitlement to the double science course thereafter, but not an
entitlement to the three individual sciences.
</p><p><a name="06102454000236"></a>However, when we sought
systematically to review the improvements we needed to make to school
science and to ensure an adequate supply of students going through the
system, and published in March our <I>Science &amp; innovation
investment framework 2004-2014</I>, which my department conducted with
the Treasury&#151;it is a detailed publication which owes
a

and I pay tribute to the work that he did&#151;we identified
precisely the point highlighted by the noble Lord, Lord Lewis of
Newnham: that for those students who perform more highly in science and
wish to proceed to AS and A-level, the individual sciences were likely
to prepare them better than the general science GCSE courses, and that
we should seek to extend the availability of the individual sciences
alongside the new science in society syllabus and the new general
science GCSEs.</p><p><a name="06102454000237"></a>The document
<I>Science &amp; innovation investment framework 2004-2014 </I>set out
very significant new entitlements that we intend to introduce to the
three individual sciences. It sets out two which are precisely captured
in the noble Baroness&#146;s AmendmentsNos. 96 and 97.
First, those pupils who achieve level 6 or above, who are the higher
performing pupils, in the key stage 3 test at the age of 14, should
from 2008 have an entitlement to study the three individual
sciences.</p><p><a name="06102454000238"></a>To give your Lordships
an idea of the scale of the entitlement we are introducing, this year
41 per cent of pupils achieved level 6 or above in science&#151;that
is 259,000 students. As of this year, only about 45,000 students are
doing the three individual sciences at GCSE. So we are increasing from
about 45,000 to 259,000 over the course of the next two years the group
of students who will have an entitlement to study the three individual
sciences. As I say, that is about 40 per cent of the cohort going into
GCSE which is a very generous interpretation of the group described by
the noble Lords, Lord Sutherland and Lord
Lewis.</p><p><a name="06102454000239"></a>Our second policy
announcement was that comprehensive schools which have a specialism in
science, of which there are nearly 300, should also, from 2008, have a
requirement to make available the three individual sciences, on the
grounds that in addition to schools already offering the three
individual sciences&#151;and quite a number of state schools
do&#151;they would have the greatest capacity to have teachers in
physics, chemistry and biology to offer the individual sciences. That
highlights the type of networking and cluster-type arrangements which
the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, described. We see them as hubs in
their communities for excellence in science education; they are the
schools most likely to be able to offer the three individual sciences,
and to do so on a collaborative basis with other schools.</p><p><a name="06102454000240"></a>That is a very
substantial addition to the entitlement that will be available to the
three individual sciences. We believe that that very ambitious
programme of extending entitlement to the three individual sciences is
as far as it is practical for us to go at the moment, given the supply
of teachers in the system. Despite the big incentives we have put in
the system, which have led to significant increases in the recruitment
of science teachers in all three disciplines, it is still not
sufficient for us to have a universal entitlement in all schools and
for all pupils to study the three individual sciences, much as I would
like to make that available now.</p>



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1116"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1116</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06102454000241"></a>As of January this year, the National
Foundation for Educational Research found that 26 per cent of schools
for 11 to 16 year-olds had no physics specialist, while 12 per cent had
no chemistry specialist. We are significantly increasing the supply of
both physics and chemistry teachers; we have set targets in the
documents to which I referred earlier for a very significant further
increase in both disciplines, and are increasing the golden hellos and
other payments to encourage graduates to come forward. But I do not
believe it would be appropriate and right for us to put in legislation
requirements on schools which they simply cannot meet at
present.</p><p><a name="06102454000242"></a>While
Amendments Nos. 96 and 97 reflect accurately the policy we have set out
to increase the availability of the three individual sciences and to
extend the entitlement substantially in the way in which I have
described&#151;up to about 40 per cent of the cohort over and above
those who can do the general science&#151;to make it a universal
entitlement at one stroke, as the noble Baroness proposes in Amendment
No. 95, would simply put a burden and a requirement on schools which
they are unable to meet. It is much better to go down the path
described by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, of having a great
increase in the supply of science teachers, focused particularly on the
science specialist schools, and then seeing how, from those hubs, we
can spread out a steadily wider availability of the three individual
sciences.</p><p><a name="06102454000243"></a>I hope
that the noble Baroness will not press Amendment No. 95. If she does,
we will simply be unable to support it because I cannot say that the
school system can deliver the objective she wants. However, with regard
to Amendments Nos. 96 and 97, under Clause 71(5)(b) the Secretary of
State has a power to prescribe entitlements in respect of science
within the curriculum. If she does not press those two amendments, I
will undertake to see how the requirements that the Secretary of State
prescribes reflect our policy on the further extension in availability
of the three individual sciences. I believe that that will secure the
objective that she is seeking in respect of her second and third
amendments. However, as I say, Amendment No. 95 is simply not
deliverable on the current scale of resources and the current capacity
of
schools.</p><p><a name="06102454000244"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew98"></a><a name="06102454001040"></a>Baroness

response. I accept that there is a critical shortage of properly
qualified science teachers. But my concern is that as long as the three
separate sciences are available only to those high achievers from the
age of 14, we will have even fewer qualified science teachers for the
future.</p><p><a name="06102454000245"></a>There is a downward
spiral in terms of the number of science teachers. I appreciate that
the Government are putting a number of incentives in place, and I
applaud that. But the fact that there is a lack of qualified teachers
should not be a reason why fewer pupils are allowed to study all three
of the separate sciences.</p>

<p><a name="06102454000257"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in
moving Amendment No. 98, I speak also to Amendments Nos. 102 and 103.
These amendments would allow the maintained sector to follow
alternative examination routes in order to drive up rigour and
standards in schools. Amendment No. 98 would allow pupils in maintained
schools to take the IGCSE in science and mathematics and ensure that
the qualification is considered acceptable in lieu of a GCSE for the
purposes of government league
tables.</p><p><a name="06102454000258"></a>When we previously dealt
with this issue in Committee, I was pleased that the Minister
recognised that the IGCSE is an &#147;effective programme of
study&#148;. The international GCSE has been offered since 1988 and
is recognised by universities and employers worldwide. More than 4,000
schools across the world, including more than 200 UK schools, teach
international GCSE, which is taken in more than 100 countries with
350,000 entries a year. This is tried and tested. Two exam boards,
Cambridge and Edexcel, already offer the IGCSE. It is recognised by
UCAS, which accepts the IGCSE in lieu of the GCSE.</p><p><a name="06102454000259"></a>Needless to say,
Governments overseas have seen the light and approved the IGCSE at
national and federal levels. The take-up of the exam in diverse
overseas curricula is striking. The United States is ahead of us on
this. The Florida state legislature lists the International GCSE as a
&#147;rigorous academic programme&#148;. IGCSEs are recognised by
the Department of Education of the Commonwealth of Virginia as 



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1121"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1121</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>equivalent to its own state standards. What is more striking is that
this Government support the IGCSE&#151;but only overseas. The
government-funded British Council delivers the IGCSE to over 45,000
candidates a year from all around the world. Noble Lords will
understand my surprise on reading the words of the Minister in another
place, Jim Knight, who stated:</p><ul><a name="06102454000314"></a>&#147;Inclusion of the IGCSE would be
contrary to the policy that the basics must be achieved by everyone if
the IGCSE has not first been proven to meet those
standards&#148;.</ul><a name="06102454000286"></a>Clearly,
the IGCSE has proven standards. It is good enough for British children
overseas, but not for children in the maintained sector at home, who
could benefit so much.<p><a name="06102454000260"></a>The
Chancellor is committed to closing the gap between the maintained and
the independent sector, yet as usual that means matching pound for
pound&#151;matching the quantity and not the quality of provision.
That is nothing less than unacceptable. The Minister mentioned a report
from the QCA on this subject in Committee. We have not read the report,
but I suspect that the QCA will continue to dig in its heels. Yet what
surprises me is that the Secretary of State has not seen the evidence
of his own Government&#146;s international practice and that of other
Governments.</p><p><a name="06102454000261"></a>A
news report from the <I>Independent</I> on 2 September showed that as
many as half of all independent schools have now adopted the exam. Head
teachers at independent schools say that the GCSE is no longer
sufficient preparation for A-levels. We have debated the inadequacies
of the new science curriculum. The maths curriculum has seen some
improvement in the recent commitment to scrap maths coursework, and I
hope that the Minister will confirm that policy today. The IGCSE
applies that valuable concept to all subjects. Christopher Ray, High
Master of Manchester Grammar School, has
said:</p><ul><a name="06102454000315"></a>&#147;We wanted the
coursework-free option because the coursework that is demanded for GCSE
maths is very routine and very
undemanding&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06102454000262"></a>It is sad
that we can only quote today from the independent sector. The
maintained sector is being denied the privilege of choosing its exams;
it is legally prevented from making those choices. I expect that
Members on the Benches to my right and the Benches opposite would agree
with us that that must
change.</p><p><a name="06102454000263"></a>Amendment No. 102 would
change the current system so that it is not necessary to take an
AS-level in order to complete an A-level course. It is based on the
recognition that the artificial split between AS and A2 has had a
detrimental effect on education at sixth-form level, which has become
exacerbated by an increasing obsession with the modularisation of the
qualification. I do not propose to abolish the AS-level; it is clear
that there is a need for a one-year course for pupils who do not intend
to take a subject further. I do not have any objection in principle to
the idea that this course can be upgraded to an A-level at a later
point. However, I fear that the AS-level has diluted what was a
rigorous, linear course of study under the two-year
A-level.</p>



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1122"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1122</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06102454000264"></a>Many
pupils have found that the AS has forced them to cut back on
extra-curricular activities. The summer term in the first year of sixth
form, when sixth formers often take on extra responsibilities in the
absence of those in the final year, has become disrupted by study leave
and examinations. The artificial split of a two-year course of study
into two one-year courses has resulted in students following up to 12
loosely connected courses and being assessed 12 different times.
Schools should have the choice to offer a rigorous, linear course that
allows for the development of intellectual maturity.</p><p><a name="06102454000265"></a>We have debated science
and maths, but let us not forget the arts subjects. Attainment in
English literature, history, geography and languages improves over
time. Graham Able, the head of Dulwich College, says that A-levels
are,</p><ul><a name="06102454000328"></a>&#147;lacking in
stimulus. They are putting in things that are simply to examined in
little chunks but have little real value. We are wasting a lot of time
doing coursework. It is doing simple things more
mechanically&#148;.</ul><a name="06102454000287"></a>It
should be extremely worrying that universities are already indicating
that some of the qualifications I mentioned are superior to the
A-level. If good schools adopt the most rigorous qualifications of the
international baccalaureate, the international A-level and the
Cambridge Pre-U, then the gap between those schools and poor schools
will be exacerbated
further.<p><a name="06102454000266"></a>Amendment No. 103
protects the status of the international baccalaureate. Although it is
currently approved by the QCA for teaching in maintained schools, the
amendment would give the qualification statutory protection. I feel
that such protection would be useful: it would reinforce the
respectability of the exam if Parliament were to approve it in this
manner. </p><p><a name="06102454000267"></a>I would also like to
expose the inconsistency of permitting the international baccalaureate
diploma, yet not the international GCSE. I think that it is
particularly inconsistent given that the international baccalaureate
diploma is approved by the QCA for the pre-16 age group. The Minister
needs to explain in which respects the international baccalaureate
differs from the international GCSE. I appreciate that it is a level 3
rather than a level 2 qualification, but the fact remains that a school
could offer the international baccalaureate to gifted and talented
students at key stage 4, but could not offer others the IGCSE at this
stage.</p><p><a name="06102454000268"></a>I look forward to the
Minister&#146;s response to these amendments, in particular to my
AmendmentNo. 98&#151;which I hope he can accept in the
interests of consistent opportunities and standards for all children at
all schools in this country. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06102466000001"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew102"></a><a name="06102466000130"></a>Lord
Alton of Liverpool:</b> My Lords, I associate myself
with the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, regarding the
IGCSE, the international baccalaureate and AS-levels. I touched on some
of those points at Second Reading. I would like to draw the attention
of the House to Amendment No. 99, standing in my name in this group,
which also returns to an issue that I raised at Second Reading and
concerns youngsters who may not be able to aspire to the levels of
attainment that the noble Baroness has just outlined.</p>



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1123"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1123</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06102466000002"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for agreeing
to meet Mr Mike Bell, who saw the Minister&#146;s officials, along
with colleagues from the Education Policy Network. I readily accept
that some tentative steps have been made in the Bill to move in the
direction that I have argued
for.</p><p><a name="06102466000003"></a>As at Second Reading, in
this amendment I hope to put the spotlight on the 30 per cent of pupils
who leave education at 16 with few or no useful
qualifications&#151;ordinary young people who have simply found
education difficult. Later in their lives, you may meet them as loving
parents, excellent mechanics, first-rate shop assistants, skilful lorry
drivers and a host of other careers that are vital to the economic and
social life of our nation. Lest too rosy a picture of this group should
lull your Lordships into complacency, consider that some 80 per cent of
the prison population are from this group and some become the
disaffected youth that so many towns-people fear on their streets at
night.</p><p><a name="06102466000004"></a>I would like to tell your
Lordships about real young people whose names have been changed, but
whose stories have been told to me by practising teachers: of Janie,
who worked hard every lesson, often got the work right in class, but
who always did badly in tests and exams, however hard she worked, and
of Bethany, who would often complete the work the teacher had set, but
most of her answers were wrong. Both have now left school and are
trainees in hair and beauty salons. Or I can tell you of Jamie, who
arrives in lessons so eager to get his hands on things that he often
gets into trouble for taking the teachers materials; or of Joe, who is
expected by his GCSE entitlement to work out the percentage efficiency
of a light bulb. He has struggled with ratio and never grasped
percentages despite hard work by himself and his teachers and the word
&#147;efficiency&#148; means nothing to him. And Ben hated school
so much that he would work only under threat of punishment, but is now
successfully engaged on an engineering apprenticeship. Those are just a
few voices from around 200,000 young people who, in one year group, had
academic abilities lying between the 5th and 30th
percentiles.</p><p><a name="06102466000005"></a>The
aim of the amendment is to give all those pupils the chance to leave
school with certificates showing what they can do. For many in this
group, the current system tells them only what they cannot do. Grades
E, F and G at GCSE are of no value as entry to courses, and employers
consider them to be &#147;fail&#148; grades. Around 55 per cent of
pupils achieve five A to C grades, but that means that 45 per cent do
not.</p><p><a name="06102466000006"></a>As I
have indicated, this Education and Inspections Bill goes some way
towards addressing the issue, and I welcome the fact that the new
specialist diplomas will be available at level 1, as well as at the
GCSE equivalent, level 2. I also welcome the introduction of the new
functional skills, which should enable teachers to focus on the basics
of maths and English with pupils for whom algebra and Shakespeare may
be inappropriate. However, these new courses are not yet available and,
while there is no guarantee that they will meet the needs of
non-academic pupils, I ask the Minister, in responding to the
amendment, at least to flesh out 



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1124"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1124</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>some of the detail of what they will involve and give us some kind of
timetable for their implementation. We need to remember that the same
institutions&#151;the Department for Education and Skills and the
QCA&#151;which are drawing up the new courses were also responsible
for the previous curriculum, which sadly has humiliated many of these
less able young people, turned them off education and, in some cases,
turned them against
society.</p><p><a name="06102466000007"></a>Our
gifted civil servants never were in the bottom set at school. They have
probably never been in regular personal contact with the people whose
plight I am trying to highlight in the amendment. When the national
curriculum was introduced in 1998, teachers found it so impractical and
prescriptive that in 1993 the Government very sensibly commissioned my
noble friend Lord Dearing&#151;then Sir Ron Dearing&#151;to make it
more manageable. As he indicated in our earlier debate on the previous
set of amendments, he slimmed it down considerably.</p><p><a name="06102466000008"></a>The curriculum proposals in the Bill are
further attempts to patch and mend the national curriculum to meet the
needs of real children found in real classrooms by real teachers,
rather than the intellectual model of a pupil which seems to stalk the
corridors of the Department for Education and Skills. Teachers tell me
that you have to teach these youngsters regularly for some time before
you come to terms with the fact that they are not simply misbehaving.
They tell me that, for some students, however many times you teach some
topics, however helpful the worksheet and however interesting the
presentation, some pupils continually report, &#147;I've no idea what
you are talking about, sir&#148;.</p><p><a name="06102466000009"></a>Classroom experience and research
evidence shows that the range of abilities in the average classroom is
far wider than is reflected in current GCSE courses. Surely it is time
to admit these facts and offer all pupils courses that stretch their
abilities and also give them the chance to succeed. After all, the word
&#147;education&#148; is derived from Latin. Its meaning is clear:
to draw out; to lead forth. For education to work, it must start from
where pupils are today and lead them
forward.</p><p><a name="06102466000010"></a>I suppose that if I
could caricature the amendment in one phrase, it would be &#147;Let
them succeed&#148;. The problem that we see today derives from the
concept of &#147;entitlement&#148;. It is used in the national
curriculum and we have heard much about it this afternoon. The Minister
may try to persuade the House that my amendment undermines the
entitlement of all pupils to a broad and balanced curriculum. If he
does tell us that, he will be wrong on two counts. First, my amendment
applies to key stage 4&#151;to 14 year-olds. It does not reduce the
breadth of the curriculum at key stage 3&#151;the first three years
at secondary school. Secondly, it does not allow pupils to opt out of
core subjects. It simply gives them the right to follow, for example, a
course in mathematics to which they are
suited.</p><p><a name="06102466000011"></a>This
so-called entitlement is a dangerous corruption of the use of the word
in common parlance. To most of us, if we have an entitlement, it means
that we can choose to have it or not. In education, however,
entitlement 



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1125"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1125</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>means compulsion. All pupils must follow this or that course. Let us
imagine that when you joined a gymnasium you were
&#147;entitled&#148;&#151;for which we should read
&#147;compelled&#148;&#151;to run 10 miles on the treadmill and
lift 100 pound weights. For some, that would be physical education; for
others&#151;probably people like me&#151;it would be a disaster. It
has been the same in education for 15 years. Some aspects of this
entitlement have driven some pupils to despair, disengagement and
disaffection. Any sensible gymnasium assesses each member and gives
them a training programme designed for their particular needs. Although
that cannot be done to the same degree at school, my amendment would
move the curriculum in that
direction.</p><p><a name="06102466000012"></a>Whenever teachers
talk about their work, the same themes repeat themselves: staff leaving
through stress, poor classroom behaviour, disaffection with learning
and dumbing down of academic standards. Employers complain of skill
shortages and low standards of literacy and numeracy. At first these
appear as separate issues, but a closer look reveals deep connections.
They all result from treating pupils as though they were
similar.</p><p><a name="06102466000013"></a>Taking an average
form-group of 30 pupils just starting their GCSE courses in year 10,
their key stage 3 results from earlier in the summer tell us that there
are three pupils at level 3 or below, five at level 4, 11 at level
5&#151;the average for this age group&#151;eight at level 6 and
three at level 7 or above. Those figures may not mean much to the lay
observer, so translating them into notional academic ages reveals that
the average form starting at year 10 contains three 8 year-olds, five
11 year-olds, 11 14 year-olds&#151;the age of most year
10s&#151;but also eight 16 year-olds and three pupils with the same
thinking skills as good university students. That is a remarkably high
range. We would find it strange if we were to have 11 year-olds and 16
year-olds in the same class, but, in terms of academic age, that is the
pattern at age 14 in every non-selective school in the country. The
idea that we should be offering all pupils variations on the same
course, as at present, is simply
nonsense.</p><h5><a name="06102466000125"></a>5.30
pm</h5><p><a name="06102466000014"></a>Further
evidence comes from Shayer and Adey's research at Kings, London on
cognitive acceleration. Many schools use CASE in
science&#151;cognitive acceleration through science
education&#151;or its equivalent, CAME, in maths. These programmes,
which are proven to work, are based on an understanding which divides
thinking into two broad groups: first, everyday concrete thinking,
which is largely about facts and descriptions of the world; and,
secondly, abstract formal thinking which requires a mental
process.</p><p><a name="06102466000015"></a>The research shows
that only about 30 per cent of the adult population develops the
abstract thinking skills needed for academic courses. That key fact is
too often overlooked when education policy is being made. Not only do
we have an age range of at least eight years, but it is divided into
two distinct groups: those who can access the abstract topics and those
who, at this stage of their lives at least, cannot. Failure is bound to
follow if policy makers ignore those facts. Many of the problems
encountered by

forces teachers to put perfectly intelligent but concrete thinkers
through courses that require abstract
thinking.</p><p><a name="06102466000016"></a>To conclude, education
for some has become the basis for failure. While the Government have
indicated that they will oppose my amendment, I hope that the House and
the Government will at least give serious consideration to the
principles that lie behind it. Give every child the right to follow
courses which will show what he or she can do. Do not let us be
persuaded by talk of entitlement, but listen to what practising
teachers tell us about their daily experience with non-academic
students. Do not be persuaded by promises of functional skills,
specialist diplomas and foundation tier. Those have not yet been
written and there is no guarantee that they will succeed in meeting
that need. Spare a thought for the struggling pupil who feels
humiliation on a daily basis at school and for the teachers who
struggle to deal with their indifference. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06102466000017"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew103"></a><a name="06102466000131"></a>Baroness
Whitaker:</b> My Lords, I support Amendment No. 103
to encourage the use of the international baccalaureate. My interest in
this comes, first, from the fact that my elder son insisted on doing
the international baccalaureate and it has served him very well, and
secondly, and more objectively, I was a member of the European Union
Select Committee&#146;s Sub-Committee F when we examined labour
mobility. It was quite striking to note that one of the obstacles for
UK people with children moving into jobs in Europe was the
non-recognition of the leaving exam. The international baccalaureate is
the leaving examination in 124 countries and in almost all European
countries.</p><p><a name="06102466000018"></a>In particular I want
to remind the House of the evidence of the CBI in this matter. It is on
page 23 of the evidence attached to the report. The CBI points out
that,</p><ul><a name="06102466000113"></a>&#147;individuals in
families are more concerned about the education implications of
mobility&#148;,</ul><a name="06102466000077"></a>and
that,<ul><a name="06102466000114"></a>&#147;many families
like the opportunity to go and stay in another EU Member State, they
want their children to attend a local school and acquire various
language skills. They can actually see that as a very strong benefit of
a relocation&#148;.</ul><a name="06102466000078"></a>But
they do not move because their children's secondary education might be
undermined by having to do a different examination system. The CBI goes
on to state
that,<ul><a name="06102466000115"></a>&#147;many
employees find the international baccalaureate helpful because it is
broad enough and deep enough to be able to go to universities in most
European countries&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06102466000019"></a>Increasingly, UK universities are happy
to use the international baccalaureate as an entry qualification. I
think Oxford and Cambridge like it better because it is more rigorous
and broader. My noble friend will know that it is also flexible enough
to allow different levels of mobility within it. Today's <I>Education

that,</p><ul><a name="06102466000116"></a>&#147;Wales has

nearer to 45 per cent. I should also point out that I do not intend to

Sharp of Guildford:</b> My Lords, in speaking to
Amendment No. 100, in my name and that of my noble friend Lady
Walmsley, I shall speak also to other amendments in the group. Like the
noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, we support Amendment No. 103. It has
long been our policy on these Benches that we should broaden out the
offering to pupils aged 16, 17 and 18 and the international
baccalaureate provides
that.</p><p><a name="06102466000022"></a>However, we do not support
Amendment No. 98. We feel that it looks back to the days of GCEs when
there was a division between the sheep and the goats: GCEs for the
brighter pupils and CSEs for the less bright pupils. On the whole, we
feel that the IGCSE is based on the old GCE standard and is not
necessarily appropriate as a broad examination across a whole
range.</p><p><a name="06102466000023"></a>We have a great deal of
sympathy for Amendment No. 99, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord
Alton, but our policy is to implement the Tomlinson report which would
have brought this about. The amendment to which I want to speak tries
to bring a little more flexibility into the system of specialised
diplomas that is being introduced. I raised this issue in Committee and
since then I have had an opportunity to meet the QCA and Ken Boston to
discuss what is being proposed under the specialised diplomas. I now
have a much better understanding of what is intended and how the
process will work.</p><p><a name="06102466000024"></a>I tabled
this amendment again largely because I want to continue to register the
discontent on these Benches with the Government&#146;s interpretation
of the Tomlinson report. The new specialised diplomas, if studied
through to level 3, which is the A-level equivalent standard, will
incorporate many of the Tomlinson proposals: the broader base of
studies with a continuing role for maths and English, side-by-side, for
example, with engineering and the need for extended essays or the
practical equivalent in terms of a completed piece of artwork or an
artefact. We applaud that. We are pleased that these generally welcome
aspects of the Tomlinson report are to be incorporated into the
diplomas but we are disturbed about the degree to which the choice
between diploma and the GCSE and A-level route is likely to be made at
14 rather than 16, or indeed at 13 in terms of choices to be made a key
stage
4.</p><p><a name="06102477000001"></a>As
presented in the Bill, key stage 4 is when the routes divide and pupils
are given the choice of the GCSE route, which leads on to A-level, or
the specialised diploma route. We are all agreed that it is 



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1128"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1128</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>necessary to broaden the secondary school offering and provide more
courses with practical, hands-on content so that the many who learn by
doing rather than just by theorising may be better motivated to
continue their studies. That is the point made by the noble Lord, Lord
Alton. Nevertheless, it was intended that there should be an
opportunity not only for the demotivated teenager to study construction
skills or motor mechanics but for the aspiring engineer also to get his
hands dirty with some practical studies if he wished to. As it is, with
the key stage 4 diploma courses being the equivalent of five to six
GCSEs, there is neither the opportunity for the construction skills
student to study history nor for the aspiring civil engineer to study
construction skills.</p><p><a name="06102477000002"></a>The
Minister will emphasise, I am sure, the degree to which students may
switch courses at 16 and that the diploma courses at level 3 will be an
A-level equivalent and provide a good route to university entrance,
while the student who has taken the diploma course rather than GCSE may
be able to proceed to AS and A-levels. How many actually will switch at
this stage is yet to be seen. However, it is very depressing to read in
the <I>Times Educational Supplement </I>of 13 October that many schools
and local authorities are currently planning to ignore these new
specialised diplomas in the hope, as the headline has it, that they
will &#147;just go away&#148;.</p><p><a name="06102477000003"></a>High-achieving schools focusing on GCSE
and A-levels fear that if they shift their focus they will lose their
current high position in league tables. Low-achieving schools are
concentrating on raising their league table position and, again, do not
wish to divert effort and training into the new, untried areas. I hope
that that report in the <I>Times Educational Supplement</I> was unduly
alarmist and that things may change when the programme begins to roll
out in 2008. As things stand, however, we are fearful that diplomas
will be seen as an appropriate route only for pupils who are not bright
enough to take GCSE and achieve an A-to-C grade and that those who
switch from the GCSE route to the diploma route at 16 will be those
deemed poor prospects for A-level.</p><p><a name="06102477000004"></a>A key proposal in the Tomlinson report
was the ability for all pupils to have the possibility of studying the
practical side-by-side with the more theoretical. The present proposals
do not fulfil that ambition. This amendment has been tabled in
the&#151;I suspect rather vain&#151;hope that the Government will
even at this late hour introduce more flexibility into the choices
available.</p><p><a name="06102477000005"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew106"></a><a name="06102477000353"></a>Lord

before we could allow the IGCSE to be used in state schools, that it
met essential requirements in this regard.</p><p><a name="06102477000007"></a>In order to take that forward, my right
honourable friend the Secretary of State asked the Qualifications and
Curriculum Authority to study the IGCSE and to give us its advice. We
have now received its report. My right honourable friend proposes to
ask the QCA&#151;with the agreement of Cambridge Assessment and
Edexcel, the two awarding bodies offering the IGCSE&#151;to publish
its report so that the Government can invite a wider consultation
within the education community and beyond on the IGCSE&#146;s use in
the maintained sector. We will then look at the results of that
consultation with an open mind. I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady
Buscombe, will find this a constructive way forward and that she, her
party and other noble Lords who have expressed an interest will
contribute to the consultation. At the end of that consultation, my
right honourable friend and I will look at this issue to see whether it
would be appropriate to allow the IGCSE to be offered in state
schools.</p><h5><a name="06102477000028"></a>5.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06102477000008"></a>Amendment No. 99, tabled by
the noble Lord, Lord Alton, seeks to ensure that all young people,
whatever their level of ability, have access to courses in which they
can succeed and to which they are suited. I broadly agreed with the
noble Lord&#146;s remarks. In the past our curriculum has not been
sufficiently flexible or rich to offer students opportunities of the
kind that the noble Lord described. We accept that we must do a great
deal more to meet their needs and to ensure that they have a successful
experience of education so that they can leave school with skills they
can apply in the workplace and are not held back by an unduly rigid
curriculum and set of opportunities in school.</p><p><a name="06102477000009"></a>I believe that the reforms we are putting
in place will substantially, although perhaps not entirely, meet the
points that the noble Lord raised. We probably part company only on the
issue of continuing entitlements. Perhaps I may say to him in passing
that not all entitlements are statutory. If they were, we would not
have the problem that we now have in modern languages and we would not
be inviting the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, to issue his report. That is
a classic area, and there are many others, where we have entitlements
to provision within the curriculum that are not mandatory. They
sometimes cause us difficulties because they lead students to choose
not to follow those courses. In respect of modern languages, which is a
pertinent issue, it was precisely with the group of students which the
noble Lord mentioned in mind&#151;those who are under-motivated by
the current curriculum and need more flexibility as they come up to
GCSE&#151;that we were influenced to give more flexibility, to allow
more opportunities for particularly work-related learning, and not to
oblige students who have ceased to be motivated by particular subjects
to continue all the way to 16.</p>



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1130"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1130</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06102477000010"></a>That comes at a price, though, and our
debates on modern languages during the Bill&#146;s passage show that
the price can be a serious one where students choose not to follow
courses that we regard as worth while. But we have been prepared to go
down that road. The issue of some difficulty is the core subjects,
which the noble Lord mentioned and the House would not wish to see
unstudied in state schools up to the age of 16. Even here, however, I
suspect that the difference between the noble Lord and myself is more
apparent than real. He said that he would wish functional English and
mathematics to continue to be taught, and so do we.</p><p><a name="06102477000011"></a>The introduction of
diplomas will give more flexibility on that. The foundation level of
the diploma&#151;which is geared at students who currently achieve
between grades D and G at GCSE, precisely the group that the noble Lord
mentioned&#151;will offer those students the opportunity to succeed
with a worthwhile qualification. That will include, in its generic
components, English and mathematics of a functional nature and not the
whole programme leading to the current GCSE. Equally, we recognise the
larger role that work-related learning can play. From September we have
introduced the key stage 4 engagement programme, with precisely the
sorts of students that the noble Lord mentioned in mind. It is designed
to offer a motivating and engaging route for 14 to 16 year-olds at risk
of disaffection, has a significant work focus of up to two days a week
and is tailored to individual circumstances. From September, 21 schemes
began for up to 5,000 young people. We shall study the experience of
those schemes with care to see whether they are capable of wider
application. I will see that the noble Lord has full details of them
and can contribute to the ongoing debate about how we take this part of
curriculum development forward.</p><p><a name="06102477000012"></a>Amendment No. 100, in the name of the
noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, seeks to allow all young people to choose
to study both a specialised diploma and a course of study in one or
more of the four entitlement areas of the arts, humanities, design and
technology and modern foreign languages. The noble Baroness described
this as a probing amendment, to understand more what our thinking was.
I believe that her objectives are met by the design of the diploma as
it is being taken forward by the sector skills councils, the
departments and the QCA.</p><p><a name="06102477000013"></a>At each of the three
levels&#151;level 1, the foundation level; level 2, which is
equivalent to GCSEs; andlevel 3, which is equivalent to
A-levels&#151;the specialised diplomas will have three components: a
generic component&#151;English, maths and ICT; a principal learning
component that will be sector-related to the area of the diploma; and,
crucially, an additional specialist learning component. That additional
specialist learning component may be further intensive study in the
specialist area of the diploma&#151;for example, a student studying
engineering might study mechanical engineering in greater depth as part
of his additional specialist learning&#151;or it may involve taking
additional subjects within the scope of the diploma, which would, for
example, enable students in any of the diploma lines to study modern
foreign languages as part of their additional learning. At level 2, the
entire diploma will be equivalent to approximately six GCSEs. We have 



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1131"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1131</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not finally decided the number, but it is likely to be in that area.
That will give students the opportunity to study the equivalent of two
to three GCSEs in their additional learning component. The areas in
which students will be able to engage in additional learning will
include the four areas specified in the noble Baroness&#146;s
amendment: the arts, humanities, design and technology and modern
foreign languages.</p><p><a name="06102477000014"></a>I understand
the point that the noble Baroness made, but we are not seeking to
introduce new rigidities into the system. The whole purpose of the
diploma is to significantly enlarge opportunities and make it much more
possible for students to match theoretical and applied learning. We do
not believe that it will be difficult for students to change diploma
lines between levels 2 and 3. Students are not being required at the
age of 14 to take a decision about their diploma line that will bind
them until they finish school or college at the age of 18. On the
contrary, the level 2 diploma, which is likely to be equivalent to six
GCSEs at grades A* to C, will take students to the age of 16 when they
will decide whether to take A-levels or to follow a diploma line at
level 3, in exactly the same way as students who have gone down the
conventional GCSE route decide at the end of their GCSEs. We are not in
the business of introducing new
rigidities.</p><p><a name="06102477000015"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew107"></a><a name="06102477000354"></a>Baroness

another failed experiment in the introduction of a broader curriculum.
Because of the important entitlement that is set out in the Bill, we
will be in a very strong position to require schools and colleges to
take the introduction of diploma lines very seriously. We are also
establishing 14-to-19 partnerships across the country to ensure that
the full range of the new curriculum, including the specialised
diplomas, is available on a collaborative basis between schools and
colleges in the partnerships. That will give significant impetus to
making the enlarged curriculum properly available in all parts of the
country. I hope that I have met the noble Baroness&#146;s concerns on
that point.</p><p><a name="06102477000018"></a>Amendment No. 102,
tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, would mean that students
are no longer required to complete assessment at AS-level in order to
achieve an A-level. The AS-level currently makes up 50 per cent of
A-level assessment and is an important step in the transition from GCSE
to A-level. We agree that there should be less assessment and

report we announced our plans to reduce the number of assessment units
in A-levels from six to four so that students will have to study only
two units in the AS year and not three as is currently required. In
most cases that will lead to fewer AS assessments and will reduce the
assessment burden of the AS-level and the A-level by a third. It is a
significant reduction and goes in the direction that the noble Baroness
wants.</p><p><a name="06102477000019"></a>Amendment No. 103 deals
with the IB. I entirely associate myself with the remarks of the noble
Baroness, Lady Buscombe, and my noble friend Lady Whitaker in
supporting the IB. It is an excellent qualification and should be
widely available in the state system. However, the amendment is
unnecessary as the IB is already an approved qualification in the state
system. State-maintained and independent schools are already free to
offer the IB to students and it is currently being taught in over 70
schools and colleges in England including a large and growing number of
maintained schools. The Government are keen that students in the
maintained sector should have a wider opportunity to study it if they
so wish.</p><p><a name="06102477000020"></a>I hope that, on the
basis of those assurances, the noble Baroness will not feel it

sector. It is important that the Government respond to the need to look
at the IGCSE and I welcome their offer to allow Her Majesty&#146;s
Opposition to contribute to that consultation. I want to encourage the
Government in this direction and to send a strong message to the QCA
that it is right to allow schools to introduce the IGCSE. Why should
children in the state sector be denied that real opportunity to improve
their life chances? As I said in speaking to the amendment on separate
sciences, I know that many parents feel strongly that their children
should have a much more rigorous curriculum. In recent days I have
spoken to a number of heads in the independent sector and they have
told me that the IGCSE truly teaches the language and vocabulary of
science. That is why so many schools in the private sector have opted
for it in science and mathematics. If we are to create scientists and
mathematicians for the 21st century so that our children will be able
to compete at the forefront of the global economy of the future, they
must have the opportunity to study and cope with a harder and

noble Baroness said: My Lords, I am grateful that the amendment has now
been tabled in a separate group, and is not part of the large group on
faith issues in schools that we considered last week. This will avoid
the overlaps and confusions that we had when we last discussed
collective worship.</p><p><a name="06102466000029"></a>Collective worship is
an important issue. I do not intend to repeat the arguments advanced
last week; I shall simply try to put the nub of the argument to your
Lordships. Many faith organisations, teacher organisations and parent
organisations support the reform of collective worship in schools. They
want collective worship to be replaced by inclusive assemblies that are
meaningful to pupils. I do not want to abolish assemblies with a
spiritual nature&#151;indeed, the amendment does not seek to ban
religious worship&#151;but the organisations that I have just
mentioned do not agree to assemblies that are entirely about
worship.</p><p><a name="06102466000030"></a>Spiritual worship in
assemblies is good for the school ethos and morale, but it is quite
unsuitable and impractical to insist that all schools must conduct
worship in assemblies. Many are already technically breaking the law by
not doing so. Will the Minister confirm that the DfES is considering
collective worship? It is not a complicated issue. It is a sensible
reform that would free schools to be creative and to deliver
inspiring

include discussion of the teaching of many religions as well as
discussion of behaviour, values and social issues. The Minister has
clarified the position on pupils being excused from religious
education, and we should reconsider the issue at a high level. I beg to
move.</p><h5><a name="06102466000127"></a>6.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06102466000031"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew111"></a><a name="06102466000135"></a>Lord
Wedderburn of Charlton:</b> My
Lords, I support Amendment No. 104, in accordance with paragraph 6.54
of the <I>Companion</I>, because the amendment was discussed, in a way,
a week ago before your Lordships. It was a casualty of what I call
irrational grouping; that is, it was hidden in a grouping to which it
manifestly did not belong. That is an important issue which your
Lordships should consider this evening. Amendments remain the property
of the noble Lords in whose names they appear. They can alter a
proposed grouping, but very often&#151;sometimes because the
groupings appear rather late&#151;that is impossible, as it appears
to have been impossible for this amendment, which appeared in a vast,
almost surreal, grouping with other amendments when it came before the
House.</p><p><a name="06102466000032"></a>I
shall use this occasion deliberately to deplore the proposals that
departments sometimes advance for groupings that are manifestly
irrational and unhelpful. We thought that we had seen the back of this
sort of thing in the 1980s, but if 30 years&#146; experience in this
House has taught me one thing, it is that proposals for groupings
should be the basis of sensible and orderly debate. No department
should try to hide an awkward issue&#151;if that was the intention;
no doubt it was not in this case&#151;by putting it with amendments
that are manifestly not on the same
subject.</p><p><a name="06102466000033"></a>Amendment
No. 104, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, spoke last week, at
cols. 706-07 of the <I>Official Report</I>, addressed a duty that was
created only in 1944 for schools to have an obligatory daily act of
collective worship. The amendment, as the noble Baroness made clear,
would replace that duty with a duty to hold a daily assembly aimed at
supporting
people&#146;s,</p><ul><a name="06102466000117"></a>&#147;spiritual,
moral, social and cultural education&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official
Report</I>, 17/10/06; col. 707.]</ul><a name="06102466000080"></a>The importance of that phrase was made
clear earlier this afternoon.
<p><a name="06102466000034"></a>The act of worship needs to be broadly
Christian, but the amendment is of interest not only to humanists,
atheists or agnostics, or even to religions other than those with a
Christian tradition. This is a fundamental issue, which the Government
so far have not addressed. The Minister addressed Amendment No. 104 in
another sitting, but I hope that he will not mind my saying that I
thought that his reply to its case was rather perfunctory. No doubt,
having been given a little more time, he may do better
tonight.</p><p><a name="06102466000035"></a>The Minister claimed
that this obligatory act of daily worship
represented,</p><ul><a name="06102466000118"></a>&#147;the
values and traditions of the majority in this
country&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 17/10/06; col.
736.]</ul><a name="06102466000081"></a>I beg leave to doubt
whether that is now the case and suggest that it is out of date. No
doubt polls will be quoted, but I refer those who cite polling evidence
to 



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1138"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1138</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>an article in the <I>Times</I> only yesterday, in which an expert on the
matter said that polling is
increasingly,<ul><a name="06102466000119"></a>&#147;being
used to manufacture the headlines rather than uncover the
facts&#148;.</ul><a name="06102466000082"></a>The expert
is a chief executive of a very important polling
organisation.
<p><a name="06102466000036"></a>The Minister did not
address the substantive case, made by the British Humanist Association,
the National Secular Society and many other organisations, that the
time for this obligation in all schools has passed. I will not quote
those organisations, because noble Lords will think that they are
<I>parti pris</I>; I will quote what the Government&#146;s
inspectorate wrote in a document that was separately published, so
important was it, a year later, under the heading <I>Secondary
Education</I>. In 1998, Ofsted said that the whole question of daily
collective
worship,</p><ul><a name="06102466000120"></a>&#147;raises
questions about the ... Act and its interpretation, and in
particular whether schools in a broadly secular society can or should
bring their pupils together in order to engage in worship. For Roman
Catholic, Church of England and other denominational schools the answer
is clear in principle. For most LEA and grant maintained schools,
however, the notion of worship, and indeed that of prayer, can be
problematic at both an institutional and a personal
level&#148;.</ul><a name="06102466000083"></a>In my
submission, nothing has changed to make that decisive judgment
inapplicable
today.<p><a name="06102466000037"></a>Of
course, the Government may refer to Amendments Nos. 79 and 151, which
were passed in your Lordships&#146; House on 17 October. Those
government amendments allow sixth formers to have a special right to
escape from collective worship in which they do not believe. That right
is for sixth formers, but what about the rights of fifth or fourth
formers&#151;or third formers, given that I have grandchildren who
have reached that elevated level? Do the Government think that those
students do not discuss such matters and that they do not have
incipient and, in some cases, firm beliefs, and that sixth formers
alone should be granted this inalienable right to get out of collective
worship?</p><p><a name="06102466000038"></a>In order to clarify the
point, I asked a very close friend, who is a devoted and devout
Christian and a very honest person, what it was all about. He laughed
and chided me, and said, &#147;Come on, you must be joking. You know
perfectly well what it is all about. We want to get at them early on.
Give us a few years of prayer and worship and you can do what you like
with them and, what&#146;s more, the Jesuits can do what they like
with them&#148;. The noble Lord shakes his head. I am sorry to offer
that to him, but that is what my friend said. It may be wrong, but if
it is not the case, what on earth is the point of making these boys and
girls go to a religious occasion in which they may already not believe
or, more important, in which they may have begun not to
believe?</p><p><a name="06102466000039"></a>Professor Richard
Dawkins addressed this issue on page 185 of his recently published

wrote:</p><ul><a name="06102466000109"></a>&#147;Could irrational
religion be a by-product of the irrationality mechanisms that were
originally built into the brain by selection for falling in love?
Certainly, religious faith has something of the same character as
falling in love (and both have many of the attributes of being high on
an addictive drug)&#148;,</ul>

did not know it&#151;as &#147;Gerin Oil&#148;. That is not an oil
company; it is the name apparently of an addictive drug. He went on to
quote the neuropsychiatrist, John Smythies, who
said:<ul><a name="06102466000110"></a>&#147;One facet of
the many faces of religion is intense love focused on one supernatural
person, i.e. God, plus reverence for icons of that person. Human life
is driven largely by our selfish genes and by the processes of
reinforcement. Much positive reinforcement derives from religion: warm
and comforting feelings of being loved and protected in a dangerous
world, loss of fear of death, help from the hills in response to prayer
in difficult
times&#148;.</ul><a name="06102466000085"></a>Your Lordships
will forgive my reading, which has recently suffered an attack of
something no doubt from beyond the
hills.<p><a name="06102466000040"></a>In
the face of the question that we are addressing, the point of the
quotation is: what on earth is the point of getting together boys and
girls from third, fourth and even fifth forms to obey an order that
they must express warmth and loving hopes for help coming to them from
beyond the hills? It seems a very strange thing to do, except perhaps
in very unorganised and not advanced societies. Dawkins concludes his
argument on such matters with words that I suggest the Government
should gather together daily to read&#151;aloud, if
possible&#151;on their sofas in an assembly devoted to collective
inquiry. He wrote:</p><ul><a name="06102466000111"></a>&#147;An
atheistic world-view provides no justification for cutting the Bible,
and other sacred books, out of our education. And of course we can
retain a sentimental loyalty to the cultural and literary traditions
of, say, Judaism, Anglicanism or
Islam&#148;&#151;</ul><a name="06102466000086"></a>no
doubt he would have added other religions had he
time&#151;<ul><a name="06102466000121"></a>&#147;and
even participate in religious rituals such as marriages and funerals,
without buying into the supernatural beliefs that historically went
along with those traditions. We can give up belief in God while not
losing touch with a treasured
heritage&#148;.</ul><a name="06102466000087"></a>That is
important because this amendment does not seek to make anyone do
anything except attend an assembly, which, as I have understood
today&#146;s debate, is a matter of common ground in the whole House,
on all Benches, to advance
the,<ul><a name="06102466000122"></a>&#147;spiritual,
moral ... and cultural
education&#148;,</ul><a name="06102466000088"></a>of all
pupils. There lies the nub of the amendment, which I am happy to
support. <h5><a name="06102466000128"></a>6.30

Turner of Camden:</b> My Lords, I have put my name to
this amendment and I support my noble friends who have spoken. It is
desirable for school communities to have ways in which they can come
together to build a common ethos and to explore and celebrate shared
human values. This can be in assemblies, which is what our amendment is
about, but it does not necessarily have to be under a system that
requires religious worship, which, by definition, can never be common
to all children, with their variety of beliefs and the wide diversity
that we have in our society. The law needs to change to provide for
inclusive assemblies instead&#151;and that is what the amendment is
about.</p>

is widespread support for a reform of this law, not only from
religious, humanist and secularist groups and the teaching unions but,
as my noble friend has indicated, from Ofsted. It stated in its 1998
report on the
matter:</p><ul><a name="06102466000112"></a>&#147;For most LEA
and grant maintained schools the notion of worship, and indeed that of
prayer, can be problematic at both an institutional and personal
level&#148;.</ul><a name="06102466000089"></a>It
is not surprising therefore that it was found in the same year that
most secondary schools were not complying with the law. Teachers favour
good inclusive school assemblies of a moral and reflective nature,
which can bring the school community together to celebrate shared
values, news and achievements. Many schools are holding such
assemblies, and doing it very well, but they are technically breaking
the law and so can attract criticism. It is a pity that a practice that
is workable, honest and educationally and socially valuable does not
remain legal.<p><a name="06102466000043"></a>I am a humanist
and a member of the British Humanist Association. It is not only
humanists who feel this way&#151;as has already been indicated,
Sikhs, Hindus and of course the teaching unions support our
amendment&#151;but all those who would like schools to be able to
share their values and ethos without hypocrisy or fear of
non-compliance with an outdated law.</p><p><a name="06102466000044"></a>At the moment, many parents do not wish
to withdraw their children from religious assemblies; on the other
hand, perhaps they do not want to withdraw their children and make them
feel different, because that is often a rather harmful situation. I can
remember what happened when I was very young. My mother was a Roman
Catholic and I went to a state school. My mother indicated on the form
that she had to complete that I was Roman Catholic and it was decided
that when there were prayers I should sit outside the door. So, when
all the other children went in for the religious assembly, I sat
outside the door. When I went home, I said to my mother, &#147;They
don&#146;t like me at school because I&#146;m a Roman
Catholic&#148;. I immediately felt different. That is not a good idea
for any child&#151;it certainly was not as far as I was concerned. I
support the amendment and I commend it to your
Lordships.</p><p><a name="06102466000045"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew113"></a><a name="06102466000137"></a>Lord
Alton of Liverpool:</b> My Lords, because of the
uncoupling of these amendments we are revisiting issues that we
discussed last week. I therefore do not intend to rehearse arguments
that I have already put to your Lordships&#146; House and to extend
this debate unduly. I should like, however, to make one or two comments
about the contributions
today.</p><p><a name="06102466000046"></a>The
noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, was particularly critical of what he
suggested was the style of education offered by the Society of
Jesus&#151;the Jesuits. He said that those who went through such an
education came out indoctrinated. I smiled at the noble Lord, Lord
Patten, because I think he and I are the only Members in your
Lordships&#146; House this evening who were educated by Jesuits. I
can assure the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, that, quite the reverse
from being indoctrinated, most of my friends and
contemporaries&#151;and I dare say 



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1141"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1141</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>those of the noble Lord, Lord Patten&#151;ended up with no belief
whatever. Therefore, in that sense, that education failed because at
the heart of their approach to education lay the principle that you
should learn to think for yourself and reject those things that you
cannot embrace. Therefore, far from being indoctrination, that
education encourages a development of
sensibilities.</p><p><a name="06102466000047"></a>The noble
Baroness, Lady Turner, also touched on this issue when she said that
she had gone through a personal experience of feeling excluded. What
about those children at a school who believe in God and want to take
part in an act of worship? If we are not careful, we could turn the
tables on them and leave them feeling excluded if we remove something
so central to their lives as the daily act of worship. When your
Lordships gather for worship, as we do in this House each day, there
are noble Lords on our Benches who have no Christian or other faith,
yet they come here because it is a moment of pause, a time for
reflection, when we can come to terms with ourselves and with God. Even
if someone does not believe in God, they can at least clear their minds
and perhaps think sometimes about the words that the right reverend
Prelates leave before your Lordships&#146; House during those
prayers. After all, it was a Member of this House, Alfred Lord
Tennyson, who in the 19th century&#151;in answer, perhaps, to the
point being made today by the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn&#151;said
that more things are wrought by prayer than this world ever dreams of.
Sometimes we in public and political life place our own material
interests and our own personal aspirations and expectations too much at
the heart of the equation and squeeze out the
spiritual.</p><p><a name="06102466000048"></a>We should tread with
care. The right of conscience is there, but if someone wishes to be
excluded from daily acts of worship their parents can do that. Let us
not exclude parents from the equation, which is precisely what the
amendments would do. They would remove the role of parents in
discussing with their own children their beliefs and where they are in
their own spiritual development. It would be a tragedy if we did
that.</p><p><a name="06102466000049"></a>More
than 80 per cent of the people of this country still say that they
believe in God. There are some things that bind us together as a
nation. I think it would be a huge error to unravel those things
without carefully thinking about the consequences. Syncretism,
practised perhaps by the art teacher with the aid of some bean bags
during an assembly that tells us about everything but teaches us
nothing, is not a substitute for the daily act of worship. I hope,
therefore, that your Lordships will not go in the direction that the
noble Baroness, Lady Massey, invites us to
go.</p><p><a name="06102466000050"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew114"></a><a name="06102466000138"></a>Lord

question. I preface it by saying that I have always admired him as one

Lord Bishop of Peterborough:</b> My Lords, I, too,
will be brief. It will not surprise the noble Baroness that I do not
feel able to support her amendment. I fully endorse the arguments made
in support of collective worship on the first day of Report by my
colleague the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Portsmouth. At
column 699 of the <I>Official Report </I>he argued in support of
collective worship and said it provided an important grammar and
language for later life and is still part of our common
culture.</p><p><a name="06102466000053"></a>Given the clear
indication of the recent census, which is different from a poll, that
the overwhelming majority of people in this country wish to identify
themselves with one or other of the major faiths&#151;including the
fact, if my memory serves me right, that roughly 70 per cent identify
themselves as Christian&#151;the right reverend Prelate was right to
say that this continues to reflect the grammar and the values of the
majority of this country. We of course fully recognise the right of a
minority of parents who wish to withdraw their children from collective
worship to do so.</p><p><a name="06102466000054"></a>The issues
were fully aired on the first day of Report and I do not want to repeat
the arguments put forward then. I fear that I and my colleagues will
continue to resist the amendment while continuing to support all that
teachers and others are doing to improve collective worship in our
schools, recognising that it is not always providing the focus that it
should and can
do.</p><p><a name="06102466000055"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew117"></a><a name="06102466000141"></a>Lord
Dearing:</b> My Lords, I guess that
none of us is going to be persuaded very much by what has been said, so
I, too, have an incentive to be brief. I should say to the noble Lord,
Lord Wedderburn, that I was invited by the Church of England to chair a
review of the future of church schools, which caused me to go out and
about in the land. One of the schools I went into was in Bradford,
where it appeared to me that95 per cent of pupils were Muslim.
That did not suggest to me that they were coming to be
indoctrinated.</p><p><a name="06102466000056"></a>I turned to the
Bishop of London on one occasion and raised this question with him
because I was aware that Muslim children often went to church schools.
He said, &#147;I asked the same question to a leader of the Muslim
community, and he said, &#145;We look at it like this: there are
those who believe in God and those who don&#146;t. You do, and we
feel more comfortable in a school where there is this belief than we
would otherwise&#146;&#148;. That does not suggest indoctrination.
If I remember correctly&#151;and my memory is fallible&#151;in the
report of the committee which I chaired, we made

people the experience of what it is to learn and play within the
framework of a community that had values and certain beliefs.</p><p><a name="06102466000057"></a>Some things about the amendment surprise
me. I found no difficulty with Proposed Section 4 because parents
already have that right. They can withdraw from religious assemblies,
but very few do, which suggests that they are not perturbed by
them.</p><p><a name="06102466000058"></a>Proposed Section 2(1)
refers to furthering a
pupil&#146;s,</p><ul><a name="06102466000123"></a>&#147;spiritual,
moral, social and cultural
education&#148;.</ul><a name="06102466000090"></a>That
seems to deny schools that are not voluntary aided the choice of making
it an act of worship. Subsection (5) of proposed Section 3 makes it
explicit that voluntary-aided schools may do so; the implication is
that others cannot. I wonder where that leaves voluntary-controlled
faith schools, of which there are very many.
<p><a name="06102466000059"></a>I was surprised that proposed Section
3(8) said that a voluntary-aided school may, on special occasions, use
a church in which to worship. Why only on special occasions? There are
schools which have a church on site; perhaps the church is the only
place with a room big enough to accommodate everyone.</p><p><a name="06102466000060"></a>I must not go on about the detail. I just
wanted to put differently the main point made by my noble friend Lord
Alton. In the faith schools of which I have some knowledge, the
business is not to seize minds, it is to open
minds.</p><p><a name="06102466000061"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew118"></a><a name="06102466000142"></a>Baroness
Deech:</b> My Lords, I am in favour of the new clause
from personal experience. I was a minority child in a faith school.
Although when one is older one can see the benefits, at the time it can
be very hurtful&#151;indeed, off-putting&#151;not to participate,
excluding oneself, or to participate in an occasion when the majority
indoctrination is not to one&#146;s taste. One has to remember that
children of that age can be quite brusque and unfeeling in their
treatment of minorities. While there was no attempt to convert, being
forced to participate did not endear the notion of formal religious
worship to one. There is another place for those who want that
experience, and it is not school. There are some similarities with the
debate already held in this House about faith schools having a quota
for minorities.</p><p><a name="06102466000062"></a>There is much to be
said for a secular assembly that brings everyone together. That is a
much truer form of multiculturalism, and no one need feel excluded.
Adults&#146; attitude to this is very different from that of
children, who were not included in any Gallup poll or census. I hope
very much that the House will support the new
clause.</p><p><a name="06102466000063"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew119"></a><a name="06102466000143"></a>Lord

deeply respect the position that my noble friends Lady Massey and Lady
Turner take in tabling the amendment. They wish to go further than the
position we have established. The Government listened to the debates in
Committee and have proposed a substantial change in allowing individual
students to withdraw themselves from collective worship rather than
that being solely the preserve of parents. However, we do not think it
right to go further in the way the amendment suggests: abolishing
existing collective worship requirements and putting in place a new
requirement to take part in an assembly to further
pupils&#146;,</p><ul><a name="06102466000124"></a>&#147;spiritual,
moral, social and cultural
education&#148;,</ul><a name="06102466000091"></a>with no
requirement, as now, for that education to be wholly or mainly of a
broadly Christian character.
<p><a name="06102466000067"></a>We believe that assemblies and collective
worship are important elements of school life in establishing their
ethos and collective character. We believe it right that those under 16
should be required to take part unless their parents specifically wish
otherwise. We believe that it is in accordance with the values and
traditions of the majority in this country that such collective worship
should be of a broadly Christian character, allowing also for the
celebration of other faiths as
appropriate.</p><p><a name="06102466000068"></a>The noble Lord asks
for my evidence for that. In the 2001 census, 71.8 per cent of
respondents identified themselves as Christian. Those are the facts,
although the noble Lord may not like
them.</p><p><a name="06102466000069"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew122"></a><a name="06102466000146"></a>Lord

broadly Christian character, Section 394 of the Education Act 1996
allows community schools and foundation schools without a religious
character to lift the broadly Christian requirement for some or all
pupils when the local standing advisory council on religious education
judges it appropriate to do so, having received an application from the
head teacher. Before making such an application, the head teacher must
consult the governing body, which, in turn, may want to seek the views
of the parents. That is the position at the moment. Taken in
conjunction with the right of parents to withdraw their children from
collective worship, we believe this strikes the right balance. The
Government do not intend to propose any further changes. Therefore, we
oppose the amendment.</p><p><a name="06102466000072"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew124"></a><a name="06102466000148"></a>Baroness

training courses which led to a level 2 or a level 3 qualification
would be raised to 25. The Bill ought to reflect that
change. <p><a name="06102469000004"></a>In Committee, the
Minister explained&#151;I have received a further letter from him
which sets out the position in greater detail and for which I thank
him&#151;that the Bill relates only to the core entitlement set out
in new Section 3B, which reflects the core entitlement in Clause 71 to
courses in English, maths and science, and to the additional
entitlement in new Section 3C to take courses in one of the entitlement
areas specified by the Secretary of State. These are the specialised
diplomas which are being introduced and are identified in Clause
81.</p><p><a name="06102469000005"></a>In his letter to me, the
Minister wrote as
follows:</p><ul><a name="06102469000028"></a>&#147;The main
purpose of the clause is to place a duty on the Learning and Skills
Council to secure sufficient provision in each locality to enable 16-19
year olds to access all 14 Diploma lines and the core entitlement of
English, maths and ICT. Therefore, this clause will give all young
people, wherever they are in the country, an entitlement to a course of
study in one of the Diploma entitlement
areas.</ul><ul><a name="06102469000029"></a>The collaborative
nature of delivery which will be necessary to ensure all young people
have access to the specialised diplomas means that we will need more
than funding streams to ensure that post-16 providers are all working
in partnership to deliver these significant curriculum reforms; that is
why we are placing a new duty on the LSC through this
clause&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06102469000006"></a>The
announcement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in March related to a
different entitlement. I again quote the Minister&#146;s
letter:</p><ul><a name="06102469000030"></a>&#147;The
Level 2 and Level 3 entitlements are aimed at a slightly different,
voluntary, audience. Those wishing to access these entitlements are
more likely to be returning to education following a break. The courses
offered in this entitlement include more vocational and job specific
courses, as well as the more generic
courses.</ul><ul><a name="06102469000031"></a>The Level 2 and Level
3 entitlements are removing financial barriers to further learning by
ensuring tuition for those eligible is free. Clearly, provision for all
adults cannot be guaranteed, and so we would not be justified in
creating a statutory entitlement. However, through greater refocusing
of public support the government is expanding the opportunities for
eligible adults to achieve a first full Level 2 and Level 3
qualification&#148;.</ul><a name="06102469000024"></a>We
know that because those who have had anything to do with adult
education know that funds are being transferred from adult education
into meeting the &#147;full-fat&#148;, as we call it, level 2
entitlement and the level 3
entitlement.<p><a name="06102469000007"></a>In
Committee, the Minister described this second set of entitlements as
non-statutory entitlements for young people and adults to study, free
of tuition charges, on courses leading to a level 2 or a level 3
qualification. I understand the distinction between the statutory
entitlements described in Clause 72 and those which are non-statutory.
However, the Government seem to be seeking to draw an over-fine
distinction between these two sets of entitlements. On the one hand,
they are saying that they want to hold open the opportunity for
everyone up to the age of 25 to achieve a level 2 or a level 3
qualification; on the other, they are saying, &#147;No, no, not that
qualification; this qualification&#148;. The specialised diplomas
will be available only up to age
19.</p><p><a name="06102469000008"></a>I have one comment and one
question for the Minister. The comment relates to the non-statutory 



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1147"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1147</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>nature of the up-to-25 entitlement. As far as I can see, it is a
question of finance. The letter seems to say that, since provision for
all adults cannot be guaranteed, a statutory requirement would not be
justified. What, then, is an entitlement? A non-statutory entitlement
is one that may be given and may be taken away. Given the known skills
shortages in the UK, and the demographic trends which mean that we will
have to look to training and retraining older people, surely this
short-term approach is inadequate. We need to make sure that the LSC
funds these longer-term training facilities just as much as it funds
the specialised diploma
facilities.</p><p><a name="06102469000009"></a>I turn to Amendments
Nos. 113, 114 and 115. We raised this issue in Committee and it, too,
relates to the age of 25. I have had further correspondence with the
Minister on this issue. We raised the amendments on behalf of
Skill&#151;the National Bureau for Students with
Disabilities&#151;and the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association. Their
purpose is to require that local education authorities make provision
for transport for disabled students engaged in further education or
training up the age of 25. Very often, these students, because of their
disablement or learning disability, are behind in their studies and
need to go through to 25. As I explained in Committee, we frequently
see situations where the local LSC can agree to fund the
student&#146;s tuition, but the student cannot make use of that
funding because the LEA has no obligation to provide transport after
the age of 19, although it is pressed by the Government to provide it
up to 21. The Minister explained in his response that the LEAs are
obliged to make transport plans which cover all students continuing in
education up to 19 and, for disabled students and those with learning
disabilities, up to 21, with the DfES recommending that the latter
provision be made up to 25. Perhaps I may again read from the
Minister&#146;s letter to
me:</p><ul><a name="06102469000032"></a>&#147;DfES are currently
responsible for issuing the guidance that sets out these duties,
detailing priorities and priority learner groups, and for ensuring that
local transport policies fulfil the duty and have regard to that
guidance. Officials will investigate complaints and advise and mediate
with local authorities when there are concerns that their duties might
not have been met. In the event that any complaint or claim cannot be
resolved, the Secretary of State is empowered to direct local
authorities to make arrangements for transport which are not in their
published transport policy statements and carry out their
duties.</ul><ul><a name="06102469000033"></a>&#147;Clause 74 is
simply intended to transfer the current DfES administrative functions
to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), while the Secretary of State
retains his present powers to direct local authorities. One of the key
goals of the LSC is to encourage young people to participate in
learning and the transfer of this role will enhance their ability to do
so.</ul><ul><a name="06102469000034"></a>As part of taking on these
responsibilities, we would like the LSC to strengthen its role with
regard to the responsibilities of LSC area teams in local transport
partnerships. At the local level, the LSC would work more closely with
partnerships to fulfil their shared aims of improving the prospects of
young people by encouraging participation in learning to enhance their
skills&#148;.</ul><h5><a name="06102469000037"></a>7
pm</h5><p><a name="06102469000010"></a>We welcome
very much these developments. However, the evidence suggests that
despite the work of the DfES and the guidance provided, many disabled
students over 19 are not being funded by their local education

friends if they are to continue participating in education or training.
The Minister seems to be looking to the local LSCs to take on a more
active role in overseeing these arrangements, but he will know that
there is frequently little joined-up thinking between the local LSCs
and LEAs. That is why I am bringing this amendment back. Getting
something along these lines in the Bill would bring home to LEAs and
the local LSCs precisely what their obligations are. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06102469000011"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew126"></a><a name="06102469000039"></a>Baroness
Darcy de Knayth:</b> My Lords, I support all the
amendments in this group. The first three are essential if young adult
disabled learners are to be entitled to continue their education and
the second three, to which I have put my name, would ensure that they
can actually get to their courses. Unlike my noble friend Lord
Alton&#146;s interpretation of entitlement, we are talking about
enabling and actually making possible. I refer to the noble
Lord&#146;s remarks on Amendment No.
99.</p><p><a name="06102469000012"></a>I am grateful to the
Minister for sending me a copy of his letter about transport, which he
sent to the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp. I have no doubt of his
commitment to making things work. The noble Baroness read out the
passage where he says he hopes the LSC will work more closely with
partnerships and will manage to encourage participation and be
successful. The Minister went on to
say:</p><ul><a name="06102469000035"></a>&#147;In my view this is
sufficient. Where there is evidence of a specific breach of these
duties, my officials will investigate thoroughly and pursue
vigorously&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06102469000013"></a>It should
not have to come to that. We have been here before&#151;and Guide
Dogs for the Blind has cited instances when it was only with the
intervention of a Minister that someone has managed to get to their
course to pursue it. Skill and the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association
feel very strongly that further legislation is necessary, despite the
welcome guidance in paragraph 12 of the transport support arrangements
for students aged 16 to 19 2006-07. I should declare here that I am
president of Skill.</p><p><a name="06102469000014"></a>We know
that there are still problems with this group. Skill has produced some
evidence as has the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association. The colleges
and other providers say that there is a problem. The LSC knows that
there is a problem; <I>Through Inclusion to Excellence</I> recognised
that there was a major difficulty and recommended that the DfES and
other government
departments,</p><ul><a name="06102469000036"></a>&#147;consider
and propose appropriate transport
legislation&#148;.</ul><a name="06102469000025"></a>The
LSC received a 98 per cent positive response from the sector to its
consultation on that
recommendation.<p><a name="06102469000015"></a>Another point
is that in the main you really hear only of cases in which a problem
has been resolved or there has been a struggle and a failure. The young
adult disabled learners who have been turned down and are lost by the
roadside go unrecorded. So it is possibly the tip of the iceberg. If
there is not a real problem, as the Minister suggests that there is
not, where is the harm in bringing in legislation? But the Minister is
a very listening and thinking Minister and I hope for a positive
response, as normal. Otherwise I

and the directors of children&#146;s services to discuss the problem
further and more deeply.</p><p><a name="06102469000016"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew127"></a><a name="06102469000040"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, Amendments Nos. 105, 106 and
107 relate to the entitlements in Clause 72, entitlements which will
legally cease if a person has not started the course of study before
they reach the age of 19.</p><p><a name="06102469000017"></a>We
strongly agree that young people up to the age of 25 and beyond should
also have entitlements to continue studying and acquire new skills that
will help them to gain employment and once employed to progress in the
work place, but we believe that these needs are properly served by
specific non-statutory, funded entitlements which are already in place
for young people up to age 25. I accept that by their nature, being
non-statutory, they are less binding than statutory entitlements, but I
equally believe that our commitment to them has been demonstrated not
only by what we have said but by the substantial funding that we have
put in place to enable the entitlements to be
delivered.</p><p><a name="06102469000018"></a>The
entitlements are for all adults to study towards a level 2
qualification and for young people up to the age of 25 to study towards
their first level 3 qualification. From 2007-08, to fund this first
full level 3 entitlement my right honourable friend the Chancellor made
an extra &#163;25 million available in the Budget this year
specifically to ensure that there was proper funding behind that
entitlement, so that it could actually be delivered. The existing
entitlements give young people the opportunities that they need and
deserve to prepare themselves for success in life. Although they are
not statutory and do not have the absolute enduring binding force of
those that are in the Bill, we none the less stand by them and they
will be a first call on resources in our next spending
review.</p><p><a name="06102469000019"></a>I turn to the points
made by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, supported by the noble
Baroness, Lady Darcy de Knayth, about placing a duty on local
authorities to make arrangements for the provision of transport for
qualifying disabled young learners in the further education sector. As
the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, said, I wrote to her on 10 October
setting out our view on this. I must say that this is not my area of
direct ministerial expertise. I shall give the House the response I
have, but it may be useful if I arrange for the noble Baronesses to
meet my honourable friend the Minister for Further Education, who I
think would be happy to discuss these issues and take up some of the
more detailed points that the noble Baronesses
raised.</p><p><a name="06102469000020"></a>In my
letter, I outlined our intention to strengthen the role of the Learning
and Skills Council in transport partnerships locally. We look to the
Learning and Skills Council to work closely with each partnership to
help them fulfil their shared aim of improving the prospects of young
people by encouraging participation in learning to enhance their
skills. This builds on measures already in place to support young
people and adults to access further education. For example, the DfES
provides additional support to those who

Learning and Skills Council. It is a discretionary fund targeted at
local provision to assist learners in financial hardship to continue in
learning. It is particularly targeted at disadvantaged groups such as
those from low income families to help with learning-related expenses,
such as contributions to costs of transport or books and equipment.
Around one-third of the learner support fund for young people is used
to help with transport costs for disadvantaged
students.</p><p><a name="06102469000021"></a>In
2005-06, the learner support fund was funded to a total of &#163;123
million. In this financial year, 2006-07, it is funded to a total of
&#163;122 million, of which&#163;86 million is for adult
learner support and &#163;36 million for young people aged 16 to 19.
The fund is awarded to learners on the basis of need. Colleges have to
prioritise use of the funds within a framework that clearly identifies
disadvantaged groups as a priority for funding. As I say, the fund can
help with transport costs.</p><p><a name="06102469000022"></a>I
hope that that goes some way to meeting the points raised by the noble
Baronesses, but I would be happy to facilitate a further meeting with
my honourable friend the Minister for Further Education if they would
like to take advantage of
that.</p><p><a name="06102476000001"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew128"></a><a name="06102476000098"></a>Baroness

preferred on the grounds of religion or belief within a 15 mile
radius.</p><p><a name="06102476000008"></a>The
intention of these amendments is to further promote two of the
principles that run through this entire Bill: diversity and fairness.
The amendments will play an important part in ensuring that
disadvantaged parents make a genuine, informed choice when expressing
preferences for their child&#146;s secondary school.</p>



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1151"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1151</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06102476000009"></a>Evidence suggests that
choice of school, particularly for low-income groups, is often
restricted by parental concerns about the cost and availability of
transport. Some 41 per cent of parents living in social housing cite
travel convenience as the most important reason for choosing a school,
compared with only 33 per cent of owner-occupiers. There is also real
inequity in how far children travel to school&#151;only around 10 per
cent of children entitled to free school meals travel more than three
miles to school, compared with 18 per cent of children not entitled to
free school meals.</p><p><a name="06102476000010"></a>To create
equity in the system, it is therefore crucial that lack of affordable
transport is removed as a barrier to choice. The existing proposals to
extend rights to free transport for low-income groups to one of their
three nearest schools will do this. However, we believe that lack of
affordable transport should not stand as a barrier to parents
exercising a choice based on their religion or belief&#151;such as a
parent with strong religious beliefs expressing a preference for a more
distant faith school than is available within their three nearest
schools; or a parent of no faith expressing a preference for a more
distant community school where they do not have a choice of such a
school within their three nearest. I refer to the distance requirements
currently set out in the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06102476000011"></a>Amendment No. 109 will
apply where a child of secondary school age from a low-income family
attends a school because his or her parent has expressed a wish for
them to attend that school, and that wish is based on their religion or
belief. Amendment No. 110 provides that &#147;religion&#148; or
&#147;belief&#148; for these purposes have the same meaning as in
the rest of the school travel provisions&#151;that is, it covers all
religions, religious or philosophical beliefs and a lack of religion or
belief. Amendments Nos. 108, 111 and 112 are consequential amendments
arising from Amendment No. 109. The amendments follow extensive
consultation with interested groups, including, but not restricted to,
the faith communities. I believe that these proposals will be welcomed
by them. I beg to move.</p><h5><a name="06102476000097"></a>7.15

87, insert the following new clause-</ul><ul><a name="06102476000078"></a>&#147;PREVENTION OF
BULLYING</ul><ul><a name="06102476000079"></a>The governing body
and head teacher or principal of a maintained secondary school,
Academy, sixth form college, further education college, city technology
college or city college for the technology of the arts shall have a
duty to establish effective policies to prevent bullying and ensure the
safety and well-being of all pupils.&#148;</ul><p><a name="06102476000034"></a>The noble Baroness
said: My Lords, Amendment No. 118 is a return to the issue of bullying,
which we debated in Committee. On that occasion, our amendment required
a school to develop a policy on homophobic bullying. We had enormous
support from across the House, including from the Minister, about the
importance of this matter and the need for it to be addressed by all
schools. All noble Lords agreed that it is unacceptable that a child
should be bullied on the basis of his sexual orientation, or any other
characteristic, come to that. However, many noble Lords encouraged us
to come back with an amendment that was wider in its scope and
addressed the whole issue of bullying. That is what we have
done.</p><p><a name="06102476000035"></a>On 25 July, the noble
Baroness, Lady Buscombe,
said:</p><ul><a name="06102476000080"></a>&#147;Bullying is
unacceptable towards any
child&#148;.</ul><a name="06102476000054"></a>She went on to
say:<ul><a name="06102476000081"></a>&#147;While we very
much support the aims of the amendment, we are concerned that it may be
seen as singling out a particular
group&#148;.</ul><a name="06102476000055"></a>The noble
Lord, Lord Judd, said, in the same column of
<I>Hansard</I>:<ul><a name="06102476000082"></a>&#147;Homophobic
bullying is nasty, sinister, and cruel and can have terrible results.
Of that there is no doubt. But I strongly believe that we should all be
concerned about the strategic issue of
bullying&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 25/7/06; col.
1692.]</ul><a name="06102476000056"></a>The noble Lord asked
whether I would consider withdrawing my amendment and coming back with
one that addressed the strategic issues. Support for such an approach
also came from the noble Lord, Lord Lucas.
<p><a name="06102476000036"></a>In his reply, the Minister agreed
that,</p><ul><a name="06102476000088"></a>&#147;bullying in all
its forms is one of the great evils that our schools have to confront,
and we have a good deal further to go before we can claim to have
confronted it
successfully&#148;.</ul><a name="06102476000057"></a>However,
it became clear that he thought that the Bill confronted the matter
adequately without the benefit of my amendment when he said later in
his speech:<ul><a name="06102476000083"></a>&#147;Clause
82(1)(b) requires a head teacher to determine measures to be taken with
a view
to,</ul><ul><a name="06102476000084"></a>&#145;encouraging good
behaviour and respect for others on the part of pupils and, in
particular, preventing all forms of bullying among
pupils&#146;&#148;.</ul><a name="06102476000058"></a>He
told us:<ul><a name="06102476000085"></a>&#147;That
provision means what it says. Head teachers must ensure that their
school&#146;s behaviour policy deals with all forms of bullying,
including homophobic bullying and bullying relating to race, religion
and culture, as well as cyber-bullying&#148;&#151;[<I>Official
Report</I>, 25/7/06; col.
1694.]</ul><a name="06102476000059"></a>and so
on.<p><a name="06102476000037"></a>The problem is that, when
I looked at the Minister&#146;s words, I realised that that
responsibility is only in one direction. It relates to action that the
head must take to affect the behaviour of the pupils. But 



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1154"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1154</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>pupil behaviour is only part of the picture. We need schools to have a
policy that addresses the behaviour of everyone in the school
community: pupils, teachers, support staff, caretakers and everyone who
might come into the school as part of its extended school format. The
clause quoted by the Minister does not do that; our amendment does. It
would ensure that policies are in place to prevent bullying from
wherever it came or on whatever basis it lies. The school would need to
foster a culture of mutual respect among all members of its
community&#151;both adults and children.</p><p><a name="06102476000038"></a>Noble Lords may remember that we had an
amendment along those lines in Committee. Without Amendment No. 118,
the job is only half-done by the Bill. The Minister assured
us,</p><ul><a name="06102476000089"></a>&#147;my department is
committed to providing comprehensive guidance on bullying that is
driven by
prejudice&#148;.</ul><a name="06102476000060"></a>He went
on to
say:<ul><a name="06102476000086"></a>&#147;As
well as advice on dealing with specific incidents, the guidance in
respect of homophobic bullying will focus on prevention, including
promoting a school environment in which homophobic bullying does not
occur&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 25/7/06; col.
1695.]</ul><a name="06102476000061"></a>We quite agree with
that. That is what we want to do, but we feel that the Bill as it
stands only does half the job. The guidance is not quite enough.
Without our amendment, the school may see the matter only as a part of
its policy on the behaviour of pupils, without all the positive,
mutually respectful things that we all want to see in the whole school
community. In other words, it addresses the negatives without putting
in the positives. We would like to put the positives in, too. I beg to
move.<p><a name="06102476000039"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew137"></a><a name="06102476000107"></a>Baroness
Howe of Idlicote:</b> My Lords, though we had
considerable reassurance from the Minister, there really is a case for
making this rather more specifically a duty. We seem to hear the word
&#147;bullying&#148; coming from so many different directions. If
it was specifically a duty&#151;not just of the headmistress but also
of the governing body&#151;to see that the whole culture of the
school was addressing this worrying aspect that has been identified so
often, that would be a help. Having a regular item on the governing
body&#146;s agenda when it met at least once a year might be one way
of concentrating people&#146;s minds. I hope that further
consideration can be given to the
matter.</p><p><a name="06102476000040"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew138"></a><a name="06102476000108"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, the issue of
bullying in schools is immensely important, and we accept that a great
deal more needs to be done, as the leaders of the school community
accept that a great deal more needs to be done, to tackle it school by
school and community by community. I am entirely with the noble
Baroness in all that she said about its importance, including the issue
of homophobic bullying, on which we are looking to publish specific
guidance early next year. We are consulting interested parties on that
at the moment. We also have our main bullying guidance toolkit,
<I>Don&#146;t Suffer in Silence</I>, which has been very warmly
received and has made a big difference to the capacity of schools to
deal with the issue. It is currently being updated, and we are looking
to see that it reflects best practice in this area.</p>



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1155"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1155</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06102476000041"></a>When it comes to the law, though, I am
straining my powers of understanding to understand what the noble
Baroness thinks that we could do that we are not doing. I will go
through it so that my understanding is clear, and it may be that we can
have a further dialogue on this.</p><p><a name="06102476000042"></a>Clause 86 sets out requirements on the
head teacher, which must include, as Clause 86(1)(c)
states,</p><ul><a name="06102476000090"></a>&#147;securing that
the standard of behaviour of pupils is
acceptable&#148;,</ul><p><a name="06102476000043"></a>Also,
Clause 86(1)(b)
requires,</p><ul><a name="06102476000091"></a>&#147;encouraging
good behaviour and respect for others on the part of pupils and, in
particular, preventing all forms of bullying among
pupils&#148;.</ul><a name="06102476000062"></a>I do not
see that as purely restricted to bullying. It
says,<ul><a name="06102476000092"></a>&#147;encouraging
good behaviour and respect for
others&#148;,</ul><a name="06102476000063"></a>so it is
not just about bullying. It goes on to
say,<ul><a name="06102476000093"></a>&#147;and, in
particular, preventing all forms of
bullying&#148;,</ul><a name="06102476000064"></a>so it
goes from the general to bullying as the specific. I do not see it as
couched in any way in terms of negatives as opposed to positives. I
find it inconceivable that a head teacher could encourage good
behaviour and respect for others if they did not have positive measures
to promote respect and rewards for good behaviour in school, and if
they did not have those properly recognised, as opposed to simply using
sanctions or punitive measures. I hope that the noble Baroness is with
me so far on the fact that I do not see this as
negative.<p><a name="06102476000044"></a>In undertaking to
meet those requirements in Clause 86(1), the head teacher
must,</p><ul><a name="06102476000094"></a>&#147;act in
accordance with the current statement made by the governing
body&#148;,</ul><a name="06102476000065"></a>and the
governing body, under Clause 85,
must,<ul><a name="06102476000095"></a>&#147;ensure that
policies designed to promote good behaviour and discipline on the part
of its pupils are pursued at the
school&#148;.</ul><a name="06102476000066"></a>Again, this
is not just restricted to cracking down on bullying; it is about
promoting good behaviour and discipline, although cracking down on
bullying is one element of it. The points made by the noble Baroness
are largely, if not entirely, met, but I am happy to have further
discussion with her if there are specific issues.
<p><a name="06102476000045"></a>The amendment
says:</p><ul><a name="06102476000087"></a>&#147;The governing
body ... of a ... school ... shall have a duty to
establish effective policies to prevent
bullying&#148;&#151;</ul><a name="06102476000067"></a>which,
in fact, is a more specific area of action than we provide for in
Clauses 85 and
86&#151;<ul><a name="06102476000096"></a>&#147;and
ensure the safety and well-being of all
pupils&#148;.</ul><a name="06102476000068"></a>Here, we
come to the issue of well-being, which the noble Baroness raised in our
earlier debates on Report, where she was widely supported by other
noble Lords in wanting to impose more extensive well-being duties. I
said in response to that debate that we would look at this issue
further, and I repeat that assurance. We are looking carefully at this,
and I may even have some good news for the noble Baroness at Third
Reading.<p><a name="06102476000046"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew139"></a><a name="06102476000109"></a>Baroness

anticipation to hearing what he has to say about it at

although all those good things in the Bill address pupil behaviour, the
ethos, atmosphere and culture of respect and tolerance in a school do
not just relate to how the pupils behave; they relate to how the
teachers and the caretaker behave, too. If the caretaker refers
disrespectfully to some children in the school using some of the very
nasty homophobic language that you sometimes hear, that affects the
children just as much as if other children made the comments, or if the
teachers did. Unfortunately, it does happen that some teachers make
these comments. Teachers also sometimes feel that they are being
bullied by other members of staff for their sexual orientation or for
some other aspect of their personality. Our amendment tries to include
the whole school community in the duty to ensure that the pupils have
their well-being cared for.</p><p><a name="06102476000047"></a>The behaviour policy is
probably well catered for in the Bill as it refers to the pupils, but
it does not refer to the whole school. The school is more than the
pupils; it has staff, volunteers and all kinds of people who come into
a school. It is important that the policy should take all that into
account, so that you have that mutual respect between adults and
children, between adults and adults, and between children and children.
That would be covered by our amendment, and it is not covered in the
Bill at the
moment.</p><p><a name="06102476000048"></a><b><a name="61024-0002.htm_spnew140"></a><a name="06102476000110"></a>Lord

noble Lord. I am sorry if I did not explain it well enough the first
time, but I am delighted that he now takes the point. We really must go
as far as we can to make sure that schools really understand that there
are positive things that can be done&#151;not just punishments when
things go wrong. There are positive things that can be done to prevent
these things from ever happening at all and to create the sort of
culture in which such bullying never would happen and children would
never dream of behaving to one another in the sorts of ways that they
do.</p><p><a name="06102476000050"></a>I had intended
to divide the House on this amendment but, given what the Minister has
said about what he might do at Third Reading, I will save
everyone&#146;s legs. I really look forward to hearing what the noble
Lord is going to bring forward then, because we on these Benches regard
this matter as being terribly important. If we do not think that he has
adequately addressed it with what he is intending to bring forward, we
most certainly will divide the House at Third Reading. I shall tell my
Whips, who have the troops on the front foot, ready to vote, that
perhaps we should not divide the House. I beg leave to withdraw the

from the Joint
Committee</I>].</p><p><a name="06102481000003"></a>The noble Lord
said: My Lords, I welcome this opportunity to commend to your Lordships
the measures the Government have introduced to ensure that consumers of
home reversion plans and Ijara home financing arrangements will be
protected by FSA regulation. These changes are to be achieved through
the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities)
(Amendment) (No.2) Order 2006. They take effect from April next
year.</p><p><a name="06102481000004"></a>For completeness, I should
also mention two negative procedure orders also before Parliament: the
Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Business in the Regulated Sector) Order
2006 and the Terrorism Act 2000 (Business in the Regulated Sector)
Order 2006, both of which make consequential changes. They align the
money laundering treatment of arranging or advising on the products
that the main order deals with, and they reduce burdens on
firms.</p><p><a name="06102481000005"></a>These changes follow the
Regulation of Financial Services (Land Transactions) Act 2005, which
was widely supported by industry and consumer groups. That measure was
also widely welcomed by your Lordships. It received Royal Assent last
year. Noble Lords will be pleased to hear that there is equally
widespread support for the secondary legislation on which the
Government consulted earlier this year. The actuarial profession, Safe
Home Income Plans&#151;the self regulatory body&#151;the
Association of British Insurers and the Financial Services Consumer
Panel were united in support.</p><p><a name="06102481000006"></a>Respondents to the home
reversion proposals were generally strongly supportive of regulation
and endorsed the approaches the Government had taken. They raised a
number of points of detail, and the Government&#146;s published
response to the consultation analyses those. Nine respondents commented
on the home purchase plan proposals. Generally, respondents supported
the detailed proposals for defining and regulating these products. I
want to put on record that the Government are extremely grateful to all
those who took part in the consultation.</p><p><a name="06102481000007"></a>I shall set out briefly
what we mean by these different products. Equity release schemes allow
some elderly homeowners to release the value of their property in
return for all, or a share, of their interest in the home. With home
reversion plans, the consumer sells all or part of their home but
retains the right to live there. These are not yet regulated by the
FSA.</p>



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1158"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1158</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06102481000008"></a>The second main issue is to extend
regulation to what we describe in the order as home purchase plans.
Sharia-compliant home financing arrangements have been developed to
meet the same purpose as a conventional mortgage product while
complying with Islamic principles. There are two main types. First, in
Murabaha structures, an institution buys and re-sells the home to the
consumer, accepting payment of the price over a lengthy period. These
are already regulated by the FSA. Secondly, Ijara products relate to
where the institution combines a sale with renting the un-owned share
of the property to the consumer. These are not yet regulated by the
FSA. Our aim is to remove the current regulatory imbalance between
Murabaha and Ijara products. All consumers who choose to use these
non-interest bearing products will benefit from FSA protection. This is
basically a question of fairness and of a level regulatory playing
field.</p><p><a name="06102481000009"></a>Consumers of home
reversion plans are not completely without protection at the moment.
The market is subject to voluntary protection through the industry
group Safe Home Income Plans (SHIP). SHIP members agree to comply with
a code of practice and undertake to provide a fair, simple and complete
presentation of any plan that they offer. They also offer a guarantee
that consumers will never owe a lender more than the value of their
home&#151;a &#147;no negative equity&#148; guarantee. These
protections stop short of the protections offered by statutory
regulation and the FSA&#146;s regime. Such a regime would extend to
consumers the FSA protections and would ensure a level regulatory
playing field in the equity release market, removing any artificial
regulatory
distortions.</p><p><a name="06102481000010"></a>We
are also committed to tackling regulatory barriers that may hinder the
development of a Sharia-compliant financial product. Purchasing your
own home is potentially the largest financial transaction people may
make during their lifetime and all consumers deserve suitable
protection. Regulation has an important role in protecting consumers of
these products, building market confidence and facilitating
innovation.</p><p><a name="06102481000011"></a>I have also been
asked by the Merits Committee briefly to address in my remarks the
Government&#146;s approach to Islamic finance. London is already
leading the West in Islamic finance. It has more banks supplying
services in accordance with Islamic principles than any other western
financial centre, and British professional services firms are leading
the way in the development of Islamic business services.</p><p><a name="06102481000012"></a>It is the Government&#146;s ambition to
ensure that, through London&#146;s international markets, Britain
strengthens its position as the world&#146;s leading centre for
international finance. The Government will continue to work with the
Financial Services Authority to modernise the regulatory and tax
framework to ensure that it keeps pace with opportunities in matters of
traditional UK strengths, along with new and innovative areas such as
Islamic finance. For example, there is a nascent market for
Sharia-compliant home financing products. The changes that we are
making in this order are to avoid market distortion, ensuring a level
regulatory playing

non-interest-bearing products will benefit from FSA protections.
However, I am sure that it will be understood that wider issues of
Islamic finance go beyond the scope of this order.</p><p><a name="06102481000013"></a>The
FSA has had responsibility for regulating first charge residential
mortgages since October 2004 and, following consultations in 2003 and
2004, we decided to bring home reversion plans and Ijara home financing
arrangements within the scope of FSA regulation. Because these types of
transactions are based on sale and purchase arrangements in land, and
are not loans secured on land which are specified in the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000, primary legislation was required. The
Regulation of Financial Services (Land Transactions) Act 2005 amended
the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 to add an appropriate
reference to these transactions. This order is needed to complete this
process by defining in detail the new activities to be
regulated.</p><p><a name="06102481000014"></a>In
addition, the FSA has published its own cost-benefit analysis and draft
rules and guidance. It proposes a range of rules tailored to deal with
the specific risks inherent in the home reversion and Ijara home
purchase markets. We anticipate that, subject to this measure
completing its passage through Parliament, the FSA will make the final
announcement of its rules next week.</p><p><a name="06102481000015"></a>This order amends the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order
2001. It specifies as regulated activities entering into,
administering, arranging and advising on regulated home reversion plans
and regulated home purchase plans. This means that the FSA will be able
to require firms undertaking these activities by way of business to be
authorised unless they benefit from an
exemption.</p><p><a name="06102481000016"></a>The order also
clarifies an existing provision relating to high net worth
&#147;business angel&#148; companies and amends the overseas person
exception to replace the reference to a &#147;non-resident
individual&#148; with a reference to a person who is not resident, in
order to catch corporate trustees who are resident overseas. The order
extends the existing exclusions from regulation for activities such as
giving general advice in newspapers to bring them into line with the
treatment of other mortgage-related activities.</p><p><a name="06102481000017"></a>The order defines home
reversion plans and home purchase plans in detail and the activities to
be regulated in relation to these products. These differ from the
equivalent regulated activities for mortgages in two important
respects. First, intermediaries for home reversion
providers&#151;&#147;the lender&#148;&#151;and for reversion
sellers will be regulated. Secondly, the acquisition of an existing
home reversion by a new provider, including from a provider who is not
the original provider, will be regulated. These differences were
consulted on and received
support.</p><p><a name="06102481000018"></a>Part
3 of the order makes consequential amendments to the Consumer Credit
Act and other primary legislation. Part 4 also makes consequential
amendments to secondary legislation, so that the newly regulated
activities are dealt with elsewhere in the body of financial services
and other secondary legislation. Part 5 establishes a

have submitted an application to the FSA for permission or variation of
permission or an application for approval which has not been dealt with
by 6 April next year, and which meet the other conditions. Finally, the
schedule to the order sets out further details of the regime that will
apply to persons who are subject to the transitional
provisions.</p><p><a name="06102481000019"></a>In conclusion, I

it to your Lordships. I beg to

Noakes:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for
introducing the order, and I put his mind at rest immediately by saying
that we support it. We supported the Regulation of Financial Services
(Land Transactions) Act when it was debated in your Lordships' House
just a little over a year ago, and we now support its detailed
implementation.</p><p><a name="06102481000022"></a>When I looked
back at the issues that we brought forward when we debated the Bill, as
it then was, in October 2005, I found that we raised concerns about the
cost of regulation. I am delighted to find that the final estimate of
the cost of regulation has proved lower than it was when we debated the
Bill. I do not know whether that is a first, but lower final regulatory
costs are certainly welcome.</p><p><a name="06102481000023"></a>At
that time, we also raised concerns about timing. The Government started
bringing home reversions within the FSA's regulatory ambit back in
November 2003, nearly three years ago. I then asked when the new
regulatory arrangements, and therefore complete protection for
consumers, would be brought into effect. The Minister told me at the
time that implementation would be in the first quarter of 2007. He
concluded his remarks at Second Reading by saying that the
Government,</p><ul><a name="06102481000040"></a>&#147;now wish
to press ahead and implement it as quickly as we
can&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 17/10/05; col.
565.]</ul><a name="06102481000039"></a>That sounded quite
hopeful, but I now see that the implementation date has slipped back to
the second quarter of 2007. It would be very easy to say that it is
just a matter of two months, but we started this three years ago. The
plain fact is that, although a voluntary scheme is in place, at present
consumers have imperfect protection, and there has been a general
consensus that that issue should be put right. I have never quite felt
that there has been a sense of urgency in getting these arrangements in
place, and perhaps the Minister can comment on
that.<p><a name="06102481000024"></a>I also raised with the
Minister last year the plight of those who had entered into home income
or shared appreciation mortgages marketed in the late 1980s. At that
stage, some, but certainly not all, lenders had entered into voluntary
arrangements, which mitigated some of the worst cases of hardship. But
not all lenders participated in that and I urged the Minister to use
the Government&#146;s de facto powers to achieve an equitable
outcome. The Minister said that the Government would continue to do
what they could. Can he update the House on that? Are all lenders now
engaged in a process which has removed the problems

these arrangements, as a result of the unregulated nature of home
income and shared appreciation mortgages? If not, will the Minister say
what else the Government will do about this?</p><h5><a name="06102481000042"></a>7.45

Newby:</b> My Lords, it is literally a year and a
week since we debated the primary legislation from which this order
flows. The Minister&#146;s description of its purpose brought back
memories of that happy
time.</p><p><a name="06102481000026"></a>The
noble Baroness has just made a point about timing. I have some sympathy
with her, not least because there is evidence that some providers have
been waiting for these regulations to come into effect before deciding
to offer products to the market. These are useful products for a lot of
people, so urgency would and should have been of the essence. However,
we are grateful that the regulations are now before us and that they
are coming into force reasonably
quickly.</p><p><a name="06102481000027"></a>It is also pleasing to
note that the likely cost of introducing and managing the order is less
rather than more than was envisaged. The figures that were bandied
about were very high, so I am particularly pleased. Without going into
the minutiae of the new computer programmes or whatever would be
required, it seemed to me that this would be a big barrier to entry for
many providers. I think that during the previous debate we were talking
of costs of more than &#163;400,000 for a regulated
firm.</p><p><a name="06102481000028"></a>I should welcome the
Minister's view on the press speculation that these products might
serve as a form of inheritance tax avoidance. Under these provisions, a
person could sell a half or two-thirds of a whole house and at that
point distribute the income to his heirs and successors but, at the
point of death, he would not have ownership of the assets. Subject to
the seven-year rule, this might be a rather crafty way of avoiding
inheritance tax. It seems to me that the innovation used by&#151;I
shall not say &#147;the accountancy profession&#148; in present
company&#151;the markets for providing people with ways of avoiding
inheritance tax knows no bounds. I wondered whether this issue had
crossed the Treasury's path, whether the Treasury thought that it was
likely to be significant and, if so, whether it had given any thought
to the potential leakage of revenue that might flow from it.</p><p><a name="06102481000029"></a>Subject to that question, we remain as
supportive of this measure as we were a year and a week
ago.</p><p><a name="06102481000030"></a><b><a name="61024-0003.htm_spnew146"></a><a name="06102481000046"></a>Lord

opposition Benches for their continued support for these provisions and
the thrust of the order. I shall try to deal with their
points.</p><p><a name="06102481000031"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady
Noakes, and the noble Lord, Lord Newby, talked about how the cost of
regulation had gone down. This came about through the FSA's own
calculations, which gave us better insight into what was involved, as
it had become more focused on the detail of what its regulation might
entail. Whether or not that is a first, I do not know, but it is
certainly to be welcomed as good news.</p>



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1162"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1162</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06102481000032"></a>Timing was also mentioned by both the
noble Baroness and the noble Lord. I accept that 6 April is just into
the second quarter, although not by very much. As to why it has taken
as long as it has, the Government will regulate only where there is a
clear need. We are often accused of over-regulating but, on this
occasion, it seems to me that we are accused of not regulating speedily
enough. It is important to establish the costs and benefits of
regulation before proceeding with it. These are complex products and it
is important to get the regulation right. That is why two consultations
were completed in advance of the Regulation of Financial Services (Land
Transactions) Act 2005, and we consulted earlier this year on the
technical detail of the secondary legislation. We published the results
of that consultation in mid-September. In addition, the FSA has
consulted on its rules, but I hope that we will now have a shared
interest in ensuring that this measure is implemented as quickly as
possible.</p><p><a name="06102481000033"></a>The noble Baroness,
Lady Noakes, asked about home income plans, which we touched upon when
we debated the primary legislation. That matter comes outside the ambit
of the order but I shall update the noble Baroness as best I can. There
is very little that the Government can now do; it is for lenders to
resolve the situation with the people who took out these products. Most
lenders have offered a package of measures to home income plan
investors to deal with the residual debt, and the Government hope that
all lenders will continue to take as generous and sympathetic an
approach as possible to that debt. The Government do not believe that
it would be appropriate or desirable to go beyond the protections
offered by the 1986 Act and the further steps taken to achieve
retrospective redress for consumers in this
instance.</p><p><a name="06102481000034"></a>The
Government have every sympathy with consumers who find themselves in
difficulty having taken out a shared appreciation mortgage, but no
evidence of misselling has been found by the Financial Ombudsman
Service to date, so it is difficult to see what grounds there are for
compensation. Consumers can access the Financial Ombudsman Service if
they feel they have been badly advised or that the mortgage has been
missold. Although I reiterate the Government&#146;s sympathy, if
there has been no misselling it is difficult to see what else might be
done.</p><p><a name="06102481000035"></a>The
noble Lord, Lord Newby, asked an intriguing question about inheritance
tax. Of course, the Government are very keen to ensure that loopholes
in inheritance tax are closed at the earliest opportunity. I know there
are those who would wish to abolish inheritance tax, but perhaps that
is a debate for another occasion. The Government have assisted some of
these products which were in danger of being caught by the pre-owned
assets legislation. Regulations came into force on6 April 2005
which introduced an exemption for equity release arrangements from the
pre-owned assets charge. The commitment was made by the Paymaster
General in autumn 2004 that arm&#146;s-length equity release
transactions would be exempt from the pre-owned assets charge, even if
the owner sells only part of their home. That was a facilitating
measure and not a restrictive one. The fundamental point is that we
need

abused as an inheritance tax or other tax avoidance device.</p><p><a name="06102481000036"></a>I thank noble Lords for
their support for the order. If the order is approved tonight, the FSA
will be able shortly to open its doors for applications from firms
carrying out regulated activities. This will give firms the necessary
time to prepare for the start of regulation next year. Subject to the
order completing its passage through Parliament this evening, the FSA
will take a further important step when it publishes its detailed rules
and guidance next week. As set out in this legislation, regulation will
take effect from 6 April
2007.</p><p><a name="06102481000037"></a>In general, our approach
throughout has been to establish a new regulatory regime, broadly
equivalent to the existing mortgage regime. It is only right that
consumers of home reversion plans and Ijara home financing arrangements
benefit from consumer protections afforded by FSA regulation, and I
think that that view is widely held. This will strengthen confidence in
the market, and consumer confidence is an essential base for diverse
and competitive markets. That is an outcome which I think your
Lordships will be keen to support, therefore I commend the order to the
House.</p><p><a name="06102481000038"></a>On Question, Motion

Committee</I>].</p><p><a name="06102487000003"></a>The
noble Lord said: My Lords, this debate relates to proposed revisions to
the code of practice published under the Treasure Act 1996 by my right
honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport.
It spells out the principles and practice to be followed by her in the
treasure process and provides guidance to other parties involved in the
treasure system. The Secretary of State is under a statutory duty to
keep the code under review and to revise it when appropriate. It is
being revised now to reflect the fact that certain administrative
responsibilities relating to the valuation of finds of treasure and the
payment of rewards are to be transferred from the Department for
Culture, Media and Sport to the British Museum.</p><p><a name="06102487000004"></a>Currently the DCMS undertakes a number of
responsibilities relating to the valuation of treasure finds and the
payment of rewards to finders and landowners. It is intended to
transfer, with conditions, these responsibilities, in respect of finds
made in England and Wales, to the British Museum. The museum already
undertakes a number of other responsibilities in relation to the
administration of the Treasure Act
1996.</p><p><a name="06102487000005"></a>This transfer of
responsibilities is designed to have two primary benefits. It will

way through the system. They will have to deal with only one
institution, the British Museum. By being involved throughout the whole
process, staff at the British Museum will be best placed to ensure the
smooth progress of any item from the beginning to the end of the
treasure system. Locating these responsibilities in one body will also
remove the current need to replicate files and expertise over two
organisations. This will improve the efficiency of the treasure system,
leading to related savings. However, we are also mindful of the need to
preserve the integrity of the current system and to ensure that it
retains public confidence.</p><p><a name="06102487000006"></a>We recognise that the
British Museum is a potential purchaser of treasure finds and, at the
same time, under these proposals, it will also be responsible for the
administration of the system which recommends to the Secretary of State
the price that museums should pay for such finds. It is because of
these concerns that a number of safeguards have been built into this
transfer to preserve the integrity of the system. These include: in all
cases it will remain the Secretary of State&#146;s responsibility to
make decisions in relation to rewards and valuations; the Department
for Culture, Media and Sport will also retain its responsibilities
relating to valuation in cases where the British Museum has shown an
interest in acquiring a find; appointments to the Treasure Valuation
Committee will continue to be made by the Secretary of State; the right
for interested parties to make representations to the
Secretaryof State against the Treasure Valuation
Committee&#146;s recommendations will remain; and a detailed
memorandum of understanding will be agreed between the DCMS and the
British Museum. This will spell out the responsibilities of both
organisations and will be available for public scrutiny. We feel
confident that these safeguards will ensure that the system retains a
high level of confidence among those involved that all finds are fairly
valued.</p><p><a name="06102487000007"></a>The code of practice
needs to be amended to reflect the new procedures which will be
followed once the transfer of responsibilities has taken place. A full
review of the code is planned for 2007, when other proposed amendments
to the treasure system will be considered. However, the last review of
the code took two years to complete and it was considered that the
benefits associated with this transfer were sufficiently compelling for
these amendments to be made in advance of the forthcoming
review.</p><p><a name="06102487000008"></a>Both the principle
behind the amendments to the code of practice and the amendments
themselves have been consulted on. The consultation documents were sent
to stakeholders, including the British Museum, the National Council for
Metal Detecting and various museums and their representative bodies.
All responses to the consultation were supportive of the proposed
transfer of responsibilities and of the proposed amendments to the
code. I beg to move.</p><p><a name="06102487000009"></a>Moved, That

Redesdale:</b> My Lords, we on
these Benches support the code. It seems to us to be logical. I know
that many groups have been consulted. Moving the responsibility from
the DCMS to the British Museum, with the appropriate safeguards, makes
all the sense in the world because the British Museum has extensive
knowledge. Of course, it will cut down on some of the costs
involved.</p><p><a name="06102487000011"></a>One issue that we have
to raise is that of integrity. The Minister said that while those
bringing forward treasure would have to feel that they were receiving a
fair price, the Treasure Act itself is a law to try to stop those who
take part in illicit activities and do not bring forward treasure finds
to be valued. That is one of our major problems we have: the system of
&#147;night hawking&#148; by metal detectorists who raid some of
our fine sites, taking metal objects which could have been used for
dating purposes.</p><p><a name="06102487000012"></a>It is
unfortunate that no prosecution has taken place under the Treasure Act,
which is of course a valuable tool to show where the law lies. It has,
however, been extremely difficult to bring about a prosecution. Despite
some good work done by the police, the value of these finds often means
that no prosecution is made, even though the damage to our ancient
monuments in the acquisition of those illicit objects should not be
underestimated.</p><h5><a name="06102487000037"></a>8
pm</h5><p><a name="06102487000013"></a>I raise this issue because
the DCMS is giving up a responsibility to the British Museum. We should
be looking carefully at the enforcement of the Treasure Act. This is
one aspect of the Treasure Act, but we must also ensure that people are
aware of the functioning of the Act. That has been undertaken by the
Portable Antiquities Scheme, which is also based at the British Museum.
There are 49 find liaison officers who liaise with finders and ensure
that much of the information is gathered and recorded. The Portable
Antiquities Scheme was originally set up with lottery funding, but the
DCMS has taken on board that it has a responsibility to fund the
scheme. Without the scheme&#151;the linchpin of the Treasure
Act&#151;the Act would be worthless to a degree, because few people
would know of its provisions and comply with them.</p><p><a name="06102487000014"></a>I raise this issue because Portable
Antiquities Scheme funding is currently under threat. Under the
spending review for 2007, there has been a requirement to make cuts,
year on year, of 7 per cent. That means that the Portable Antiquities
Scheme would lose 19 posts by 2010, making it inoperable. There would
then be a question mark over whether the Government were doing enough
to ensure that the Treasure Act was properly supported. I asked the
Government whether they could give an assurance that this would be
reviewed; there is a review of the Portable Antiquities Scheme next
year. It would be helpful, however, if the DCMS could give some
assurance that the very linchpin of the Treasure Act is not going to be
removed through funding cuts.</p><p><a name="06102487000015"></a>Lending support to the
idea that this must be done, objects are coming up for sale on the
illicit market. One of the major ways in which illicit objects are now 



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1166"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1166</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>being traded is through eBay. The Portable Antiquities Scheme has done
good work in monitoring what is happening on eBay. However, while the
scheme and the Treasure Act have been incredibly successful in bringing
forward treasure items to be valued and therefore saved for the
nation&#151;some of these items are quite exquisite&#151;there is a
growing market in illicit British finds being sold. I therefore hope
that the Government will not pass off their responsibilities to other
departments, such as the British Museum, and pass up their
responsibility for paying for
them.</p><p><a name="06102487000016"></a><b><a name="61024-0003.htm_spnew149"></a><a name="06102487000041"></a>Lord
Renfrew of Kaimsthorn:</b> My Lords, I, too, welcome
these provisions, and the success of the Treasure Act and Portable
Antiquities Scheme as a whole. These revisions, savings and proposed
rationalisations are clearly entirely appropriate. Much of the
scientific work is done at the British
Museum.</p><p><a name="06102487000017"></a>However, the Minister
was a little modest in his presentation of the scheme. One reason for
the formal transfer of many of these responsibilities to the British
Museum is the formidable success of the Treasure Act, as reinforced by
the Portable Antiquities Scheme. I do not think the late, lamented Lord
Perth, when he was so vigorously pressing for the new Treasure Act,
passed in 1996, could quite have envisaged the success of the scheme.
In that year, about 25 treasure trove finds went through the
appropriate procedure. In the most recent year for which we have
figures, 2005, it was something like 596: an increase by a factor of
20. It has been an enormous success. As I shall say in a moment, and as
the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, has indicated, the Portable Antiquities
Scheme and the finds liaison officers have played an important part in
that process. </p><p><a name="06102487000018"></a>The very success
of the treasure trove scheme means that many more pieces are being
offered to the nation&#146;s museums, including the British Museum,
and which it is desirable to acquire. Fortunately, it has been possible
to provide the funding, in large measure through the Heritage Lottery
Fund as well as the Victoria and Albert Museum scheme. I declare a
benign interest as a trustee of The Art Fund which has also played a
role. It is suggested that the Heritage Lottery Fund is likely to play
a decreasing role in future. I wonder whether it is not time for the
Government to set aside a modest sum&#151;&#163;1 million a year or
so&#151;for treasure acquisition. Otherwise, there will be a
considerable problem.</p><p><a name="06102487000019"></a>Wonderful
things have been acquired in recent years. One of the most remarkable
was the Ringlemere cup: a wonderful gold cup from the beginning of the
early Bronze Age, around 2000 BC, which compares with the Rillaton cup.
I remind the House that the treasure scheme has been updated from
earlier days. I think I am right in saying that on the death of King
George V, the Rillaton cup was found on his desk, containing his
cufflinks. In those days the treasure system clearly worked in a less
formal manner than today. I am sure we welcome that, and the fact that
it is now safely in the British Museum.</p>

great success of the Portable Antiquities Scheme. The finds liaison
officers, as the House will know, not only encourage the effective
operation of the Treasure Act, but also the voluntary reporting of
antiquities, as the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, has reminded us, which
are not treasure&#151;they are not gold, silver or
whatever&#151;but which are worth recording. In 2005, 57,000
antiquities were so recorded. The scheme is an enormous success on
which the Government are warmly to be congratulated. It also has an
outreach dimension: there are millions of hits on the website
associated with the scheme, and the very efficient team based at the
British Museum goes to schools and gives lectures. The nation&#146;s
treasure is not only being put in the right place&#151;in museums, in
many cases&#151;but is being of educational
value.</p><p><a name="06102487000021"></a>If I
may be even more affable about the Government, it has been a good
decade for antiquities. It started in 1996, when there was still a
Conservative Government, as the Minister will recall, but since then a
number of significant steps have safeguarded antiquities in this
country. The ratification of the 1970 UNESCO convention by this
Government, is one of them, and the Dealing in Cultural Objects
(Offences) Act 2003&#151;in which the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, had
a significant hand&#151;was a great step forward. However, the Act
does not work retrospectively and, like the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale,
I am still uneasy about some of the things that go on.</p><p><a name="06102487000022"></a>For instance, the Sevso
treasure was recently exhibited in a London saleroom. It is not
believed to have been found in this country&#151;although I do not
think the Minister could give me an assurance that it was
not&#151;and it was probably exported from its country of origin,
almost certainly illegally, after 1970 and must therefore be of
uncertain ownership. I find it difficult to see how the Government
could grant it an export licence. However, we cannot blame the
Government for the failure of the legislation at that point because of
the convention that legislation does not act retrospectively. As the
noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, said in today&#146;s <I>Guardian</I>, it
is a knotty problem that requires resolution, but that will not be
easy. However, the larger picture has been entirely
positive.</p><p><a name="06102487000023"></a>I shall conclude on
the same point as the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, by pointing out that
the success of the working of the Treasure Act and the Portable
Antiquities Scheme depends on the team of 47 or so people based at the
British Museum who work in liaison with the Department for Culture,
Media and Sport. The Comprehensive Spending Review is causing anxiety
among those of us who admire the working of the scheme. I am told that
it will require about &#163;1.5 million to operate at the present
level in 2008-09 and about &#163;1.6 million in 2010. Like the noble
Lord, Lord Redesdale, I ask the Minister to consider ring-fencing those
sums so that the scheme can go forward.</p><p><a name="06102487000024"></a>It is sometimes said that the present
Government are looking for a legacy. There may be some areas where the
legacy does not command my entire admiration, but in this area, for
which the Minister is responsible, it is a fine legacy, and my advice
to the Government is to safeguard it by ring-fencing it. I am therefore
happy to support the code.</p>

Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to both
noble Lords who contributed to this short debate. I am particularly
grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Renfrew, for his comments about the
advances we have made in allocating finds to their proper place, which,
in many cases, is for the good of the nationin museums. I
could expand his praise of recent developments in terms of museum
attendance, the figures for which are so much higher than they were in
the recent past. That reflects the fact that we now address ourselves
to a nation that is much more aware of this legacy and of the enormous
rewards than can be derived from our museums and that takes a keen
interest in this subject. That is why the Government are committed to
our strategy.</p><p><a name="06102487000026"></a>Both noble Lords
stretched the discussion on the code. I sought to emphasise not only
that the code of practice is based on rationality, but also that there
are administrative gains by effecting reductions in unnecessary
expenditure, thereby releasing funds for necessary expenditure. I hope
the noble Lords recognise that we are concerned about these matters,
but they ranged much more widely than
that.</p><p><a name="06102487000027"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale,
that we have a genuine problem with those who do not declare their
finds. Those involved in detection give enormous help in rescuing
treasure. They play their part in archaeological digs and engage in
their own forays. Many honest citizens and true ensure that, as the
noble Lord, Lord Renfrew, indicated, finds become available, and proper
rewards go to those who have discovered them and to those on whose land
they have been found.</p><h5><a name="06102487000038"></a>8.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06102487000028"></a>However, there is the hidden
market and the substantial activity&#151;although we are not able to
quantify it with any accuracy&#151;of those who do not follow the
procedures that we expect them to with regard to such finds. That is a
genuine problem. The British Museum, the Museums, Libraries and
Archives Council and eBay have recently produced a partnership
agreement so that eBay can be alerted to items on its site that may be
unreported treasure finds. Of course not everything will be sold
through eBay, but there is no doubt that this action will potentially
close down the illicit activity of people advertising their finds when
they have no right to be selling them. We are concerned to block
that.</p><p><a name="06102487000029"></a>I hear what the noble
Lord, Lord Redesdale, suggests about greater activity by my department
in pursuit of the illegal. That is not the direct responsibility of the
DCMS. The Home Office is concerned with illegal acts. It is very much
in the nation&#146;s interest that we reduce such illegal activity to
the absolute minimum, but the noble Lord will recognise that
prosecuting authorities will act only on clear evidence that such
activity has occurred. That is not easy to establish, as I am sure he
will
recognise.</p><p><a name="06102487000030"></a>Both
noble Lords indicated that departmental cuts might affect the
efficiency with which the work is carried out. All departments are
under the rubric of finding efficiency gains. The DCMS and its
supporting agencies are in the same position as others. The noble 



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1169"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1169</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord, Lord Renfrew&#151;quite rightly, given his enormous interest in
and massive contribution to this work over the years&#151;says that
this item of government expenditure and activity should be ring-fenced.
He will not be surprised to hear me say that I believe that if I
succumbed to such a concept&#151;I am mindful that the noble
Baroness, Lady Noakes, is sitting opposite me and knows exactly where
the economic pennies fall&#151;there would be a wide range of
representations in this House for ring-fencing of a similar kind. So I
cannot promise that this evening, but I can undertake to ensure that
efficiency gains will increase the efficiency of organisations and not
damage process. I am entirely at one with both noble Lords that this
work is of great benefit to the
nation.</p><p><a name="06102487000031"></a>The
noble Lord, Lord Renfrew&#151;he will not mind if I say it on this
occasion&#151;predictably raised the issue of the Sevso treasure. I
did not think that I could stand at the Dispatch Box this evening and
introduce an instrument with the word &#147;treasure&#148; in it
without the Sevso treasure being mentioned. I assure the House that the
Government have not been asked to grant an export licence. If they are,
they will consider whether they have any discretion in the matter.
Although we cannot guarantee where the Sevso treasure was found or who
owns it, there are sufficient vigorous claims around for the Government
to be unlikely to need to decide whether there should be an export
order. I cannot go any further than that from the Dispatch
Box&#151;and the noble Lord will recognise why I cannot&#151;but we
obviously have a keen interest in the outcome if the Sevso treasure
actually comes to market. There are great uncertainties about all
aspects of the Sevso treasure. The nation is right&#151;and I am glad
that the noble Lord raised the matter this evening&#151;to be to be
alert to the problems attendant on
that.</p><p><a name="06102487000032"></a>I want to say how much I
appreciate the constructive way in which both noble Lords discussed the
issues this evening. Both of them have contributed an enormous amount
to this work over the years. If I introduced the Motion modestly, it is
because, as I am all too well aware, I personally have a great deal to
be modest about, in comparison with the two noble Lords who have spoken
on the issue. What is more, a guiding light of the department is to do
as much good by stealth as we are able. The code of practice, which is
in the public domain without stealth, will, I hope, do good.
Accordingly, I commend it.</p><p><a name="06102487000033"></a>On

<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1170"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1170</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06102492000005"></a>The noble Baroness said:
My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 119, I shall also speak to Amendments
Nos. 120 to 122, 128 and 131. The amendments remove an ambiguity in the
Bill, which uses the phrase &#147;normal school hours&#148; to
refer to the time when a child is at school. The phrase is ambiguous.
Section 32 of the Education Act 2002 allows school governing bodies to
set the times of school sessions rather than school hours. The
Education (School Day and School Year) (England) Regulations 1999
require that,</p><ul><a name="06102492000109"></a>&#147;every
day on which a school meets shall be divided into two sessions which
shall be separated by a break in the middle of the
day&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06102492000006"></a>Furthermore,
many schools permit pupils to leave the premises in the lunch break.
The key question, therefore, is whether
the,</p><ul><a name="06102492000110"></a>&#147;break in the
middle of the
day&#148;,</ul><a name="06102492000078"></a>is part of
normal school hours. If it is not, there will be several adverse
consequences, most notably on the ability of a school to place a child
in detention over lunchtime and on the ability to ensure that parents
supervise their children in the first five days of an exclusion. The
amendments would remove this
ambiguity.<p><a name="06102492000007"></a>Amendments Nos. 119
to 121 would replace the phrase &#147;normal school hours&#148;
with &#147;school sessions&#148; in Clauses 88 and 89. Amendment
No. 122 would ensure that lunchtime detention does not
require24 hours&#146; notice to the parent or for the pupil
to be under 18.</p><p><a name="06102492000008"></a>Amendment No.
128 would ensure that, where a parent is supervising a pupil under
Clause 100, the pupil cannot roam the streets in the lunch
break.</p><p><a name="06102492000009"></a>Finally, Amendment No.
131 to Clause 104 would ensure that the police can take into custody
excluded children whom they find in a public place in the lunch
break.</p><p><a name="06102492000010"></a>I hope the Minister can
accept the amendments, which seek to provide further clarity. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06102492000011"></a><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew153"></a><a name="06102492000121"></a>Baroness
Sharp of Guildford:</b> My Lords, Amendments Nos.
126, 127 and 129, in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Walmsley,
relate to exclusions and parental responsibility for
exclusions.</p><p><a name="06102492000012"></a>We
had a very lengthy discussion in Committee about exclusions. The key
issue was how far parents of excluded children can keep them under
house arrest, which is what the government proposals in effect suggest.
There was general agreement on all sides of the House that, for many
families&#151;one must bear in mind that the pupils who are excluded
often come from disadvantaged, often one-parent, families, where the
sole breadwinner has a relatively low-skilled job, perhaps paid at the
minimum wage, and is likely to be dismissed if they fail to turn up for
work&#151;requiring a parent to take time off from work to supervise
a child poses considerable difficulties for them. This was summed up
rather neatly by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, at col. 1708 of the
<I>Official Report</I>, when he
said:</p><ul><a name="06102492000087"></a>&#147;It is wrong to
think that incarceration is the only form of punishment. The punishment
is actually on the parents in this case. The people who will suffer are
the parents, and the child will suffer because the parents are
suffering. That is the mechanism being used. To inconvenience the
parents sufficiently for them to

&#147;You go home and stay home for five days&#148;, in order that
the child should be properly disciplined&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official
Report</I>, 25/7/06; col.
1708.]</ul><p><a name="06102492000013"></a>In
replying to these concerns the Minister rightly pointed out that the
recommendation that parents should take responsibility for their
children came in the first instance from the Steer report, which many
of us felt was very good and well balanced. It stressed the importance
of ensuring that exclusions are seen not as a reward with time off from
school but as a punishment. I confess that that rang very true, as I am
a governor of a small primary school in a relatively disadvantaged area
and one of the problems we have faced is children on short-term
exclusions from school riding their bicycles round the school property.
The pupils involved see their bad behaviour rewarded with extra time
off from school, and that is not what we
want.</p><p><a name="06102492000014"></a>The Minister also pointed
out that the provisions apply only to the first five days of exclusion
and that the key issue was short-term, temporary exclusions. Of the
344,500 exclusions in 2003-04, 85 per cent were for five days or fewer,
50 per cent were for only one or two days and 26 per cent were for just
one day. The very large burden of what to do with children during
short-term exclusions is a real problem that has to be faced.</p><p><a name="06102492000015"></a>Other problems continue to arise. My
noble friend Lady Williams, who is unfortunately unable to be with us
today to argue this amendment in my place, wrote a letter to the
Minister in which she
said:</p><ul><a name="06102492000088"></a>&#147;First, the
defence of &#145;reasonable justification&#146; does not in itself
address the situation that may arise when others are unreasonable. Some
of the parents of excluded children will be single parents, trying to
bring up children while holding down a full or nearly full-time job. If
their employer is unsympathetic, and will not give them immediate leave
to pick up the child concerned, the parent will be faced with a
difficult dilemma. Does she or he conform to the school&#146;s
request, or to the employer&#146;s order? Many parents particularly
in low-paid occupations may be at risk of [losing their job] if they
absent themselves from work.</ul><ul><a name="06102492000089"></a>Second, some parents will have jobs that
demand their presence, and cannot easily be replaced if they absent
themselves. Nurses and medical aides in NHS hospitals fall into this
category. So do teachers and teaching aides. So do carers in homes for
the elderly or the dying. None of these people can easily abandon
responsibilities just as weighty as that of attending to their
child.</ul><ul><a name="06102492000090"></a>Third, many parents
have elderly parents they cannot call upon, or spouses/partners who are
unreliable and who may be largely absent or addicted to alcohol or
drugs. For such a parent, the conflict between the needs of other
children or elderly relatives and the demands of the job they hold may
be virtually
irreconcilable&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06102492000016"></a>My
noble friend makes very real points that led us to put forward
Amendments Nos. 126 and 127, the thinking behind which I would like to
explain a little more. I confess that Amendment No. 126 is not quite
what we had in mind and I have, so to speak, an amendment to the
amendment which I need to explain. The amendment
reads:</p><ul><a name="06102492000091"></a>&#147;The local
education authority for the area of the school which has excluded the
pupil must offer a place at a pupil referral unit for the period of the
exclusion referred to in subsection (2)&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1172"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1172</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><a name="06102492000079"></a>We were picking up on
the idea that the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, discussed in Committee. He
said that the right thing would be for three or four local schools to
club together to form a pupil referral unit which could be used
jointly. Not every parent will have problems when confronted by the
need to look after an excluded child but some will face real
difficulties&#151;and where there are real difficulties they should
have the option of asking for a place at a pupil referral unit. The
amendment that we would like to see would
state:<ul><a name="06102492000092"></a>&#147;The local
education authority for the area of the school which has excluded the
pupil must offer the parent the option of a place at a pupil referral
unit&#148;.</ul><a name="06102492000080"></a>That would meet
our
requirements.<p><a name="06102492000017"></a>To
some extent Amendment No. 127 follows on from that. It refers to the
child accompanying the parent to a pupil referral unit and provides
clarification, as do the amendments of the noble Baroness, Lady
Buscombe. In looking at the concept of whether the parent is guilty of
an offence, the alleviating circumstances must be whether the pupil
is,</p><ul><a name="06102492000111"></a>&#147;accompanying a
parent to the parent&#146;s place of employment or a hospital or
other healthcare
facility&#148;,</ul><a name="06102492000081"></a>or
<ul><a name="06102492000112"></a>&#147;with a parent at the
parent&#146;s place of employment&#148;,</ul><a name="06102492000082"></a>or&#151;and this picks up on the
point that I was
making&#151;<ul><a name="06102492000113"></a>&#147;accompanying
a parent to a pupil referral unit.</ul><p><a name="06102492000018"></a>We tabled Amendment No.
129 at the request of the Advisory Centre for Education. I believe that
its representatives have been to see the Minister and discussed with
him their worries about the whole question of what is
&#147;reasonable justification&#148; and its interpretation. The
Minister&#146;s letter to my noble friend Lady Williams refers at
length to the agreements that he came to with the Advisory Centre for
Education. Perhaps I may read out the letter because it will be useful
to have it on the record. It
states:</p><ul><a name="06102492000093"></a>&#147;My officials
have recently met with representatives of Parents&#146; Groups such
as Parentline Plus and the Advisory Centre for Education, to discuss
possible changes to my Department&#146;s draft guidance to LAs on
penalty notices and parental responsibility for the whereabouts of
excluded pupils. We were able to agree several changes with the groups.
The main changes are to: amend the model letter for schools to issue to
the parent at the time of exclusion, to make it clear to the parent
what their duty is for the first five days and outlining the principle
of the defence of &#145;reasonable
justification&#146;&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06102492000019"></a>One
of the requirements of the Advisory Centre for Education is that there
should be an understanding and information for the parent about what is
meant by that wording.</p><p><a name="06102492000020"></a>The
letter goes on to say that the main changes will
also,</p><ul><a name="06102492000114"></a>&#147;reflect the
wording on the exclusion of pupils with Special Educational Needs
included in the recently issued Exclusions guidance in the new guidance
we will issue on penalty notices. This wording makes it clear that
schools must have regard to the SEN Code of Practice on identifying,
assessing and making provision for pupils with SEN, including those
with behavioural, social and emotional needs. We will also cross refer
the reader to the full exclusions guidance, include a reference in the
Penalty Notice guidance to encourage local authorities to collect data
to help them monitor the use of penalty notices for whereabouts; and
revise the wording in the draft guidance to emphasise that a penalty
notice should not normally be issued for a first
offence&#148;.</ul>

feel that that meets the requirements of the advisory centre for the
provision of better information for parents on what &#147;reasonable
justification&#148; means. I am grateful to the Minister for writing
to clarify those issues. That covers the three amendments that I wish
to speak to.</p><h5><a name="06102492000118"></a>8.45

Adonis:</b> My Lords, in Committee, the noble
Baroness, Lady Buscombe, drew the House&#146;s attention to an
important point relating to the definition of school hours in Clause
100 and its implications for our policy on the whereabouts of excluded
pupils. Our intention is for pupils not to be present in a public place
during school hours on the first five days of exclusion without
reasonable justification. In &#147;school hours&#148;, we include
the lunch hour and other breaks that a school may permit during the
day. Amendments Nos. 119 to 122, 128 and 131 in the name of the noble
Baroness provide a more sufficient and robust definition of
&#147;school hours&#148; than is in the Bill. They improve the Bill
and we are very glad to accept them.</p><p><a name="06102492000023"></a>Amendments Nos. 126, 127 and 129, spoken
to by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, are concerned with the provisions
the Bill makes for excluded pupils. We have given a great deal of
further attention to that issue and the noble Baroness was good enough
to quote some of the correspondence. However, I have a reply
outstanding to the latest letter from the noble Baroness, Lady
Williams; I will reply, but I hope I can give some indication of where
we will be going on that and I hope that the noble Baroness will find
that at least a move in the right
direction.</p><p><a name="06102492000024"></a>Amendment No. 126
would mean that local authorities would have to make provision from day
one of the exclusion, in the case of temporary exclusions, rather than,
as proposed in the Bill, from day six. Under existing arrangements,
schools and local authorities can and do make provision earlier than
the sixth day either at a pupil referral unit or through another form
of alternative provision. The issue here is whether we should require
local authorities to make alternative provision earlier than the sixth
day. We considered this issue long and hard, and I appreciate the
arguments of the noble Baronesses, Lady Sharp and Lady Williams, but
our conclusion was that to make a move in this direction was certainly
unaffordable at the moment and probably unworkable. Let me explain
why.</p><p><a name="06102492000025"></a>First, an appropriate place
will not always be available immediately in a pupil referral unit
unless there is a very significant expansion of supply. To have that
significant expansion of supply and other provision that would be
suitable for pupils would, in our view, be prohibitively expensive. Our
estimate was that it would cost some &#163;53 million a year,
compared with the cost of making such provision available from day six,
which is around &#163;16 million a year. We accept that some local
authorities are in a position to make this provision now because of the
facilities they have available.</p><p><a name="06102492000026"></a>However, it is not simply a case of the
availability of places in pupil referral units. It is important to note
that under the law, quite rightly, provision for 



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1174"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1174</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>excluded pupils has to be suitable to the child&#146;s age, ability
and aptitude and to any special educational needs that they may have.
Although a pupil referral unit placement may be suitable for excluded
pupils in the first few days of exclusion, it may not be. Therefore,
that may not be the answer even if we were able to resource PRU
provision. It may not be the appropriate provision for a particular
excluded child in a particular circumstance.</p><p><a name="06102492000027"></a>The conclusion we have reached is that
the position in the Bill is right, but of course we expect local
authorities to be mindful of their responsibilities. A conscientious
local authority would be very mindful indeed of the needs of parents
who find it difficult or well nigh impossible to make personal
arrangements for the supervision of their children during a short-term
exclusion.</p><p><a name="06102492000028"></a>Amendments Nos. 127
and 129 address the concerns raised by the noble Baronesses, Lady Sharp
and Lady Williams, about the duties introduced under Clause 100.
Reflecting on the concerns expressed in Committee and following the
meeting of my officials with several parents&#146; organisations to
which the noble Baroness referred, we recognise that parents need a
clearer explanation of their duty under Clause 100.</p><p><a name="06102492000029"></a>I wrote to the noble
Baroness, Lady Williams, undertaking to ensure that the model letter my
department offers head teachers to send to parents when a child is
excluded is revised to set out clearly the precise nature of their duty
under Clause 100, the days on which that duty will apply, the
consequences of failing in that duty and the availability of the
defence of reasonable justification. Picking up on the suggestion of
the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, in her latest letter to me, the
model letter will also include the telephone number of local
authorities&#146; education welfare services or equivalent. I
undertake to speak to the Local Government Association about
commitments it may be able to give about, for example, helpline
arrangements with extended hours to ensure that this is as accessible
as possible for parents, including those who are at work during the
day.</p><p><a name="06102492000030"></a>I undertake to report
back&#151;I fear that I shall be unable to do so in the coming
week&#151;to the noble Baronesses, Lady Sharp and Lady Williams, on
the results on those discussions, and to circulate details to other
noble Lords.</p><p><a name="06102492000031"></a>However, after
careful consideration, we are not persuaded that we should go further
and seek to define &#147;reasonable justification&#148; in the way
in which I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, would wish.
There are two reasons. First, to include in the notice which the parent
receives an indication of what is and what is not a reasonable
justification may simply present parents with a list of ready-made
excuses. Secondly, having considered what such a list might look like,
we do not believe that it is viable to compile it. It would be well
nigh impossible to predict the range of factual circumstances in which
the defence would be available. The test of what is reasonable will
depend on the merits of the individual case. What is reasonable in some
circumstances will not necessarily be reasonable in all circumstances.

as an example&#151;I have given some thought to it. Going to a public
library might be a reasonable justification for a pupil who needed to
undertake specific study, particularly in the run-up to examinations,
but it might not be reasonable if the reason for going was to play
computer games and to lark around. That is just one example of how to
seek to specify &#147;reasonable justification&#148; in guidance or
a letter to parents would be well nigh impossible. Those who will bring
forward cases under this clause will be reasonable people working for
public authorities and they will make reasonable
judgments.</p><p><a name="06102492000032"></a>I
reiterate that we accept that parents, particularly those who may be
disadvantaged, need clear guidance. I have gone some way towards
clarifying that advice. I am happy to commit the Government to
consulting interest groups on the wording of our guidance, but we
cannot go as far as to agree to the notice from head teachers including
a list of acceptable
justifications.</p><p><a name="06102492000033"></a>I
further stress that the duty placed on parents under Clause 100 is
quite specific: they must ensure that their child is not present in a
public place during school hours during the first five days of
exclusion. There is no duty on the parent to supervise their child or
to be with their child during that time. Where a child may need
supervision, the clause does not require the parent to exercise that
supervision; a friend or relative could do it. A parent, therefore, is
at liberty to arrange for the supervision of the child in whatever way
they choose and this need not be in person; hence, they have no need to
take time off work, to take their child to work with them, or to
accompany their child to a pupil referral unit. However, as I have
said, the greater availability of advice from the education welfare
service&#151;which I hope we can provide&#151;should mean that
those parents who have no capacity to make arrangements will be given
proper support.</p><p><a name="06102492000034"></a>I know that what
I have said falls short of what the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, was
seeking, but I hope that I have been able to meet at least some of her
concerns. I hope that she and the House will welcome what I have said
as achieving the objectives that we all share. Having read the Steer
report, I accept what the noble Baroness said. It is the
professionals&#146; remark that the penalty of short-term exclusion
often seemed to be no penalty at all which led us into this territory
in the first
place.</p><p><a name="06102492000035"></a><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew155"></a><a name="06102492000123"></a>Baroness

noble Baroness said: My Lords, we move to the issue of physical
restraint of pupils. In our debate on 25 July, the Minister said that
school staff already had a statutory power to use reasonable force. He
pointed out:</p><ul><a name="06102492000101"></a>&#147;We are not
aware that this essential legislation has caused problems over the past
eight years in which it has been in effect. Therefore, we believe that
it would be disproportionate and impractical to require every school to
give every member of staff who has any responsibility for supervising
pupils specialised training in physical
intervention&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>,
25/7/06;col.
1688-9.]</ul><p><a name="06102492000043"></a>What about the
Minister&#146;s inclusion agenda? The Government say that every
teacher is a teacher of children with special needs, and it is those
children who are disproportionately affected by this problem and whose
needs must be seriously taken into account, if there is to be any kind
of physical intervention without damage. The Advisory Centre for
Education, the National Autistic Society and the charity TreeHouse all
have significant concerns about the broad powers given to the
schools&#146; workforce to use force and the likely disproportionate
impact on disabled children and those with special educational needs
such as autism, whose behaviour can often be extreme and very difficult
to deal with, unless all those members of staff have training in
intervention in an appropriate way and in de-escalation
strategies.</p><p><a name="06102492000044"></a>The Steer report,
about which we have heard much, deliberately set aside consideration of
children with special educational needs, yet they make up 90 per cent
of those at primary school and 60 per cent of those at secondary school
who are excluded from school and with whom those situations might
arise. In debates in another place the Schools Minister, Jim Knight,
was most helpful in clarifying that
when,</p><ul><a name="06102492000115"></a>&#147;deciding
whether to use force and what sort of force to use, school staff will
have to take account of all the relevant

educational needs or disability&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official
Report</I>, Commons Standing Committee E, 10/05/06; col.
835.]</ul><p><a name="06102492000045"></a>The Minister is
entirely correct in saying that there is non-statutory guidance on the
use of force. Schools already have guidance on the use of restrictive
physical interventions for staff working with children and adults who
display extreme behaviour in association with a learning disability
and/or autistic spectrum disorder, and separate guidance on the use of
restrictive physical intervention for pupils with severe behavioural
difficulties. The problem is that those two sets of guidance are
neither statutory nor well known in mainstream schools. As anybody with
any knowledge of working with children with autism will know, it is
imperative that mainstream schools also receive such guidance,
especially on avoidance and de-escalation of
problems.</p><p><a name="06102492000046"></a>Special schools have
developed great expertise over the past few years in dealing with such
issues, and we would hope that their expertise can be spread throughout
the mainstream school community through dissemination of best practice.
We warmly welcome the Minister&#146;s pledge to update the guidance,
but could he clarify how it will be distributed to schools, whether it
will be made statutory and how the DfES will ensure that all schools
will act in accordance with it? For example, will Ofsted monitor its
use? We believe that unless this clause requires statutory guidance,
uneven professional practice will result, with consequent risks to
children and the staff involved. The Minister said at Second Reading
that,</p><ul><a name="06102492000116"></a>&#147;we need to
further nurture the training and development of teachers and head
teachers&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/6/06; col.
863.]</ul><a name="06102492000083"></a>That is exactly what
our amendment seeks to do. The need for this will become increasingly
pressing as more children with complex behavioural and communication
difficulties, such as autism, are included in mainstream schools. They
will gain many advantages from that, but only if they are properly
resourced and the staff are properly trained to meet their particular
needs, not least in a situation where physical restraint might be
required.<p><a name="06102492000047"></a>Jim Knight suggested
in Committee in another place that he did not see SEN behaviour and
physical handling as a mainstream issue and maintained that it was only
so in,</p><ul><a name="06102492000117"></a>&#147;some schools
and units ... where situations requiring physical intervention may
be more frequent and more serious&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official
Report</I>, Commons, Standing Committee E, 10/5/06; col.
860.]</ul><a name="06102492000084"></a>But, as I said, his
comments seem at odds with the Government&#146;s excellent 10-year
strategy for children with special needs, <I>Removing barriers to
achievement</I>, which
states:<ul><a name="06102492000102"></a>&#147;All teachers
should expect to teach children with special
needs&#148;.</ul><a name="06102492000085"></a>If
all teachers need to teach children with special needs, then all
teachers need the appropriate training. If they have the power to use
physical restraint where appropriate, they need to know how to use it
properly and in a way that does not endanger the child, themselves or
any other child. A thorough consultation process leading to statutory
guidance aimed at all school staff would be the most appropriate step.
As any teacher might at any time have children with special needs in

teacher takes physical restraint of a child lightly. It is a very
difficult and sensitive area and teachers are very reluctant to do it
because of the danger of misinterpretation of their behaviour. I am
sure that most teachers will apply it only when it is absolutely
necessary to secure the safety of the child and other children in the
class. However, we have a duty to ensure that teachers are properly
prepared for that responsibility by ensuring that they are all properly
trained. I beg to
move.<p><a name="06102492000048"></a><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew158"></a><a name="06102492000126"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, Clause 90 re-enacts provisions
that became law in 1998. As I said in Committee, we are not aware that
they have caused difficulties over the past eight years and therefore
we did not regard this as a controversial part of the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06102492000049"></a>However, we fully accept
that the use of force is a sensitive issue, so from the outset the
legislation has been supported by detailed, practical guidance. As I
have already indicated, we will review and re-issue this guidance. It
will be made available on Teachernet, which is our usual way of
communicating with schools. That should ensure wide
dissemination.</p><p><a name="06102492000050"></a>Ofsted keeps all
these issues under review, but I shall need to come back to the noble
Baroness on the context in which it might carry out specific monitoring
of this matter. I was looking for inspiration from the Box, which,
alas, I have not received, but I do not believe that the guidance is
statutory. I shall confirm that with the noble Baroness later. Our
view, therefore, is that the first subsection of this amendment is
unnecessary. There is no need to require my department to issue
guidance because we are already fully committed to doing so. Enhanced
guidance will be available to all schools when Clause 90 comes into
force. I can also promise that it will cover issues highlighted in this
and previous debates, including special educational needs and staff
training.</p><p><a name="06102492000051"></a>The second subsection
of the amendment boils down to imposing a requirement on every school
to provide specific training for every member of staff who supervises
pupils. We continue to believe that this would be disproportionate.
Guidance will make clear that decisions about training should be based
on risk assessments carried out by individual schools. Those should
focus on the likely frequency and seriousness of incidents requiring
the use of force. There may well be schools where the head teacher
concludes that the risk is such as to justify training of all staff
with supervisory responsibilities, but it is more sensible to let heads
make decisions based on the needs of particular schools rather than
seeking to impose a uniform regime from the centre. I hope that, with
that assurance, the noble Baroness will not feel the need to press the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06102492000052"></a><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew159"></a><a name="06102492000127"></a>Baroness

response. I will not press the amendment at this stage, but I am not
totally happy with what he said. Guidance on a website is all very
well, but it is also all very theoretical. It is not really a
substitute for the sort of training where teachers can discuss the
issues and share their experiences, best

put a teacher in a situation where something dangerous might arise, you
really must make sure that they are properly trained to address it,
even if it is not very likely.</p><p><a name="06102492000053"></a>I used to be a science teacher, as noble
Lords will know, and I would have hated to go into the laboratory
without having been trained in how to respond if a child behaved
dangerously with a piece of scientific equipment, or if a child had a
fit in an environment where there was equipment with which they could
hurt themselves. I am pleased to say such a situation never arose, but
I would not have felt confident to go into a laboratory without such
training.</p><p><a name="06102492000054"></a>The more we are
successful in including children with severe difficulties in the
mainstream&#151;with all the benefits that can provide for certain
children&#151;the more we need to be aware that such difficult
situations can arise and that all teachers have a right to receive
proper training. Although I accept what the Minister said in good
faith, I am not quite sure that it is enough. My noble friend and I
will consult TreeHouse and the National Autistic Society, and we will
consider whether we might want to bring this back at Third Reading. In

as I have done again and again during our debates: who on earth would
be a teacher? We return to this much-debated and, to my mind, hugely
important amendment. It will enable teachers to retain their anonymity
where they have been accused of committing a criminal offence by a
pupil in class. Out of 2,016 cases investigated between 1995 and 2002,
only 4 per cent of all allegations against teachers have resulted in a
conviction.</p>

believe that risks are so great that they should not be taken. That is
right; we should never risk our children&#146;s welfare. But neither
should we therefore risk the trust of our teachers. Male teachers are
dissuaded from the profession, which is hardly surprising as 70 per
cent of all allegations are made against male teachers.</p><p><a name="06102492000060"></a>Following the last stage of the Bill, my
colleagues and I met the Minister from another place to discuss the
implications of the amendment. I am very grateful to the Minister, Jim
Knight, for that opportunity. Having considered the representations of
the Minister, Members on other Benches and the NSPCC, we have revised
our amendment so that it will strike the most effective mechanism for
protecting teachers from allegations that ruin careers and lives, which
leaves enough flexibility to carry out effective police
investigations.</p><p><a name="06102492000061"></a>We have considered the
amendment extremely carefully over the past few months. There are some
crucial differences. The new version of the amendment provides for the
order to be approved by resolution of each House of Parliament,
ensuring parliamentary scrutiny. It applies only to charges for
criminal offences, not internal disciplinary matters. The amendment
includes a power to include exemptions where necessary&#151;that is,
where the accused is in danger of committing further offences or
fleeing after having done so and where the police need to identify the
accused during their investigations, for example when seeking
witnesses.</p><p><a name="06102492000062"></a>I believe that we
have addressed the main concerns of the NSPCC. The Secretary of
State&#146;s powers under the amendment are completely different from
the arrangements that surrounded List 99. The Secretary of
State&#146;s involvement in regulations made under the amendment
extends to the guidance that the Minister has already introduced. The
Secretary of State could not make a judgment on individual cases, as
with List 99; rather, he or she would have a power to introduce a
general framework for anonymity. Specific exemption could be brought by
those with expertise or local knowledge, such as police or social
workers.</p><p><a name="06102492000063"></a>We recognise the need
to leave schools and police forces the absolute independence to deal
with allegations as they, in their professional expertise, see fit; but
anonymity will protect the future of thousands who face unfair
allegations and the crippling effect of ever-increasing trial by
media.</p><p><a name="06102492000064"></a>The NSPCC has expressed
concerns that the amendment would create a two-tier system under which
teachers and school staff were afforded anonymity until they were
charged, but not those who work with children in other areas. My
response is: just because the amendment does not afford anonymity to
all who work with children does not mean that we should do
nothing.</p><p><a name="06102492000065"></a>We would welcome
measures that protected all people who work with children from the
tragic effects of false allegations and the destruction of reputation,
but I must make one point absolutely clear. Teachers work with children
in classrooms. Their relationship with children is entirely different
from that of a carer or someone in another position outside school.

amendment. We have made teachers&#146; lives difficult, for good
reason in almost all cases. On the other hand, teachers have a hard
task to perform and, in the classroom, additional vulnerability, not
least to this kind of allegation, should not be imposed. Affording the
degree of anonymity proposed in the amendment is only just, because one
is innocent until proved guilty; it is also just in terms of the
continuity of that teacher&#146;s role in the school after the
allegation has been thoroughly investigated. Finally, in its current
form, the amendment provides for the right protection of children if
there is a perceived risk due to the character of the offence committed
by the individual.</p><h5><a name="06102492000119"></a>9.15

way that they act in those circumstances. However, with a free press,
this is a very difficult matter. I recall our discussions in this House
in 2003 on the Sexual Offences Bill. We had a very thorough canter
round the course on this issue with a different team. At the time, I
was in the home affairs team but I recall it very well. We concluded
that we could not legislate to fetter the rights of the free press;

will be able to recall the difficulties that we had only a few months
ago when there was a lot of publicity about certain people working in
schools. Ministers had made decisions about that based on the advice of
civil servants&#151;all in good faith, I am sure. But, as a result,
we now have the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill, in which both
Houses of Parliament have decided that it is more appropriate for such
decisions to be made by an independent board of experts. I think that
that should also happen in these cases. I do not think that it should
go to the Secretary of State.</p><p><a name="06102492000073"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, said
that accepting her amendment would be better than doing nothing. But
the fact is that the Government have not done nothing. I, too, am
grateful to the Minister, Jim Knight, for inviting me to the meeting at
which we talked about what the Government are doing. A number of new
practices now in place are designed to ensure that cases are thoroughly
investigated as quickly as possible with appropriate inquiries of other
adults about whether there is any corroboration of the child&#146;s
story. Rightly, one concern of the NSPCC is that only a very small
proportion of all allegations is proved simply on the basis of
children&#146;s evidence. There is a better chance of genuine
complaints being proved where there is some corroboration from adults.
Therefore, it is important that appropriate and sensitive inquiries can
be made.</p><p><a name="06102492000074"></a>I found it significant
that in the run-up to today&#146;s debate we had objections from what
one might consider to be both sides of the spectrum. The NSPCC came
from the point of view of the protection of children and did not want
to fetter any appropriate inquiries that might lead to the proving of
genuine allegations. On the other hand, the NUT was very concerned
about what is meant by anonymity and how far it goes. Are we talking
about asking other members of staff at the school whether they can
corroborate the child&#146;s story? Are we going to the
child&#146;s parents or to a medical practitioner and right through
the spectrum to the press? Of course, no one wants that. When both
sides of the spectrum find difficulties with an amendment, you have to
ask yourself whether it is the right one.</p><p><a name="06102492000075"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, said
that her proposals represent the most effective mechanisms. I believe
that the most effective mechanisms are prevention and training for
staff on what is appropriate behaviour with children. Staff need to
know how they might inadvertently open themselves up to allegations;
how they can protect themselves from that; how to create a culture of
child protection within a school with everyone trained in what to look
out for when a child has been abused; and, if a child is upset, how to
notice what the problem is and to listen to the child effectively. I
believe that those are the 



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1183"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1183</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>most effective mechanisms in preventing unwarranted allegations against
teachers, which none of us wants to see. If allegations are made, we do
not want to see teachers vilified any more widely than is appropriate
for a proper investigation of the
issue.</p><p><a name="06102492000076"></a>I would like the new
measures that the Government have put in place to speed up inquiries. I
would also like a proper opportunity to evaluate whether those measures
are working before we put in place a piece of legislation such as the
noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, is so conscientiously putting before us
tonight. It is right that we should have time to see whether the new
measures are working well and then return to all the experts and say,
&#147;Right, do you think that in any way any child&#146;s safety
has been prejudiced by this set of measures? Do we need to go
further?&#148; If they believe that we need to go further I, for one,
would be very anxious to do so. If, on the other hand, many teachers
feel that they have been vilified more widely than is necessary for a
very narrow investigation of the issues, we also need to look again at
that.</p><p><a name="06102492000077"></a>As we
have some problems with this amendment and as we have some new measures
in place for which we need time to see whether they work, we shall not
be supporting the amendment, although I repeat that we absolutely
support the principle of anonymity, as far as is compatible with
ensuring child safety, because the interests of the child are
absolutely
paramount.</p><p><a name="06102497000001"></a><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew163"></a><a name="06102497000023"></a>Baroness
Howe of Idlicote:</b> My Lords, I listened with
interest to the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. She has raised some
important issues. It is important that all teachers are given basic
training on what is appropriate behaviour. However, we need to take
note of the fact that only 4 per cent of allegations are actually
proved. That does not mean to say that more than 4 per cent or less
than 4 per cent is the right number, but it is worrying that,
increasingly, teachers can be put out on a limb, cases can take a very
long time to prove and so on.</p><p><a name="06102497000002"></a>I
have much sympathy with the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness,
Lady Buscombe. As others have said, she has gone to a great deal of
trouble to take into account the circumstances under which further
investigations could and should properly be made. I agree with the
noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, that it should not be the Secretary of
State to whom one appeals in these circumstances; there should be
someone much more independent than that. Perhaps the Minister can
reassure us on that point.</p><p><a name="06102497000003"></a>As
the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, asked, &#147;Who would be a
teacher?&#148;. Teachers are an amazing group of people, giving
absolutely of their best. Usually, people are grateful to them but also
quite a lot of carping goes on. I hope that we might find a way of
further protecting them from what can increasingly be seen as a way of
purely getting one's own back on a teacher. There is an altogether too
successful method of doing that at the moment, with the media not being
as responsible as they should be.</p>

Adonis:</b> My Lords, like other noble Lords who have
spoken, I completely appreciate the concerns which have led the noble
Baroness, Lady Buscombe, to table the amendment. I pay tribute to her
for the consistent attention she has paid to this important issue
during the passage of the Bill through the House.</p><p><a name="06102497000005"></a>My reply was in fact largely given by the
noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. I hope I do not need to repeat it all,
but I feel it incumbent on me, given the gravity of the issue, to set
out the Government&#146;s position properly.</p><p><a name="06102497000006"></a>The noble Baronesses,
Lady Buscombe and Lady Walmsley, met my honourable friend Jim Knight,
along with Members of the House of Commons and representatives from the
NSPCC and the NASUWT, in July. My honourable friend agreed to give the
issue further consideration over the summer and has recently written to
the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, to follow up the points raised at
that meeting. It may be helpful, since that letter was not circulated
to all noble Lords, if I reiterate the key points. I stress&#151;as
the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, has&#151;that because we are not
able to give a statutory right to anonymity, although we have given it
a good deal of consideration, that does not mean to say that we have
been satisfied with the status quo and have not made changes. We have
made changes, which I will set out. We believe, however, that to give a
statutory right of anonymity is a step too far, given all the
considerations that need to apply.</p><p><a name="06102497000007"></a>First, our new guidance on allegations
was issued less than a year ago. Since then, we have included
overarching guidance on handling allegations against all people who
work with children, in <I>Working Together to Safeguard Children</I>.
That was published in April, and applies from October this year. Taking
up the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, a key feature of
that advice is that all allegations should be dealt with as
expeditiously as possible. One of the biggest concerns the teaching
unions have rightly had on this is that too many cases were dragging on
for an unnecessarily long time. Each continuation of the investigative
process is more time when a teacher is, perhaps unfairly, in the
spotlight and unable fully to clear their name&#151;if, indeed, they
are innocent of the allegations.</p><p><a name="06102497000008"></a>The safeguarding children guidance makes
emphatic the need for speed in dealing with allegations. At paragraph
6.21 on page 152 it
says:</p><ul><a name="06102497000020"></a>&#147;In evaluating the
effectiveness of local
procedures&#148;&#151;</ul><a name="06102497000018"></a>including
procedures applying in
schools&#151;<ul><a name="06102497000021"></a>&#147;local
safeguarding children boards should have regard to the need to complete
cases expeditiously. Data about allegations made against education
staff show that it is reasonable to expect that 80 per cent of cases
should be resolved within 1 month, 90 per cent within 3 months and all
but the most exceptional cases should be completed within 12 months,
although it is unlikely that cases that require a criminal prosecution
or a complex police investigation can be completed in less than 3
months&#148;.</ul><a name="06102497000019"></a>That is
clear in setting actual timeframes within which allegations should be
investigated and decisions taken about whether charges are to be
brought. 



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1185"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1185</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06102497000009"></a>Secondly, we now have in place the new
network of allegations management advisers, who took up their posts in
April. They work with the local safeguarding children boards to ensure
that effective arrangements are in place for dealing with allegations
of abuse against people who work with children. Part of the work of
these new allegations management advisers will be to help organisations
avoid allegations arising in the first place, through safe recruitment
processes and advice on staff behaviour when working with children,
precisely of the kind described by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley.
They will also help local safeguarding children boards and other
organisations to develop and implement effective arrangements for
collecting data on allegations, including data on how quickly the
allegations are dealt with, so that we can monitor the effectiveness of
local arrangements in meeting the guidance timeframes I have just set
out. We have undertaken formally to review the impact of the guidance
next year with the involvement of all stakeholders and will reconsider
what further measures may be necessary in the light of that
review.</p><p><a name="06102497000010"></a>On the issue of a
statutory right to anonymity, we remain of the view that legislation on
this issue now would raise important principles about the freedom of
the press and the public interest and that the crucial issue is to deal
with cases quickly. We agree with the NSPCC that we should not do
anything that would discourage children reporting concerns, and we
believe that to introduce anonymity for teachers, but not for other
professionals who have contact with children, would create an
undesirable two-tier system.
</p><p><a name="06102497000011"></a>Although I cannot go the whole
way with the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, I thank her for raising
these issues again and giving us a chance to discuss them. I hope she
will accept that the measures I have set out will go some way to
dealing with the issue.</p><h5><a name="06102497000022"></a>9.30

response. I also thank noble Lords who have been kind enough to support
the amendment, particularly the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland of
Houndwood, and the noble Baroness, Lady Howe. I appreciate the comments
made by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, about her concerns regarding
this amendment.</p><p><a name="06102497000013"></a>I feel from the closing
sentences of the Minister&#146;s response that I am doing the right
thing about my concerns. There is concern about the freedom of the
press and the public interest, but one&#146;s career, family life,
home life and whole future can be utterly destroyed within weeks,
within days, of a false allegation, let alone three months. We must do
something. We are haemorrhaging teachers; they are leaving the
profession because of this situation. It has become almost cool for
kids to accuse teachers of something as a way of getting back at them.
I believe that we are on the right path in trying to introduce
statutory protection for teachers. I appreciate that it is important to
create a culture of protection in our schools, but we are already doing
that. We should remember the numbers: there were 2,016 cases between
1995 and 2002, and only4 per cent of them led to
conviction.</p>

appreciate that the Government have undertaken a number of measures and
that cases are being dealt with more expeditiously than in the past,
but that does not go far enough. Indeed, we understand that unions have
called for the protection to go further; they have asked that those
accused are named only when they are found guilty. There are difficult
questions in relation to what we mean by anonymity. Do we mean
anonymity with regard to colleagues, the teaching profession, within
the school or in the media? But the Minister answered that point when
he said that we have to respect, or, in his words, &#147;take account
of&#148; the freedom of the press and public interest.</p><p><a name="06102497000015"></a>These Benches are concerned to ensure the
safety of children and the ability discreetly to seek out witnesses who
could support or deny allegations. But when we are talking about the
freedom of the press and public interest, we should remember that the
lives of people who give of themselves when they join the teaching
profession can be destroyed with such ease. We need to go
further.</p><p><a name="06102497000016"></a>I shall not take this
amendment further tonight. I want to think about the concerns raised
about it, including the questions the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley,
raised about problems with academies and referral to the Secretary of
State. Perhaps it is right that we should rethink yet again the wording
of our amendment and consider whether the appeal should be to the
courts or to some other independent body. I find it very hard to hold
back on something that I think is crucial for such a brilliant
profession. However, all I shall say tonight is that I shall reserve my
option to return to this issue at Third Reading. I beg leave to

Sharp of Guildford:</b> My Lords, my name and that of
my noble friend Lady Walmsley are attached to this amendment. We
thoroughly endorse what the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, has said.
The Adult Learning Inspectorate is being absorbed within the new
Ofsted. The Minister and Her Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector have made
it clear to us that in forming the new Ofsted they would incorporate
the staff and the ethos of these different inspectorates. But the Adult
Learning Inspectorate has had a specific mission, which in many ways is
encapsulated in the words of this amendment. It would be advantageous
if the new Ofsted contained at least one person who had a very clear
remit to protect and preserve the ethos of adult learning. So we
thoroughly support the amendment.</p><p><a name="06102499000022"></a>Amendments Nos. 133 and
134 in this group are in my name and that of my noble friend Lady
Walmsley. The aim of these amendments is to give the chief inspector
the power, rather than a duty, to review and rate overall performance
of each local authority every year. We put forward a similar set of
amendments in Committee. There was remarkably little discussion
then&#151;that came later on amid a very large group of amendments.
The Minister&#146;s response effectively was just to say that the
Government thought that it was a good idea that Ofsted should have the
duty to produce an annual report, and that the combination of the
report and the rating given on overall performance was a way of
enhancing local
accountability.</p><p><a name="06102499000023"></a>We tabled the
amendments on behalf of the Local Government Association. The
association accepts that the process of inspection is valuable; it does
not argue against the process of inspection. It argues that, just as
with schools and colleges, the process should feed into a
self-evaluation in which self-assessment takes centre stage. That
self-assessment would be annual; it would draw on the
inspectors&#146; report but also consider other evidence and draw on
other sources of information. That is not to say that Ofsted should
never report on the local authority&#151;far from it. As with the
self-evaluation framework for schools, which is being introduced, an
Ofsted inspection would take place regularly&#151;every two or three
years. A key aspect of that inspection would be to examine how
realistic was the
self-assessment.</p><p><a name="06102499000024"></a>The key issue
is whether it is necessary that every year the chief inspector should
have the power and duty to review the local authority and assess its
performance. I ask the Minister whether, given the evolution towards
the self-evaluation model, it is really necessary to put the duty on
Ofsted to report every year on the local
authority.</p>

significant changes taking place, both Ofsted and HMCI remain alive to
their responsibilities. That is a given and, I think, is
shared.</p><p><a name="06102499000026"></a>I am not
convinced that legislation is the best way to ensure that or to
encourage it, for two reasons. First, to specify a post in the Bill
verges on being disproportionate. There are many other areas of work in
Ofsted where we do not specify appointments on which there should be
legislative instruction. People might well feel that creating such a
post through legislation might accord it disproportionate significance
within the new
organisation.</p><p><a name="06102499000027"></a>My
second point follows that one very closely. I am inclined to oppose
anything that diminishes the professional and operational independence
of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools. That principle was won and
has been defended vigorously. I suspect that creating a post such as
this through legislation would cause uncertainty in the ranks about
where responsibility lies, to whom responsibility should be given and
by whom. At the moment, there is a clear relationship: the Secretary of
State reports to Parliament and the Chief Inspector of Schools is
responsible through that route. Now, to my regret, as I have made plain
during earlier stages of the Bill, the chief inspector also has a
board, so there is already significant responsibility, and the need to
accentuate the responsibility for this area through a specific post is
a step too far. Hence, I am unable to support the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06102499000028"></a><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew172"></a><a name="06102499000187"></a>Lord
Adonis:</b> My Lords, following the noble Lord, Lord
Sutherland, enables me to pay tribute to the work of Ofsted during the
past 14 years. He was the distinguished first head of Ofsted and it has
done exemplary work in the school system and beyond during that period.
I know that it is late, but this is our only opportunity to discuss
inspection or report.</p><p><a name="06102499000029"></a>It may be
of interest to the House to learn that recent research conducted by
Ipsos MORI on behalf of Ofsted to obtain parents' views of inspections
in schools found that 92 per cent of parents said that they were in
favour of school inspections, against only 4 per cent who were not; 82
per cent of parents said that they believed that inspections had helped
their child&#146;s or children&#146;s schools to improve, with 90
per cent of that group considering the inspection or report to be
helpful.</p><p><a name="06102499000030"></a>It is very unusual in
the educational world to have such near-unanimity on any aspect of
policy. It is a tribute to the work of Ofsted during the past 14 years
that it has managed to achieve that status. I know that the reports by
Ofsted in general and Her Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector in
particular&#151;especially his annual reports, which have become a
sort of state-of-the-nation report on the quality of the school
system&#151;are immensely valued by parents and policy
makers.</p>



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1190"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1190</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h5><a name="06102499000180"></a>9.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06102499000031"></a>On Amendment No. 132, I
completely agree with the points made by the noble Lord, Lord
Sutherland. We believe that creating an adult learning inspector in the
Bill is unnecessary. As I made clear in Committee, there is no question
of any part of the adult skills remit being lost in the new framework.
We have put in place safeguards, such as a new board with statutory
duties to have regard to the views of users such as employers, who are
defined as one such user. I recognise that some groups, particularly
those that were not part of Ofsted as it was before the Bill, were
initially suspicious of the move to Ofsted. However, we believe that
these concerns have been diminished as the proposals have become better
developed.</p><p><a name="06102499000032"></a>The strategy board
overseeing the creation of the new Ofsted demonstrated the priority
that it gives to this area of Ofsted&#146;s functions. Its first
meeting with external stakeholders was with the CBI, the TUC and a
sector skills council, and I understand that this dialogue demonstrated
the benefits that could be brought by the cross-fertilisation of the
qualities of the two
inspectorates.</p><p><a name="06102499000033"></a>The amendment
would require a senior member of Ofsted&#146;s staff to have
responsibility for adult learning. It may reassure the noble Baroness
who moved the amendment and the noble Baroness who spoke to hers to
know that Christine Gilbert, the new HMCI, has indicated there will be
a director of skills in the new Ofsted, who will report directly to the
chief inspector at exactly the same level as the directors for
education and children&#146;s services, which are also
planned.</p><p><a name="06102499000034"></a>The noble Baroness,
Lady Buscombe, stated in
Committee:</p><ul><a name="06102499000104"></a>&#147;Surely the
existence of a head of inspection for schools but no position for adult
learning will create a division of attention in the inspectorate that
all but ignores adult learning&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>,
25/7/06; col. 1710.]</ul><a name="06102499000088"></a>I
should clarify that the Bill does not propose a head of inspection of
schools, so a director of adult learning to mirror this is, by
definition, unnecessary. Furthermore, defining in legislation separate
heads of inspection runs the risk of embedding in statute a federal
system in Ofsted that is contrary to the underlying principle of
integration and that would tie Ofsted&#146;s hands in the future. As
the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, said, it should be Her
Majesty&#146;s Chief Inspector who takes operational decisions on the
organisational structure, rather than it being dictated through
legislation.<p><a name="06102499000035"></a>The
amendment might also undo the core principle of Ofsted, which has been
a key part of its success over the years, that Her Majesty&#146;s
Chief Inspector is solely and personally responsible for inspection
judgments and does not have to arbitrate those judgments, either
through a board or through management dialogue in Ofsted. We would risk
damaging the credibility, simplicity and success of Ofsted if we were
to weaken the accountability system of the office of the chief
inspector.</p><p><a name="06102499000036"></a>On
Amendments Nos. 133 and 134, as I said in Committee, since 2005 Ofsted
and the Commission for Social Care Inspection have arrived at a local
authority&#146;s performance rating for its children&#146;s
services 



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1191"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column 1191</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>functions by discussing and agreeing one rating to cover both education
and children&#146;s social care. Clause 134 provides for a single
performance rating, to be awarded by the chief inspector following the
transfer of functions. The Government believe that tracking
year-on-year progress is a key element in driving up performance. This
is especially true when local authorities and their partners are
integrating services to deliver the <I>Every Child Matters</I> agenda.
In assessing the performance of local authorities, inspectors will
assess how they interact with their partners and will focus on how they
contribute to the well-being of children.</p><p><a name="06102499000037"></a>The noble Baroness,
Lady Sharp, talked about self-assessment on behalf of the Local
Government Association. I emphasise that self-assessment is at the
heart of the annual performance assessment. The local authority
produces its self-assessment, and Ofsted evaluates this against other
evidence. That process produces the performance rating, so we accept
the importance of self-assessment and do not believe that it is
diminished by these
arrangements.</p><p><a name="06102499000038"></a>Government
Amendments Nos. 134A to 134E, 145A and 145B are technical government
amendments. They are consequential on recent amendments to the Police
and Justice Bill, which were announced by the Government and approved
by the House last week. The amendments that I have tabled will ensure
that the reciprocal arrangements for co-operation between all
inspectorates apply between the new Ofsted and each of the criminal
justice
inspectorates.</p><p><a name="06102499000039"></a><b><a name="61024-0004.htm_spnew173"></a><a name="06102499000188"></a>Baroness
Buscombe:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for his
response and I join him in paying tribute to the work of Ofsted. I was
surprised that he sounded surprised that 92 per cent of parents are in
favour of school inspection. As a parent, I think that inspection is
crucial. I have never come across a parent who does not think that it
is important to have transparency and accountability. Ofsted has
performed a brilliant role in making parents feel comfortable and
assured that the school to which they send their child and in which
they put their faith for their most precious possessions is assessed.
There is a feeling of accountability, which was sorely lacking before,
and of confidence in the school
system.</p><p><a name="06102499000040"></a>I will not detain the
House at this late hour. Obviously we are disappointed in the

the things that he said. I should like to think about his response to
our amendment. I hear what he says about our looking for something that
perhaps is not mirrored in another way. For now, I feel that it is best

speak also to the other government amendments in this group. Amendment
No. 135 makes a technical correction to the drafting of subsection (4)
of the new Section 11A to the Education Act 2005 which is to be
inserted by virtue of Clause 155. By virtue of subsection (4),
regulations will enable the chief inspector to disapply a condition
specified in regulations which requires parents to have exhausted other
complaints mechanisms before their complaint may be investigated. It is
right that in normal circumstances, under this clause, parents should
seek to resolve their concerns locally before approaching Ofsted.
However, I am sure that the House will agree that it is important that
the chief inspector has the ability to act immediately on receipt of a
complaint where the matter raised justifies urgent
investigation&#151;for example, where the chief inspector has serious
concerns about pupil well-being.</p><p><a name="06102499000053"></a>Government Amendment No. 137 inserts new
Clauses 167A to167D into Part 10 of the Education Act 2002 to allow the
appropriate authority for independent schools to make a direction which
would prohibit or place restrictions on a person participating in the
management of independent schools on one or more prescribed grounds to
be set out in regulations. The new provisions also provide for a right
of appeal against such a direction. The current arrangements are
contained in Section 142 of the Education Act 2002, which will be
repealed once the vetting and barring scheme is introduced by the
Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill. A full consultation will be
undertaken before regulations are made. The consultation will propose
prescribing grounds, such as criminal convictions for fraud, theft or
money laundering and glorification of terrorism and membership of a
proscribed organisation.</p><p><a name="06102499000054"></a>In
addition, Amendment No. 138 deals with the removal of independent
schools from the register of such schools where unsuitable persons are
employed. Amendment No. 139 puts in place a power to make transitional
provisions to cover those persons currently subject to a Section 142
direction. Parents and the general public will expect the Secretary of
State to protect children in independent schools and the public by
continuing to have arrangements which prevent unsuitable people from
running independent schools. These amendments, together with existing
powers to prescribe the standards relevant to the suitability of
proprietors and staff in independent schools, seek to continue the
current arrangements for preventing people who are unsuitable from
taking part in the management of independent schools.</p><p><a name="06102499000055"></a>Government Amendment

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and
Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> My
honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State has made
the following Written Ministerial
Statement.</p><p><a name="06102470000011"></a>The department has
today published a strategy for the fire and rescue service working with
children and young
people.</p><p><a name="06102470000012"></a>Children
and young people are particularly vulnerable to death and injury by
fire, especially in deprived households. Fire-related crime, including
arson, hoax calls and attacks on fire fighters, and anti-social
behaviour are disproportionately committed by children and young
people, especially disadvantaged young people. Early and effective
intervention, diversion and education can reduce crime, improve life
chances, develop better citizens and safer communities and make the
difference between life and
death.</p><p><a name="06102470000013"></a>The UK
Fire and Rescue Service has a strong track record in this area. It has
particular strengths in supporting vulnerable and disadvantaged young
people and reducing risks to them and to their communities. But in the
context set by the Government's commitment to better services for
children and young people, the service has many challenges to meet in
common with many organisations that work with young
people.</p><p><a name="06102470000014"></a>At the
centre of the children and young people's strategy is a new approach.
This involves a new commitment to involving children and young people,
joint development and delivery with partners, comprehensive evaluation
and review of impact, and high quality professional development for
those involved in working with young people. We believe that this is
the path to provision for children and young people which is focused on
effective risk reduction, targeted at the disadvantaged, tailored to
individual needs, and is a mainstream activity for the service. Copies
of the strategy are available in the
Libraries.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="61024-wms0001.htmstate_1"></a><a name="06102470000003"></a>Nuclear

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and

honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry
(Alistair Darling) has made the following Written Ministerial
Statement.</p><p><a name="06102470000016"></a>I
would like to make a Statement regarding a joint proposal from BNFL and
the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority about the process for
implementing the sale of BNFL&#146;s subsidiary, British Nuclear
Group. I would also like to make a Statement on the establishment of a
National Nuclear Laboratory to safeguard key nuclear research and
development skills and capability. The Government's objectives for
nuclear clean up are: keeping a clear focus on safety; ensuring the
taxpayer gets best value for expenditure on clean up; and ensuring 



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS104"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column WS104</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that, within that framework, we do what is best for British Nuclear
Group as a business, especially its employees and also its wider
stakeholders, including the local
communities.</p><p><a name="06102470000017"></a>These
objectives were essential elements of the Energy Act 2004, which
established the NDA to take on decommissioning and cleaning up the
public civil nuclear legacy on a UK-wide basis while bringing renewed
drive and focus to this work through competition. The clear policy
intention behindthe Act was that while the sites themselves
would remain in public ownership through the NDA, they would be
operated, in time, by a range of different
contractors.</p><p><a name="06102470000018"></a>Since April 2005,
the NDA has owned the sites and facilities previously owned by BNFL
(the Magnox stations, Sellafield, THORP/SMP and Springfields). BNG was
created as a subsidiary of BNFL at the same time and was awarded
short-term contracts to manage and operate those facilities on behalf
of the NDA. All these sites were to be opened up to competition
progressively in line with the NDA's obligations under the Energy
Act.</p><p><a name="06102470000019"></a>BNG
consists of four key business areas: the management of the Sellafield
contract; the management of the Magnox sites; Project Services&#151;a
specialist contractor at Sellafield and Magnox sites that is looking to
expand non-NDA work; and a 33 per cent stake in AWE, which manages the
Aldermaston weapons complex on behalf of the Ministry of Defence. Its
assets are these contracts. The sites and facilities are owned by the
NDA and will continue to
be.</p><p><a name="06102470000020"></a>When announcing the sale to
the House on 30 March, the then Secretary of State, my right
honourable friend the Member for Hull West and Hessle, Alan Johnson,
said he envisaged a sale of British Nuclear Group as a single entity by
Autumn 2007 to coincide with the NDA awarding a new five-year contract
for cleaning up the Sellafield site. Following that announcement, BNFL
and the NDA have proceeded along this route with the emphasis on
potential Sellafield performance given the size and urgency of the
clean-up task at that
site.</p><p><a name="06102470000021"></a>However, as they have got
into the detail it has become increasingly clear that this approach was
not the best way of meeting the different needs of BNG's other
businesses or staff. The board of BNFL became concerned that the
organisation best suited to succeed at Sellafield may be less suited to
helping Magnox succeed in the subsequent competitions at its sites or
to developing Project Services as a key contractor in the evolving
market here and overseas. These businesses may be better served by a
range of operators with different skill sets rather than a single
overall one.</p><p><a name="06102470000022"></a>The BNFL
board&#146;s concerns were reinforced by evidence in the market that
instead of single buyers for BNG, consortia were being formed for the
bid, suggesting that a future split of BNG was likely, with a risk that
the non-Sellafield pieces might be sold on at a premium, to the loss of
the taxpayer. In addition, the requirements and duration of the formal
procurement process for the Sellafield contract were 



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS105"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column WS105</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>felt to have the potential to damage the prospects for Project Services,
which might have been restricted from pursuing new business
opportunities during a prolonged sale
process.</p><p><a name="06102470000023"></a>The BNFL and NDA boards
have therefore concluded that it would be appropriate to modify their
approach in response to this new information. Their joint
recommendation is that BNG should continue to operate the Sellafield
contract until the NDA can put in place a new contractor following a
full competition (potentially the middle of 2008) and that BNFL should
conduct individual sales of its other businesses on an early time scale
to complete during
2007.</p><p><a name="06102470000024"></a>I have
given these points very careful consideration. I have also considered
all the representations made to me. I have concluded that there are
real benefits to Project Services and the Magnox business in separating
them from the process of choosing the right contractor for Sellafield.
I also believe that the best way of securing the right contractor for
Sellafield is to proceed with a separate competition, with the full
focus on what is best at that site. That process will be run by the
NDA, and the criteria it is setting will include first-rate health,
safety, security and environmental performance and effectiveness as a
contractor, as well as demonstrable engagement with stakeholders,
including trade unions, and understanding the socio-economic issues of
the area.</p><p><a name="06102470000025"></a>On
this basis and in the knowledge that the regulators agree with the
change subject to strengthening of the site licensee company
arrangements and capabilities, which I shall be insisting upon, I am
satisfied that the Government should support the new approach proposed
by BNFL and the NDA.</p><p><a name="06102470000026"></a>Earlier in
the summer, I announced that we would be carrying out some detailed
work to establish how best to safeguard the UK&#146;s key nuclear
research and development skills and capabilities to ensure that our
future requirements are met. These capabilities reside principally
within Nexia Solutions, a subsidiary of BNFL, and key facilities in the
British Technology Centre in Sellafield, west Cumbria. I also said that
while the UK nuclear research and development market is developing it
might be necessary to preserve and develop these skills potentially as
part of a National Nuclear
Laboratory.</p><p><a name="06102470000027"></a>In
the light of these discussions, I am pleased to say that we expect that
a National Nuclear Laboratory will be set up as soon as practicable.
Subject to agreeing appropriate contractual terms, the laboratory will
be based around the British Technology Centre in Sellafield, west
Cumbria, and Nexia Solutions and managed by a contractor
operator.</p><p><a name="06102470000028"></a>As the NNL, it will
play a key role in supporting the UK's strategic research and
development requirements, and operate world-class facilities. As the
market for the provision for research and development skills develops,
the NNL will ensure that key skills are safeguarded and
enhanced.</p>

Performance Assessments
2005-06</h3><p><a name="06102470000029"></a><b><a name="61024-wms0001.htm_spnew186"></a><a name="06102470000120"></a>The
Minister of State, Home Office (Baroness Scotland of
Asthal):</b> My honourable friend the Minister of
State (Tony McNulty) has made the following Written Ministerial
Statement.</p><p><a name="06102470000030"></a>Today I have
published <I>Police Performance Assessments 2005/06</I>, covering the
43 individual police forces in England and Wales. This publication has
been brought together by the Home Office&#146;s Police and Crime
Standards Directorate (PCSD) and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of
Constabulary (HMIC) and this is the second year that such assessments
have been published. Copies will be placed in the Library. The
publication of these assessments represents an important part of the
Government's reform programme for public services. We want to see
policing that is visible, accessible and
responsive.</p><p><a name="06102470000031"></a>Together with the
countrywide programme to introduce neighbourhood policing and achieve
consistently high quality of service standards, the assessments are
intended to provide the public with a clear view on how well policing
is being delivered in their area. In addition to these assessments,
police authorities are now obliged to provide even more local views to
every household in their communities on the police priorities for their
area and to explain who is responsible and accountable for their
delivery, as well as reporting on how effectively these policing
priorities have been
discharged.</p><p><a name="06102470000032"></a>As in last year's
report, tables have been used to provide an understandable summary of
performance for each of the 43 police forces across seven key
performance areas. Forces are assigned the clear judgments
&#147;excellent&#148;, &#147;good&#148;, &#147;fair&#148;
and &#147;poor&#148; and are also compared against previous
performance to determine whether they are &#147;improved&#148;,
&#147;stable&#148; or &#147;deteriorated&#148;. The publication
is complemented by comprehensive information, including data and
technical definitions, available via the Home Office
website.</p><p><a name="06102470000033"></a>The
continued application of this framework sets a benchmark for future
policing performance and ensures that local police forces can be held
to account for the delivery of key services to local communities. It
provides a mechanism for improving performance and for increasing
responsiveness to the public. It has also allowed forces, with the
support of their police authorities, to identify strengths and
weaknesses across their responsibilities, thereby reducing the need for
external inspections, reviews or other
interventions.</p><p><a name="06102470000034"></a>Going
forward&#151;and as noted in the Home Office reform action
plan&#151;the assessments will be developed further in 2007-08 into a
simplified performance framework covering crime, drugs and policing.
This will streamline the mechanisms in place to monitor police
performance and should reduce the inspection burden on police and their
partners.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="61024-wms0001.htmstate_3"></a><a name="06102470000005"></a>Questions

<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS107"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column WS107</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06102470000036"></a>The honourable Member
for St Ives asked about the level of UK public investment for Angola. I
regret that my reply on 13 September 2006 (<I>Official Report</I>,
House of Commons, col. 2357W) contained two incorrect figures. The
first related to DfID&#146;s contribution to a UNICEF &#163;18
million southern Africa programme from which Angola benefits. I stated
that DfID contributes &#163;3.5 million to this programme. In fact,
DfID is contributing the full &#163;18 million, of which Angola will
receive approximately &#163;3 million. A pursuant response was issued
on 14 September (<I>Official Report</I>, House of Commons, col. 2546W)
correcting this.</p><p><a name="06102470000037"></a>The second
error related to DfID&#146;s contribution to the World Bank's
demobilisation and reintegration programme in Angola. I stated that
DfID is contributing $25 million over five years to this programme. In
fact, DfID is contributing this amount to the entirety of the World
Bank&#146;s multi-country demobilisation and reintegration programme,
which comprises support to seven countries including Angola. The World
Bank's demobilisation and reintegration programme in Angola is budgeted
at $84.2 million, of which $48.4 million is being funded through the
multi-donor trust fund, to which DfID contributes $25 million over five
years (with an imputed share to Angola of $2.4
million).</p><p><a name="06102470000038"></a>These errors were due
to a lack of readily available data on the extent to which individual
countries benefit from regional programmes. I regret that this
occurred. DfID actively pursued correction to these figures as soon as
the errors were discovered, and will closely monitor future funding
flows to Angola from regional
programmes.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="61024-wms0001.htmstate_4"></a><a name="06102470000006"></a>Railways:

Davies of Oldham:</b> My honourable
friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Tom
Harris) has made the following Ministerial
Statement.</p><p><a name="06102470000040"></a>I am today laying
before Parliament new guidance on the arrangements for making,
assessing and determining applications to close rail services, stations
and infrastructure, as provided for in Section 43(1) of the Railways
Act 2005. I will shortly be making orders to bring the guidance, and
the related provisions of the 2005 Act, into effect in England,
Scotland, and Wales from 1 December. Draft guidance on these
arrangements was issued for consultation on 26 January, and the final
version published today reflects the comments received during the
consultation.</p><p><a name="06102470000041"></a>This guidance will
ensure that safeguards and standard practices are applied to any
proposals for changes on the rail network. For the first time,
statutory guidance will be put in place on rail closures, making
procedures clearer and more transparent. It will also ensure certain
procedures are taken into account before any rail closure can be
considered. The guidance requires that:</p>all
alternatives are considered;a full
consultation, takes place and that this includes passenger
groups;

passengers are considered as well as the safety, economic and
environmental costs or benefits; andin
contrast with current procedures, where the Secretary of State
determines closure proposals, the independent Office of Rail Regulation
must be satisfied that a robust economic analysis has been
performed.<p><a name="06102470000042"></a>The guidance
covers separate processes in England and Wales, and Scotland but to
ensure consistency across the railway the two processes have been
aligned and brought together in one guidance document. I have also
placed in the Libraries copies of the Government&#146;s response to
the consultation on the draft
guidance.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="61024-wms0001.htmstate_5"></a><a name="06102470000007"></a>Romania
and
Bulgaria</h3><p><a name="06102470000043"></a><b><a name="61024-wms0001.htm_spnew189"></a><a name="06102470000123"></a>The
Minister of State, Home Office (Baroness Scotland of
Asthal):</b> My right honourable
friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department (John Reid) has
made the following Written Ministerial
Statement.</p><p><a name="06102470000044"></a>The House will wish
to know what arrangements will be in place here in the UK to support
the accession of Romania and Bulgaria on 1
January.</p><p><a name="06102470000045"></a>Global movement is a
fact of life. In the UK we have more than 90 million visitors a year.
This openness ensures that we have a vibrant society and a strong
economy. Over the years, Europe has prospered by letting people move
and trade freely, but as the EU expands this poses new challenges which
have to be managed properly. Here, as elsewhere, managed migration is
the right approach.</p><p><a name="06102470000046"></a>In 2004,
when 10 new countries joined the EU, we gave their people access to our
labour market&#151;but the workers registration scheme ensured that
people came to work and did not claim benefits. This has been a
success. Workers from the new member states have filled skills gaps,
including in key public services such as the NHS and social care, and
have contributed to UK growth and prosperity. Studies have found no
evidence that they have taken jobs away from British workers or
undercut wages. Employers and customers alike have welcomed their
skills. Very few have brought dependants and the proportion attempting
to claim out-of-work benefits has been less than 1 per
cent.</p><p><a name="06102470000047"></a>In 2004 only Ireland and
Sweden took the same position. Since then, Italy, Spain, Finland,
Portugal and others have followed our lead and lifted restrictions.
Germany has admitted 500,000 eastern European
workers.</p><p><a name="06102470000048"></a>Over
the past few months, I have set out ambitious plans to ensure that our
immigration system is effective and fair, including plans to: ensure
that Immigration Rules are advised by an independent Migration Advisory
Committee, double spending on enforcement, and introduce ID cards for
foreign nationals. There have also been some transitional impacts from
the last round of accession. A small number of schools have 



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS109"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column WS109</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>seen a significant increase in admissions. Some local authorities have
reported problems of overcrowding in private housing. There have been
cost pressures on English language
training.</p><p><a name="06102470000049"></a>Because
we believe in the principle of managed migration before we take further
steps, our plans for immigration reform should be further advanced so
that we understand any pressures in detail, and we should ensure that
appropriate measures are in place to ameliorate them. Our plans to
manage accession have been developed on this basis, and today I can set
out for the House three key
steps.</p><p><a name="06102470000050"></a>First, the Department for
Communities and Local Government (DCLG) will work in partnership with
local areas to spread best practice in meeting isolated and specific
pressures that have arisen as a result of recent
migration.</p><p><a name="06102470000051"></a>Secondly, the
Department for Education and Skills (DfES) will provide &#163;400,000
to fund a new excellence programme, which will support schools that
have limited experience of teaching new migrant pupils with English as
an additional language.</p><p><a name="06102470000052"></a>Thirdly,
the UK will maintain controls on Romania and Bulgaria's access to jobs
for a transitional period. The opening of our labour market will take
account of the needs of our labour market, the impact of the A10
expansion and the positions adopted by other member
states.</p><p><a name="06102470000053"></a>Furthermore, we will
expect employers to look exclusively to workers from EU nations to meet
any low-skilled labour shortages within the UK. We can therefore
announce today that from 1 January 2007 we will be phasing out all
low-skilled migration schemes for workers from outside the
EU.</p><p><a name="06102470000054"></a>Places on the two
low-skilled migration schemes for non-EU workers (the seasonal
agricultural workers scheme and the sectors-based scheme, which between
them currently have 19,750 places) will now be restricted to nationals
from Romania and Bulgaria, with this cap maintained at its present
level.</p><p><a name="06102470000055"></a>In the first instance,
food processing and agriculture will be the only sectors open to
less-skilled A2 nationals. But we will listen to industry
representatives where it is felt that similar schemes are needed in
other sectors. Employers will need to convince the Government that
there is a genuine labour shortage and such schemes would be limited by
quota.</p><p><a name="06102470000056"></a>Once we have brought
forward proposals for a Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) we will
suggest that in due course the MAC will advise on how the quotas on
low-skilled migration are
managed.</p><p><a name="06102470000057"></a>Highly skilled A2
workers that qualify for the highly skilled migrant programme
(currently just under 100 a year) will also be admitted, as they are
now, along with any
dependants.</p><p><a name="06102470000058"></a>Romanian and
Bulgarian students studying in the UK will also continue to be able to
work part-time, providing they are enrolled at an approved college on
the DfES register of education providers.</p>



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS110"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column WS110</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06102470000059"></a>In addition, Romanian and Bulgarian
workers with specialist skills that are needed in the UK will be able
to come here to do jobs that cannot be filled by resident labour,
provided they meet our tests on qualifications and earnings. This is
already the case. A total of 1,740 Romanians and Bulgarians entered the
UK last year on this basis. Again, work permit holders will be able to
bring dependants as they can today. These arrangements will be reviewed
annually.</p><p><a name="06102470000060"></a>The terms of the
accession treaty do not allow us to place restrictions on EU
nationals&#146; rights to come here to set up a business, so the
self-employed will continue to be able to work here (and in all other
EU countries) if they can prove when challenged that they are genuine
and not employees posing as
contractors.</p><p><a name="06102470000061"></a>We look forward to
welcoming Romanian and Bulgarian workers here, provided that they
comply with our rules and obey the
law.</p><p><a name="06102470000062"></a>Visa regimes for the new
accession countries will be maintained up until accession. Bulgarians
and Romanians will therefore continue to need to have visas for entry
to the UK up until midnight on 31 December 2006; after that,
people from Romania and Bulgaria will be able to travel about the EU
freely.</p><p><a name="06102470000063"></a>However, if they want to
take employed work, they will need a work authorisation document. As
set out above, to get such a document they will need to have passed the
tests to get on to the highly skilled migrant programme, to have
secured a work permit for a skilled job, proved they are a student at a
reputable college, or to have got a place in the quota for agriculture
or food processing.</p><p><a name="06102470000064"></a>The House
will expect to know how this system will be policed. I must be clear to
the House that policing the system against a background of free
movement to the UK will present some challenges, but workers or
employers who are tempted by this into breaking the rules should be
aware that they will be robustly enforced. Subject to debate in this
House, we will take powers to make it an offence for an A2 national to
work without such a document. We plan to make this punishable by an
on-the-spot fixed penalty. It will also be an offence for an employer
to take on undocumented A2 nationals. This will be punishable by a
heavy fine. Employing illegal workers undercuts legitimate business and
leads to exploitation. It will not be
tolerated.</p><p><a name="06102470000065"></a>Employers will
rightly ask for assistance in fulfilling their responsibilities. There
will be, therefore, an information campaign for employers, backed up by
a toolkit and helpline, to ensure that firms are aware of the rules and
their responsibilities. Employers and employees must be clear that they
have a duty to play by these rules or suffer the
consequences.</p><p><a name="06102470000066"></a>Through this
measured response to accession, we will ensure that migration is and
continues to be managed in the best interests of the country as a
whole.</p>

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and
Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> My right
honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning has made the
following Written Ministerial
Statement.</p><p><a name="06102470000068"></a>The Government are
today announcing support for 29 areas across the country which have bid
to become new growth points, combining increased housing with new jobs,
town centre regeneration and higher design and environmental
standards.</p><p><a name="06102470000069"></a>Last
year the Government announced plans to increase housing supply as part
of the response to Kate Barker's review. More houses are needed to help
first-time buyers, to address overcrowding and keep up with rising
demand. We are living longer and more people are living alone. If we
continue to build at currently planned levels, the proportion of 30
year-old couples able to afford their own home will fall from over 50
per cent today to nearer 30 per cent in 20 years&#146; time. But it
is vital that new homes are built alongside jobs growth and
infrastructure investment in order to deliver sustainable communities
for the future. That is why, alongside other measures on planning,
affordable housing and infrastructure funding, we invited local
authorities and partners to put forward proposals for new homes as part
of sustainable growth.</p><p><a name="06102470000070"></a>Following
a review of these new growth point proposals across Government, and in
particular in consultation with Defra and DfT and their agencies, we
are announcing a total of 29 areas, put forward by more than 70 local
authorities, which we are supporting. We are also publishing
<I>Partnership for Growth</I>, a summary of these proposals, copies of
which will be placed in the Libraries. Subject to consultation, testing
and examination through the regional and local plan-making processes,
these proposals have the potential to add up to 100,000 homes by 2016,
an increase of around 30 per cent on previous plans for housing supply
in these areas.</p><p><a name="06102470000071"></a>These proposals
involve substantial jobs growth, town centre regeneration and measures
to improve the quality of life and environment. Most of the bids
include major employment proposals&#151;more than 130,000 jobs in the
south-west and east of England regions alone. They include measures to
improve skills, promote business start-up, create new employment sites
and widen the local economic base. They also include proposals to
invest in green spaces and the local environment as well as town centre
regeneration.</p><p><a name="06102470000072"></a>Achieving this
potential for sustainable, realistic and affordable growth will require
a strong long-term commitment between Government, their agencies and
local partners. The partnership that we are announcing today is based
on four principles:</p><p><a name="06102470000073"></a>First, we
want to work with local authorities to support the early delivery of
more housing and ensure that the type of housing provided responds to
local and market conditions and affordability
pressures.</p>



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS112"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column WS112</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06102470000074"></a>Secondly, we want to
achieve sustainable growth, supporting schemes which set the highest
standards of design and are exemplars of sustainable development,
supporting the local environment and promoting ways to cut carbon
emissions. These new developments will also be underpinned by the
forthcoming planning policy statement on climate change and the Code
for Sustainable Homes to help reduce the carbon footprint of new
housing and lead the way towards our longer-term aim of zero carbon
development.</p><p><a name="06102470000075"></a>Thirdly, we will
work with local partners to ensure that infrastructure and services
keep pace with people and homes. We have begun a cross-Government
process to support the new growth points involving all the major
transport and environment agencies, as well as other regional and local
partners. There is potential to make better health and education an
integral feature of new
design.</p><p><a name="06102470000076"></a>On environmental
infrastructure, the programme should enable partners to identify and
plan for the additional water supply, sewerage, waste and other
environmental infrastructure that their proposals require. They will
then be able to show how these needs will be addressed when their
specific detailed proposals come
forward.</p><p><a name="06102470000077"></a>On transport, we need
to achieve more sustainable travel outcomes, for example through the
design and location of new development encouraging more use of buses,
cycling and walking and minimising any increase in long-distance
commuting. We will continue to encourage partners to exploit existing
public transport networks in determining the most sustainable locations
for growth but we recognise that additional infrastructure will be
needed.</p><p><a name="06102470000078"></a>The
Government have established the Treasury CSRO7 Review to ensure that
departmental resources across Government are targeted appropriately for
providing the national, regional and local infrastructure necessary to
support future housing and population
growth.</p><p><a name="06102470000079"></a>Fourthly, we recognise
that to deliver growth successfully requires dedicated resources,
specialist expertise and the ability to work closely with the private
sector to optimise the potential for their investment. The funding we
are announcing today will help local partners carry out critical
studies on environmental and transport issues. In addition, we will be
asking English Partnerships to work closely with the individual growth
points to discuss what type of delivery support will be needed, how
best that can be provided and to advise on the detailed programmes of
development.</p><p><a name="06102470000080"></a>New growth point
status means that Government and local partners agree the potential for
growth and are committed to working together to ensure that growth will
be sustainable, realistic and affordable. This shared assessment can
inform the RSS process. It is up to the regional spatial strategies
(RSS) to determine, among other things, the scale and distribution of
provision for new housing. Specific site allocations must be decided
through the local development framework (LDF)
process.</p><p><a name="06102470000081"></a>We are also pleased to
announce initial funding allocations to each of the new growth points
to support the work. These initial allocations, totalling 



<notus-date day="24" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS113"></a><b>24 Oct 2006 : Column WS113</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>&#163;40 million, are for both capital projects and revenue support
for studies and capacity building. Allocations are subject to detailed
negotiation and appraisal of projects to ensure maximum benefit can be
achieved from spending in 2007-08. Allocations for future years will be
subject to the outcome of the CSR, and we intend that from 2008-09
funding will be linked to local area agreements to give local partners
greater flexibility on delivery. Consultation is still under way about
the arrangements for LAAs, and a Statement will be made about this
shortly.</p><p><a name="06102470000082"></a><I>New Growth
