<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they will require strategic health authorities to monitor and keep the Government informed about the progress being made regarding the formation of consortia to purchase specialised services; and whether they will give strategic health authorities the power to require primary care trusts to form consortia for the purchase of such services.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Warner): </B>  My Lords, primary care trusts decide whether they wish to form purchasing consortia for specific specialised services. Overall arrangements for commissioning specialised services are performance managed by strategic health authorities. In turn, strategic health authorities are subject to a national process of assessment which will include their processes for strategically reviewing the commissioning of specialised services. There are no plans to change those arrangements.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that this Question is about people with rare but serious conditions that are very expensive to treat? The Government seem to be failing some of them. Currently, only the combination of primary care trusts and consortia can handle these cases and cope with the expense. In my view, and according to that Answer, all the Government seem to be doing is making recommendations or guiding and advising. What they should be doing is demanding that primary care trusts establish consortia and requiring them to carry out that work. Without such a combination, these people will remain neglected, and that would be inexcusable. It is the Government's job to see that primary care trusts are not left to their own devices. They are reluctant to combine, but unless they do they cannot treat this small but vital number of very important cases, some of them people with life-threatening conditions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, I am aware of my noble friend's concerns. However, it is also true that the Government have tried to shift the balance of power&#151;the title of the document published in 2002&#151;to devolve more responsibility to a lower level. We have also issued guidance on the commissioning arrangements for specialised services to try to address some of the concerns expressed by my noble friend. However, we have not just issued guidance. A Department of Health survey showed that, in the first three years of their existence, regional <P>


<a name="column_126"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 126</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>specialised commissioning groups had made significant advances in establishing commissioning arrangements for those specialised services. Those included in particular the eight national priority services, which I will not go into but which I am sure are well known to many noble Lords. The survey also looked at the commissioning arrangements for other specialised services and found very reassuring evidence that things were going in an extremely satisfactory manner.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, this House last debated specialised services in April 2003. During that debate, the answers given were widely at variance with answers which have subsequently become available from John Hutton, the health Minister, and indeed from Ministers in this House. The guidance given in April clearly lacks the clarity needed by those who are now responsible for commissioning. Will the Minister undertake to reissue that guidance in a much clearer form?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   No, my Lords.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, has any consortia of this kind for buying these services yet been formed? If so, how many?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, I am not sure that I understand the drift of the noble Lord's question. We do not collect a lot of information of this kind centrally, as I thought I had made clear. However, if he would like to write to me about particular concerns I shall be happy to make inquiries.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Walton of Detchant: </B>   My Lords, if one accepts, as one must, that clinical research is a vital function of the National Health Service, can the Minister assure us that that will be preserved and enhanced in the arrangements that he has been talking about? There is no doubt at all that the results of research not only nourish but produce major developments in clinical care. Will he also take account of the parlous state of clinical academic medicine at the present time, which is very serious when one talks about the future of clinical research in the United Kingdom?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, on the latter part of the noble Lord's question, I am aware of the concerns about academic medicine. Work is under way, particularly in relation to a number of inquiries&#151;but that is rather wide of the Question. On the particular issues of research in relation to commissioning, nothing in these new arrangements for commissioning should damage the research interests.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-01_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister explain what specific plans are in place to monitor the commissioning of cancer services given the need for the exceptional tracking exercise recently?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, the arrangements for monitoring specialised cancer services are the same as for other specialised services; they are as indicated in my <P>


<a name="column_127"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 127</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>earlier Answer to my noble friend Lord Ashley. It will be for the department to assess with strategic health authorities, when they assess their accountability, the performance in this area.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-01_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Lockwood: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend the Minister agree that primary care trusts also have strategic responsibilities not only in connection with specialist commissioning but in a wider area? Does he agree with me that, particularly in metropolitan areas, primary care trusts tend to think of their own corner and not of the strategic role they clearly have?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, I understand my noble friend's concerns. Primary care trusts have a responsibility in relation to their particular areas and in relation to specialised services, which go much wider. As I said, we have carried out a survey which, without being complacent, is rather reassuring about the way in which primary care trusts are tackling specialised services.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord McColl of Dulwich: </B>   My Lords, I wonder if the Minister could help us in this rather confused area. Who is responsible for, say, providing the services for children who need kidney transplants, and to whom are they accountable?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, about 36 specialised service areas are defined. I am trying to skim down the list to see whether the services the noble Lord mentioned are included. My eyes do not immediately alight upon them so I do not think they are included. However, I shall write to the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-01_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   My Lords, what will the treatments be called? They used to be called supra-regional specialties and then out-of-area treatments. Will the money follow the patient?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, as I tried to say earlier, they are called specialised services. A set of national definitions identifies those services&#151;36 in all. They are covered by PCT consortia for commissioning where populations of 1 million or more are covered by those services. That is about as far as I can go.

<A NAME="30708-01_spopq1"></A><B> Lord Berkeley </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What evidence Postcomm will require from Royal Mail in order to determine whether it will be able to meet its performance after withdrawal of its rail freight services.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry   (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </B>  My Lords, Postcomm is in the process of <P>


<a name="column_128"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 128</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>considering the action plans Royal Mail has presented to it to underpin this year's service quality targets. I have no doubt that one of the issues it will be looking at will be the potential impact of implementing Royal Mail's multi-modal transport review.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for that Answer. I declare an interest as chairman of the Rail Freight Group. Does he not agree that as Royal Mail is a government-owned company it should comply with government policy to use as much rail freight as possible rather than road? Should it not also in its appraisal use the Government's appraisal and methodology in comparing the benefits and the costs of road, rail and air for value for money, environmental benefit and performance? Will he ensure therefore that Postcomm requires the Royal Mail to do that as part of the review?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-01_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, it is for Postcomm to ask those questions. On the figures that I have the air and road only network results in fewer carbon emissions than the air, road, rail proposal. It also involves fewer lorry movements although more miles per annum. It is arguably a better environmental scenario.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030708/text/30708-02.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </B>   My Lords, is it not the case that Royal Mail anticipates that it will reduce its losses by some £90 million a year by switching from rail to road? Would it not be wrong to interfere with such a wise commercial judgment?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, the figure of £90 million is the total savings from the total transport review. Transferring rail services to road will save about £25 million which is a substantial amount of money. It is a commercial decision for Royal Mail to take rather than the Government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   My Lords, is the situation not complicated by the incidence of VAT which is payable on rail freight but not on road movements by Royal Mail? Of the saving of £25 million, how much is accounted for by VAT?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Lord asked that question on a previous occasion, this time I can give him the answer. The £25 million saving would come down to £19.5 million. It would nevertheless still be a very substantial saving. It arises because VAT is not paid on stamps. Therefore, VAT cannot be recovered from the railways. I hope the noble Lord is not suggesting that we should charge VAT on stamps as a way of solving the problem.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Greengross: </B>   My Lords, what has to happen before the Government acknowledge that such a decision is of major public interest and is much broader than purely a commercial cost matter?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, in the past 25 years during which I have had any connection with <P>


<a name="column_129"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 129</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the postal service, I believe that Royal Mail has suffered enormously under all governments through Ministers and civil servants interfering in commercial decisions. It is not the intention of the DTI to continue with that tradition.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Campbell-Savours: </B>   My Lords&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, will it be borne in mind&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord President of the Council  (Lord Williams of Mostyn): </B>  My Lords, it is the turn of this side.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Campbell-Savours: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend will be aware that a number of my noble friends are perplexed by the answers that he is giving on this particular matter. What is the point of Labour Members of Parliament and Labour activists knocking on doors up and down the land and assuring people that we intend to move freight from road to rail when we are totally incapable of intervening on this occasion when the public utility is owned by the taxpayer? It is owned by us. We are the shareholders.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, the amount of mail as a total percentage of freight is very small; it is about half of 1 per cent. The Secretary of State sets social and environmental targets against which Postcomm measures performance. However, as I suggested, in this particular case it is not at all clear that continuing with the rail freight operation is environmentally the best solution.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Howell of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, the Minister said that it was correct not to intervene in a commercial decision, but has he seen discussion in the newspapers of proposals for a heavy congestion charge on the motorways? Up to 50p per mile is mentioned. As we are moving into an age of charges for transport on roads, what will happen then? Will the Post Office do its sums again and decide that it ought to go back to rail?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, as I am sure the noble Lord knows, the situation is that about 70 per cent of the future network connections&#151;that is, the journeys that take place&#151;will take place between 6.30 in the evening and 3 o'clock in the morning, when congestion is not a major issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Brookman: </B>   My Lords, I assume that the Minister will be aware that, on these Benches at least, there is great concern about these proposals. For example, how on earth will the situation be dealt with at Christmas time, when some 150 extra trains are brought into play to deal with the Christmas surge? Does he think that that can be handled by road, or maybe by air as well? It seems absurd.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, it is very difficult&#151;which is why it has been such a disaster in the past&#151;for Ministers and civil servants to try to control the operational arrangements of an industry of <P>


<a name="column_130"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 130</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>this scale and complexity. It is simply not possible, nor do I think it desirable, for us to start imposing our judgment on how those operational services are run, at Christmas or at any other time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, will it be borne in mind that Royal Mail has always, so far, delivered first-class mail promptly? Will the Minister ensure that that continues?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, clear service targets are laid down by Postcomm, and it is the job of Postcomm to measure the performance of Royal Mail against those. In looking at the action plans of Royal Mail, it will take into account whether, in its judgment, they will lead to the service standards that it has laid down.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   My Lords, is the Post Office meeting its performance targets at present? Two cheques have gone missing from my mail in the past three weeks?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I am very sorry that the noble Lord has had that particular problem, but I do not think it is relevant to the Question that we are considering.

<P>
<A NAME="30708-02_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>To what extent the Joint Intelligence Committee was consulted on the contents of the dossier on weapons of mass destruction.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, the chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee was responsible for the production of the September dossier. There was no attempt to override the judgment of the chairman at any point in the process. Intelligence was not inserted; neither was it exaggerated at the instruction of Ministers or special advisers. The Government welcome the Foreign Affairs Committee's conclusion on this point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-02_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </B>   My Lords, the noble and learned Lord is not quite answering the Question. Did the Joint Intelligence Committee have sight of either version of the dossier? When the noble and learned Lord has answered that, perhaps he will go on to a further underlying question; namely, whether anything has been done to reassure the troops in Iraq, who must be rather upset by the squabble that is going on, which no one is going to win and in which everyone may come off a loser. Not only that, but will he, first, congratulate them on the achievement of getting rid of <P>


<a name="column_131"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 131</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Saddam and, secondly, will he make sure that they are given some clue as to what they are going to do next and how long they will be in Iraq?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-02_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, on the latter point, I could not agree more with the noble Lord. Our troops in Iraq are carrying out their professional duties with their usual skill and calm attachment to duty. Going back to the Question, the chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee was responsible for the production of the dossier. I have authority to tell your Lordships that I believe the dossier was published on 24th September. On 23rd September&#151;if we want to go to responsibility for the contents&#151;the chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee was actually at the printers checking the proofs.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-02_spnew21"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </B>   My Lords, does the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House recall that some of us questioned whether or not the evidence presented in those dossiers at the time justified the conclusions that were reached? Does he also recall that, after the Falklands War&#151;where there was much less questioning of the intelligence provided to the government beforehand&#151;the government accepted that a judicial inquiry would clear the air? Do we not now need something that will very much clear the air?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-02_spnew22"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, clearing the air is usefully done by attending to fact, not assertion. There has been a vast amount of false assertion put forward here&#151;not necessarily knowing it to be false at the time, but without the grace to recognise that false assertions having been made, an apology might well be in order.
<P>

<a name="30708-02_para0"></a>I go, if I may, to one or two conclusions of the FAC:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We conclude that Alastair Campbell did not play any role in the inclusion of the 45 minutes claim in the September dossier".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-02_para1"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We conclude"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-02_para2"></a>
this is conclusion 14, found at paragraph 86&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"that the claims made in the September dossier were in all probability well founded on the basis of the intelligence then available, although as we have already stated we have concerns about the emphasis given to some of them. We further conclude that, in the absence of reliable evidence that intelligence personnel have either complained about or sought to distance themselves from the content of the dossier, allegations of politically inspired meddling cannot credibly be established".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-02_para3"></a>
So we are waiting, I imagine, for an apology.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-02_spnew23"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell: </B>   My Lords, will my noble and learned friend confirm that the Intelligence and Security Committee is now conducting an investigation into this matter? Would it not be sensible to await the outcome?

<A NAME="30708-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, it is indeed, as my noble and learned friend indicated, considering this matter and it is going to be given the fullest possible assistance at the specific direction of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has said that, subject of course to the usual constraints of sensitive intelligence and on a basis to be agreed by that committee, the report will be published. My noble and learned friend <P>


<a name="column_132"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 132</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of course serves on that committee. It is a committee of absolute integrity, and I do respectfully suggest that those who make unsubstantiated allegations might well attend to the report that is about to be published.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   My Lords, when did preparation of the dossier start?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, the preparation of the dossier cannot be said to have started at any particular time. The Joint Intelligence Committee, as a number of your Lordships know, produces regular assessments. It was decided that a dossier should be produced. The responsibility for the production of that dossier was with Mr Scarlett, the chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee. I repeat: he had such a close involvement that he was actually checking the proofs, the final format and the final content on the day that the printing run was to start, on the day before publication.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord King of Bridgwater: </B>   My Lords, the Lord President has quoted from the report of the Foreign Affairs Committee&#151;a number of whose members made clear that they could not give a full report because they did not have access to all the material. Endorsing what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, has said&#151;who is a previous colleague of mine on the Intelligence and Security Committee&#151;will the Minister confirm, first, reinforcing what he said, that no reasonable request from the Intelligence and Security Committee will be refused; and that material that was refused to the Foreign Affairs Committee will be made available to the Intelligence and Security Committee? Will he further confirm that, having regard to the fact that virtually all these matters are now history and not subject to acute sensitive intelligence, the Government will raise no objection if, for part of its hearing, the Intelligence and Security Committee decides to sit in public?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I certainly give the assurance for which the noble Lord asks. He and I both had dealings together when he was a distinguished member of the ISC. So far as concerns the committee sitting in public, if the committee, having borne in mind the very sensitive ramifications which the noble Lords knows of as well as I, wished to sit in public, that, it seems to me, would be a matter for its own decision. I do not entirely agree with the noble Lord when he says that this is historic. He will know as well as I that, even if intelligence becomes historic, the danger to sources continues, sometimes for many years.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   My Lords, have not the answers that the Leader of the House has given in reply to questions on this subject revealed the weaknesses of the Select Committee system? As the noble and learned Lord has ruled out a judicial inquiry, does he not think that we could learn from the American system of congressional committees? The American constitution, in I believe Articles 1 and 2, confers on those committees what the <P>


<a name="column_133"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 133</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>constitution calls all the necessary powers in order to investigate effectively and to hold the executive to account. If there is not to be a judicial inquiry on controversial matters such as these, does the noble and learned Lord think that we could learn much from the American system when trying to correct the widely perceived imbalance that we have in this country between the power of the executive and the power of Parliament?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, whether we can learn from any other select committees in any part of the world, whatever the jurisdiction, is certainly worthy of consideration. The budgets of congressional committees of inquiry, whether in the House of Representatives or in the Senate, are very substantial and they have the benefit&#151;some would say&#151;of being assisted by qualified cross-examiners.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Renfrew of Kaimsthorn: </B>   My Lords, does the noble and learned Lord share the reported view of the Foreign Secretary in relation to the second, February part of the report that it was a horlicks? In those circumstances does he feel that it was entirely consistent of the Foreign Secretary yesterday publicly to call on the BBC to offer an apology for its rather more circumscribed criticisms of the first September report?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, the Question concerns the first dossier and I responded to that. I was never quite sure what an "absolute horlicks" meant and I am still waiting to be told. The important question in relation to the apology is that assertions were made by the BBC that have proved to be wrong. If one looks at what was said in the dossier, to which the Question of the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, referred, the 45-minute issue is dealt with there. Journalistic ethics are an important part of a civil society. With great respect, it seems to me that if the BBC sometimes gets things wrong, it would not be a bad idea to say so.

<A NAME="30708-03_spopq0"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What discussions were held with the United States, prior to the military action against Iraq, about plans for post-war security and reconstruction.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-03_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, Her Majesty's Government had a wide range of discussions with United States interlocutors on contingency plans <P>


<a name="column_134"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 134</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>for post-war security and reconstruction if the Iraqi regime failed to comply with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441. At the Azores summit on 16th March, shortly before the conflict began, the Prime Minister and President Bush set out a vision for Iraq committing the coalition to work closely with inter alia the United Nations to ensure an appropriate post-conflict administration and to support the Iraqi people.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-03_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister recall that on 14th February Mr Donald Rumsfeld, the Defence Secretary, said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"With Iraq . . .  there has been time to prepare. We have set up a Post War Planning Office"?
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-03_para0"></a>
That was echoed by the Deputy National Security Adviser who said that there had been extensive discussion over months between the United States agencies about the post-war planning. Can the Minister tell the House whether the United Kingdom was fully consulted at all stages and whether it raised any objections for what in retrospect now looks like a very complacent set of assumptions about what would happen to Iraq once the conflict was over?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-03_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness has mentioned what was said in America about United States planning. The Foreign Office, the MoD, DfID and indeed the DTI liaised extensively with each other and liaised also with United States counterparts in the State Department, the Pentagon, US Aid and other relevant United States authorities. From the outset it was very clear that coalition forces would be responsible for humanitarian assistance in the aftermath of any fighting and, of course, that UN authority would be needed for reconstruction.
<P>

<a name="30708-03_para1"></a>The noble Baroness says that this has been characterised by complacency. I do not agree with that. There was a great deal of work to be done and there remains a great deal of work to be done. Two months after the end of decisive combat operations, I am bound to say that Iraq is already arguably better off than a number of post-conflict areas with which we have been associated in recent years.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-03_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, do the Government agree that the experience of Bosnia and Kosovo shows clearly that the first thing that needs to be restored is law and order and a system of justice? Can the noble Baroness tell the House what criminal and civil codes are now in force or in use in Iraq?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-03_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, to be honest I do not agree that it is solely law and order and civil justice that has to be restored. There are also the vital issues of food, of water, of electricity, of sustaining the basics of life itself. The noble Lord shakes his head, but I can assure him that, were those vital necessities not being delivered to the people of Iraq, I am absolutely certain that he would be one of the first to be on his feet making exactly that point to me. It is not a matter of just shaking his head, if I may <P>


<a name="column_135"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 135</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>say so, because troops also have to be engaged in ensuring that those basic necessities of life are delivered.
<P>

<a name="30708-03_para2"></a>As to what is happening on law and order and justice, policing is improving. There are now 33,000 Iraqi troops operating in Iraq; some 8,000 of those are in Baghdad; and there are also about 3,000 operating in Basra. The courthouses are starting to open: as I understand it, currently three in Baghdad and one in Basra. So the justice system is now starting to reassert itself.

<A NAME="30708-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, there is time for both noble Lords to ask a question.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Judd: </B>   My Lords, accepting the assurance of my noble friend that reconstruction is a matrix, as of course it is, nevertheless can she tell the House exactly what resources are being put into the redevelopment of the system of justice and of civil policing?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-04_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I cannot quantify what is going in, in terms of money being spent, but I can tell your Lordships that the security situation is being controlled by coalition troops. The number of coalition patrols has increased and there are now around 2,500 patrols a day across Iraq, and I can tell my noble friend that 200 of those are jointly conducted with the Iraqi police. As of 24th June, Iraqi police were conducting their first patrols on their own, which is a major step in helping Iraqis to return to a self-policed environment. It is important that we are talking here not only about what the coalition is able to bring to security on the ground, but also increasingly about what Iraqi policemen are bringing to the security on the ground.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-04_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </B>   My Lords, given that the Government fought the war because they believed that there were weapons of mass destruction that may fall into the hands of extremist groups through Saddam Hussein's regime, why are the Government so calm, and indeed almost complacent, about the failure to enforce law and order which has resulted in looting and in all kinds of materials possibly falling into the wrong hands? What are the Government doing to ensure that we are not at risk of that happening if they believe that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-04_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, if by the use of the word "calm" the noble Lord is trying to imply that the Government are complacent on this issue, I reject that entirely. I have just explained to your Lordships what is happening, with increased patrolling from coalition forces&#151;some 2,500 patrols, as I have indicated, every day&#151;and the increased provision for Iraqi policemen also to be involved.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30708-04_para0"></a>Of course, the issue of finding weapons of mass destruction is very important, but I am bound to say to your Lordships that I think it has greater importance in the United Kingdom, perhaps in both Houses of Parliament and perhaps also in our press, than necessarily it does on the ground in Iraq. The majority of Iraqi people want to ensure that they are living in an environment where they can send their children to school, where they can be sure about their health, where they have secure policing and where they have access to food and water. I point your Lordships to the fact that yesterday, for example, there was the first meeting of the new Baghdad city council, a not unimportant issue. The noble Lord may shake his head and look exasperated. If the noble Lord does not believe that it is important that democracy is being established in the city of Baghdad then I beg to disagree with him.

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-04_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Freeman </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What purpose is intended to be achieved by the Treasury review of the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-04_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport   (Lord McIntosh of Haringey): </B>  My Lords, the primary focus of the review will be to make public service delivery more effective and efficient. It will examine the best organisational arrangements for delivering the Government's tax objectives. It will consider the case for changes in the law where necessary to allow the full benefits of particular arrangements to be realised, and it will pay particular attention to the need to ensure the continued effectiveness of the core business of revenue collection and administration.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-04_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Freeman: </B>   My Lords, if it is confirmed by this review or otherwise that financial loss has been suffered by those who have applied for tax credits and not yet received payments due to inefficiencies in the system, will the Minister confirm that the Inland Revenue code of practice will definitely permit compensation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-04_spnew11"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, there has been a great deal of misrepresentation on this issue, although I can give the noble Lord, Lord Freeman, the <P>


<a name="column_137"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 137</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>assurance that he seeks. It has been claimed that there has been a great deal of loss. There has certainly been delay in dealing with telephone calls and with correspondence. Anyone who has applied for tax credits and has shown his or her eligibility for tax credits will get the money which is due.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-04_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Newby: </B>   My Lords, can the noble Lord confirm that one option being considered by the review is whether the Inland Revenue and HM Customs and Excise might merge? Within that context, will the review be considering whether the extensive powers which are currently held by Customs officers might be extended to Inland Revenue officials?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-04_spnew13"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am glad to be answering a supplementary question which is about the original Question on the Order Paper. Yes, I can confirm that that is one of the options being considered. The matter of the potential merger of the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise has been on the public agenda since a parliamentary committee of inquiry in 1862. It was last considered by the Government in 1993 and by the Treasury Select Committee in 1999. So this is not a new proposal, if indeed that is what emerges from the current review. But the question of the powers of Customs and Excise and Inland Revenue officials will undoubtedly be a part of the review.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-04_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe: </B>   My Lords, can my noble friend say who is to undertake the review and when it will report?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-04_spnew15"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the review will be conducted by the Treasury and it will report in due course.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-04_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   My Lords, in the discussion of this merger, has there not been an unattractive tendency lately to blame Inland Revenue officials for faults which really lie with Ministers&#151;for example, the Chancellor landed the Inland Revenue with the task of administering tax credits, which have nothing to do with tax at all? As the Minister is aware, it was in your Lordships' House that it emerged that 90 per cent of all tax credit payments totalling £15 billion a year actually exceed the total tax liability of the recipient. In other words, they are not tax credits at all.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-04_spnew17"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, if there has been criticism of officials in the Inland Revenue, it has not come from the Government. The Chancellor has explicitly praised the Inland Revenue for the way in which it has taken on the very substantial additional tasks imposed on it by the tax credit regime.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-04_spnew18"></A><B> The Earl of Northesk: </B>   My Lords, in reviewing the administration of tax, will this review also investigate the issue of fraud, particularly in respect of tax credits?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-04_spnew19"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, there are continuing reviews on the issue of fraud, just as there are continuing reviews on, for example, failures of <P>


<a name="column_138"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 138</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>prosecution for fraud, if that is to what the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, is referring. One such review being conducted by Mr Justice Butterfield will be reporting very shortly, probably next week. We shall be interested to see the findings.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-04_spnew21"></A><B> Lord McNally </B>   moved Amendment No. 1:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 3, line 8, at end insert "with due regard to the qualifications and limitations contained in paragraph 6A of Schedule 14"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-04_para3"></a><P>

<a name="30708-04_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Amendment No. 1 paves the way for Amendment No. 131 that is grouped with it, which I hope will provide the core of the debate that we are about to have. That amendment stands in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, and is identical to an amendment which has being tabled at different stages of the Bill in the names of the noble Lords, Lord Hussey and Lord Puttnam. The name of the noble Lord, Lord Hussey, does not appear on this amendment. As he is unwell, I did not think it right to disturb him to ask whether he would put his name to it. The name of the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, is not on the amendment for reasons which I fully understand and accept.
<P>

<a name="30708-04_para5"></a>The Puttnam committee report had a tripod of recommendations, which it believed would immensely strengthen the Bill in providing essential protection for our communications industry against the predatory instincts of the global multi-media conglomerates. The first recommendation was that Ofcom should be able to test the totally unproven assertion that ITV would benefit from American ownership and American money before opening up our markets without any reciprocation on the part of the Americans.
<P>

<a name="30708-04_para6"></a>Last week the Government were able to resist the amendment by 11 votes, with only half of Labour Peers supporting the Government and helped over the line by a three-line Whip from the Conservative Front Bench.
<P>

<a name="30708-04_para7"></a>The second leg of the Puttnam tripod was the inclusion of a tough plurality public interest test. Thanks to the persuasive powers of the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, the Government will be bringing forward amendments to insert such a test later today.
<P>

<a name="30708-04_para8"></a>That brings us to the third leg of the tripod which is contained in this grouping before the House. The amendment seeks to put specific restrictions on the ownership of Channel 5 in terms of cross-media <P>


<a name="column_139"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 139</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>ownership between print media, satellite and terrestrial television, which would&#151;as did happen&#151;as I said at Second Reading, create a grotesque concentration of power in any industry and in the communications industry would constitute a threat to our democracy.
<P>

<a name="30708-04_para9"></a>I can already hear the Minister arguing that this amendment is no longer needed thanks to the tough new plurality clause which we are about to receive. But is that so? Not according to the Financial Times. On 3rd July, the day after the Puttnam plurality amendment was accepted, it quoted an unnamed senior DCMS official as saying that the amendment would not hamper the principle of allowing US media groups to bid for ITV or enabling newspaper publishers to seek control of Channel 5.
<P>

<a name="30708-04_para10"></a>The media expert, Owen Gibson, in the Guardian said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Competition lawyers believe that the new test will be a significant hurdle to media owners wanting to branch out into other sectors. A lot will depend on how Ofcom, which under Lord Currie has promised to retain a 'light touch', chooses to interpret the public interest test".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-04_para11"></a>
So, there we have it: after today we are in the hands of the media lawyers and an untried regulator and an untested piece of legislation. That is why the House should take this final opportunity to have its say on the matter.
<P>

<a name="30708-04_para12"></a>The plurality test provides Ofcom with a big and powerful gun. These amendments give a clear direction as to which way it should be pointed. Some people say that this is aimed at the ambitions of Mr Rupert Murdoch, but Tessa Jowell has told us at great length that this is not a Bill tailored to Mr Murdoch's ambitions. Furthermore, Mr Murdoch has said that he has no interest in Channel 5. So let us have no more about this being an anti-Murdoch amendment. It is aimed at thwarting any Australian/American multi-media conglomerate with significant press and satellite holdings taking such a stranglehold on the British media.
<P>

<a name="30708-04_para13"></a>I know that asking Labour Members to vote with us today puts great strains on their loyalty. The Whips are very persuasive. I am a great fan of "24" on BBC2, which is an example of good American television. As devotees may know, in Sunday's episode the hero, Jack Bauer, was left in the hands of the world's most cruel and sadistic torturer, who, I understand, was on loan from the Government Whips' Office.
<P>

<a name="30708-04_para14"></a>I ask Members on all Benches to ask themselves what they will answer in the future when asked about what they did to make sure that the right safeguards were in place. What if the plurality test does not prove as strong as we think it is? What if the noble Lord, Lord Currie, proves less robust in his interpretation than we would like? What if Mr Murdoch changes his mind and comes calling for Channel 5?
<P>

<a name="30708-04_para15"></a>We all remember the impressive mea culpa of the noble Lord, Lord Renton, about the 1990 Act. What will noble Lords who today vote "Not-Content" say? "David Puttnam asked me not to vote"; "I thought the plurality tests would be enough"; "I was bullied by the Whips"; or will they say, "I used the one personal <P>


<a name="column_140"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 140</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>power I had&#151;my vote in the Lobby&#151;to send a message to government, Ofcom and to the media moguls that we expect diversity and choice to be defended with vigour and this legislation to be interpreted robustly"?
<P>

<a name="30708-04_para16"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, reminded us on Report, the media moguls have a record of challenging rather than complying with regulation.
<P>

<a name="30708-04_para17"></a>Shortly before I entered the Chamber, I received an e-mail from a senior person in the television industry who asked me to put the following questions to the Minister. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If, as the Government is implying, the plurality test is the solution, that begs the question why the 20/20 rules are being retained for ITV. If the test is not enough for ITV&#151;where the competition and plurality hurdles to Murdoch takeover would anyway be immense&#151;it is disingenuous for Government to imply that the plurality test alone is enough for C5&#151;where actually the competition and (as defined) plurality concerns may be surmountable.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-04_para18"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Furthermore, the Government extending the 20/20 rule to ITN at the same time as introducing the plurality test. Again this suggests that the plurality test is not enough and gives a lie to the argument that it is too late in the day for extending the scope of 20/20".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-04_para19"></a>
Those points were made by an expert within the industry and it will be interesting to know what the Minister says about them.
<P>

<a name="30708-04_para20"></a>Essentially, this amendment had its origin in the recommendation of the Puttnam committee, which said that if the Government believed that it is unacceptable for a major terrestrial channel, a major newspaper group and the dominant satellite network to be open to shared ownership, then the clearest and most straightforward way to achieve that was to maintain the prohibition on ownership of Channel 5 which presently exists.
<P>

<a name="30708-04_para21"></a>The questions to be answered today are clear-cut and simple. Do the Government consider such a concentration of media power to be unacceptable? If so, why do they resist the most unambiguous and clear-cut way of preventing such an accumulation of cross-media power?
<P>

<a name="30708-04_para22"></a>Listen carefully, my Lords, and if the answers are not convincing, I hope noble Lords from all Benches will join me in the "Content" Lobby today. I beg to move.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell: </B>   My Lords, my name is attached to Amendment No. 131 and I therefore support the noble Lord, Lord McNally, on both the amendments in this group.
<P>

<a name="30708-05_para0"></a>The noble Lord concluded his remarks with a quote from the Puttnam committee, which I was going to take as the simple proposition on which to base my speech. He referred to this being the clearest and most straightforward way to make sure that we did not have a major terrestrial channel, a major newspaper group and a dominant satellite network open to shared ownership.
<P>

<a name="30708-05_para1"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McNally, also observed earlier in his speech that the Government will argue that now we have a plurality test, these amendments <P>


<a name="column_141"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 141</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>are superfluous. He said that the plurality test would depend upon the approach of the chairman of Ofcom and his board and on the effectiveness of the legislation. However, it is a little worse than that. It is actually going to depend on the attitude of Ministers and the action of Ministers. I want to say a little more about that.
<P>

<a name="30708-05_para2"></a>Noble Lords must be clear that the purpose of the plurality test as it is about to be added to this Bill by the government amendments, which we will debate later, is not to impose a plurality test. The purpose is to enable a media plurality test to be carried out in the event of a qualifying merger.
<P>

<a name="30708-05_para3"></a>According to the Minister on Report,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a plurality test would, in principle, allow the Secretary of State to make a judgment on media mergers".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-05_para4"></a>
He went on to say:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It will be for Ministers to determine whether the merger causes sufficient plurality concerns for it to be blocked, or for conditions to be attached".&#151;[Official Report, 2/7/03; col. 914.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-05_para5"></a><P>

<a name="30708-05_para6"></a>Therefore the test is very conditional and it is all in the hands of Ministers. The test may be effective if Ministers decide to act, but that is a very big if. We know, because Ministers have told us, that the Government took the view that there were very good reasons for removing the restrictions on a major newspaper owning or controlling Channel 5, although in response to repeated questions since, it has emerged that the only difference they can spell out is the difference in size between Channel 3 and Channel 5 at the present time.
<P>

<a name="30708-05_para7"></a>We know that the Government intend to be restrictive in their use of this new plurality power. There is no guarantee that the Government would use it to prevent a major national newspaper owning Channel 5&#151;the Minister made that perfectly clear on Report. I refer to his remarks in col. 915 of the Official Report of 2nd July 2003.
<P>

<a name="30708-05_para8"></a>We are told the Government will publish guidelines setting out in more detail the areas where the test will generally be applied. I am not sure whether these guidelines have yet been issued. In any case, guidelines are only guidelines. Therefore, we have before us what might be termed the "if, maybe, possibly, and then again, possibly not" clause.
<P>

<a name="30708-05_para9"></a>However, the arguments against allowing a newspaper which has a national market share of 20 per cent owning Channel 5 are immediate and compelling. They do not depend on some future increase in Channel 5's market share. Those arguments were put with great conviction, with admirable brevity and clarity and with unanswerable logic by my noble friend Lord Glentoran, speaking from the Opposition Front Bench in Committee. I agreed with everything he said then. He provided grounds enough to support the certainty of the amendment before we again fog it all with the uncertainty provided by the Government's plurality test.
<P>

<a name="30708-05_para10"></a>There is a another compelling reason for Parliament removing the uncertainty. We know that there has never been a moment in the history of the modern media when its barons have not been prepared to exert <P>


<a name="column_142"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 142</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>every pressure in support of their own interests. We also know that there has never been a time when the powers of media barons to exert pressures have been greater&#151;greater perhaps than when Stanley Baldwin made his famous remark about "power without responsibility . . .  the prerogative of the harlot down the ages".
<P>

<a name="30708-05_para11"></a>As the Bill has gone through Parliament, pressure has been applied to both the Government and the Opposition to allow the giant oligarchies the maximum freedom to exploit their already great power. I am alarmed at the prospect that we leave all this uncertainty in the hands of Ministers, who will inevitably and unavoidably come under greater pressure, no matter which party is in power. That pressure will be political and financial to allow the great media moguls to have their way.
<P>

<a name="30708-05_para12"></a>We should build certainty into the Bill. I therefore urge my noble friends to support this amendment and with it Amendment No. 131.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lipsey: </B>   My Lords, I accept the test that the noble Lord, Lord McNally, has put before us; namely, when we go into the Lobbies today, we should be thinking hard about how in 10 or 20 years we shall answer for our vote in the light of developments. I accept the test and have thought hard about the subject as a result. I want to make only three brief observations.
<P>

<a name="30708-05_para13"></a>First, the noble Lord, Lord McNally, described the committee's recommendations as a trifle. I do not see it like that. I believe that in the plurality test we have a solid pillar which requires little by way of gothic buttresses to be added to it. It is sufficient to stand.
<P>

<a name="30708-05_para14"></a>Secondly, although there are dangers such as those described by the noble Lord, Lord McNally, there is another. That is that Channel 5 does not do very well. In five or 10 years' time, the only people who might be prepared to invest in it are those who would not on plurality grounds be ideal. The Minister at the time will be able to account for that, but we are legislating for five, 10, 15 or 20 years.
<P>

<a name="30708-05_para15"></a>If Channel 5 goes belly-up due to the fact that no one is prepared to invest in it because the law we have passed allows no flexibility for changing circumstances, that might be regrettable, particularly for those who get pleasure from Channel 5. It is, after all, a channel contributing to plurality, but it has no guaranteed existence. That is a matter that this House should weigh.
<P>

<a name="30708-05_para16"></a>I want, thirdly, to comment on a matter that weighs heavily with me. In my time in this House&#151;it is short compared with most noble Lords&#151;I have known no other Bill that has changed so much during the course of its passage here. The Government have been prepared to make many fundamental changes. Indeed, one only has to look at today's Marshalled List to see the number of government amendments. They have not been tabled because the Government have cocked things up, but tabled in response to the views put forward by this House.
<P>


<a name="column_143"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 143</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30708-05_para17"></a>Like many noble Lords, I know the kind of arguments that occur among Ministers when considering amendments which come from this House. Many people in another place and elsewhere say, "Oh, don't pay any attention to them"; or they say, "If you give them concessions, what's the good? They just want more. They are insatiable, that lot. Take them on. Ignore them". Perhaps the Licensing Bill is an example of that.
<P>

<a name="30708-05_para18"></a>Thanks to my noble friend Lord Puttnam, we have achieved a remarkable result with this Bill. It is beyond what most of us would have believed. We are now right, particularly Members on this side of the House, to say, "The deal is done. It is a success. We have achieved the objectives we wanted to achieve and now we will support the Government through the rest of the Bill".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Pilkington of Oxenford: </B>   My Lords, I was a member of the Joint Committee and I must remind your Lordships that we put forward a modest proposal that Ofcom should consider this matter. The Government's concession is that Ministers should consider the position. I totally share the view of my noble friend Lord Crickhowell that Ministers are subject to enormous pressure. The committee was united in the view that Ofcom should consider the position. It did not, as the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, said, recommend setting the situation in tablets of stone. It said, "Allow this body, which is neutral and not subject to political pressures, to consider the position".
<P>

<a name="30708-05_para19"></a>I urge your Lordships to support Amendment No. 1 tabled by the noble Lord, Lord McNally. Ministers are politicians and are subject to pressure. My noble friend Lord Crickhowell is right about that&#151;he was one of them. I urge the House not to follow the honeyed words that we have just heard.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-05_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Cohen of Pimlico: </B>   My Lords, I support the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord McNally. The plurality test, though useful, will not quite do the job, particularly if it is in the hands of Ministers to apply it. I was prepared to consider the plurality test when Ofcom, which one hoped would be independent of Ministers, had the application in its hands.
<P>

<a name="30708-05_para20"></a>Media are political. We would do well not to be too confident about how culture stands up to anyone else's agenda. It does not stand up very well&#151;it never has. I therefore consider it important to put in place as many bodies charged with considering the preservation of our culture which do not include Ministers. I therefore support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-05_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </B>   My Lords, I want briefly to support every word the noble Baroness, Lady Cohen, has just spoken. In particular, I want to echo what was said by my noble friends Lord Crickhowell and Lord Pilkington. I do not believe that the plurality test stands on its own and I greatly hope that your Lordships will support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord McNally.

<P>

<a name="30708-05_para21"></a>I sadly add this. While I have every admiration for the way in which my noble friend Lady Buscombe has led the opposition to the Bill, I deeply regret this lacuna. I speak for myself and not for her. I suspect that she is under heavy pressure from some gentleman down the corridor, whose name I can never remember, who has given contrary instructions in this particular context. I can say only that I deeply regret that and I shall certainly disregard them with some happiness and support the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord McNally.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   My Lords, I want briefly to make a point referred to rather vividly by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, when we last debated the Bill; namely, that the extent to which tests of the complex and rubbery kind which are implicit in his Amendment No. 85, which introduces the plurality test, can be the subject of intense legal bombardment by well-financed and resourced would-be litigators, should not be under-estimated by this House.
<P>

<a name="30708-06_para0"></a>While undoubtedly the concession made previously and the tabling of the plurality amendment is most important, I believe that the rigour which would be added to it by the amendment in the name of my noble friend Lord McNally would carry the position much further. Amendment No. 85, introducing the plurality test, talks about,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a sufficient plurality of persons with control of the media enterprises".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-06_para1"></a>
Media lawyers will lick their lips at the extent to which that will give them endless prospect for muzzling and befuddling the poor old lawyers who will be working for Ofcom.
<P>

<a name="30708-06_para2"></a>I invite your Lordships to look at some of the other great regulators we have set up in the past 20 years. Let us take, for example, the Serious Fraud Office, which in the past five years has brought only a single prosecution for insider trading while everyone in the City knows that it is an hourly and daily event. Why? Because the criteria for the bringing of a prosecution and the range of legal guns levelled against the authorities if they try to prosecute are such as to make an insider trading prosecution a farce. I put that point to the House as a practical consideration.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-06_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   My Lords, I also wish to support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord McNally. There are two points that I wish to make, both of which have been made already but they need emphasising. The noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, pointed to the two tests that already exist and have been reaffirmed by the government amendment&#151;the test of 20 per cent for both ITN and Channel 3. There really is no argument why the same restrictions should not apply to any would-be owner of Channel 5.
<P>

<a name="30708-06_para3"></a>The second point is one that other noble Lords have expressed. It is about the involvement of Ministers. As noble Lords will know, I have always had a great concern about the telecommunications and contents side coming together&#151;the techies and the fluffies&#151;because there could well and truly be conflicts of <P>


<a name="column_145"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 145</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>interest. Naturally, the Minister for Trade and Industry will be the one to be consulted. However, there are two Ministers who are to be responsible for this Bill. It is important to know that both would be consulted before any decision was taken.
<P>

<a name="30708-06_para4"></a>Having said all that, I agree entirely with the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey. We have had a tremendous response from the Government and we all applaud that. It is this continued worry that we wish to reinforce by testing the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord McNally.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   My Lords, I would like to speak against the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord McNally, despite the fact that I admire his work in this field. As he made a comment on the strength of Government Whips, I add to my admiration the way in which the Liberal Democrat Whips have gathered such a splendid force behind him. Not for the first time, the Liberal Democrats are extremely good at filling their Benches in support of this important amendment.
<P>

<a name="30708-06_para5"></a>This Bill, which will be passed in the very near future, is one which will stand for a considerable period of time. If I concentrate on Amendment No. 131 which specifically deals with Channel 5 licences, it says anyone having a national newspaper market share of 20 per cent or more shall not be allowed to acquire Channel 5. That is concentrating on the now and near future. What my noble friend Lord Puttnam, the noble Lord, Lord McNally and others of the pre-legislative scrutiny committee were really concerned with was to make the Bill future proof. They were not just concerning themselves with the temporary moment. They were to consider life as we go ahead in which there will be huge numbers of channels of various kinds&#151;terrestrial, satellite and others whose names we do not yet know. Things will not be the same in five or 10 years.
<P>

<a name="30708-06_para6"></a>If we look at the amendment more closely, it is such an inflexible position to say 20 per cent. While that may be a significant figure at the present time, who knows what will be the right figure in years to come? Who knows whether it is desirable that an owner of 19 per cent should be allowed freely to acquire Channel 5? The noble Lord may say if anybody does not fit the exact criteria of Amendment No. 131, then he may come within the plurality test which is to be introduced by the government amendment. It seems to me that the plurality test which has been moved before by my noble friend Lord Puttnam, but criticised by others today because of ministerial involvement, is much more future proof, much more sensible to put into a Bill which we hope will last for many years.
<P>

<a name="30708-06_para7"></a>I cannot see a government of any complexion being particularly keen to have a communications Bill of any kind for years to come because of the difficulties of this one. Of course the plurality test involves Ministers because as noble Lords know, it fits into the structure of the Enterprise Act 2002. But that is not to diminish the role of the principal adviser on these matters&#151;Ofcom. Its views would be known and made public. No government Minister with any sense, whether in an existing or future government, will override the <P>


<a name="column_146"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 146</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>carefully reasoned advice of Ofcom&#151;assuming it is carefully reasoned. I do not believe that Ministers will go off on a wild tangent of their own in a matter of this sort.
<P>

<a name="30708-06_para8"></a>My noble friend Lord Puttnam, the noble Lords, Lord McNally and Lord Crickhowell, and other noble Lords have promoted the plurality test for months. It is now shortly to be proposed by the Minister. This is something which can cater for all situations, for the future as well as the present. Having this extraordinarily inflexible amendment, which the noble Lord, Lord McNally put forward, is not necessary.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Maclennan of Rogart: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may begin by saying to the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, that I am not here because anyone suggested that I ought to be here. I am here because his suggestion that this very large Bill could be made future proof in the way he suggests, is certainly not borne out by experience of earlier attempts in 1990 and 1996 to regulate cross-media ownership for all time. I do not imagine the present Bill will have any greater success in longevity. What is quite clear from my recollection of those Bills is that if one seeks to set up a framework to protect diversity, it is necessary to have figures which the noble Lord characterises as arbitrary. Percentage wise, it has been done before and no doubt will be done again. The nub of the opposition has not come so much on the merits of the particular amendments before us as the suggestion by the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, that somehow if we were to carry these amendments we would be chancing our arm too far, pressing our luck too far. The suggestion is that the response of the Government might be less rational as a consequence.
<P>

<a name="30708-06_para9"></a>What has characterised the debate on this Bill has been the degree of dialogue between the Government and many other interested parties. With a Bill of such major importance and of such gargantuan extent, it seems entirely appropriate that that should be the approach. I recognise that the time available to consider these matters has been very great, but I do not believe it has been too much or that the Government are likely to abandon the approach that they have taken which is to consider these matters on their merits. As my noble friend Lord McNally said, this amendment was not put forward by the Puttnam committee as an alternative to the plurality clause. As I read the report, this was seen as a belt and braces measure necessary because of the importance of this issue. I cannot think that at this stage the judgment of what we would be doing if we carried my noble friend's amendments and that of the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, would be any different in another place, where there is, properly, considerable unease about media concentration, not just now, but in the long term. Many of those engaged in this debate, and who will be engaged in further consideration of the Bill, took part in debate on the 1990 and 1996 Bills. The noble Lord, Lord Corbett, who participated in those debates, expressed concern about these matters at that time. I see no reason to believe that the <P>


<a name="column_147"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 147</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>judgments of principle made then would be any less focused today. I hope that we will not shy away from our duty to provide the best framework possible and that we will take the advice of the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, and his colleagues in supporting my noble friend's amendments. 

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Gordon of Strathblane: </B>   My Lords, I, too, support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord McNally. I concede that, at worst, it is a belt and braces measure and that the clause might not be necessary if the plurality test is strong enough. However, in a matter as important as media ownership, which is pivotal to the future of democracy in this country, I would rather&#151;save in the presence of the noble Lord, Lord Peyton&#151;add a clause than take a chance on the issue not being caught. Given that there are already 400-odd clauses, I do not think that the rainforests will be endangered by the use of extra paper.
<P>

<a name="30708-06_para10"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, that the amendment addresses a subject different from the plurality test. It addresses a specific. At Second Reading, I said in passing that I cannot see why people are treating Channel 5 differently from Channel 3; after all, both are terrestrial television services licensed by the Independent Broadcasting Authority. Why are we treating one differently from the other? Two reasons can be alleged. The first is audience size. Surely we all recognise that that could change. Channel 5 could end up with a bigger audience, particularly allied to media promotion from a national newspaper. Channel 3's audience could well decrease, so that argument does not hold water.
<P>

<a name="30708-06_para11"></a>The only argument that bears examination is that, at present, Channel 5 does not cover the whole of the UK. At present, the channel covers over 75 per cent, but that could change. Why are we treating Channel 5 so much differently from Channel 3? If it is logical to impose restrictions for Channel 3, it is also logical to impose them for Channel 5. This clause is a specific. It is not an alternative to the plurality test; it is an addition to it to ensure that there is no possible doubt about what noble Lords mean. At the moment, I support the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="30708-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Thomson of Monifieth: </B>   My Lords, I support my noble friend Lord McNally. Normally, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, on these matters, but I was tempted by his remark that he puts his faith in the fact that he could not foresee a situation in which Ofcom's serious views were rejected by Ministers. The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, was a very distinguished director of the Office of Fair Trading for a very long time. I do not know the full details of his history, but I would be very surprised if he was totally content with all the ministerial decisions put before him.
<P>

<a name="30708-07_para0"></a>I support the views that the noble Lord, Lord Gordon of Strathblane, has expressed. Channel 5 must be regarded as a distinctive, separate case to be dealt with on its own merits. It is the fifth terrestrial public service channel in this country. It is true that, because of its lack <P>


<a name="column_148"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 148</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of total coverage and for other reasons, the public service regulator has given it a lighter remit than the other ITV channels. However, that will change.
<P>

<a name="30708-07_para1"></a>I find Channel 5 rather good these days. Very often, I find programmes on the channel that interest me. I hope earnestly that its standards and coverage will improve. I see no reason why it should be treated separately from the ownership considerations that apply to the rest of the public service commercially-funded system in this country&#151;the ITV system. For those reasons, it is wholly right that Channel 5, as the fifth channel of our public service broadcasting system, should be safeguarded as proposed by my noble friend Lord McNally.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sheldon: </B>   My Lords, for some years now, I have been concerned about the increasingly close relationship between the Government and the media. We have seen it as an extreme form&#151;nowhere near the one that we are discussing today&#151;in Berlusconi, where there is almost a fusion between certain parts of the media and important parts of the government. That is what concerns me most. That relationship seems to be growing over time. We have never had that kind of relationship in this modern media age, but we are seeing it now. This is an opportunity for us to say, "Enough is enough". There comes a time when one must bring it to a halt.
<P>

<a name="30708-07_para2"></a>Politicians now depend more than ever before, not so much on getting support from the media, but on avoiding unfavourable mentions from them. That has now become an important aspect of government and political life. We need greater safeguards to protect us from the increasing powers of these kinds of relationships. For that reason, I support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord McNally.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-07_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   My Lords, I wish to be very brief. I join the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, and the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, in congratulating the Government for making many moves in relation to the Bill. I do not think that it is the case, as the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, stated, that we are worried about pushing our luck too far. I genuinely mean that. Several noble Lords, including myself, were deeply concerned, when we set out to scrutinise the Bill in your Lordships' House, that the Government would not show signs of shifting, and of listening to noble Lords and our debates.
<P>

<a name="30708-07_para3"></a>However, the Government have listened on several occasions. On behalf of Her Majesty's Opposition, I am extremely grateful for that. We support the Government on this issue. It is right to liberalise ownership rules for Channel 5, particularly given that the Government have tabled amendments to the Enterprise Act to introduce a plurality test in certain media mergers. Given that the plurality public interest test will act as a belt-and-braces safeguard&#151;some have talked about a pillar&#151;in addition to powerful competition law, we simply do not believe that it makes sense now to retain limits on cross-media ownership.
<P>


<a name="column_149"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 149</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30708-07_para4"></a>With the exception of the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, who made a very powerful speech with which I agreed entirely, and the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, who referred to the OFT, noble Lords have spoken as if the OFT and the Competition Commission do not exist. They play powerfully important roles in such issues and the question of mergers. We believe strongly that Ofcom will have very powerful content rules. Ofcom will be in the driving seat rather than Ministers, as the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, said.
<P>

<a name="30708-07_para5"></a>On several issues on which the Government have moved in your Lordships' House, we have concentrated on the need to future proof the Bill. As the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, said, there is a concern that if the amendments were carried today, we would place in the Bill an unnecessary inflexibility on Ofcom's ability to act in the future. I ask the noble Lord, Lord McNally, to respond to the brief statement that the noble Lord made on Report with regard to similar amendments.
<P>

<a name="30708-07_para6"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McNally, said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in the light of the very important statement made by the Minister today about plurality and its effect on the Bill, I shall not move this amendment".&#151;[Official Report, 2/7/03; col. 955.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-07_para7"></a>
Was the noble Lord, Lord McNally, deciding on principle last week that it was not necessary to move his amendment in relation to Channel 5, or was it that the troops were not there to support him? That is terribly important, because it is unfortunate that we are not debating the government amendments on plurality before debating Channel 5. It would be helpful to have that point answered.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, I thought that I had cleared that matter up in my opening remarks. Within 24 hours, according to the Financial Times on 3rd July, an unnamed senior official at the DCMS was putting the concessions well into the margins of the Bill and making them extremely discretionary. That was why I was determined to bring this matter back to the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I must start by congratulating the noble Lord, Lord McNally, on the way in which he has succeeded in paving this debate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-07_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, when I was faced with this dilemma, I was told that the expert on paving Bills in Opposition was the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, so I was following the master.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-07_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, that is precisely why I was congratulating the noble Lord, Lord McNally. I was about to say that I did that for 14 years and enjoyed it. I challenge the noble Lord to achieve what I once did, which was to move an amendment in Part 6 of a Bill that would retrospectively have changed provisions in Parts 2, 3, 4 and 5. He can have a go at that if he wants to.
<P>

<a name="30708-07_para8"></a>The noble Lord's amendment has had a very bizarre effect, paving up the debate on Channel 5 now. The amendment will be considered before the debate on the <P>


<a name="column_150"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 150</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>plurality clause. That means that I now have to bore your Lordships by saying what the plurality test, which will be introduced in the next group of amendments, will do. If my noble friend Lord Sheldon had heard what I am going to say, he would not have been able to say what he said about Berlusconi and Beaverbrook. The answers to all of the points that have been made are to be found in the plurality amendment.
<P>

<a name="30708-07_para9"></a>The media plurality test is a new public interest consideration added to Section 58 of the Enterprise Act 2002, in addition to a consideration relating to national security that was included in the 2002 Act and the newspaper merger public interest considerations that are already in the Bill. The wording seeks to ensure that the Secretary of State can intervene in a proposed or completed merger between broadcasters or between broadcasters and newspaper proprietors.
<P>

<a name="30708-07_para10"></a>The clause deals at great length and in detail, in many amendments, with the whole issue of cross-media ownership, which was not recognised by the noble Lord, Lord McNally, in his speech. It proposes to ensure sufficient plurality of persons controlling media enterprises in relation to: every different audience in the United Kingdom or a particular area or locality in the United Kingdom; the need for diversity of broadcasting throughout the United Kingdom; and the need for persons controlling or carrying on media enterprises to have a genuine commitment to attainment in relation to the broadcasting standards objective in the Bill&#151;impartiality generally and impartial and accurate news, for example.
<P>

<a name="30708-07_para11"></a>The amendment exactly addresses the problems of the potential motivation of individual media proprietors or would-be media proprietors seeking to enter broadcasting markets&#151;be it Channel 3 or Channel 5&#151;in this country. However, the difference between this amendment and the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord McNally, is that ours has two bases. It is based on principle and is not directed at individuals&#151;and I really do deplore the noble Lord's levity when he said that his amendment was not about Mr Murdoch, but was about American or Australian moguls, because he could not name a second one, could he?
<P>

<a name="30708-07_para12"></a>Our amendment is not only based on principle&#151;in other words, on the competition legislation that has existed for many years. It is not untested, but is based on the high standards that are required of media owners throughout this Bill and the way in which the plurality amendments, which I hope that we will agree, protect the high standards of broadcasting in this country. Against that, the speech made by the noble Lord, Lord McNally&#151;although not his supporters, who made serious speeches&#151;was disgraceful. He talked about industry experts, the Financial Times, unnamed senior officials in the DCMS and Government Whips, but almost not at all about the substance of his amendment, which is an ad hominem amendment, directed at an American Australian media mogul.

<a name="30708-07_para13"></a>The way in which the noble Lord, Lord McNally, has approached this amendment has debased the argument in this House. The rest of the debate has been perfectly proper, but the noble Lord, Lord McNally, has sought to have this debate before the one on the plurality test. He has sought to do so in a personal and light-hearted manner. This is a serious matter that deserves serious consideration. I believe that the noble Lord, Lord McNally, has not given it that serious consideration.

<P>
<A NAME="30708-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell: </B>   My Lords, I am glad that the Minister said that some of the supporters of the noble Lord, Lord McNally, were serious. I believe that the noble Lord, Lord McNally, was also serious. Would the Minister not agree that he made almost every single point that he made tonight when speaking on the subject on 2nd July on Report? The Minister might also give us the credit for reading ahead to the amendments that we will discuss later. It was only after reading this amendment and re-reading what the noble Lord, Lord McNally, said, that I came to the firm decision to support this amendment. I hope that my noble friends will also support it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I absolve the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, of any blame, because he put his name to the amendment at a late stage. The noble Lord, Lord McNally, however, tabled his amendment before I had tabled my plurality amendment, despite the fact that he withdrew it on the argument that he had to see the plurality amendment before he tabled his own amendment. That argument will not wash.
<P>

<a name="30708-08_para0"></a>I am also a little surprised that the noble Lord, Lord McNally, continued to say that this was the view of the Joint Scrutiny Committee. That committee said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We consider that matters relating to the consolidation of ITV and Channel 5 could properly be decided through competition law strengthened by the plurality test".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-08_para1"></a>
That is exactly what the Government are doing, as the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, and others recognise. I commend that view to the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Pilkington of Oxenford: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry to interrupt, but the committee wanted Ofcom. The great worry that the Minister has not dealt with is that the Minister will decide the criteria. There is considerable worry on this side of House about the pressure imposed on Ministers. I hope that the Minister will answer that point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I was going to answer that point. The noble Lord, Lord Pilkington, cannot take me very seriously if he thinks that I would ignore that point. The noble Lord, Lord McNally, seems to base his argument on three questions&#151;what happens if Channel 5 grows, how we ensure that Channel 5 does not fall into the wrong hands, and the contention that any protections offered by the plurality test could be swept the way on a Minister's say so. That is the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Pilkington.
<P>


<a name="column_152"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 152</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30708-08_para2"></a>I will take each point in turn. First, what happens if Channel 5 grows? The noble Lord, Lord Gordon, referred to that point. We would very much like to see Channel 5 grow. Channel 5 has just over 6 per cent of the audience and a reach of only 80 per cent of the country. We do not think that Channel 5 is large enough to need protecting in the same way as ITV. That is the difference between Channel 3 and Channel 5. There is a range of protections and controls that the Bill will put in place in the event that Channel 5 grows to the size of ITV. For example, Ofcom could alter the channel's original programme requirements, or the quota for independent productions could be changed by order by the Secretary of State. If Channel 5's audience share becomes broadly equivalent to that of ITV, the Secretary of State may introduce an appointed news provider scheme similar to that for the Channel 3 system, or Ofcom could change the obligations for Channel 3.
<P>

<a name="30708-08_para3"></a>How do we ensure that Channel 5 does not fall into the wrong hands? There are the plurality tests. As I said, the tests will allow the Secretary of State&#151;I shall come to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Pilkington of Oxenford&#151;to intervene in cases in which she believes that a merger causes sufficient plurality concerns for it to be blocked or for conditions to be attached. The test will enable us to examine a newspaper acquisition of Channel 5 with a view to ensuring that a minimum level of plurality is maintained. The test will also address the need for a plurality of owners, a wide range of high quality broadcasting calculated to appeal to a wide range of tastes and interests, and a genuine commitment to Ofcom's standards code.
<P>

<a name="30708-08_para4"></a>There is also a power for Ofcom to review the Channel 5 licence when it changes hands and, if necessary, impose new licence conditions on the new licence holder, if the change is thought to be prejudicial to aspects of the service. There are rules in place that will prevent an unreasonable amount of cross-promotion, which will be regulated by Ofcom and the OFT. For example, the cross-promotion of other television channels and programmes is not allowed to cause annoyance to viewers, and licensees for Channels 3, 4 and 5 are not permitted to promote multi-channel platform service operators such as the Sky platform.
<P>

<a name="30708-08_para5"></a>If, at some point in the future, the regulator believed that the cross-promotion rules in place were no longer relevant, Ofcom would be able, with consultation, to change the rules on cross-promotion. The noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, implied that the big beasts would work their way around content regulations with armies of lawyers. Big companies always look for the greatest commercial advantage in any rules-based system, but there is also the possibility, which the noble Lord apparently rules out, that a large company, having been examined by the Competition Commission, might be suitable. It might be a good thing. As I said, the Joint Scrutiny Committee did not rule that out. It suggested that it should and could be properly decided through competition law, strengthened by the plurality test.
<P>


<a name="column_153"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 153</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30708-08_para6"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Crickhowell and Lord Pilkington of Oxenford, in particular, addressed the issue of the role of Ministers. The test involves three independent regulators: Ofcom, the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission. They are not, as the noble Lord, Lord McNally, alleges, untested regulators. The OFT has been running for more than 30 years, and the Competition Commission has run for about 30 years too. They are all independent bodies commanding respect, and I do not care to hear them called "untested".
<P>

<a name="30708-08_para7"></a>The whole point about the public interest merger test is that it is for those independent regulators to make recommendations. It is for Ministers to make decisions. Does anybody seriously think that, if the independent regulators said, having regard to the provisions of the plurality test contained in Amendment No. 85, which we have yet to debate, that a Minister had flouted their advice and had done so for the base reasons suggested by several noble Lords&#151;it is legitimate to criticise Ministers and ascribe base reasons to them&#151;that Minister would get away with it? Of course not.
<P>

<a name="30708-08_para8"></a>I propose to the House that we should address the issue of cross-media ownership and plurality on the basis of principle, not of levity and ad hominem arguments about Australian-American moguls. We would do ourselves credit if we gave proper prominence to the rule of law in this country and avoided the kind of temporary political advantage proposed in the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30708-08_time0"></a><H5>4.15 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-08_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, I suppose that we all respond to difficult situations in different ways. I often say that, perhaps, I do so with a little too much levity. Others respond by speaking louder and using a little bombast. It is a matter of choice. The more I listened to the Minister, the more I thought of the phrase:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The louder he talked of his honour, the faster we counted our spoons".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-08_para9"></a><P>

<a name="30708-08_para10"></a>I spent a long time on the Bill, and I was proud to have the noble Lords, Lord Crickhowell, Lord Sheldon, Lord Gordon of Strathblane, Lord Peyton of Yeovil and Lord Pilkington of Oxenford, the noble Baroness, Lady Cohen of Pimlico, and my noble friends Lord Maclennan of Rogart and Lord Phillips of Sudbury with me today. I may be frivolous, but they are not. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, that it is not some wonderful thing that, at Third Reading, a Labour government should propose concessions on plurality. I would have expected a Labour government to have had such a test as the flagship of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30708-08_para11"></a>As for my attack on Mr Murdoch, the noble Lord, Lord Sheldon, put his finger on it. He mentioned the matter a week or so ago at a seminar. The Rubicon was crossed when Tony Blair travelled halfway round the world to address a News International conference. There are concerns about the close links between the media and politics not only in Britain or Europe, but around the world. In the 1930s, we were afraid that the fascists would take over the government and then control the press: in the 21st century, there may be a <P>


<a name="column_154"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 154</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>danger that the fascists will take control of the press and then control the government. The dangers are there.
<P>

<a name="30708-08_para12"></a>We talked about Mr Murdoch: OK, let us take Mr Murdoch. The Columbia Journalism Review said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Rupert Murdoch's Fox is leading the charge on the station ownership issue . . .  Murdoch is threatening to fold the Post"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-08_para13"></a>
the New York Post&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"if the FCC doesn't bend the rules to allow him (over media activists' objections) to own those two TV stations and a newspaper in the same city".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-08_para14"></a>
The Guardian, reporting from Australia, said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Rupert Murdoch's business ambitions in his home country have been thwarted after the Australian senate passed a bill limiting cross-media ownership yesterday . . .  'That final amendment . . .  is a dagger through the heart of cross-media reform,' said communications minister Richard Alston. 'We'll send it back to the [house of representatives]. I'm sure they'll make some changes, including the removal of Senator Harradine's amendment, and we'll see where we go from there.' . . .  The government controls the lower house and the bill is expected to go through another senate vote this year as the government maintains pressure on an upper house it feels is blocking too much legislation",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-08_para15"></a>
The indignation shown by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, in his desire to defend Mr Murdoch runs in the face of 20 years' experience.
<P>

<a name="30708-08_para16"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, said that, at some time, Channel 5 might be in such dire straits that we might have to bend the rules a little to save it. That is how Mr Murdoch got The Times; that is how he got his satellite television monopoly. We must not consider the amendment as an alternative to the plurality test. I am delighted at the plurality test. I welcome not only the plurality test but the many other amendments that the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, with principle and great skill, has managed to insert. However, that better Bill needs the amendment. For all the talk from the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, about future proofing, the 20:20 arrangements are in for Channel 3 and ITN. They must be in for Channel 5 because there is a clear and present danger that there will be a call to bring Channel 5 into cross-media ownership. That would be dangerous for our democracy and damaging to other parts of our media.
<P>

<a name="30708-08_para17"></a>I shall say one more thing. My noble friend Lord Maclennan of Rogart mentioned another place. Some 126 Members of another place signed an Early Day Motion in support of the amendment at an earlier stage of the Bill's passage. The proposer of that Early Day Motion, Mr John Grogan MP, who was himself a member of our committee, was quoted in the Independent as follows:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I was frustrated that we did not get a chance to debate and vote on this in the Commons. If the Lords knock it back, then we will have a chance and there will be quite a rebellion".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-08_para18"></a>
That has not been discussed, but this belt and braces amendment is needed. I hope that the Minister will bring forward those plurality clauses, which will be a great tribute to the Bill. The clear and present danger that exists with regard to Channel 5 justifies this amendment, and I urge noble Lords on all Benches to join me in the Contents Lobby today.

<P>
<A NAME="30708-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey </B>   moved Amendment No. 2:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 3, line 23, after "a" insert "sufficient"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-09_para0"></a><P>

<a name="30708-09_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 2, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 83 to 116, 118, 120, 121, 132 to 136 and 148. I made clear on Report that I intended to bring forward amendments at Third Reading to introduce a media plurality test. I have now done so and the amendments are before us. These amendments will introduce an additional level of protection to plurality by extending the public interest test in the Enterprise Act to enable a media plurality test to be carried out in the event of a qualifying media merger. A qualifying merger is one where enterprises cease to be distinct and either the UK turnover of the acquired enterprise exceeds £70 million or the new entity has at least a 25 per cent share of supply of goods or services of any description in the United Kingdom or in a substantial part of the United Kingdom. We shall also be able to look at a qualifying merger where an existing share of 25 per cent or more changes hands.
<P>

<a name="30708-09_para2"></a>By extending the scope of the Enterprise Act so that qualifying mergers could be subject to a media plurality test, the Secretary of State will be able to intervene where she believes a merger would have a damaging effect on plurality. In principle, all media mergers, including cross-media mergers, can be subject to a media plurality test. However, we intend as a matter of policy normally to apply the test in practice to those areas only where the current rules are being removed completely. That would mean that usually the Secretary of State would consider intervening on plurality grounds only in the following areas: national newspapers with more than 20 per cent of the market/Channel 5; national newspapers with more than 20 per cent of the market/national radio service; Channel 3; Channel 3/national radio; Channel 5/national radio; and national radio/national radio.
<P>

<a name="30708-09_para3"></a>As I explained on Report, we do not believe that it would normally be desirable or sensible to intervene and apply the test to areas where there have never been media ownership restrictions or to areas where there <P>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 158</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>continue to be ownership rules, as the continuing rules will protect plurality. In order to give the media industry some degree of certainty, the Government will publish guidance setting out in more detail the areas where the Secretary of State is likely to consider intervening on media plurality grounds. Guidance obviously cannot fetter the Secretary of State's discretion and we would not rule out its wider use in an extreme and rare case.
<P>

<a name="30708-09_para4"></a>The test will ensure that the Secretary of State can ask Ofcom and, if necessary, the Competition Commission to investigate any merger which threatened plurality. It will prevent unacceptable levels of cross-media dominance and ensure a minimum level of plurality. The media plurality test would sit alongside the special&#151; page 26 of the brief is missing. I had to be caught out some time. Thank you; it is missing in this version too. I shall correct any self-evident errors&#151;or perhaps not. With real apologies, I shall start that sentence again.
<P>

<a name="30708-09_para5"></a>The media plurality test would sit alongside the special newspaper public interest test, which would continue to consider newspaper-only mergers. So it is a rather important page. The plurality provisions will be brought into force before or at the same time as the lifting of restrictions on media ownership contained in the Bill. The Secretary of State's powers of intervention under Sections 59 to 66 of the Enterprise Act will extend to the media plurality provisions.
<P>

<a name="30708-09_para6"></a>I hope that the House will allow me a few minutes to explain the effect of the main provisions set out in these amendments, although to some extent I have done so twice already. Amendment No. 85 inserts a new public interest consideration into Section 58 of the Enterprise Act 2002. It specifies that public interest considerations may be looked at in mergers that satisfy the relevant jurisdictional criteria.
<P>

<a name="30708-09_para7"></a>Under the Enterprise Act, the vast majority of mergers will be considered only under the test of whether they would result in a substantial lessening of competition. However, the legislation also makes provision for intervention by the Secretary of State on specified public interest grounds. Currently, the only specified consideration is national security. Clause 372 specifies new newspaper public interest considerations. This clause adds a new subsection (2)(c) to Section 58 and sets out a public interest consideration that may apply to media and cross-media mergers.
<P>

<a name="30708-09_para8"></a>As a result, the Secretary of State will have the ability to intervene in relation to mergers involving media enterprises and to investigate the impact of the merger on the need, in relation to every different audience in the United Kingdom or in a particular area or locality of the UK, for there to be a sufficient plurality of persons with control of the media enterprises serving that audience; the need for the availability throughout the United Kingdom of a wide range of broadcasting which, taken as a whole, is both of high quality and calculated to appeal to a wide variety of tastes and interests; and the need for persons carrying on media enterprises, and for those with control of such enterprises, to have a genuine <P>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 159</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>commitment to the attainment in relation to broadcasting of the standards objectives set out in Section 315 of the Bill. I commend these amendments to the House. I beg to move Amendment No. 2.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-10_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   My Lords, I should like to press the Minister on several points concerning the scope and purpose of his amendments. On Report, the Minister set out clear boundaries to the Government's intended plurality test. In particular, he stated that it would be,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a matter of policy normally to apply the test in practice to those areas where the current rules are being removed completely".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-10_para0"></a><P>

<a name="30708-10_para1"></a>In addition, he added&#151;which he added again today&#151;that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"usually, the Secretary of State would consider intervening",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-10_para2"></a>
only in the following areas:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"national newspapers with more than 20 per cent of the market/Channel 5; national newspapers with more than 20 per cent of the market/national radio service, Channel 3; Channel 3/national radio; Channel 5/national radio; and national radio/national radio".&#151;[Official Report, 2/7/03; col. 915.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-10_para3"></a><P>

<a name="30708-10_para4"></a>This clearly stated approach to the plurality test reflects the key concerns expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, and others throughout the passage of the Bill and in the pre-legislative scrutiny process. That is a concern over a liberalisation of the cross-ownership provisions for Channel 5&#151;as we have heard today&#151;as well as the prospect of investment by non-EEA companies in UK media companies in Channels 3 and 5 (and UK radio).
<P>

<a name="30708-10_para5"></a>I am concerned therefore that it is not just these carefully targeted policy aims that are reflected in these amendments. Instead, having considered the amendments, it appears that the Government are presenting us with a plurality test which could be applied to all "merger situations" involving broadcasters or broadcasters and newspapers which qualify for investigation under the Enterprise Act 2002. It could also apply to transactions that initially may not qualify for investigation, but concerning which the Government's amendment to Clause 375 would permit an intervention notice to be served. Such transactions would include mergers and acquisitions among cable and satellite channels that have launched in the UK without any of the special privileges or protections given to those broadcasters using scarce, analogue terrestrial frequencies, and which have not had any special media ownership rules applied to them previously. Examples, of which there are almost limitless permutations, might include the acquisition of the National Geographic Channel or History Channel by Discovery Networks, the acquisition of additional music video channels by MTV or the purchase of one channel provider by another&#151;for example Flextech Television and Turner.
<P>

<a name="30708-10_para6"></a>The provision represents a major shift in government communications policy and as the Government are aware it is of significant concern to all broadcasters, who now face another regulatory barrier and greater uncertainty. I should like to remind your Lordships of the comments of the broadcasting <P>


<a name="column_160"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 160</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Minister during the Committee stage of the Bill in another place. The Minister said that the problem with the plurality plus competition test was that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it inevitably leads to uncertainty . . .  Although businesses may be used to dealing with uncertainty daily, they do not actively seek out uncertainty. We should make clear rules where appropriate. If we accepted the amendment"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-10_para7"></a>
that is not the amendment proposed today, but one proposed in another place&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"we would effectively be putting those who wanted to acquire media assets in a worse position. In addition to complying with the clear and transparent ownership rules and satisfying the competition authorities, an owner would face the further obstacle of satisfying a plurality test. The Bill is intended to remove regulations, not to impose new and unnecessary ones".&#151;[Official Report, Commons Standing Committee E, 6/2/03; cols. 1002-04.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-10_para8"></a><P>

<a name="30708-10_para9"></a>I recognise that the Government have subsequently introduced amendments into your Lordships' House as a compromise. I also recognise that the Minister said on Report&#151;and has confirmed today&#151;that guidance would be produced to clarify the provisions and narrowly to define the scope of the plurality test. However, we are concerned that nothing has been produced yet. It is creating disquiet in the industry and on the part of the Opposition that such wide provisions are being introduced with the promise of guidance to come once the Bill has received Royal Assent.
<P>

<a name="30708-10_para10"></a>In the absence of such guidance I should be grateful if the Minister would provide further clarification. Why have the Government gone to the trouble of including all broadcasters in the plurality test, only to produce guidance to exclude most of them from it? Surely a better solution would have been to amend Clause 373 to narrow the target of the plurality test in the first instance to Channel 3, Channel 5 and radio; that is, the scarce analogue terrestrial frequency services, which have been the source of the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, and others about non-EEA and cross-media ownership all along.
<P>

<a name="30708-10_para11"></a>I should also be grateful if the Minister would explain the status of the guidance to be produced, and why this has not been made available at the same time as the amendments to the Bill. After all, if a key feature of the plurality test is that it is to be narrowly applied by the guidance, so as give broadcasters confidence and clarity, it naturally follows that the two must be considered hand in hand. How are we to decide on the merits of the amendments when they represent only half the story? Such guidance is unlikely to have the same legal force as the provisions in the Bill, so the certainty that could be derived from it is likely to be limited.
<P>

<a name="30708-10_para12"></a>I should be grateful if the Minister could clarify the Government's intentions towards the existing 20:20 ownership rule governing Channel 3 licences in the light of the new plurality test. As the Minister said on Report, the 20:20 rule has something of a cliff-edge element to it, with the plurality test allowing "finer judgments" to be made in particular cases according to circumstances. Given that it is his stated intention to apply the plurality test in this particular case and, in <P>


<a name="column_161"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 161</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>addition, only where the current rules are being removed completely, it would follow that the 20:20 rule should be abolished.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Fowler: </B>   My Lords, I also have one or two concerns and shall speak briefly. I agree with the Minister that it would have been much more useful had we been able to debate this set of amendments prior to our debate on Channel 5. There is no question that it might have illuminated that debate.
<P>

<a name="30708-10_para13"></a>Having read not only the clauses and the amendments, but the Minister's letter, I think this is a useful addition and I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, on achieving it. However, I do not think that it answers some of the concerns relating to the Bill, in particular, those relating to the rules on foreign ownership that we were debating under the first set of amendments. It seems to me that it is not intended to do so.
<P>

<a name="30708-10_para14"></a>I am not clear why the Minister was so upset with the noble Lord, Lord McNally, for mentioning the report in the Financial Times. It seemed to me that that report was relevant to this debate. It said that senior officials of his department insisted that the amendment would not hamper the principle of allowing United States' media groups to bid for ITV or enabling newspaper publishers to seek control of Channel 5. I know that the Government are rather concerned about sources at the moment, but there is no dispute about the source in that case. Senior officials have told the Financial Times that that is the issue, and as far as I know the department have done nothing to correct that.
<P>

<a name="30708-10_para15"></a>I think that we are allowed to be a little sceptical about some aspects of the Bill. At the end of the day, the decision will rest with the Secretary of State&#151;there is no question about that. The Minister's letter to the Front Bench leaders said that the provision enables the Secretary of State to intervene in a case. It does enable, but of course it does not require. At present, we do not all have overwhelming confidence that the Government would intervene in particular circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30708-10_para16"></a>There is no rule set down to deal with a number of the cases that we will be discussing. There is, for example, no rule, such as the one that I have included in an amendment to be debated later, for making reciprocal arrangements a condition if a United States company takes over a British television company. We will debate later whether that rule is right or wrong&#151;I can perhaps predict what the Minister's reply will be&#151;but at least if that rule is in the legislation, we know exactly where we are.
<P>

<a name="30708-10_para17"></a>The Secretary of State is not bound by the advice given. The Minister made much of his contention that no Minister would ever overrule the advice given to him in this area. I am not entirely sure that that is correct. There are examples where the unanimous recommendations of the Office of Fair Trading have been overruled. I remember one instance involving regional newspapers&#151;the Nottingham Evening Post&#151;where the OFT said quite clearly that deal should not go ahead, but it was overruled. It was overruled, as it happens, by the Government of which I was a member. <P>


<a name="column_162"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 162</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I did not agree, but that was the decision. The Minister will say that that example concerns a Conservative Government and that nothing of that kind would ever happen under a Labour Government, but that slightly beggars belief.
<P>

<a name="30708-10_para18"></a>The amendment is a useful addition, but I do not think that we should place too much emphasis on it. Personally, I welcome what has been done and what the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, has achieved, but I give only two cheers for the final version of the amendment.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo030708/text/30708-11.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Puttnam: </B>   My Lords, I offer the Government two and a half cheers. They are to be congratulated. An enormous amount of work has gone into making the amendment possible. I would personally like to thank Paula Carter, who has helped me enormously, and the Bill team, who have done Trojan work. I am not sure that they will thank me for thanking them, but they have done an extraordinary job in hammering through what is in some senses new law. We have come a long way.
<P>

<a name="30708-11_para0"></a>These amendments must be seen as all of a piece with the amendments to the general duties that we have already agreed. Together, those provisions are the double bolts. I have now talked to enough lawyers and judges, who have assured me that those two aspects of the Bill, taken together, represent a very serious impediment to the type of dominance that the clause is intended to prevent.
<P>

<a name="30708-11_para1"></a>That is one thing. I come to the other issue. Several noble Lords mentioned the Financial Times article. The last Division went as it did&#151;but I have to tell the Government that I believe that the Division was quite avoidable. It was caused by a misbriefing given to the Financial Times last week, which gave the impression for whatever reason that the amendment might not bite as the Government intended, or as the proposers of the amendment intended. That could have been avoided.
<P>

<a name="30708-11_para2"></a>I beg the Government to do two things. First, I ask them not to be tempted by the wish expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, to restrict the breadth of what has been created. That breadth is very important. Secondly, they should make it very clear, and not only in this Chamber but outside, that they have taken a big step in a very important direction and are intent on giving the noble Lord, Lord Currie, all the powers and all the encouragement to take the route that the House has clearly indicated.
<P>

<a name="30708-11_para3"></a>There is real fear about media dominance. The Government have come a long way in accepting those fears, which have been made apparent today by the comparative narrowness of the previous Division. However, I look for some form of assurance that we will not be battered next week by the type of Commons amendments that would undermine much of the good work achieved in this House over the past weeks and months. I welcome the amendment gratefully.
<P>


<a name="column_163"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 163</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-11_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   My Lords, I hope that the noble Lord will forgive me. We have had pretty little time to get used to these wonderful new amendments, but I welcome them. I have actually read them but, if I have not understood them thoroughly, I apologise in advance.
<P>

<a name="30708-11_para4"></a>I want to return to the point that I made earlier, which the Minister, perhaps rightly, did not answer in the earlier debate. With all the tests that will be applied, we come back to the point that it will be a Minister who makes the decision, although admittedly advised by Ofcom. With regard to both the content and the technology aspects&#151;and particularly the content aspect&#151;I am concerned that there will be more than an assumption that the Secretary of State at the DCMS will also be consulted. I am certain that Ofcom will consider both sides of the question; we have been told often enough that that is its intention. However, I am concerned that there are often problems when two Ministers are responsible for something. While congratulating the Minister on all the amendments, I should be grateful for an answer to that question.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the amendments and the moderate and temperate tone in which the Minister introduced them. However, I make one point as a genuine seeker after truth. An executive from one of the specialist music stations asked me whether it would be seen as a dangerous accretion of media power if a music station with one per cent of the total audience acquired another music station with one per cent of the total audience, or whether it would be said that the stations had only 2 per cent of the total audience, even if they had a larger share of the music-only stations. I told him that I would put that question to the Minister, and I was sure that he would get an answer.
<P>

<a name="30708-11_para5"></a>The broader question of how far and how real this is a step forward goes to the heart of the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam. The Financial Times article was not an accident. There have been parallel messages coming from the Government: the kind of messages that the Minister has given from the Front Bench here, and the kind of speeches that Mr Kim Howells and officials have made at specialist conferences, which have continued to emphasise that this is the freewheeling, free enterprise, deregulatory Bill that was so carefully crafted in Downing Street all those months ago.
<P>

<a name="30708-11_para6"></a>It has also been irritating to hear the continual message that Parliament has somehow interfered in this perfect process. I went to a seminar organised by the ever-industrious the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, where the noble Lord and an official combined to lecture the assembled attendees, some of whom had more political experience than both of them put together, about the realities of legislating. One reality of legislating for me is that Parliament does matter and governments should listen.
<P>


<a name="column_164"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 164</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30708-11_para7"></a>I was very worried when Mr Stephen Carter was reported as showing a certain tetchiness about the way in which Parliament was messing about with the Bill. I asked for the text of his speech, and was pleased to read that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"as a creature of statute Ofcom will deliver to whatever rulebook it inherits from Parliament".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-11_para8"></a>
Quite so.
<P>

<a name="30708-11_para9"></a>Sometimes when we are discussing civics education, I think that it might be worth applying it to some civil and public servants, to show them where the relative balance lies between their powers and Parliament's powers. We do not want to see some carefully crafted briefing, 48 hours after the Bill has left this place, saying, "Don't worry, all those silly old people are now out of the way and we can march on to the new land".
<P>

<a name="30708-11_para10"></a>The Minister has made a great to-do about how powerful the test is, and we want to make sure that it works. I am not making any predictions. However, Mr Murdoch will come calling, believe me, because it fits into his strategy and his pattern. The noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, should know that when he comes calling he never plays just by the rules. As he did in New York, he will threaten to close down The Times if he does not get his way, or he will have some other blockbuster to intimidate Ministers.
<P>

<a name="30708-11_para11"></a>The issue is a lot tougher than the Minister implied, but the amendments are welcome, as long as the Minister lives up to his promises and the public servants who are get the rulebooks from Parliament live up to them too.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   My Lords, I want briefly to ask the Minister whether I heard him correctly when he referred to the possibility of the director of Ofcom imposing conditions in relation to matters dealt with by Amendment No. 85. Is that the case? If so, is the Minister concerned by some of the precedents for the imposition of conditions attached to newspaper takeovers in the past, which it would be fair to say have been ineffectual in practice?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-11_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the welcoming and moderate tone of the debate. I must say a word to the noble Lord, Lord McNally. He accused me of shouting, and maybe I did. He made a debating speech and I made one in reply, but I did not at any stage question the sincerity behind his speech. Of course, I know that he feels strongly about these matters, and always has. I simply did not like the way in which he introduced his amendments, and I said so.
<P>

<a name="30708-11_para12"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, started by asking why we did not specify a narrow test in the Bill&#151;why we went for a wide test and then imposed restrictions on it. We considered a narrow test but decided on balance that we could get to substantially the same place through taking a wide power and limiting its general application as set out in guidance.
<P>


<a name="column_165"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 165</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30708-11_para13"></a>In exceptional circumstances&#151;I think that I used the phrase "extreme and rare circumstances"&#151;we might want to apply the test more widely if there were genuine plurality concerns. This approach allows us to do so. However, we recognise that the share of supply of goods or services in the United Kingdom&#151;or a substantial part of the United Kingdom in the case of a relevant merger situation&#151;or when one of the parties has an existing share of a supply of broadcasting of at least 25 per cent, could cause the Secretary of State to decide to intervene. We intend generally to intervene only in those areas where we have removed all ownership rules. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that in exceptional circumstances we will look at other orders. Nevertheless, I think that we have diminished uncertainty as far as possible by setting out in my speech all of those relationships which we expect to be covered. I think that that deals with the point that the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, raised about uncertainty.
<P>

<a name="30708-11_para14"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, then went on to quote points made in the House of Commons. I do not know how to respond to that. We have responded to debate in this House. We have responded to debate over a period of something like three months now. The fact that we have responded late in the day means that we have been concerned and worrying about it. We have certainly been doing that, as the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, recognised. I hope that if I am offered the choice of being charged with introducing amendments late and charged with being inflexible, I will accept the charge of tabling amendments late rather than of being inflexible. That means&#151;the noble Baroness asked about guidance&#151;that guidance cannot be produced in time. We cannot produce guidance simultaneously with approximately 44 complex amendments, which is what we have done.
<P>

<a name="30708-11_para15"></a>The noble Baroness asked particularly about satellite and cable channels. Although we do not think that there is normally an issue of plurality test there, we could see plurality tests applying in some rare cases if a large number of news or educational channels would be coming under single control. I do not know what that means as regards the question that the noble Lord, Lord McNally, asked about music channels. I take it that he is talking about what I call "serious music channels" with a small share of the market.

<P>

<A NAME="30708-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   No, my Lords. On cable television there may be four or five specialist music channels playing various kinds of pop. If one channel took over another, its share would increase from 20 per cent to 40 per cent of the channels. Would that worry or trigger any of this legislation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I would be very surprised if it would. As I have just been saying, cable and satellite channels are not currently regulated and we would not expect them to raise questions of plurality. However, if someone were to take over all the music channels, I think that the "extreme and rare" case to which I referred might well come into force.

<a name="30708-12_para0"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, referred to the issue of the 20 per cent rule. I think that the point about these amendments in departing from the 20 per cent rule is that it is possible that someone with 19 per cent of the national newspaper market might raise plurality concerns, which is why we did not want cliff-edge regulation. The provision would enable Ministers to distinguish those with larger holdings in the event that the 20 per cent rule was removed. We do not have any plans to remove it, but a well-established plurality test may make removing it a possibility in the future.
<P>

<a name="30708-12_para1"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Fowler, Lord Puttnam and Lord McNally, all referred to the Financial Times article, which of course I read. However, I have to say that I and the members of the Bill team do not know who the unnamed source was. Whether anyone is briefing against us, I do not know; it is not a matter on which I can comment. However, on the substance of the article, if the Bill is passed as it stands, yes, investment from non-EEA sources will be possible. However, although the plurality test will allow foreign investments to be made, if necessary they will be considered by the Competition Commission on a case-by-case basis. If they raise concerns, those cases can be targeted. If those concerns are found to be justified, those cases could be blocked. That is the point that we were making last week in the foreign ownership debate.
<P>

<a name="30708-12_para2"></a>I should like to say to the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, how grateful I am to him for his continued involvement in debate on this issue, at any rate over the time that I have been involved in the Bill's passage. I think that he carries a great deal of the credit for what is widely accepted as being improvements to the Bill. I pay tribute to him for what he has done. I agree with him that we need to get the general duties right so that they work with the spirit of the Bill. However, I can confirm that, pending that which has to be done in another place, this amendment, if we agree to it today, is in black and white. It clearly bites right across the range. The Government have taken a big step. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, for giving encouragement to the noble Lord, Lord Currie, in the way that he carries out the Bill's provisions.
<P>

<a name="30708-12_para3"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, asked which Secretary of State would be involved. In legislation there is only one Secretary of State. The legislation applies regardless of whether the Department of Trade and Industry or the Department for Culture, Media and Sport is abolished. There will still be a Secretary of State who is responsible for carrying out the law. I do not think that she should place any significance on the fact that the Secretary of State currently responsible for competition policy is the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, and certainly not on the personalities concerned. However, in so far as there are two Secretaries of State involved in these issues, they will, as they have been doing, work closely on the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30708-12_para4"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, asked about precedents for conditions under the newspaper merger regime. There certainly have been headline cases where conditions have been thought to be ineffectual. <P>


<a name="column_167"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 167</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>However, there are many other cases where they appear to have worked well. Generally, we think that undertakings will be given effect to in broadcasting licences, which are readily enforceable, as I think is well recognised. Of course newspapers are not licensed, and for newspapers a merger can always be prohibited.
<P>

<a name="30708-12_para5"></a>I hope that that deals with the points raised in debate.

<a name="30708-12_para7"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
(a) the principles under which regulatory activities should be transparent, accountable, proportionate, consistent and targeted only at cases in which action is needed; and
<br>
(b) any other principles appearing to OFCOM to represent the best regulatory practice.
<br>
(4A) OFCOM must also have regard, in performing those duties"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30708-12_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving this amendment I shall also speak to government Amendments Nos. 6, 7, 81 and 82.
<P>

<a name="30708-12_para9"></a>We have been clear that Ofcom will be a good regulator. As we are giving it strong powers, that is only right. It is important that as Ofcom carries out its functions the principles of good regulatory practice should apply. We have listened to the concerns vigorously expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, that the provisions in Clause 3(4)(b) and (d) were not sufficiently robust to ensure that the principles applied when they should. We have therefore brought forward amendments to address the concerns that she expressed on that occasion.
<P>

<a name="30708-12_para10"></a>We agree with the noble Baroness that the principles of good regulatory practice must always be relevant to Ofcom's decision-making and that Ofcom should apply those principles uniformly. There is to that extent a shade of difference between the application of good regulatory practice and the other matters to which Ofcom should have regard under Clause 3(4). Good regulatory practice is always relevant. The other matters may or may not be relevant in particular circumstances or in particular cases. We are happy to reflect that shade of difference through the structure of the clause.
<P>

<a name="30708-12_para11"></a>The amendments retain the current drafting that Ofcom will have regard to the principles. It may be helpful if I explain why that is the right approach. For a person or a body to have regard to a matter when taking specified action is a substantial legal obligation. If they fail to have regard to the matter in deciding what action to take, or whether to take action, or have regard to it in the wrong way, the action which is taken is liable to be held by a court to be unlawful or legally ineffective. It will not be sufficient for Ofcom to consider the principles of regulatory practice for the sake of form only or to consider and reject them for no good reason.
<P>

<P>

<a name="30708-12_para12"></a>I hope that I have assured the noble Baroness that the phrase "have regard to" is a significant legal phrase and obligation and tightens up the inevitable obligations upon Ofcom. Good regulatory practice should be a consistent and central tenet in Ofcom's operations. I believe these amendments ensure that it will be. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-12_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for responding to our concerns which we raised throughout our debates, beginning with Second Reading, in relation to good regulatory practice. The Minister knows that we have always been concerned about the expression "must have regard". Therefore we are extremely pleased that the Minister listened to our concerns and brought forward these amendments. They are not quite the amendments that we would have liked but I am grateful that the Minister read almost verbatim from a letter addressed to myself dated 30th June which reassured me that we are talking about a substantial legal obligation. I am grateful to the Minister for that. We welcome the amendments.

<P>

<a name="30708-12_para16"></a>We debated in Committee, and on Report, earlier amendments tabled by the noble Lord which the Government found they could not accept, but I made it clear that we supported the spirit behind the amendments because the Bill aims to secure the future of public service broadcasting in this country.
<P>

<a name="30708-12_para17"></a>We now have revised duties for Ofcom and I must say that the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, skilfully responded both to the Government's reservations and those expressed by noble Lords in earlier debates, as well as to the other changes to Clause 3, in bringing forward his revised amendment.
<P>

<a name="30708-12_para18"></a>I have argued previously that it was undesirable to refer to public service broadcasting in Clause 3, given the detailed regime established in Part 3 of the Bill, but the proposal of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, fits very neatly in the new structure of Clause 3 and much improves it. The Government are grateful to the noble Lord for the tenacity with which he pursued his aim.
<P>

<P>
<A NAME="30708-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   My Lords, I am extremely grateful to the Government and to the Minister for in effect accepting the amendment which, as the Minister rightly says, was pressed strongly not only by myself but also in particular by those whose names were attached to the amendment: the noble Baronesses, Lady O'Neill and Lady Howe, my noble friend Lord McNally and the noble Lord, Lord Fowler. In Committee there was an hour long debate on the matter. I am sure that everyone will be extremely content that what must be by any reckoning the most single important non-economic factor linking into Clauses 262 and 263, as they now are, is written into the keynote clause of the Bill. I am grateful for that.
<P>

<a name="30708-13_para0"></a>At Second Reading I mentioned that I felt that commercial strains fell heavily on producers and programme makers in commercial television. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Birt, added his own gloomy prognostication to that theme. I gave as an example my local television company, Anglia, which I know and with which I have worked closely for many years, and was perhaps a little unfair to it in that it has done better than some other commercial television companies in relation to what one might call the public broadcasting remit or standards.
<P>

<a name="30708-13_para1"></a>I know that good programme makers and producers, of whom there are very many in the commercial sector, will welcome this entrenchment of the public service broadcasting remit in Clause 3 as it will strengthen their hand when the going gets a bit rough. That is all I need to say. Later we shall deal with an amendment to the enforcement clause, which is now Clause 268, and there will be more to say then. In the mean time I am most grateful to those who supported this long campaign and to the Government and the Minister for concurring. I beg leave to&#151;no, I do not do anything, do I?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Fowler: </B>   My Lords, not yet. I wish to add to what the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, said. This is an important amendment. I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, on his persistence with it. I congratulate the Government on accepting it. Personally, I prefer the wording of the amendment as it stands now without the Government's amendment, but we shall not argue about that because the Minister has given way.
<P>

<a name="30708-13_para2"></a>As has been said, public service broadcasting is not just about the BBC, but the dispute between the BBC and the Government is being used to attack the very concept of public service broadcasting in this country. It is argued that there are other options: government controlled radio and television making no pretence to <P>


<a name="column_170"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 170</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be other than the Government's mouthpiece or the kind of marginal public service broadcasting that exists in the United States.
<P>

<a name="30708-13_para3"></a>My own view is that the standards of public service broadcasting are so demonstrably superior to any of those other brands that it is something that we should fight very hard to preserve in this country. In that respect the Government have been entirely right in putting that at the head of the Bill. Perhaps one might add in parenthesis that one hopes that the tabling of this amendment by the Government might mark an end to the rather futile warfare between the Government and the BBC at the moment. It would be in everyone's interest if that were to take place. I shall not go further down that particular road, but I congratulate the Government on underlining their belief in public service broadcasting.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-13_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   My Lords, as one who has put my name to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, on many occasions, as he acknowledged, I, too, congratulate the Government. I also particularly congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, on his persistence. The measure will give considerable reassurance to many organisations. I mention especially the Voice of the Viewer and Listener and Public Voice, representatives of which have written many times to your Lordships throughout the Bill's passage. Indeed, many individual citizens have let us know how deeply concerned they are to preserve that unique quality of British broadcasting which they consider is crucially embedded in public service requirements.
<P>

<a name="30708-13_para4"></a>As has already been said, British public service broadcasting is the bench-mark not just for British terrestrial channels but for all broadcasters who wish to compete for our viewing time. Again, I congratulate all concerned and particularly the wider public who made us aware of their views.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-13_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness O'Neill of Bengarve: </B>   My Lords, I shall not spin this debate out, but I should like to ask the Minister what are the reasons for the restriction of Amendment No. 4 for the purposes of public service television broadcasting. That is the substantive difference between the government amendment and that of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips. So far, I have failed to understand the reason for that restriction.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-13_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I shall not talk about public service radio&#151;that is effectively the BBC, and its purposes are set out and secured through the BBC Charter and Agreement rather than in the Bill. When we talk about public service television, we are talking about a wide range of channels, but public service radio is the remit of the BBC. That is why Amendment No. 4 is expressed in these terms. I accordingly commend it to the House.

<a name="30708-13_para11"></a><P>

<a name="30708-13_para12"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the House will recall that the words in brackets in Clause 16(5) which my amendment seeks to remove are the words inserted by the Government on 15th May in Committee into what was then Clause 15(5), dealing with areas which should be subject to consultation by the consumer panel.
<P>

<a name="30708-13_para13"></a>The purpose of the government amendment was, according to the Minister,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to give the consumer panel the power to consider matters of content which are referred to it by Ofcom".&#151;[Official Report, 15/5/03; col. 357.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-13_para14"></a>
The Minister said that these would be matters that had a "high consumer dimension", and misleading advertising was cited as an example.
<P>

<a name="30708-13_para15"></a>Your Lordships will recall that we debated the issue again on the second day of Report, on 26th June, in relation to Amendment No. 33. The aim of my amendment then was to remove the words in brackets, and thus return to the clarity of remit previously given to the consumer panel. It was identical to the amendment that I am moving now.
<P>

<a name="30708-13_para16"></a>My amendment reflects concerns expressed to me by content providers and the advertising industry throughout the progress of the Bill in this House about the potential for overlap between the consumer panel and the content board, and the need for clearly defined boundaries between the two.
<P>

<a name="30708-13_para17"></a>The Government gave some reassurance at Report stage on 26th June that the consumer panel would not have free rein to advise on content, and that it could do so only when asked by Ofcom. That was helpful, but I do not believe that it goes far enough. It is essential, going forwards, to have clarity between the functions of the regulatory and advisory bodies. Otherwise, the whole purpose of creating a single regulator&#151;to develop a common regulatory approach across the communications sector and to avoid regulatory overlap&#151;will have been pointless.
<P>

<a name="30708-13_para18"></a>The Minister also referred to the fact that that has been government policy since the White Paper. Yes, that is true&#151;but have not the Government developed the remit of the content board since then; and is it not true that Ofcom is required to carry out research on public opinion and the experience of consumers in accordance with Clause 14 of the Bill? Surely that should be sufficient to ensure that Ofcom's policy on content issues takes full account of wide consumer concern.
<P>


<a name="column_172"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 172</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30708-13_para19"></a>The Government said that the wording that they added in Committee was merely to correct a disparity between what is now Clause 16(5) and Clause 16(6)(c). I believe that it goes further than that. My reading of the Bill is that there is no disparity in the meaning of the respective clauses if the words in brackets in Clause 16(5)&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"other than one referred to them for advice by OFCOM"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-13_para20"></a>
are taken out. It then means that the consumer panel can give advice to Ofcom in relation to any matter except content, which is specifically excluded under Clause 16(5). However, if the words in brackets are left in Clause 16(5), this would nullify the specific exclusion created for content by that clause. In other words, the opposite effect is achieved.
<P>

<a name="30708-13_para21"></a>In conclusion, my amendment seeks to address the concern that I know still exists among content providers in the advertising industry that there should be complete clarity and avoidance of overlaps between the consumer panel and the content board. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-13_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Thomson of Monifieth: </B>   My Lords, I support the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, in her amendment. The noble Baroness described succinctly the previous discussions that have taken place on this matter. I share her desire as regards the value of achieving certainty over the frontier between the responsibilities of the consumer panel and those of the content board before the Bill finally leaves this House.
<P>

<a name="30708-13_para22"></a>The consumer panel has clear and important responsibilities&#151;there is no question about that. So does the content board. But they are distinctively different. One of the advantages of this mammoth Bill is that it tidies up the landscape of communications and clears the regulatory undergrowth of competing responsibilities.
<P>

<a name="30708-13_para23"></a>Ofcom has a massive task ahead of it dealing with the pressures of conflicting interests, some of them very powerful. Ofcom deserves the maximum of clarity in the Bill that finally completes its passage. It does not deserve having thrust on it the duty of deciding which content matters have such "high consumer dimension" that the content board should be second-guessed by the consumer panel.
<P>

<a name="30708-13_para24"></a>It is a quite unnecessary fudging of the regulatory frontiers. It will confuse the work of the content board and will add a dimension of uncertainty to a regulatory system for television advertising which has a record of working well and which is in the process of development within the new responsibilities of Ofcom.
<P>

<a name="30708-13_para25"></a>It is true, as the Government have previously pointed out, that there was a specific reference in the original policy document relating to the draft Bill to the consumer panel having a say in,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"content issues that have a high consumer dimension, such as rules on misleading advertising".

<FONT SIZE=3>
But the Bill itself permits Ofcom to contract out its functions and to promote "effective" self-regulation. If key areas may be contracted out, leaving Ofcom as a backstop regulator, albeit with teeth, surely we should be careful about giving Ofcom's consumer panel a statutory role, however limited, in content.
<P>

<a name="30708-13_para27"></a>It is no secret in this House after our prolonged discussions that a key area which may be contracted out by Ofcom in the near future, subject to the results of a public consultation, is the regulation of broadcast advertising, using aspects of the ASA system.
<P>

<a name="30708-13_para28"></a>The Bill provides that self-regulation of areas co-ordinated by the Bill must be, first, adequately funded and, secondly, independent of the industry that it regulates. An effective self-regulatory system operating in a co-regulatory framework would surely base policy decisions on input from consumers as well as from the industry. It would surely also ensure that the complaints adjudication process is properly and effectively managed, with published performance indicators.
<P>

<a name="30708-13_para29"></a>If broadcast advertising is contracted out, Ofcom would become the backstop regulator. Would it not be odd in such circumstances for Ofcom to refer advertising content matters to its consumer panel if the self-regulatory system is already using established procedures for taking views from consumers?
<P>

<a name="30708-13_para30"></a>Advertising is but one case, but I believe it demonstrates that we have to be extremely careful, as we move into the new regulatory environment, not to perpetuate the problems created by previous legislation&#151;where, for example, there were overlaps between the ITC and BSC advertising remits which sometimes resulted in conflicting decisions. We are creating a single regulator with the purpose of developing a unified approach to communications policy and we must therefore ensure that we avoid creating overlaps and additional bureaucracy within the regulator and its boards and advisory groups, one of which is the consumer panel.
<P>

<a name="30708-13_para31"></a>The consumer panel is important, but we must avoid two groupings giving conflicting advice. It would be a recipe for confusion and delay to have an advertising self-regulatory system consulting with consumers and relevant interest groups and advertising also being discussed by Ofcom's own consumer panel.

<A NAME="30708-13_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Thomson, is certainly right when he says that we have been round this course before. We have had substantial discussions on these issues as the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, attested when moving the amendment. We have discussed a similar matter at Committee and Report stages. I understood that the amendment had been brought back at Report stage so that the Government would have an opportunity to put on record the details of a letter that my noble friend Lord McIntosh sent to the Advertising Association. The letter assured the industry&#151;I take this opportunity of renewing that assurance&#151;that this provision does not risk double jeopardy and that there is no perception that misleading advertising is a problem. It was not our <P>


<a name="column_174"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 174</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>intention to suggest that it is. I had hoped that our answer on Report gave further reassurance to the industry, although the noble Baroness has renewed her fears on their part again today.
<P>

<a name="30708-13_para32"></a>The consumer panel is an advisory body and has no regulatory powers. The contents board of course is part of the regulatory structure, but the consumer panel is not. The consumer panel will provide another means of advice for Ofcom if Ofcom wants to use it.
<P>

<a name="30708-13_para33"></a>I understand that there is a more fundamental objection to the policy of Ofcom being able to refer matters of content with a high consumer dimension to the consumer panel for advice&#151;please note, for advice, not regulation; not for decision taking, just for advice.
<P>

<a name="30708-13_para34"></a>The principle behind the amendment seems to be at some odds with the will of the Chamber when it gave Ofcom a principal duty to further the interests of consumers and citizens. The joint scrutiny committee was quite clear that it, while recognising that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the interests of the citizen in the nature of broadcast content should first and foremost be represented by the Content Board . . .  nevertheless support the current proposals in the draft Bill whereby certain issues could be examined by the Consumer Panel at the instigation of Ofcom's main Board".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-13_para35"></a>
That is exactly what the Bill says.
<P>

<a name="30708-13_para36"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, said on Report that she wanted to be sure that nothing in the Bill undermines the advertising industry's ability to regulate itself successfully. She has emphasised that point again and as we said on Report we agree with her wholeheartedly, but we do not see how this provision could undermine the Advertising Association's plans for co-regulation. It does not.
<P>

<a name="30708-13_para37"></a>Furthermore, I believe that if we were to deny Ofcom that flexibility we would be doing consumers a great disservice. As my noble friend Lord Evans fully explained on Report, this is not about advertising. There are some&#151;not many&#151;content-related matters, such as the bundling of different channels on pay TV services that could have a high consumer dimension on which Ofcom may need to seek expert consumer advice.
<P>

<a name="30708-13_para38"></a>The consumer panel is best placed to give Ofcom that advice. This is not about blurring the boundaries or muddying the waters, as the noble Lord, Lord Thomson, was suggesting. The content board, within the regulatory structure, is the proper place for matters of content. I believe that we are totally agreed on that point. But on the few issues where there is a high consumer dimension we must not deny Ofcom the flexibility of hearing the consumer voice.
<P>

<a name="30708-13_para39"></a>Responses to the consultation on the draft Bill fell into two fairly distinct camps on this issue. Powerful interests like BSkyB were quite clear that they did not want the consumer panel to be able to advise on content matters referred to them by Ofcom. They were concerned that the consumer panel should have,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"no jurisdiction over content-related issues or the terms on which content services are provided".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-13_para40"></a>
The consumer lobby, in the other camp, wanted the panel to have a much broader remit that allowed it free reign over all of Ofcom's remit, including content. Some, like Channel 5, were supportive of the Government's position that the consumer panel,
<P>


<a name="column_175"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 175</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"should only be required to consider broadcasting/content issues when instructed to do so by Ofcom".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-13_para41"></a>
This is the balance that we have struck between two competing perspectives on this issue. We believe that the balance that we have struck provides certainty for the industry and gives consumers a voice on content matters where Ofcom decides that its advice is relevant. BskyB have nothing to fear. The panel has no jurisdiction over content. Ofcom merely has the ability to seek its advice and we have made it clear that we expect it to do so only when matters of content have a high consumer dimension.
<P>

<a name="30708-13_para42"></a>At Report stage the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, said that she felt the wording that this amendment removes was unnecessary. We introduced the wording to give certainty in respect to our policy which has always been clear throughout the Bill. Clause 16(6)(c) which provides for the panel to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"give advice to Ofcom in relation to any matter referred to the panel by Ofcom for advice",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-13_para43"></a>
is where it is given effect.
<P>

<a name="30708-13_para44"></a>But we were concerned that there was a tension between Clause 16(6)(c) and Clause 16(5). I think that the debates in Committee, on Report, and again today&#151;the noble Baroness has put her case with admirable clarity&#151;have helped us to examine the matter further. It is the Government's intention in drafting the Clause 16(6)(c) that "any matter" would include matters of content where there is a high consumer dimension and where Ofcom chooses to seek advice. I firmly believe that it is in the interests of consumers that this is so. I hope that the noble Baroness at this late stage&#151;we have tried to persuade her on two previous occasions without conspicuous success&#151;will say that we have sought to strike a balance between competing interests in these terms and that we have a provision that will secure the interests of consumers so she will withdraw her amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="30708-14_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his response. He has worked hard today and on previous occasions to allay industry fears. The Minister said that the wording we seek to remove was introduced to give certainty on government policy. Unfortunately, it has done the opposite.
<P>

<a name="30708-14_para0"></a>We have talked ad infinitum to the industry during each stage of the Bill. The advertising industry, in particular, but also content providers remain deeply concerned. As I said on Report, which the Minister was kind enough to repeat, this industry has proved entirely capable of successful self-regulation. We believe that it deserves our whole-hearted support, a matter referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Thomson. I am very grateful to him for his support.
<P>

<a name="30708-14_para1"></a>This is an important issue and one that is causing great concern. It is true that we have been around the course before, but there is still uncertainty and we remain dissatisfied on the matter. Therefore, I wish to test the opinion of the House.

<A NAME="30708-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Randall of St Budeaux </B>   moved Amendment No. 9:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 19, leave out lines 14 to 16 and insert "is not"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-14_para4"></a><P>

<a name="30708-14_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I want to make a short speech because I am dealing with the finance being presented for small to medium enterprises and the telecommunications implications.
<P>

<a name="30708-14_para6"></a>I start by bringing in a few introduction notes. First, the current Act provides satisfactory protection and regulation for SMEs. Secondly, the SME performance is vital for economic reform in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="30708-14_para7"></a>There is deep concern that the Bill will weaken the protection of SMEs in a very serious way. Also, the proposed case is to retain for SMEs the level of standards for SMEs in the current Act.
<P>

<a name="30708-14_para8"></a>I will speak briefly on the perception of SMEs. During the Portuguese presidency of the European Union it was decided that all 15 member states should have a key role in economic reform. The Prime Minister contributed significantly to this, which showed the vital role that SMEs have. Additionally, the DTI has a "think small first" policy and the Better Regulation Task Force. They are very important policies and show the significance of SMEs in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="30708-14_para9"></a>In addition, the Minister for SMEs, Nigel Griffiths MP, paid tribute to Britain's 3.7 million SME businesses, which he said are responsible for generating £1 trillion in our economy and employ 12 million people.
<P>

<a name="30708-14_para10"></a>The good reputation of SMEs in the United Kingdom is now being recognised by other member states in the European Union. It is worrying that the current Act has worked well for SMEs, but the proposed legislation would undoubtedly weaken SME interests as a whole.
<P>

<a name="30708-14_para11"></a>People are asking, why on Earth are we attempting to change the current legislation regarding SMEs when it has worked satisfactorily?
<P>

<a name="30708-14_para12"></a>Those in the SME representative bodies are confused as to why the Government are weakening SMEs by means of their legislation when at the same <P>


<a name="column_179"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 179</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>time the Government have expressed support for SMEs and their important contribution to the UK economy.
<P>

<a name="30708-14_para13"></a>I will briefly explain the main concerns that SMEs and their representative organisations have about the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30708-14_para14"></a>First, they welcome the Bill's consumer panel, which will promote the interests of consumers. A strong consumer panel should act as an effective counterbalance in the interests of industry, particularly large players, and it should provide useful input into regulatory decision making.
<P>

<a name="30708-14_para15"></a>As I have already implied, the proposed consumer panel, which will protect the interests of SMEs, is weaker than the current arrangements in the Act. The Bill describes the consumer panel's role in relation to domestic and small business consumers. In practice, this means that the elements in the relationship between the new consumer panel and SMEs are used in deciding whether SMEs are chosen or rejected when it comes to protection and regulation provided by the consumer panel.
<P>

<a name="30708-14_para16"></a>This is a complicated issue but, briefly, the valuation of SMEs' acceptability by the consumer panel will take into account the following definition points. SMEs, as consumers in the market for services or facilities such as computer systems, would be acceptable provided that neither is a communications provider or a person who makes associated facilities available; or a person who is a consumer in the market in respect of an undertaking carried out by him or for which more than 10 individuals work.
<P>

<a name="30708-14_para17"></a>The consumer panel is therefore being changed so as to protect the interests of SMEs in this country.
<P>

<a name="30708-14_para18"></a>So what are we worried about? This part of the Bill ignores the reality that many SMEs are both consumers&#151;in that they subscribe to a communications provider&#151;and service providers, for example, hardware/software maintenance and retail shops.
<P>

<a name="30708-14_para19"></a>What are the consequences? They are that small businesses with 10 or more employees are highly likely to be consumers of communications services. However, if small businesses are also part of the communications industry, they will not be represented by the very important consumer panel, which is a matter of great concern. This is so even if SMEs have legitimate concerns and interests as consumers of communications services that are totally unrelated to their own products or services.
<P>

<a name="30708-14_para20"></a>I wonder what estimates the DTI has made about the number of exclusions of SMEs arising from the consumer panel. This is an important question for the various representative bodies not just in the UK but in the European Union. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="30708-15_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   My Lords, I support these amendments, but of course I would because we put them down in Committee. I am rather tempted to welcome the noble Lord, Lord Randall of St Budeaux, to the Bill, albeit at a rather late stage. As chairman of <P>


<a name="column_180"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 180</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a project linked to the Small Business Bureau, he is obviously very keen to support the interests of small businesses.
<P>

<a name="30708-15_para0"></a>This is an issue we have spoken to at earlier stages of the Bill. It is an important issue and we very much hope that the Government will be able to respond positively to these amendments today.
<P>

<a name="30708-15_time0"></a><H5>6 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, it is certainly the case that we have discussed these amendments previously and it is a little late in the Bill for such fundamental concepts to re-emerge. We did not have the opportunity of considering them at the Report stage. I will do my best to reply to my noble friend's long list of amendments.
<P>

<a name="30708-15_para1"></a>I shall take Amendments Nos. 10 to 16 together, as their combined effect would be to make the Secretary of State responsible for appointing and removing the members of the consumer panel. As the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, recalled, we discussed this in Committee in response to her amendments. We explained at that time why it was not our intention that appointments to the consumer panel should be made by the Secretary of State and nothing has changed since to alter our view.
<P>

<a name="30708-15_para2"></a>There are two possible models which might be followed in establishing the consumer panel. The first is the approach adopted in the case of Energy Watch and Post Watch&#151;and the other is that followed by the Financial Services Authority.
<P>

<a name="30708-15_para3"></a>Both Energy Watch and Post Watch were established as separate non-departmental public bodies with a separate legal identity and their own secretariats and staff. They each have significant complaint handling responsibilities which the Ofcom consumer panel will not have. As separate bodies, it is appropriate that the appointments to those bodies should be made by the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="30708-15_para4"></a>The model we have followed for establishing the consumer panel is that adopted for the Financial Services Authority where, although the members are appointed by the FSA, albeit with the chairman's appointment subject to the approval of the Treasury, the panel is still able to operate perfectly independently of the FSA itself. We believe this provides a more appropriate model for Ofcom and have presented our arguments to the House on previous occasions.
<P>

<a name="30708-15_para5"></a>We have also put in place a number of measures designed to ensure that the panel is able to work independently. These include the consumer panel being a legally separate unincorporated body and operationally independent from Ofcom; the panel being able to formulate its annual work plan and be responsible for allocating its own resources; providing the panel with the power to establish its own advisory committees and to determine its procedures; ensuring that no member or employee of Ofcom is able to be a member of the consumer panel; and that Ofcom must explain the reasons why it might not accept the advice given to it by the panel. On the second day of Report, we moved a government amendment to require the <P>


<a name="column_181"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 181</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>consumer panel to publish an annual report, adding an extra element of transparency and accountability to the panel's work. When taken together, we believe that the whole package will ensure that the consumer panel will be able to act as an effective, independent voice for consumers.
<P>

<a name="30708-15_para6"></a>Amendment No. 9 suggests that as well as domestic consumers, the remit of the consumer panel covers small businesses of no more than 10 employees because the experiences of these businesses are similar to the experiences of domestic consumers in the markets for communications networks and services. Businesses of this size may lack the resources and expertise to tackle any communications problems they may experience and they will have particular issues as consumers on which the consumer panel will be able to advise Ofcom.
<P>

<a name="30708-15_para7"></a>We have excluded communications providers and persons supplying associated facilities&#151;even if they have no more than 10 employees&#151;because they may have different needs as consumers that would not fit with the tight focus of the panel. I know that some members of the small business community have expressed concern that this exclusion will cover many small IT businesses, but let me assure the House that this is just not the case. The definitions of "communications provider" and associated facilities are set out in Clauses 402 and 30 respectively.
<P>

<a name="30708-15_para8"></a>Amendment No. 17 would in its first part effectively create the consumer panel as some kind of "watchdog" for Ofcom, monitoring it and reporting on what it has been doing. This is not the role we want to create for the panel. We have made clear during the passage of the Bill that we want to ensure that the consumer panel acts as the independent voice of consumers. I indicated today the way in which that has been established in the Bill. The phrase "a critical friend" has often been used, but sums up nicely the way we envisage the consumer panel operating by working closely with Ofcom in order to provide it with expert advice.
<P>

<a name="30708-15_para9"></a>The remaining parts of Amendment No. 17 relate to the power of the consumer panel to establish committees and would, in effect, require the panel to establish advisory bodies for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and one for small businesses. We have had debates on these issues, too, during the passage of the Bill. One of the measures we have included to ensure the independence of the consumer panel is the power for it to determine what committees it feels are necessary in order to provide advice about its functions. We did so in response to the recommendation from the pre-legislative scrutiny committee.
<P>

<a name="30708-15_para10"></a>Finally, I turn to Amendments Nos. 18 and 19, which would require the consumer panel to make arrangements for regulating its own procedures and those of any committees it establishes. The Bill as it stands allows the panel to make such arrangements as it sees fit. Given what I have already said about not wishing to constrain the independence of the panel unnecessarily, I cannot imagine that the consumer <P>


<a name="column_182"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 182</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>panel would not want to make proper arrangements. It would certainly make its operation needlessly difficult if it did not.
<P>

<a name="30708-15_para11"></a>In the light of those assurances&#151;and I have no doubt that my noble friend has had a chance to study our previous debates on these issues&#151;I hope he will feel we have aired the issues sufficiently and will be prepared to withdraw his amendment.

 "ADVISORY COMMITTEES FOR DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM
<br>
(1) It shall be the duty of OFCOM, in accordance with the following provisions of this section, to exercise their powers under paragraph 14 of the Schedule to the Office of Communications Act 2002 (c. 11) (committees of OFCOM) to establish and maintain a committee for each of the following parts of the United Kingdom&#151;

(a) a chairman appointed by OFCOM; and

(b) such number of other members appointed by OFCOM as OFCOM think fit.
<br>
(3) In appointing a person in accordance with this section to be a member of a committee, OFCOM must have regard to the desirability of ensuring that the person appointed is able to represent the interests and opinions, in relation to communications matters, of persons living in the part of the United Kingdom for which the committee has been established.
<br>
(4) The function of each committee shall be to provide advice to OFCOM (including other committees established by OFCOM) about the interests and opinions, in relation to communications matters, of persons living in the part of the United Kingdom for which the committee has been established.
<br>
(5) A committee established under this section may also, at the request of the Consumer Panel, provide advice about those interests and opinions to the Consumer Panel.

<a name="30708-15_para18"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, your Lordships will recall that in responding to an amendment tabled at the Report stage by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, and the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, we recognised the anxieties the nations have expressed that their voices should be heard within Ofcom. We therefore agreed to <P>


<a name="column_183"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 183</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>consider tabling a government amendment to ensure that Ofcom should establish advisory committees for each of the nations.
<P>

<a name="30708-15_para19"></a>Amendment No. 20 would place Ofcom under a duty to establish and maintain committees for each of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland in order to provide Ofcom with advice about the interests and opinions of people living in the respective nations in relation to communications matters.
<P>

<a name="30708-15_para20"></a>It will be for Ofcom to appoint the chairman of each committee and such numbers of other members as Ofcom thinks appropriate. In doing so, Ofcom would need to have regard to the need to ensure that the people appointed to each national advisory committee are able to represent the interests and opinions of those living in the relevant part of the United Kingdom in relation to communication matters.
<P>

<a name="30708-15_para21"></a>The national advisory committees would be able to provide advice to other committees established by Ofcom, including the content board. In view of the independent status of the consumer panel, it would of course be possible for the panel to establish its own national committees should it so wish. However, we have also made provision that it would be possible for the national advisory committees to provide advice to the consumer panel should the panel request such advice and Ofcom consents.
<P>

<a name="30708-15_para22"></a>Also at the Report stage we considered two amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Addington, that would put a requirement for a disabled and elderly person's advisory committee on the face of the Bill. One amendment required Ofcom to establish and maintain an advisory committee on the interests of disabled and elderly people and the other required the consumer panel to do so.
<P>

<a name="30708-15_para23"></a>Consistent with our approach on the advisory committees for the nations and regions that I have just set out, Amendment No. 21 will require Ofcom to establish and maintain a committee to advise it on the interests of disabled people and of elderly people across its remit.
<P>

<a name="30708-15_para24"></a>As I have said, we do not want to get embroiled in the detail of Ofcom's organisational structure&#151;it must have the flexibility to make operational decisions without being tied into complex statutory requirements. For this reason, we have kept the clause simple and avoided over-prescription. We have also allowed the same flexibility that the national committees have to advise the consumer panel, if they request it and with Ofcom's consent.
<P>

<a name="30708-15_para25"></a>I set out in some detail in Committee and again at Report the powers which underpin the panel's independence and self-determination. This is why we have not taken forward the second amendment that was tabled at Report which would require the consumer panel to establish a committee for disabled and elderly people. Our amendment does not preclude <P>

<P>
<A NAME="30708-16_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </B>   My Lords, I would like to speak briefly in support of this amendment this afternoon and to welcome it. The amendment recognises the unique nature of each part of the United Kingdom. It is in the spirit of devolution and it allows Ofcom to ensure it meets the special needs of individual areas instead of trying to cater for the whole of the UK in a blanket way.
<P>

<a name="30708-16_para0"></a>While I am on my feet, I would also like to welcome Amendment No. 21, which recognises that elderly and disabled people have special needs. We have an increasingly elderly population. I am glad that the Government have recognised that the needs of elderly and disabled people may be quite different and that Ofcom must take this into account.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-16_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </B>   My Lords, I compliment the noble Lord and the Government on introducing the new clause represented by Amendment No. 20. I also compliment the chairman of Ofcom on the wisdom he displayed when he addressed your Lordships' House during Report stage. I also compliment the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff, on her persistence, which gave the noble Lord, Lord Currie of Marylebone, his opportunity. The Government have given us all we asked for and more. The function and scope of the advisory committees is not confined to devolved areas of government in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland but ranges over all communication matters as defined in Clause 3(11), and I am sure that that is right.
<P>

<a name="30708-16_para1"></a>I am slightly mystified as to why the consumer panel is specifically mentioned in subsection (5) but not the content board. It did beg the question of whether the committees could advise the content board with or without the consent of Ofcom. But the noble Lord, in speaking to the clause, made it quite clear that the content board could also be advised. He might just wish to clarify why the consent of Ofcom is required by the committees before they advise the consumer panel. Of course Ofcom should be kept informed, but consent to advise is something different. It smacks of potential prohibition. I shall not belabour the point, but this also applies to Amendment No. 21, of which I approve, which gives powers of advice to the committee for the elderly and disabled. But again I ask why the consent of Ofcom has to be obtained by that committee before it advises the consumer panel?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   My Lords, I also welcome this amendment. We are very grateful to the Government for listening to the arguments that were put forward. I should like to pay tribute to the leadership of the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff, on this topic. She has done a brilliant job. The only criticism I have of this amendment is that I would have wished to see a closer link with the National Assembly for Wales when it comes to the Welsh committee. I hope that the committee membership will be formed with proper consultation <P>


<a name="column_185"></a>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-16_spnew3"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Manchester: </B>   My Lords, much congratulation for persistence is being spread around your Lordships' House. I look at Amendment No. 21 and take the opportunity to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Ashley&#151;not in his place today&#151;and also the noble Lord, Lord Addington, on their persistence on behalf of the elderly and the disabled. I welcome particularly this amendment. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Addington does. I congratulate the Government on listening.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-16_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </B>   My Lords, there must be some disturbing dissident note here and I propose to sound it. The Minister gave me some pleasure when he said that the Government did not want to get embroiled in the intestinal arrangements of Ofcom. That is very satisfactory. It is much better than just having a committee appointed by the Government. I am tempted to ask whether Ofcom really welcomes all these duties. I suspect, from an earlier stage in the Bill when we were talking about appointing a committee to represent the needs of the elderly and disabled, that Ofcom will be reasonably happy with this arrangement.
<P>

<a name="30708-16_para2"></a>I always rail against the pathetic faith we have that the appointment of a committee will actually achieve something. Very often committees have too many people on them. Half the people there ought to be doing something more important and the other half ought never to be let loose at all. The National Health Service is festooned with them. They are a nuisance, they take up the time of busy people. Committees very often need themselves to be scrutinised. It would be very healthy if every committee were compelled to examine what they did last year and then decide whether they have any excuse for remaining in existence.
<P>

<a name="30708-16_para3"></a>Let us look briefly at subsection (3) of Amendment No. 20:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In appointing a person in accordance with this section to be a member of a committee, OFCOM must have regard to the desirability of ensuring that the person appointed is able to represent the interests and opinions, in relation to communications matters".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-16_para4"></a><P>

<a name="30708-16_para5"></a>I would have thought that that idea would have occurred to Ofcom. It does not need to be told on a page of the statute that it must find people who are interested and knowledgeable on the subject.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-16_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, I welcome particularly Amendment No. 21. There are two amendments in later groups with which the Government have come a long way towards the views of those of us who have spoken on issues concerning disability. I would like to thank all my noble friends on the Front Bench and my noble friend Lady Blackstone for the way in which they have responded to our concerns.
<P>


<a name="column_186"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 186</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30708-16_para6"></a>I have one point on the two amendments, which was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy. Under subsections (5) and (6) the consent of the consumer panel is required before these committees can give advice. They have to ask for it. Then Ofcom has to consent to it. This means that the advisory committee will tend to be reactive rather than proactive on behalf of the nations and the elderly and disabled. I await an answer on this.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-16_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Darcy de Knayth: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may very briefly intervene on the side of the accolades. This is an amendment we have wanted very much. It is an important amendment. I would say to the noble Lord, Lord Peyton of Yeovil, that one disabled person or someone with knowledge of disability is no substitute for an advisory committee whose members know exactly what they are talking about and can explore all the issues. We have discussed this at length and Ofcom is perfectly happy. I very much appreciate the Minister having done this.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-16_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Wilcox: </B>   My Lords, we are pleased that the Government have listened and responded to the arguments that, along with the noble Lords, Lord Addington, Lord Carter, and others, we made on Report. They have added to the Bill a commitment to establish and maintain an advisory committee on elderly and disabled people. We thank the Government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-16_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, I thank everyone who helped to have the amendment tabled. No matter whose name appeared on the amendment, it was definitely a team effort to bring it here. Taking on the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, slightly, I think that we should have a committee to consider the functioning of committees. We should always bear in mind that the entire House often sits as a Committee. Another committee to give advice might be a suitable present from us to the whole process.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-16_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful for the general welcome that the two government amendments have received. In response to the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, and my noble friend Lord Carter, I said earlier that we did not want to get embroiled in the detail of Ofcom's organisational structure. We tried to make the committee system in relation to these amendments as flexible as possible. There is neither a hidden agenda nor anything sinister related to the points that the noble Lords raised. Given Ofcom's interpretation of the amendments, and having listened to the debate&#151;we will also read Hansard&#151;I am absolutely sure that any concerns noble Lords may have will be allayed.
<P>

<a name="30708-16_para7"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, asked for an assurance that the countries in question will be consulted fully about the committees. I can give that assurance.
<P>

<a name="30708-16_para8"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Peyton, a man after my own heart, hates bureaucracy and talked about "intestinal arrangements". I am sure that we have all taken on board his points. He ridiculed the wording concerned with <P>


<a name="column_187"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 187</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>appointing persons able to represent communications. We must acknowledge that communications is a very broad church. The intention is that those appointed do not, for example, have an interest in film as part of communications and nothing else; rather they must have a broad interest and an ability to contribute.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-16_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, he should promise to consider further the point that the noble Lord, Lord Carter, and I have made. In proposed subsections (5) and (6) in Amendment No. 20, and similarly in Amendment No. 21, it is curious that the consumer panel should request advice from the appropriate committees and then have to gain the consent of Ofcom before that advice is given. It seems a somewhat strangulated approach. I should be grateful if the Minister would agree to consider the point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-16_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   My Lords, I have just received a note on the matter. If the following explanation does not satisfy the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, I shall write to him. The content board is part of Ofcom; the consumer panel is not. That is why special arrangements must be made. Consent is needed because this is part of Ofcom.

<a name="30708-17_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 70 and 128. The amendments are tabled in response to concerns expressed on Report by the noble Lord, Lord Addington, that the term,

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"fair treatment of disabled persons",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-17_para5"></a>
used in Clauses 25 and 333 was not in line with the terminology used in other disability legislation.
<P>

<a name="30708-17_para6"></a>We explained on Report that the use of the term "fair treatment" mirrored the current obligations in the Broadcasting Act 1996 and was well understood in the context of that legislation. However, we accept that more recent disability legislation, such as the Disability Rights Commission Act 1999, preferred the term "equalisation of opportunities" and that it would be helpful for our legislation to be as consistent as possible with other legislation in the area. We therefore undertook to table amendments at Third Reading to substitute the current references to "fair treatment" with the more up-to-date term "equalisation of opportunities". The amendments fulfil that commitment. We have also extended the change to the equivalent provision for the Welsh authority in Schedule 12 to the Bill. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30708-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Government. I moved the amendments on the issue in Committee and on Report, so I am extremely grateful. I had wondered why the word "equalisation", rather than "equality", of opportunity was used. However, apart from the fact that the word is consistent with the wording of the 1999 Act, the dictionary states that "equality" is the state of being equal. "Equalisation" is not defined, but I understand it as a process of achieving equality, which is what equality of opportunity is all about.

<a name="30708-17_para14"></a>The amendment provides that, when Ofcom receives a complaint or otherwise becomes aware that a person may have contravened a condition, it should notify that person that it is conducting an assessment of the evidence which may lead to a notification under Clause 92. That means that, at least in the majority of cases, the person has a prior opportunity to correct the alleged breach, thus reducing the number of occasions when Ofcom must take the serious step of issuing a notification, or to submit evidence to Ofcom showing that he is complying with the conditions notified. That may convince Ofcom that the complaint did not provide reasonable grounds for believing that a Clause 43 condition had been contravened. In either case, unnecessary notifications under Clause 92(1), which could have damaging effects on the provider concerned, would be avoided.
<P>

<a name="30708-17_para15"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Currie, the chairman of Ofcom, has written to me about the matter. He has been good enough to make clear that it will be only in rare and extreme cases that Ofcom might have to act without warning. He said that, in the normal course of events, Ofcom would undertake a preliminary investigation, letting the operator concerned know as soon as possible so that in some cases it is possible,

That is indeed most helpful. I suggest that the noble Lord, Lord Currie of Marylebone, does what I have advised the Government to do, which is to place his letter on Ofcom's website so that it can receive wider circulation, instead of simply lodging it in the Library of your Lordship's House as he has been asked to do. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30708-17_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   My Lords, I rise to support the amendment to which my name is added. We are returning to a very important issue that I spoke about as early as Second Reading. We are in a strange situation that I have discussed with the noble Lord, Lord Avebury. He and I were minded to test the opinion of the House today on this issue because we are both deeply concerned that the Government have not, until now, responded sufficiently to allay concerns or rebut the problem. As the noble Lord, Lord Currie, quite rightly said in his letter addressed to Lord Avebury, <P>


<a name="column_190"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 190</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>operators are concerned that Ofcom will have gone a long way down the road of investigating an alleged breach leading to a possible enforcement order before operators are even made aware that they are under investigation, and thus have the opportunity to make representation.
<P>

<a name="30708-17_para17"></a>We are extremely grateful that, at the 11th hour, this letter was written by the noble Lord, Lord Currie. To our minds and in discussion with the industry, the letter has made a difference. The issue is an important one and we were determined to be robust on behalf of the industry. We are very glad that the letter has been forthcoming.
<P>

<a name="30708-17_para18"></a>We would have preferred, however, to have the matter included in the Bill. We are concerned, and we know that the industry is also concerned, to ensure that we do not in any way remove important flexibility in the way that Ofcom proceeds in the future. Therefore, we have decided to agree to accept the contents of the letter, although, as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, rightly said, please let us make this letter as public as possible as quickly as possible to allay concerns beyond your Lordships' House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-17_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, it is obvious that we have considered this matter very carefully and discussed it with the noble Lord, Lord Avebury. We are willing to discuss it with the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe. We understand that the assurances that the noble Lord, Lord Currie, has offered have given sufficient comfort for the amendment to be withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="30708-17_para19"></a>The amendment relates to the matter of Ofcom's detailed administrative and operational practice, rather than to any substantive matter of policy, so we do not think that it is right to include the provision in the Bill. However, we acknowledge that, as a matter of good regulatory practice and in accordance with the principle of transparent regulation, Ofcom should ensure that, except when clearly justified, the subjects of any investigation it undertakes, even an informal preliminary one, are made aware of Ofcom's interest at an early stage.
<P>

<a name="30708-17_para20"></a>As always, there will need to be provision for some exceptions to the rule. The exceptional circumstances that we have in mind would be those in which advance notice would be likely to prejudice Ofcom's ability to intervene effectively. In certain cases the element of surprise is crucial to ensuring, for example, that vital evidence is not destroyed. I hope that such cases will be very rare.
<P>

<a name="30708-17_para21"></a>Since this is principally a matter for Ofcom, I am glad to confirm that the noble Lord, Lord Currie, has written to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, advising him that Ofcom also accepts the principle underlying this amendment, and will include a suitable provision in public guidance on the administrative procedures that it is preparing. Moreover, operators and others with an interest in these matters will have ample opportunity to discuss with Ofcom the precise detail of how this process will operate. Before it formally takes over its enforcement role, Ofcom will consult on public guidance and other procedural matters too.

<A NAME="30708-18_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, I also thank the Minister for his courtesy in discussing this matter with me yesterday. He could has resolved this problem, which has caused enormous concern in the industry, as the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, said, if we had arrived at the solution much earlier. I am sorry that we had to take it up to the wire, but we felt that the issue was important.

I hope that the Minister will not take it amiss if I say that, as the period that the Bill has to be on the statute book approaches, we have noticed something of an increase in the flexibility of the department. Of course, that may be purely coincidental. I am happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment with the assurances that have been given and with the extremely helpful letter that we received from the chairman of Ofcom.

"( ) OFCOM shall carry out an impact assessment in line with section 7, prior to any introduction of recognised spectrum access, having due regard to the international implications of such a measure." 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30708-18_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we have had a great many discussions about the merits of recognised spectrum access throughout the proceedings of the Bill. There have been parallel debates going on as a result of the Radiocommunications Agency's consultation on the subject. I do not propose to rehearse those arguments today, but I merely point out that the matter is still highly controversial. Even those who were most in favour of RSAs, such as the spectrum management advisory group, acknowledge that there are unresolved problems such as the distortion of competition that would arise in the European Union if RSA is introduced in some countries and not in others. The taxation aspects also have to be more fully assessed.
<P>

<a name="30708-18_para4"></a>In order to resolve this and other outstanding issues before RSA is introduced, we propose in this amendment that Ofcom should undertake an impact assessment under Clause 7. That clause gives Ofcom power to carry out impact assessments when it proposes to do anything important for the purposes of, or in connection with, its functions. The definition of importance in Clause 7(2) certainly applies to the introduction of RSA. An impact assessment would allow persons likely to be affected by RSA to make <P>


<a name="column_192"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 192</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>representations, and for the outcome of the assessment to be published. We think that that process will be useful, because it would enable the international implications to be evaluated with the aid of those concerned, especially those in the European satellite industry. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-18_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   My Lords, the Minister and I have had extensive exchanges on RSAs in Committee and on Report. I have raised a whole host of issues in relation to the way in which the Government intend to implement RSAs and the powers of control and intervention that the Government intend to give Ofcom in this area.
<P>

<a name="30708-18_para5"></a>My concerns remain unallayed in several important areas. The Bill still fails to provide sufficiently robust requirements for consultation with the industry and other interested parties. I remain to be convinced that auctioning is an appropriate tool for RSAs. Ofcom's powers to limit spectrum use, modify and revoke licences and place conditions on spectrum trading, all reflect a hugely interventionist approach in this area.
<P>

<a name="30708-18_para6"></a>I am pleased, however, that the Government have recognised the concerns that I expressed on behalf of many in the industry on one particular issue&#151;that there is no reason to allow Ofcom to impose conditions or restrictions on the transmission or broadcasting of particular matters on RSAs. It is right for that particular provision to be removed from the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30708-18_para7"></a>I shall not take up much more time on the matter, but there is one question that I put to the Minister on Report which he has failed to answer. In Committee, the Minister expressed his personal sympathy with the arguments that I put forward in favour of grandfathering the RSA proposals to pre-existing satellite transponder agreements, which have not factored in the possibility of RSA. It is, I think he agreed, important not to discriminate in providing such protection to terrestrial broadcasters' licensing agreements and satellite transponder agreements.
<P>

<a name="30708-18_para8"></a>The Minister has indicated, however, that the timing of the introduction of charges for RSA will be a matter for Ofcom. Yet, in their response to the review of radio spectrum management, the Government said that spectrum trading and pricing, as regards terrestrial broadcasters, would not take effect while they had existing licences that did not anticipate such pricing. If the Government can make such a clear policy statement on terrestrial frequencies, what is stopping the Minister from making an equivalent policy statement today on satellite transponder agreements, rather than simply expressing a personal view?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-18_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, with such issues, we return to the issue of recognised spectrum access. I am told that it is also called "radio signals from afar". I shall speak to Amendment No. 25, about which the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, spoke, but I shall speak first to Amendment No. 24, which was moved by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury.
<P>

<a name="30708-18_para9"></a>We listened carefully to the noble Lord, and we understand the concerns. We agree about the importance of impact assessments. They are an essential component <P>


<a name="column_193"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 193</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of evidence-based policy making. However, we do not think it necessary to amend the Bill with regard to assessments for RSA.
<P>

<a name="30708-18_para10"></a>Given the significance of the RSA provisions, I would expect Ofcom to follow the Clause 7 procedure and carry out an impact assessment before deciding whether to proceed. I would further expect the assessment to have due regard to the international nature of the satellite services, if it relates to satellites, that is. We should bear it in mind that RSA may be introduced for other services, which is a good reason to allow Ofcom a measure of flexibility over the detailed contents of the assessment and not to prescribe them in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30708-18_para11"></a>Clause 7 places Ofcom under an obligation to publish impact assessments in important cases. It is difficult to imagine that RSA is not important. It will be open to operators or anyone else to make representations to Ofcom, if an assessment omits a material consideration, and Ofcom will be required not to implement the proposal until it has taken account of representations received. That is in addition to the duty under Clause 400, which will also apply. Clause 7 already makes sufficient provision for impact assessments without any need for special provision in respect of RSA.
<P>

<a name="30708-18_para12"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 25. On Report, I undertook to review the scope of Ofcom's power to make a grant of RSA subject to restrictions and conditions. The noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, had asked why Ofcom needed such a power, especially in relation to the content of transmissions and broadcasts, and she moved amendments to remove the power from the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30708-18_para13"></a>I have looked carefully at subsection (5) of Clause 157 to see whether we could narrow Ofcom's powers without compromising the effective management of the radio spectrum. Amendment No. 25 is the result of that consideration. It will remove from the clause Ofcom's express powers in relation to restrictions and conditions on content. On reflection, we agree with the noble Baroness's argument that they are unnecessary for RSA. She made a fair point, and I am grateful to her. The issue has been extensively debated, and I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, and the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, on the persistence with which they have pursued the matter.
<P>

<a name="30708-18_para14"></a>The noble Baroness asked why I could not give a categoric assurance on grandfathering. It is not really for the Government to do that. Decisions on RSA will be a matter for Ofcom. Unlike for licensed users of spectrum, such as terrestrial broadcasters, the Secretary of State has no existing powers relating to RSA, which is a new system introduced by the Bill. The situation with RSA is more complex, and the effects are not limited to broadcasting. For example, decisions on RSA could affect the availability of spectrum for terrestrial fixed links in the 11 gigahertz band, which is used by Astra for Sky transmissions and shared with terrestrial services. It is for Ofcom to balance such considerations, but I repeat my view that I expect it to take account of any implications for switchover.

<A NAME="30708-18_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, I hope that what the Minister said about grandfathering has satisfied the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, to some extent, at least. Perhaps she could get a letter from the chairman of Ofcom&#151;similar to the one that we secured with regard to the previous amendment&#151;that would say what he thought was possible?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-18_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister. That would be useful, even if he cannot give a complete undertaking that the same procedures will be applied to satellite as are applied to terrestrial to give whatever undertakings are possible about the extension of licences that might be covered in future by the introduction of RSA.
<P>

<a name="30708-18_para15"></a>The Minister has also said, effectively, that we have what we want. An impact assessment will be conducted under Clause 7. Moreover, he has drawn attention to Clause 400, which reinforces the necessity for Ofcom to take account of representations from the industry before introducing RSA. I hope that that will also go a long way towards reassuring the industry that there will not be a sudden introduction of RSA without the fullest possible consultation.
<P>

<a name="30708-18_para16"></a>We have achieved quite a lot in our discussions on the matter, and I sincerely hope that Ofcom will be as receptive to representations from the satellite industry as it ought to be. We look forward to continued consultations with Ofcom, so that we can guide it, if it feels that it is necessary for your Lordships to continue to take an interest in the matter a long time after the Bill has left the House.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30708-19_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, when I first saw the group of amendments, I was a little worried by the fact that there were 83 clauses between Amendments Nos. 26 and 49. However, they probably hang together with regard to subject matter.
<P>

<a name="30708-19_para5"></a>Amendment No. 26 deals with the teletext service. There has been an interesting debate on the matter. Analogue teletext meant that people who had access to Braille typewriters were able to use teletext and thus <P>


<a name="column_195"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 195</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>get information. It was of great benefit to them. It meant that the blind and the deafblind who could use Braille had a way of getting information.
<P>

<a name="30708-19_para6"></a>We have tried many things to get the Government to move on the matter. We started off ambitiously in Committee, but I hope that the Government will be able to accept this amendment. The aim is to mirror what was done on the electronic programme guide, on which the Government were able to move towards us. If it is possible to do something because of an advance in technology, we should take the argument on board. That is a reasonable approach. As the technology comes on line, we should be allowed to use it. I hope that the Government will respond favourably.
<P>

<a name="30708-19_para7"></a>Clause 300, to which Amendment No. 49 relates, covers the issue of people with a dual sensory impairment. The Government have undergone something of a learning process in respect of those with a dual sensory impairment&#151;the deafblind. The department has undergone something of a learning process. One wonders why other Ministers did not bring forward that matter for us. It does not matter, as long as we get there in the end.
<P>

<a name="30708-19_para8"></a>The deafblind&#151;those with dual sensory impairment&#151;are a specific group with specific problems. However, they are not even one consistent group. There are those who are born deafblind and those who are initially blind or deaf and then lose the other sense. Those secondary groups can, as their senses deteriorate, get access to services made available by current technology. It is possible to give assistance to a subset within a subset of a specific condition. All that this amendment does is suggest that the Government, or those in power, must bear in mind those considerations. I hope that the Government are able to accept the amendment.
<P>

<a name="30708-19_para9"></a>Amendment No. 50 is probably the most controversial of all the amendments. I believe that I previously described audio description as the cock-up school of history, in which broadcasters could be told to audio describe X number of programmes only to discover that no one can receive the audio description. The most recent information that I have is that 49&#151;or has it gone up to 50?&#151;people can receive several thousand hours of audio-described programmes. That is an absurdity, but there is a solution, because for those on Sky&#151;I hope my noble friend will forgive me for saying something fairly nice about&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, a wonderful company!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, Australian-American broadcasting conglomerates allow one to receive a firm kind of audio description, although it is not as good. I believe that there are two different kinds&#151;broadcaster mixed and receiver mixed. I understand that the receiver mixed system, which the free-to-air people have been working on, is renowned for its superiority. It is better; it has many bonuses; it can be used individually; one does not need to have broadcasts to the entire room. Everything about it is better. But if you cannot receive it, it does not matter <P>


<a name="column_196"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 196</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>very much whether it is better. Therefore, if we push forward here, we can simply say that those free-to-air broadcasters must allow their audio description programmes to be broadcast by Sky to those who have Sky; namely, 24 per cent of the target population, or about 480,000, according to the figures that I have been given. That surely makes sense.
<P>

<a name="30708-19_para10"></a>A number of arguments have been advanced and a number of letters written about this matter. I believe that at the back of those is the fact that trying to get a producer for the chip to go into the new box may well be discouraged. I have come to the conclusion that that is at the back of the resistance. Therefore, if one manages to scare off someone from the potential market by saying that this should go through Sky, one may well continue the process. I believe that that is one of the greatest points of resistance by the free-to-air broadcasters. I suggest that the Government should consider forcing those free-to-air broadcasters to make this service available to what is under a quarter of their potential market, when they are already pumping vast amounts of money into the audio description itself. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30708-19_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I do not want to prolong the debate and I shall not make a speech now. However, I want to indicate that I shall advise the House to accept Amendments Nos. 26 and 49.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-19_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Puttnam: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may briefly gatecrash the amendment tabled in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Addington, to deal with a small problem that I have. Due to a miscommunication between me and the Public Bill Office, Amendment No. 50, which relates to backstop powers on training, failed to make it from Report stage to Third Reading. As it was not a contentious issue when I left it at Report stage, and as it has some bearing on the utilisation of new technology, I hope that the Minister will kindly help me further with regard to that particular issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-19_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Darcy de Knayth: </B>   My Lords, I support what the noble Lord, Lord Addington, has said and welcome what the Minister is about to say. I am very pleased that the deafblind&#151;a most excluded group of people&#151;will at last get something. However, I am saddened that the Minister does not propose to accept Amendment No. 50. I support all that the noble Lord, Lord Addington, has said. We are in an absurd situation. It would be ridiculous to be unable to get what is available and hope for better prospects later.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-19_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   My Lords, I, too, express my pleasure at hearing that Amendments Nos. 26 and 49 have been accepted and also to add my concern that Amendment No. 50 has not. Over a number of sittings in Committee and at Report stage, the noble Lord, Lord Addington, has made the problems clear to us all, and we have also been very well briefed by the RNIB and others. With about half a million people being disadvantaged in this way and 22 per cent of people over 60 having both a hearing and visual <P>


<a name="column_197"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 197</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>problem, it is quite absurd&#151;I believe that that is the right word&#151; that we are not moving faster, especially as the facilities are in place and as this amendment would ensure that suitable provision was made for such people. I therefore support all these amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-19_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   My Lords, I rise to say briefly that we welcome the Minister's forthcoming response to these amendments. Our only concern, which I hope the Minister will allay, has been to ensure that the legislation is not technology specific. I believe that that would be a great mistake. It is important for Ofcom to be given the flexibility to drive forward these proposals and to respond to technology.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-19_spnew9"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I hope that the House will agree that we have listened not only today but throughout to the views expressed and have shown ourselves willing to make changes. At Report stage we introduced a new duty for Ofcom to encourage the availability of easily-useable apparatus; we acted on the need for broadcasters to make available adequate information about subtitling, signing and audio-description services to those likely to want to use them; we introduced the 60 per cent, five-year interim target for subtitling; we addressed the concern that electronic programme guides should be as accessible as possible to people with disabilities. I am grateful to all those who have pressed us to make those changes.
<P>

<a name="30708-19_para11"></a>Amendment No. 26 would require Ofcom to include in the public teletext licence conditions to ensure that people with sight or hearing disabilities are able to use the service for all the same purposes as people without such disabilities. Teletext provides a valuable service, but it is licensed as a text service. We do not want to change the name of the service. We agree that we would like it to be available to people with disabilities, in so far as that is reasonably practicable. We will therefore accept the amendment. There are some technical difficulties to be addressed with regard to the drafting and the placement of the amendment in the Bill. However, I can assure the noble Lord, Lord Addington, that what comes back from the Commons will preserve the effect of his amendment.
<P>

<a name="30708-19_para12"></a>Amendment No. 49 would require Ofcom's code relating to provisions for the deaf and visually impaired to give guidance on the extent to which applicable services should promote the understanding and enjoyment of programmes by people with a dual sensory impairment, as well as people who are deaf or hard of hearing and blind or partially sighted. We understand the very particular needs that are involved. As we have said, realistically, a person will need to have some degree of sight or hearing to be able to benefit from television; and, as such, they would be covered by the provisions. I regret that the substantive effect of the amendment is not entirely clear. However, we understand the strength of feeling. The amendment has a great deal of support, and we shall accept it on that basis. Again we may need to make some minor changes to the amendment, but they will not affect the spirit of it.

<a name="30708-19_para13"></a>Amendment No. 50 is more difficult. We have already discussed the provision of audio-description services. I am well aware of their importance for visually impaired people. We all agree that there should be more audio-described programmes. The amendment would require broadcasters to provide their audio-description services in a form intelligible by their users. That is so obvious that there should be no need to write it into the statute, and the amendment does not appear to add much to the Bill. But it could be counterproductive. It is not clear why we would need such an amendment for audio-description services but not for sub-titling or signing. We certainly would not want to imply that there is no corresponding need for subtitling or signing to reach users in an intelligible form. That is the danger of this amendment. However, we understand that particular problems surround the provision of audio description that do not arise for subtitling and signing.
<P>

<a name="30708-19_para14"></a>There are currently two ways of transmitting audio description&#151;either mixed with the programme sound as an alternative to the normal soundtrack or in a separate stream that is mixed with the soundtrack in the viewer's set-top box. Both systems have their advantages and disadvantages.
<P>

<a name="30708-19_para15"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to get broadcasters to provide their services using a specific system compatible with Sky set-top boxes instead of another one developed by the BBC and other partners which can only be received on 45 prototypes. That would allow Sky viewers to receive the programmes audio-described by the broadcasters which have to provide audio description. We fully understand the desire to make the best use of currently available technology to accelerate the provision of audio-description.
<P>

<a name="30708-19_para16"></a>That would not solve the problem of the non-Sky viewers. I agree with noble Lords who said that we must not be equipment specific. There is not enough bandwidth available on the digital terrestrial platform to operate a system similar to the one used on satellite television. The drafting of the amendment presumes that the solution lies in the hands of the broadcasters. In fact, one only has to look at the example of current developments in EPGs to see that future models may depend as much on manufacturers of equipment as on the broadcasters themselves. So we think that this is a matter better left to the codes, since that will mean the regulator can take into account the latest developments and direct the broadcasters accordingly. In future, there might be other options or equipment that might have more benefits and less disadvantages. But my point is that we should not be picking winners now&#151;a point which I think was taken up in debate.
<P>

<a name="30708-19_para17"></a>Perhaps I may now address the gatecrasher. Yes, we understand the point that he makes about training. I can just about relate it to this group of amendments. The Government would like to make it clear that the obligations placed in the Bill represent a serious and ongoing obligation to invest in training. We see these requirements as vital to the future success of the sector. Unless we invest in people and their skills our vibrant audio-visual media will eventually go the way of shipbuilding and any other traditional manufacturing <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>industries. On the recommendation of the ITC's programme supply review, the Secretary of State asked Skillset to set up a task force to report back to Ofcom on training. We keenly await the recommendations of the task force and expect a robust and vigorous strategy for the industry to emerge as a result.
<P>

<a name="30708-19_para18"></a>Broadcasting is just one part of the audio-visual industry. Skillset and the UK Film Council are currently working with the film industry to develop a comprehensive film skills strategy to be launched in September. We look forward to the DTI and Skillset working together with the new media to address skills strategies to drive productivity and competitiveness of the sector. It is particularly fitting to be addressing these issues on the eve of the launch of the Government's national skills strategy, which places particular emphasis on the need for industries to work collaboratively to advance the implementation of skills strategies within their sectors. The Government will continue to monitor this broad range of training and development activities closely, particularly compliance with measures.

<A NAME="30708-19_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for accepting my first two amendments&#151;a brace is a good haul for one day. Amendment No. 50 is designed to deal with an ongoing problem as it currently exists. I heard what the noble Lord said and I have decided not to seek the opinion of the House, although it crossed my mind more than once. I offer the Minister one thought on this matter: I promise never to come back to this subject provided boxes are produced with the relevant technology within, say, eight months from now. If not, I shall come back and badger the Government to merry hell to do something about it. There is no point in ensuring that something beneficial is produced which cannot be received.

"( ) When making an order under this section the Secretary of State shall require OFCOM to&#151;
<br>
(a) do what it can to sustain the availability of a digital frequency for an existing analogue Restricted Services Licences channel;
<br>
(b) consult with existing local television channel Restricted Services Licences licensees about transitional arrangements for broadcasting on Digital Terrestrial Television in their local area; and
<br>
(c) begin the digital local television licensing process prior to digital switch-over."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30708-20_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment concerns the availability of frequencies for existing local television services which are broadcasting under restricted services licences. In Committee I gave the example of Channel M in Manchester. The problem is that when the switchover to digital occurs, there is no guarantee that spectrum will be made available for these services. The then Minister, the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, said that it was,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"for Ofcom to determine, within the framework of its statutory duties, what spectrum should be available for those different types of services".&#151;[Official Report, 20/5/03; col. 753.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-20_para7"></a><P>

<a name="30708-20_para8"></a>The RSL broadcasters were not reassured by that statement and we fear that when digital local frequencies come to be allocated, which may not be until after 2010, their current situation of operating on low-power, poor-quality frequencies will be perpetuated. In the past, the frequency planners have leaned towards the interests of the bigger organisations at the expense of independent local channels. That could easily be repeated in the digital spectrum.
<P>

<a name="30708-20_para9"></a>The RSLs are not represented on the spectrum planning committee and have not been asked for an opinion by the planners. We therefore hope that the Government will require Ofcom to do three things: first, to provide digital frequency for existing analogue RSL broadcasters; secondly, to consult with them on transitional arrangements for DTT broadcasts in their local areas; and, thirdly, to begin the process of allocating digital frequencies for local TV now, so that existing broadcasters do not have to face years of uncertainty which would make it impossible for them to attract investment. We understand that there have been helpful discussions on these matters between most of the RSL TV channels and officials of the DCMS in which assurances have been given, but it would be useful to have those on the record. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-20_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, in practical terms, this amendment seeks to give existing television restricted service licensees a guarantee that they will be able to continue after switchover. That would not be appropriate or fair. In fact, it might not even be realistic. I say that it would not be appropriate because paragraph (a) of Amendment No. 28 would mean that Ofcom was required to do what it could to ensure that spectrum is available for existing RSLs. We have never <P>


<a name="column_201"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 201</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>given such a guarantee to any other commercial service, nor to any other spectrum user. However, we did decide that Ofcom should have a general duty to manage the spectrum as efficiently as possible. Having done so, we tried not to tie its hands by introducing more specific requirements.
<P>

<a name="30708-20_para10"></a>I also feel that it would not be fair. As we said on Report, holders of the current RSLs were perfectly aware that the licences they applied for were restricted in duration and came without any spectrum guarantee. They knew the rules of the game. It is likely that the other operators who decided not to compete for those licences would have responded to an application for long-term licences or for short-term ones that had such a guarantee for the future. It would not be fair to change the rules after the game has begun.
<P>

<a name="30708-20_para11"></a>It might turn out that it is not possible to give such a guarantee. Until our spectrum plans are finalised and have international clearance where we need it, we will not know what frequencies will be available on top of those necessary for the six multiplexes. Although it is perhaps unlikely, we might find that in a particular area securing a frequency for an RSL will be possible only if that frequency was not given to one of the six national multiplexes. Would that provision mean that Ofcom would have to give a small RSL priority over a multiplex?
<P>

<a name="30708-20_para12"></a>Paragraph (b) of Amendment No. 28 would impose a requirement on Ofcom to consult RSLs about transitional arrangements for broadcasting on DTT in their area. Not only is the drafting of this provision rather unclear but it is also superfluous. As part of the good regulatory practices that it is required to follow, Ofcom will consult all the relevant parties. Therefore, we must oppose this amendment.
<P>

<a name="30708-20_para13"></a>However, we understand that there is an issue to be addressed here. Operators have taken the risk of investing in these licences. Yes, they knew the risk beforehand, but they took it, and some of them not only built successful businesses but have created genuinely attractive local services which are now greatly appreciated by their audiences.
<P>

<a name="30708-20_para14"></a>Ideally, we would like it if these services were able to continue, while seeing new ones develop. We recognise that if they are willing to invest in developing high quality programmes and play their role in social inclusion, licensees will want to be given as much security as possible for their future. Much as we would like to be able to provide this now, we are simply not in a position to do so, nor will we be until we have a clearer idea of how best to use the available spectrum.
<P>

<a name="30708-20_para15"></a>For the time being, therefore, I can do little more than repeat what we said before. After switchover there will, of course, be more spectrum available, principally coming from the 14 frequency channels that will be cleared. However, it may well be inappropriate to use high-value national frequencies for local broadcasting. A preferable solution may be to use the interleaved spectrum that will become available within the frequencies used for the six national multiplexes. This interleaved spectrum could create new opportunities for local television services after switchover.
<P>


<a name="column_202"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 202</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30708-20_para16"></a>Once the spectrum plans for these multiplexes have been finalised, Ofcom will be able to switch its attention to this interleaved spectrum and prepare for its allocation. Once it has done so, I would expect it to consult fully all the stakeholders and present them with a list of options. In addition, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Department of Trade and Industry will undertake a major public consultation exercise on switchover in spring next year and I can assure all concerned that the issues of the availability of local television services and the continuation of existing restricted service licences will be given careful consideration in the course of that exercise.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-20_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that assurance and for repeating what I believe was the substance of what was said to the RSLs at a meeting at the DCMS on 30 June. There was only one point on which the Minister's remarks did not appear quite to tally with the assurances that the industry thought it had received at that meeting&#151;the early advertisement of suitable digital frequencies, identified in areas where local television licences were already operating. The industry thought that that early advertisement of digital licences might be accompanied by a presumption that the existing incumbent would be preferred. However, the Minister seemed to tell your Lordships that the competition would be completely open and that newcomers would have the same chance of having that spectrum as the incumbents.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-20_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, we will consult before we make any order affecting the licensing regime for local television services, and one of the questions that we will need to address will be the extent to which previous experience as a local broadcaster has to be taken into account when assessing competing applicants.
<P>

<a name="30708-20_para17"></a>Once our spectrum plans are finalised, and the orders on the licensing regime for local television have been made, Ofcom will be able to advertise licences for local television services. It may decide to do this before the relevant digital spectrum actually becomes available, in order to ensure, where appropriate, continuity of existing services, or a smooth start for new ones. However, we do not want to tie Ofcom's hands and the matter must be left to its discretion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-20_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, perhaps we had better pursue the matter through Ofcom, because the RSLs were under the impression that the existing licence holders would be given preference in the allocation of the new digital frequencies, and that did not quite emerge from the Minister's remarks. However, I thank the Minister for the rest of his remarks, which will be useful. I hope that the industry finds that they enable it to plan with greater assurance for the future. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="30708-21_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Falkland: </B>   My Lords, I spoke to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Lea, on Report. I was unfortunately unable to be at the meeting, to which I was invited, but I am delighted that the Government are taking the matter seriously. As a country, we are very proud of our long-established culture of drama and literature, particularly of the way in which that has been taken up in broadcasting. The points were well made&#151;I echo what the noble Baroness, Lady McIntosh, said.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-21_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   My Lords, we are glad that the Government have responded to the good debate that we had on Report in relation to the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Lea.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-21_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   My Lords, in Committee and on Report, the noble Lord, Lord Lea, moved amendments concerned with the place of drama in the public service television remit in what is now Clause 262. The Government were unable to accept the amendments as they stood. However, we have always made clear our view that drama programming must constitute a key element of the public service remit.
<P>

<a name="30708-21_para4"></a>The list of programme types specified in Clause 262 already refers to drama as one aspect of the UK's cultural activity and its diversity. However, reflecting on the concerns raised in the earlier debates we have had a helpful meeting with the noble Lord, Lord Lea and the noble Baroness, Lady McIntosh. In the light of that we have concluded that it is right for the Bill to offer a little more detail as to how the term "drama" <P>


<a name="column_204"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 204</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should be interpreted. Hence this proposed amendment to Clause 262, which makes clear that the term "drama" as used in the clause includes contemporary and other drama in a variety of different formats.
<P>

<a name="30708-21_para5"></a>We see this new provision as encompassing both new ideas and new writing in the field of drama. It emphasises, too, the wide range of formats that television drama can take, whether it be one-off dramas, serials or themed series, to mention just a few examples. I should also emphasise once again that drama, along with all the other listed programme types, is covered by the overarching provisions in subsection (4) of Clause 262, which specify the purposes of public service broadcasting. These make explicit reference both to programmes dealing with a wide range of subject-matter and to programmes which embody high general standards with respect to content and quality. So quality of programming and diversity of subject-matter encompass the entire list of programming requirements, drama no less than the others.
<P>

<a name="30708-21_para6"></a>The quota regime for original and independent programming by public service broadcasters will encompass drama, together with all the programme types included in the public service remit. I hope the House will agree that Amendment No. 30 provides a satisfactory way of meeting the points raised in the earlier debates. I would ask the noble Baroness, Lady McIntosh, speaking on behalf of the noble Lord, Lord Lea, to withdraw Amendment No. 29, with a view to my moving Amendment No. 30.

<a name="30708-21_para11"></a><P>

<a name="30708-21_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment relates to the strength or otherwise of the enforcement powers of Ofcom under the Bill. A great deal of energy has been expended in the House over the balance of the Bill between economic and market forces on the one hand and "cultural goods" on the other&#151;the values and standards that are to be required under the Bill. Unless Clause 268 is equal to the task, all the hopes that the House&#151;including the Government&#151;has <P>


<a name="column_205"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 205</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reposed in the public service broadcasting requirements in what are now Clauses 262 and 263 will be useless.
<P>

<a name="30708-21_para13"></a>We on these Benches have one particular and specific anxiety about Clause 268. In order for Ofcom to form an opinion as to whether it can use the enforcement powers under the clause, it has first of all to decide whether the broadcaster has,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"failed to fulfil the public service remit",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-21_para14"></a>
under Clauses 262 and 263.
<P>

<a name="30708-21_para15"></a>In addition, if Ofcom decides that there is such a failure, it must come to the opinion that it is a "serious" failure. Then Ofcom has a discretion as to whether in those circumstances it will proceed to enforce its powers. That discretion depends on whether,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the situation requires the exercise of their powers".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-21_para16"></a><P>

<a name="30708-21_para17"></a>Further, in reaching that decision, various factors are laid down in the clause to which Ofcom must, "have regard, in particular". One of those is the,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"general economic and market conditions",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-21_para18"></a>
prevailing, which may impact on the failure concerned.
<P>

<a name="30708-21_para19"></a>Noble Lords may think, "So far, so weak", but that is not the end of it, because even if all those tests are complied with, no enforcement is possible if Ofcom is satisfied that the failure is,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"excused by economic or market conditions".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-21_para20"></a>
I have checked with the extremely helpful civil servants who are working on the Bill, and their and my belief is that the first test,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"excused by economic or market conditions",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-21_para21"></a>
is particular and specific to the broadcaster that has failed to meet the public service broadcasting remit.
<P>

<a name="30708-21_para22"></a>That seems to mean that, if a media group, as is typical, puts a particular broadcaster into a subsidiary and intentionally runs it on an extremely short and limited financial lead, starving it of any resources that it does not need imminently for broadcasting purposes and driving it into a programme of broadcasting that falls foul of the public service remit, Ofcom could not then take enforcement proceedings against that subsidiary company. Ofcom must be satisfied that the failure is not excused by the particular and specific economic conditions of the broadcaster concerned, or it has no further powers under the clause.
<P>

<a name="30708-21_para23"></a>I hope that I do not to need to labour the danger of that potential state of affairs. It would allow a single broadcaster to burst through the public service remit net on the grounds of its own incompetence or, more likely, on the grounds that it did not have the wherewithal, having been starved by its parent company. It may not be able to meet the public service remit for that reason. One can think of many examples of a media group purchasing an overpriced television company and then not having the money to put into programming.
<P>

<a name="30708-21_para24"></a>One can think of a great many circumstances in which the company concerned will be beyond the reach of Ofcom on the grounds in the clause. <P>

The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, has not only explained the matter much more succinctly than I did but has added other complications that could easily occur if the circumstances that he described arose.
<P>

<a name="30708-21_para25"></a>It is absurd that there should be a double let-out, in that the clause says,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"is not excused by economic or market conditions",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-21_para26"></a>
in a specific sense, before moving down to the,

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-21_para27"></a>
which are part of the general aspects to which Ofcom must have particular regard.
<P>

<a name="30708-21_para28"></a>I am absolutely behind the amendment, and am worried that the Government have not seen fit to take note of it and remove what appears to be a bias in favour of the broadcaster under these circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lipsey: </B>   My Lords, I do not believe that the amendment is well advised, for two reasons. First, we are moving from the old world of broadcasting to a new world of broadcasting. Some of us like that more than others, but that is what is happening. In the days when ITV had guaranteed revenues and spectrum shortage and did not have to pay for its licences, we did not have to worry much about economic conditions getting in the way of its public service obligations. I hope that we will never have to do so in future, but we are in the world of greater competition, so it is sensible to have some sort of safety valve built into the Bill. The clause is a safety valve.
<P>

<a name="30708-22_para0"></a>It worries me that, at every stage, this House has displayed a lack of confidence in Ofcom. The noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, was as coherent as ever in inventing a transparent device that a company might adopt to get round the provisions and saying that Ofcom would not be able to do anything about it. The clause is quite clear that such a matter is left to the opinion of Ofcom; it would see through such a device like a shot. The provision is wise and I hope that the Minister will not accept the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, will know that no one has been a stronger advocate of public service remits and the need to protect and strengthen them than me, and I have supported other amendments that he has tabled. He will also know that I have not always agreed with the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey. However, I have a certain sympathy with the view that he has just expressed.
<P>

<a name="30708-22_para1"></a>I could not quite understand the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, that we would allow a loophole for financial incompetence. That is certainly not how I read the clause. Having lived through some difficult times in the industry, in the days when I was a director in it, I believe that there should be an escape clause under the discretion of Ofcom for general economic conditions. It will not be in anyone's interest <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>if Ofcom is forced into an action that might bring down a perfectly good company or organisation, which is doing its best and would normally, over a period, be able to meet the conditions but is facing a temporary situation in which it cannot. Such situations have arisen, and no doubt will arise again in future, when a company cannot do so for reasons entirely outside its control.
<P>

<a name="30708-22_para2"></a>I hope that Ofcom will have a certain amount of discretion. I am not a lawyer, and I do not have the noble Lord's expertise in this matter but, as I read the clause, there is some discretion given. Therefore, I am slightly puzzled by his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-22_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. However, the very point to which he refers is in the Bill, and I would leave it in the Bill. Ofcom does have to have regard in particular to the general economic and market conditions. I do not seek to strike that from the Bill. However, as the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, said, this is a second provision which is particular to the particular company. It is that which seems to me to drive a coach and horses through the strength of these enforcement powers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-22_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell: </B>   My Lords, I have made my point. I do not wish to add anything further.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-22_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, Amendment No. 31 relates to the circumstances in which Ofcom may choose not to impose direct regulation on a broadcaster in the case of a serious failure either to fulfil the broadcaster's own public service remit or to make an adequate contribution to the overall public service remit. The Bill provides that Ofcom's enforcement powers can be used only if it considers that the broadcaster's failure is serious and is not excused by economic or market conditions. Enforcement powers include removing the broadcaster's self-regulation&#151;in the third tier of the public service regime&#151;and imposing direct regulation on that broadcaster.
<P>

<a name="30708-22_para3"></a>Amendment No. 31 would prevent Ofcom considering whether a broadcaster's failure either to fulfil its individual public service remit or to make an adequate contribution are excused by economic or market conditions. So it would reduce the circumstances in which Ofcom could exempt a broadcaster under Clause 268(2)(a) to those in which the failure was not considered to be serious. Under Clause 268(2)(b) Ofcom also has to determine whether the situation requires the exercise of its enforcement powers. As the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, explained, it would not be realistic or reasonable for Ofcom to ignore the impact of economic and market conditions on the ability of licensed broadcasters to fulfil their remits.
<P>

<a name="30708-22_para4"></a>All licensed broadcasters operate in a commercial market, as the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, said. They are affected by external economic conditions. Concern was expressed both in Committee and on <P>


<a name="column_208"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 208</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Report that the double reference to "economic and market conditions" in Clause 263 might allow economic and market conditions to become Ofcom's overriding consideration when making a judgment about using enforcement powers. I shall set out again why that would not occur.
<P>

<a name="30708-22_para5"></a>Under subsection (2)(a), Ofcom will consider whether the failure of the provider is serious and whether or not that failure is excused by economic and market conditions. I should make this clear because the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, made a great point about subsidiaries and the possibility of a broadcaster starving the service of funds. The question is whether the failure is excused by economic conditions specific to the broadcaster. We do not think that Ofcom would conclude that the failure was excused if the failure was caused by the broadcaster's incompetence. We are still looking at economic or market conditions.
<P>

<a name="30708-22_para6"></a>Under subsection (2)(b), Ofcom will determine whether the situation requires the exercise of its powers, having regard to a number of matters including the general economic and market conditions affecting broadcasters. "General economic and market conditions" in subsection (3) therefore relates to Ofcom's decision on whether or not to exercise its enforcement powers. The reference removed by this amendment concerns the nature of a provider's failure to fulfil the public service remit.
<P>

<a name="30708-22_para7"></a>The combined effect of those two provisions is that Ofcom can consider whether the specific failure of the provider is excused by economic or market conditions and can decide&#151;taking into account a number of factors, one of which is the general economic and market conditions affecting broadcasters across the board&#151;whether to take enforcement action. We do not accept that these provisions give economic and market conditions too great an influence over Ofcom's enforcement powers.
<P>

<a name="30708-22_para8"></a>I should make it very clear that the issue of whether or not a failure can be excused by economic or market conditions will be judged by Ofcom, not the broadcaster. The enforcement process must have due regard to the realities of the marketplace in which commercial broadcasters have to operate. However, it is not intended to provide an easy get-out for broadcasters wanting to escape their public service obligations. I am confident that Ofcom will not regard it in that way.
<P>

<a name="30708-22_para9"></a>In short, I believe that the Bill as it stands formulates Ofcom's enforcement powers in a sensible way and that it would not be right to remove the existing reference to economic or market conditions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-22_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, I should like to ask a question, an affirmative answer to which would go some way towards reassuring me. Where Ofcom is looking at a broadcaster in order to form an opinion on whether its failure to comply with public service broadcasting standards is excused by economic or market conditions, what will be the position if it turns out to be a subsidiary which has not been incompetent but <P>


<a name="column_209"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 209</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>whose parent company&#151;the media group or holding company&#151;has simply not provided sufficient capitalisation for it to undertake programming that meets its public service broadcasting requirements? Would that bring the individual broadcaster within the net? Would that excuse the broadcaster or would it not? I feel sure that the Minister will see my point. I know from my own professional life that a great deal of extreme financial cunning is employed in such groups. What if it were possible to construct financially a set-up whereby the financial problems of the subsidiary could not be taken back to the parent company for the purposes of this clause?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-22_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, has repeated at length the argument that he used in his original speech. My answer is "No". The question is whether the failure is excused by economic conditions specific to the broadcaster. It does not matter whether it is a subsidiary or a parent company. Ofcom will not allow someone to get round their obligations by setting up a subsidiary and starving it of funds.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-22_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   My Lords, I take that last reply to mean "Yes" and not "No"&#151;that Ofcom could take account of the parent company's conduct in deciding whether the wholly-owned subsidiary had an excuse. That is of considerable solace. I hope that the Minister is right in that. I suspect that it may be a passage of Hansard that is pored over. As I detect little support from other Benches, with reluctance, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="30708-23_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence   (Lord Bach) </B>  rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 28th April be approved [18th Report from the Joint Committee].
<P>

<a name="30708-23_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the order is an essential part of the process by which Parliament continues in force the service discipline Acts. The main element of that process is the five-yearly Armed Forces Acts. The most recent of these, the Act that we passed in 2001, extended the lives of the Army and Air Force Acts 1955 and the Naval Discipline Act 1957 for a further five years. However, this is subject to both Houses approving an order such as this one in each intervening year. The service discipline Acts provide the statutory basis for discipline in the Armed Forces. <P>


<a name="column_210"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 210</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Because of that they are of critical importance, and so therefore is this order, as the means of ensuring that the discipline Acts remain in force. The draft order was approved in another place on 1st July.
<P>

<a name="30708-23_para2"></a>The Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the order addresses its compatibility with the rights provided under the European Convention on Human Rights. The order raises convention issues only in that it continues in force three Acts that have been developed over the years, by successive administrations, to reflect the rights set out in the convention. In last year's debate, I mentioned the European Court of Human Rights judgment in the case of Morris v the United Kingdom. That court had taken the view that the procedures for post-trial review provided for in the service discipline Acts were not compatible with Article 6 of the convention. That was on the basis that the involvement of non-judicial service authorities in the review of court martial findings and sentences impaired the independence of the court martial. They took that view even though the process is intended as a safeguard for the accused.
<P>

<a name="30708-23_para3"></a>I advised the House last year that we had not yet decided how to react to that judgment. I did so because the same issues concerning post-trial review were also being addressed by your Lordships' House in its judicial capacity. We naturally wanted to await their Lordships' judgment before taking a decision on the future of the review procedure.
<P>

<a name="30708-23_para4"></a>As it happens, that judgment, in the case of Boyd, Hastie and Spear, expressed a positive view of the procedure. It accepted that post-trial review served as a safeguard for the accused. The judgment also acknowledged that any changes made as a result of the review process were themselves appealable, so that the courts would be able to have the last word on the cases concerned. In formulating their own judgment, their Lordships were fully aware of the earlier Strasbourg judgment in the Morris case.
<P>

<a name="30708-23_para5"></a>Because of the judgment by the Appellate Committee, we are able to say this year that the service discipline Acts are compatible with the convention rights and that so also is the present order continuing the Acts.
<P>

<a name="30708-23_para6"></a>So where does that leave us? The issue of the compatibility of the review procedure has been raised again in the case of Grieves. Because of the conflicting judgments in the previous two cases, the Grieves case is going to be heard by the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights. The hearing will be later this year. It would, of course, be inappropriate to anticipate what this further judgment will say or to consider at this stage how we might react to it, although we are keen to have the issue settled.
<P>

<a name="30708-23_para7"></a>One conclusion we can draw from their Lordships' judgment is that it illustrates how valuable it can be that our domestic courts are now more readily able to address convention points, following the Human Rights Act. The Grand Chamber of the European Court will now have the benefit of the arguments set out in the Appellate Committee's judgment. This has not been the case with previous cases concerning our military justice system that have gone to Strasbourg. We should see this as a positive advance.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30708-23_para8"></a>I should now like to move on to our plans to replace the service discipline Acts with a single tri-service Act. This is in order to provide a framework of Armed Forces legislation that will better meet the future needs of the services.
<P>

<a name="30708-23_para9"></a>We are continuing to develop policy for the proposed new legislation. The focus remains on establishing how best to harmonise the services' differing disciplinary powers and procedures. This is so that the tri-service Act will fulfil the objective of improving the administration of discipline where the services operate together. We are looking closely at the arrangements for summary discipline and for courts martial. In doing so, we are aiming to build on those aspects that are common between the services, while seeking to ensure that their requirements are appropriately reflected in the new procedures.
<P>

<a name="30708-23_para10"></a>At the same time, we are looking at the other areas covered by the legislation, such as the system for members of the Armed Forces making complaints. This is at present essentially the same in all the services. However, the tri-service Act will be an opportunity to try to develop procedures that better meet the likely future expectations of our people.
<P>

<a name="30708-23_para11"></a>The Government and the Armed Forces attach considerable importance to the tri-service Act project. This is reflected in the substantial resources that are being devoted to working out both the principles and the detail of the legislation. Although the work on policy development is taking a little longer than we had envisaged, this is not affecting our overall timetable. In any case, as I know the House will readily agree, it really is essential that we get the policy right. Nevertheless we hope that the next five-yearly Armed Forces Bill, due in the 2005&#150;06 Session, can be the vehicle for the tri-service legislation. This will obviously be subject to the availability of parliamentary time for what is expected to be a very large Bill.
<P>

<a name="30708-23_para12"></a>I know that the noble Lord, Lord Vivian, is concerned about consultation on the Bill before its formal introduction. I do not intend today to outline what form such consultation will take. It is, if I may say so, a little early to do so for a Bill which is most unlikely to be introduced in either of the next two Sessions. We shall keep the options under review, and I have little doubt that nearer the time we shall discuss these through the usual channels.
<P>

<a name="30708-23_para13"></a>However, I can assure the noble Lord and the House that we fully appreciate the depth of experience and expertise on these matters in your Lordships' House. It will certainly be our intention to assist the House by providing details of the main proposals for the tri-service Act once we have firmed these up. As I suggested last year, I imagine that this alone will be sufficient to generate reactions of various sorts from noble Lords.
<P>

<a name="30708-23_para14"></a>Discipline in the Armed Forces is not a goal in itself. It serves the vital function of underpinning operational effectiveness. I scarcely need to remind this House of how both the effectiveness of our forces and their <P>


<a name="column_212"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 212</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>discipline have recently been put to the most demanding of tests. They have come through with flying colours.
<P>

<a name="30708-23_para15"></a>Our attention in the past few months has naturally been focused on the operations in the Gulf region. However, I know that the House would not want for one moment to overlook what the men and women of the three services do on our behalf, wherever they are serving at the time. They are among the nation's most priceless assets, and I am sure that the House will once again wish to join me in paying tribute to them. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-23_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Vivian: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the Minister for moving the order. I am grateful also for the order which will follow in due course. I wish to speak to both orders. The first concerns the annual continuation order for the Army, Air Force and Naval Discipline Acts and the second concerns the Armed Forces (Review of Search and Seizure) Order 2003. From these Benches we support these two orders and I am grateful to the Minister for his clear explanation of the first order. I have no doubt that he will also clearly explain the second order.
<P>

<a name="30708-23_para17"></a>I am sure that I do not need to remind your Lordships of the critical importance of high morale for our Armed Forces, which consists of the fair application of military discipline, good sound training and high military ethos. The efficiency and state of morale of a regiment is the sole responsibility of a commanding officer and for that reason such military discipline powers are vested in him. If we undermine those powers or reduce them in any way, we shall destroy the ethos and morale of regiments and may be left with inefficient regiments that may not be successful in times of conflict. I sincerely hope that no further amendments will be made to the summary discipline powers of a commanding officer and no more changes made to the courts martial system.
<P>

<a name="30708-23_para18"></a>Throughout the drafting process of the new tri-service Bill mentioned by the Minister, I can only hope that after every clause has been drafted the question is asked: "Have we undermined or reduced the powers of a commanding officer in any way"? Should the answer be in the affirmative, the clause really must be re-examined to prevent those powers being reduced. The new Bill will be of such importance that every attempt should be made to retain the effectiveness of the military discipline system, ensuring that commanding officers retain their full powers.
<P>

<a name="30708-23_para19"></a>I have a number of questions to ask but I shall keep my remarks short. First, I shall deal with the continuation order 2003 and then with the search and seizure order. When we processed the 2002 continuation order about a year ago, I covered a number of points that do not yet appear to have been followed up, but I expect that in due course they will be resolved.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30708-23_para20"></a>Could the Minister expand on what progress has been made in the drafting of the tri-service measure so far? The Minister will recall that he said that by this year the policy development stage should be complete and that he would consider whether it would be possible to publish information about the Government's proposals. Is the policy development stage now complete?
<P>

<a name="30708-23_para21"></a>Last year I made the observation that due to the nature of the three services and their different roles there may be a need to introduce some parts of the Bill which will be applicable only to a specific service. Could the Minister say what progress has been made in relation to the possible need for that?
<P>

<a name="30708-23_para22"></a>This is an opportunity to comment on some disciplinary matters that have occurred in Iraq over recent months. It has been reported that two soldiers were returned from Iraq because they questioned the legality of the war and yet it would appear that no disciplinary charges will be brought against them. Could the Minister say if there is any truth in this allegation and, if there is, what are the reasons for not bringing military charges against them? A second point for concern is the allegations against a number of British soldiers who may have committed serious crimes against Iraqi prisoners of war. Will the Minister assure the House that if, as a result of investigations, the case is substantiated, the strongest possible action will be taken against them if they are found to blame?
<P>

<a name="30708-23_para23"></a>I move to a matter that I raised last year concerning the International Criminal Court. The Minister informed me that the complementary provisions of the statute whereby we have primacy of jurisdiction in cases where our nationals are accused provide the protection that our service personnel require. He went on to say that, in other words, if the UK decided that there was no case to answer, then the International Criminal Court would not have jurisdiction unless it could claim that the United Kingdom was deliberately shielding war criminals or that the justice system had broken down. It would appear that the International Criminal Court could misinterpret or misunderstand the UK position of "no case to answer", with the understanding that the UK was unwilling or unable to proceed with a prosecution. If that happened, it could give rise to the International Criminal Court claiming jurisdiction over such an incidence. Will the Minister kindly give the House further reassurance on this issue?
<P>

<a name="30708-23_para24"></a>I turn briefly to the second order, the Armed Forces (Review of Search and Seizure) Order 2003. I understand that the order has been laid as Part 2 of the 2001 Act, providing for the first time a statutory regime for powers of entry, search and seizure in connection with the investigations of offences under the Army Act 1955, the Air Force Act 1955 and the Naval Discipline Act 1957, and that this draft order will be part of that regime. The powers of a commanding officer for entry, search and seizure of property has been discussed in great detail previously and I understand that the proposed order will continue to allow commanding officers to have those limited powers, subject to judicial review. If I am correct in my <P>


<a name="column_214"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 214</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>assertions, will the Minister assure the House that the Armed Forces legal directorates are content with the order?
<P>

<a name="30708-23_para25"></a>In conclusion, I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the men and women, and to the families, of our Armed Forces. They have been over-committed and many of their families have faced extra-long periods of separation. They have performed their tasks highly successfully, with great skill, bravery and determination, and I am sure that all of your Lordships, on all sides of the House, are immensely proud of all their many achievements.
<P>

<a name="30708-23_para26"></a>In the recent defence debate, I stressed the importance of ensuring that the Armed Forces are given a fair deal. I should like to take this occasion to remind the Minister to examine now how pay, conditions of service and allowances can be increased and improved; as, otherwise, we may lose many trained and experienced servicemen. The tri-service Armed Forces disciplinary Bill is yet another part of this fair deal. It is essential that this new legislation is right and easy for commanding officers to interpret and administrate. As I have said, military discipline, in combination with the military ethos and sound training, ensures high morale and operational effectiveness.

<P>
<A NAME="30708-24_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Redesdale: </B>   My Lords, I shall speak to both orders. The Minister mentioned the case of Grieves&#151;confirming the court martial and the fact that the case will be heard by the European Court of European Rights. We shall have to await the outcome; but if the outcome goes against the Government, what action will be taken, and under what time-scale?
<P>

<a name="30708-24_para0"></a>We support the move to a tri-service Act, which is seen to be in 2005&#150;06&#151;although the Minister said in his introduction that this will be down to the availability of time. That is a form of words often used by Ministers, but I hope that he will confirm that it will be seen as an essential piece of legislation. Its importance is such that, in another place, Dr Lewis Moonie mentioned the fact that it was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Vivian, last year. It is only fair&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, for the record, I think that the honourable Member to whom the noble Lord refers was my colleague the Minister, Mr Ivor Caplin.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-24_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Redesdale: </B>   My Lords, that was last year obviously, but Dr Moonie raised this point in the House of Commons Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation this year. I apologise to the House for not making that clear.
<P>

<a name="30708-24_para1"></a>The only reason I raise the point is that it is rare for this House to receive a mention in another place and the noble Lord, Lord Vivian, should be aware of the compliment paid to him by Dr Moonie. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Lord Vivian was a brigadier in the Army. He has vast experience of the armed forces, as have so many Members of the upper House. Many have served in the highest positions in each of the armed forces. The contribution that they can make to the process cannot be overestimated".

I mention that because, obviously, we like to believe that the debates in this House are taken note of in another place. In talking about the provisions for court martial and the changes that will be made, the noble Lord, Lord Vivian, mentioned the powers of commanding officers. We take on board the importance of the views of commanding officers.
<P>

<a name="30708-24_para3"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Vivian, also raised the question of the two service personnel who questioned the legality of war in Iraq. Before the vote in the House of Commons, we on these Benches questioned the legality of war in Iraq. We question at what stage those prosecutions will be taken, if they are to be taken at all. However, I was interested to note from newspaper articles&#151;I merely give this the weight that it was given in the press&#151;the stated position of Robin Cook in regard to the legality of the war in Iraq.
<P>

<a name="30708-24_para4"></a>We support all the work that is being done by our troops in Iraq at the present time and do not question their professionalism. We support both orders. I very much hope that the tri-service Act proposed for 2005&#150;06 will be brought forward.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-24_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Attlee: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation of the order. I remind the House that I have a peripheral interest. I say "peripheral" because I no longer serve in the Regular Army and I am not likely to called up again for some time, I hope. I serve for only a few days a year with the TA.
<P>

<a name="30708-24_para5"></a>I have no difficulty with the orders themselves. The Minister mentioned the complaints procedure, otherwise known as the grievance procedure. I can assure him that there is much scope for improvement in the grievance procedure, particularly in respect of the time-scales to draw such matters to a conclusion.
<P>

<a name="30708-24_para6"></a>Prior to going to the Gulf, I had to consider whether I was prepared to take the anthrax vaccination. I did. On mobilisation, it was very clearly a free, informed choice as to whether or not one was going to take the vaccination. Great efforts were made in that regard.
<P>

<a name="30708-24_para7"></a>Interestingly, and despite trying quite hard myself, I was unable to obtain a booster vaccination in theatre. Consequently, the cost of the original vaccination, which I understand is quite expensive, was wasted, and now I have no protection against anthrax.
<P>

<a name="30708-24_para8"></a>But during the operation in Iraq Ministers authorised the taking of the NAPS tablets&#151;the nerve agent pre-treatment sets. NAPS is a prophylactic treatment to mitigate the effects of nerve agent poisoning. However, service personnel were compelled under military law to take the NAPS tablets. I had no difficulty with that; I wanted to take them in order to be fully protected. But can the Minister explain why military law was used to compel the taking of NAPS but not the anthrax vaccination?

<A NAME="30708-24_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Burnham: </B>   My Lords, the Minister will be in no doubt whatever why I have risen to my feet on this subject. I have done so every year since 1997 in regard to the renewal of the tri-service Act. When the noble Lord <P>


<a name="column_216"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 216</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>says that a tri-service discipline Act is taking a little longer than we envisaged, that is an understatement. That is clearly the case of Jarndyce and Jarndyce. I have no doubt whatever that it will be many years before we have a tri-service discipline Act. There is no reason why that should be so. There was talk about the next two Sessions.
<P>

<a name="30708-24_para9"></a>My noble friend Lord Vivian and the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, were far too gentle with the Minister and with his civil servants on the delay in getting a tri-service Act together. The civil servants, the people who should be producing it, need a very serious kicking so that we can have a draft Bill by this time next year, when we next discuss the renewal of this order. I hope and believe that the noble Lord, Lord Gilbert, will support me on those points.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-24_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken on this order. Some important points have been made. I thank noble Lords for their support for the continuation order. It is very important. I agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Vivian, said about the critical importance of high morale. That is at the centre of everything that we are trying to do in this area.
<P>

<a name="30708-24_para10"></a>I have been asked a number of questions. One concerned why the tri-service Bill is taking so long. The noble Lord, Lord Burnham, in his inimitable way, suggested that there had been undue delay up to now. I do not believe that that is fair. It is likely to be a very long Bill, if it comes before Parliament at all. The House will know that after five years we must have a discipline Bill before Parliament, as we did in 2001. We very much want the next one to be the tri-service Bill. It must be understood that that will be a long piece of legislation because of the changes that it will mean to the three Acts that presently apply. Such matters take a very long time. I shall bear in mind what the noble Lord, Lord Burnham, said. If I am in this place this time next year I shall come here fearful and I dare say that my civil servants will come even more fearful.
<P>

<a name="30708-24_para11"></a>Why the delay? What is holding up matters? I want to be frank with the House. I said that we hoped that the policy development would be complete and it is not. I have to concede that. In principle, the services have agreed that the tri-service Bill, as it is called, should provide for a single system of service law, which would replace the separate systems that we are used to. If achieved it would mean that for the first time personnel in all three services will have the same rights and be subject to the same disciplinary powers. In many of those areas&#151;for example, in the courts martial system&#151;the services have largely agreed on common future procedures that will make the service system of law a reality.
<P>

<a name="30708-24_para12"></a>There are some significant issues of detail that remain to be decided, notably in the key area of summary discipline. The three services are proud of their traditions and the noble Lord, Lord Burnham, knows them as well as anyone in the House. It has not yet been possible to settle on a harmonised level of <P>


<a name="column_217"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 217</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>powers to be exercisable by commanding officers. The main difficulty is the extent of the present differences between the Royal Navy and the other services.
<P>

<a name="30708-24_para13"></a>At present the Royal Navy is able to deal summarily with a much wider range of offences and is able to award greater punishment than either the Army or the RAF. The Royal Navy has a maximum period in detention of 90 days, for example, rather than the 60 days available to the other two services. Work continues on finding a suitable harmonised level of powers. That is a key issue for a tri-service Act and one that we shall have to solve. Perhaps for once it is not fair to blame the Civil Service, but we should perhaps ask the services themselves to come to an accommodation on that. I am confident that in the normal way they will.
<P>

<a name="30708-24_para14"></a>I was asked about discipline in two different forms by the noble Lord, Lord Vivian. One was in relation to the two soldiers who were mentioned in the newspapers. The point was taken at length by his honourable friend in another place, but that is not a good point. The two soldiers returned home for different and separate reasons. One soldier wanted to go home because of a serious domestic problem which I do not intend to go into. Through discussion with the soldier, the real reasons for him wanting to get out of Iraq were identified. The soldier was compassionately returned to the UK; he is still serving with his regiment and has no desire to leave the Army. It would have been inappropriate for disciplinary action to have been considered in his case.
<P>

<a name="30708-24_para15"></a>The second soldier was a young man who suffered psychiatric problems during his time in the Gulf. He was returned home for medical reasons and assessed as being temperamentally unsuited to military service and has been discharged. I hope that the noble Lord will agree that both those cases&#151;I shall not go into any more detail&#151;were suitably dealt with, as is often the case.
<P>

<a name="30708-24_para16"></a>We know that there are a number of allegations against British soldiers of mistreatment of Iraqis. As the noble Lord would expect, we take such allegations extremely seriously and full investigations are taking place. I shall not comment on any individual case today.
<P>

<a name="30708-24_para17"></a>On a tri-service Act and on undermining commanding officers, it is key that any changes should underpin operational effectiveness. That, of course, means the commanding officer's role still being very important.
<P>

<a name="30708-24_para18"></a>I was asked about the International Criminal Court. I do not believe that the noble Lord, Lord Vivian, need worry. As he knows, the purpose of the International Criminal Court is to ensure that those who commit the gravest crimes do not do so with impunity. Those crimes are crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide. There is no question of the ICC investigating any allegations of breaches of international law other than the ones in statute.
<P>

<a name="30708-24_para19"></a>UK service personnel are not at risk from malicious or politically motivated investigation or prosecution by the ICC. Under the statute, the UK has <P>


<a name="column_218"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 218</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>complementary jurisdiction to the ICC, so it is for the UK, and not the International Criminal Court, to investigate and if necessary prosecute any allegations against UK personnel.
<P>

<a name="30708-24_para20"></a>The ICC could intervene against our wishes only if it could claim that the UK was unwilling or unable to proceed; in effect, that means that our system of justice needs to have broken down or that we were deliberately shielding something. In my view, that is inconceivable.
<P>

<a name="30708-24_para21"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, tempts me to say what we would do about the Grieves case. In the words of a very famous former Liberal Prime Minister, he will have to wait and see. Of course we are not going to commit ourselves at this stage, nor would he expect us to. As far as a tri-service Act is concerned, we shall do our best, as he requests.
<P>

<a name="30708-24_para22"></a>I was particularly pleased to hear from the noble Earl, Lord Attlee. We know that he served in the Gulf. He was too modest about his role. As noble Lords from all sides of the House have said, we are very proud indeed to have him as one of our number. I am flattering him to some extent because I do not have the faintest idea what the answer is to the question with which he finished his speech. I promise to write to the noble Earl as soon as I possibly can with the answer.
<P>

<a name="30708-24_para23"></a>The noble Earl referred to grievance procedures being too long. We recognise the need to speed up decisions. That is part of the work we are effecting on the tri-service legislation.
<P>

<a name="30708-24_para24"></a>I hope that I have covered the questions asked by noble Lords.
<P>

<a name="30708-24_para25"></a>On Question, Motion agreed to.

<P>
<A NAME="30708-25_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bach </B>   rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 28th April be approved [19th Report from the Joint Committee].
<P>

<a name="30708-25_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the draft order will be made under the Armed Forces Act 2001, which requires that it will follow the affirmative procedure, needing approval by both Houses. The draft was approved in another place on 2nd July.
<P>

<a name="30708-25_para1"></a>Part 2 of the 2001 Act provides a statutory regime for powers of entry, search and seizure in connection with the investigations of offences under the Army Act 1955, the Air Force Act 1955 and the Naval Discipline Act 1957. It does not affect commanding officers' powers to authorise searches within their units for purposes other than the investigation of offences, or to search service premises that are not living accommodation. That is spelt out in Section 16 of the Act.
<P>

<a name="30708-25_para2"></a>By and large, Part 2 reflects the procedures that have to be followed by the civil police under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Thus, the usual <P>


<a name="column_219"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 219</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>procedure for entering and searching premises will be by warrant granted by a judicial officer under Section 5 of the Act.
<P>

<a name="30708-25_para3"></a>However, Part 2 is also designed to cater for the realities of service life. It is recognised that it will not always be practicable in the Armed Forces to obtain a warrant in advance of an entry and search of premises. Section 7 of the Act therefore provides commanding officers with a limited power to authorise a search without a warrant of the living accommodation of persons under their command.
<P>

<a name="30708-25_para4"></a>Following a search under Section 7, in which property has been seized and retained, Section 8 provides that the commanding officer must request a judicial officer to undertake a review of the search and of the seizure and retention of the property. That is to provide appropriate retrospective safeguards in the absence of a warrant. Section 8 also enables the Secretary of State to make orders prescribing the powers and duties of judicial officers in respect of these reviews. This draft order sets out those powers and duties, particularly the criteria for decisions on the retention or return of property that has been seized. The judicial officer shall adopt such procedures at the review as he sees fit, although he shall take into account representations made by certain people, including the officer who authorised the search and the occupier of the premises that were searched.
<P>

<a name="30708-25_para5"></a>The draft order details the circumstances when seized property should be returned. Special provision is made for when the judicial officer is satisfied that it would be in the interests of justice to permit the retention of property. The legal services in the Armed Forces are content with this section of the Bill. They were obviously consulted when the Bill went through the House and of course they have been consulted on this draft order.
<P>

<a name="30708-25_para6"></a>Part 2 of the 2001 Act responds to the need for the services to remove uncertainty and to have a clear structure and definition for their powers of search and the seizure of property. It is planned that it will be commenced in its entirety on 30th September this year. The provisions of this order have to be in place before Part 2 as a whole can take effect. I commend the draft order to the House. I beg to move.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-25_para15"></a><P>

<a name="30708-25_para16"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I speak also to Amendments Nos. 34 to 45, 72, 80, 117, 119, 122, 126 and 145 to 147.
<P>

<a name="30708-25_para17"></a>During Committee we listened with interest to very considerable debate on the nomination and ownership rules for the Channel 3 news provider. We were convinced by the arguments in favour of their removal. I indicated on Report that I would be tabling amendments to make changes to the Bill. These amendments lift most of the ownership restrictions of the Channel 3 news provider and remove the obligation that the news provider be selected from bodies nominated by Ofcom.
<P>

<a name="30708-25_para18"></a>The Bill will still require that national news on regional Channel 3 programmes is provided by a single body corporate, but removes the system that requires that body to be nominated by Ofcom.
<P>

<a name="30708-25_para19"></a>The amendments will remove the rules restricting anyone from owning more than 20 per cent of the appointed news provider, which prevented ITV from owning its own news provider.
<P>

<a name="30708-25_para20"></a>Ownership restrictions will still apply so that any body which is prevented from holding a Channel 3 licence by Part 2 of Schedule 2 to the 1990 Act faces equivalent restrictions as regards being, or having an interest in, the Channel 3 news provider. For example, political bodies would not be able to be, control, or own more than a 5 per cent interest in, the news provider.
<P>

<a name="30708-25_para21"></a>In addition, ownership restrictions that apply to a Channel 3 licence also apply to the news provider so that, for example, a national or local newspaper with 20 per cent or more of the market cannot be the Channel 3 news provider. A national newspaper with 20 per cent or more of the market cannot have more than a 20 per cent share in the news provider and the news provider cannot have more than a 20 per cent interest in such a newspaper.
<P>

<a name="30708-25_para22"></a>We believe that these rules are fair. It would be odd, to say the least, to allow a body that could not hold a Channel 3 licence to provide the news for it. The current rules prevent anyone from holding more than a 20 per cent interest in the news provider, so the new rules leave those affected in the same position as everyone is under current rules.
<P>

<a name="30708-25_para23"></a>We have been careful to maintain the quality regulation applied to the news provider contract. There will continue to be provisions requiring that <P>


<a name="column_221"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 221</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Channel 3's national news is able to compete with other national news services. The requirements for Ofcom to approve the contract for the appointed news provider to ensure that it is adequately funded will also remain.
<P>

<a name="30708-25_para24"></a>We have also included provisions so that Ofcom will be able to obtain all the information it needs from ITV or the appointed news provider to assure itself that the necessary arrangements are in place and working properly. We are grateful to both ITN and ITV, whom we have consulted on the transitional provisions.
<P>

<a name="30708-25_para25"></a>The Bill as amended will also allow for the creation of a Channel 5 scheme comparable to the appointed news provider system for Channel 3 and we will be able to modify by order the quality and ownership aspects of the Channel 3 scheme and any Channel 5 scheme. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-25_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his helpful explanation of the purpose and effect of these amendments. He made a fulsome statement at the Report stage in which he signalled that the Government had been persuaded by the case for change and he has been true to his word.
<P>

<a name="30708-25_para26"></a>These amendments are good news for ITN and will help to ensure that there is strong competition in the news supply market between ITN, the BBC and Sky News in the years to come.
<P>

<a name="30708-25_para27"></a>In removing unnecessary ownership regulation and the arcane nominated news provider arrangements, these amendments bring the Bill closer to the Government's original intention. But, importantly, as the Minister has said, they also retain the quality aspects of Clause 278 that require ITV to supply a news programme that is competitive with other national news programmes and that give Ofcom the power to approve the terms of any future contract as adequate to deliver ITV's news obligations.
<P>

<a name="30708-25_para28"></a>I understand from discussions with ITN and ITV that the amendments in no way affect the status of the current ITV news contract, which will run unchanged until 2008, and that they will have no effect on other important ITN contracts such as that for Channel 4. That is good news.
<P>

<a name="30708-25_para29"></a>Finally, I thank the Minister once again for bringing forward these amendments and for being persuaded of the case for change that was made so eloquently by distinguished Members on all sides of your Lordships' House. We support the amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-25_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, I echo what has been said by the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe. I had great pleasure in working with her on these matters at an earlier stage of the Bill. Would that we could have worked together on some other aspects&#151;but there it is.
<P>

<a name="30708-25_para30"></a>It was touching to find that the 20:20 rules, which at four o'clock today were part of yesterday's legislation, appear back spanking new. I am pleased that the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, is not present to hear that. But as the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, said, this is good news; it is a win-win situation.

<P>

<a name="30708-25_para31"></a>It is good news for the British people because they have a chance of getting ITN back to its glory days. One of the interesting issues about the Iraq war was that when ITN was given the extra resources during the war, it showed that it had lost none of its old elan, skills and zip. That is only to the good.
<P>

<a name="30708-25_para32"></a>Whatever happens as regards the ownership of ITV, surely the lesson is that a news provider which is an integral part of the organisation, as BBC news is with BBC and Sky News is with Sky, is better cared for and a better organisation. That gives us genuine competition, quality and diversity, which is to be welcomed.
<P>

<a name="30708-25_para33"></a>I welcome the positive way in which the Minister has approached the matter and we fully support the amendments.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30708-26_para20"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in the previous stages, we had a debate which I thought was rather theological at times on the words "suitable and sufficient". My noble friend Lord Puttnam accused me of missing a slam dunk opportunity&#151;whatever that means&#151;to make a meaningful concession. We are not missing the slam dunk opportunity now. We felt that the words then proposed were too loose and might not provide Ofcom with the tools necessary to ensure that levels of regional production and programming are sustained in the future. However, we recognised the strength of feeling and we undertook to do what we could to address the concerns expressed. This could be by incorporating the word "significant" along with a qualification&#151;which we believe is immensely important&#151;to ensure that Ofcom retains the flexibility it needs to treat different services differently.
<P>

<a name="30708-26_para21"></a>We undertook to come back with suggestions on Third Reading, which is what we have done. Amendment No. 46 provides that in determining what is a suitable proportion for the purpose of Clause 283, Ofcom must not regard a proportion as suitable if it constitutes less than a significant proportion of the <P>


<a name="column_224"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 224</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>programmes or expenditure in question. The suitable proportions in question are the proportion of Channel 3 or Channel 4 programmes to be made in the United Kingdom outside the M25 area. We also detail the proportion of expenditure by the providers of Channel 3 services or the Channel 5 service on programme production at different production centres outside the M25 area.
<P>

<a name="30708-26_para22"></a>Amendment No. 48 makes similar provision to Clause 285, which deals with Channel 4. Although the amendments tabled on Report did not cover Channel 4, we think that equivalent changes should be made in the interests of consistency.
<P>

<a name="30708-26_para23"></a>Amendment No. 47 provides that in determining what is a suitable proportion for the purpose of Clause 284, Ofcom must not regard a proportion as suitable if it constitutes less than a significant proportion of the programmes in question. The suitable programmes in question here are the proportion of regional local programmes to be made in the area for which the service is provided and the proportion of regional programmes, other than news, to be shown at or adjacent to peak time.
<P>

<a name="30708-26_para24"></a>We believe that these amendments deal with the points of concern expressed in this House while preserving the essential flexibility for Ofcom and avoiding undue interference in broadcasters' commissioning and scheduling decisions. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-26_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   My Lords, we support Amendments Nos. 46, 47 and 48. The noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, said on Report that it is important that we get this matter right so that the production of television programmes in the regions is nurtured and sustained. But as the Minister pointed out, it is also important that Ofcom retains sufficient flexibility. It must be able to take account of the differences between smaller ITV licensees such as Border Television and the larger areas such as Granada, as well as the differences between Channels 3, 4, and 5. My noble friend Lord Crickhowell requested on Report that the Government meet the proponents of this cause half way. The noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, said that he would,

(c) in any other case, members of the public in the United Kingdom."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30708-27_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, throughout Committee and Report stages, there was general agreement that the obligation to give due prominence to the listing of public service channels on EPGs should apply to the national or regional variation of those channels provided for the area in which the channel was being watched; for example, BBC Wales in Wales or Granada in the North West. There were also concerns that we should find a form of words that gave the clearest possible indication of our public policy objective without predicting the outcome of any commercial negotiations that operators would need to conclude if we were to see the objective delivered.
<P>

<a name="30708-27_para1"></a>The amendments reconcile those different aims. Their effect would be that, where a public service channel is provided in different versions for different regions or areas, a viewer watching the channel in one of those areas could access the relevant version of the channel through the channel's primary EPG listing.
<P>

<a name="30708-27_para2"></a>To make it crystal clear, it is a matter of public policy that all regional variations of a public service channel should benefit from due prominence to the same extent. <P>


<a name="column_226"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 226</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>How that is achieved is a matter that should be determined through commercial negotiations under Ofcom's supervision.
<P>

<a name="30708-27_para3"></a>I hope that that statement will reassure both those who want regional versions of public service channels to be given due prominence, and those who want to make it clear that, in order to achieve that objective, broadcasters would pay, on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, for access to EPG and conditional access systems in so far as that was needed to secure regionalisation.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-27_para6"></a><P>

<a name="30708-27_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving this amendment, I shall speak to Amendment No. 55. I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 54 and 56, which we reject. It is right to require Ofcom to consult on a request for a departure from the character of a station. However, I do not accept that a requirement to consult places significant additional burdens on the industry. The process of requesting a change is no different from current arrangements, and there is no requirement on a radio station to do anything different or additional to what is currently required.
<P>

<a name="30708-27_para8"></a>The clause does not require radio stations to incur any expenditure. Any costs incurred by the radio industry will be those that they have chosen to incur, and entirely at their discretion. Some additional costs may be incurred by Ofcom in considering representations, but those are likely to be minimal and are justified by a more accountable and more transparent process.
<P>

<a name="30708-27_para9"></a>I am also confident that Ofcom, mindful of its general duties, will exercise this duty in a way that minimises the costs to the radio industry. I am therefore satisfied that it should be Ofcom's duty to consult. We have included the provision because it is important that, where appropriate, Ofcom should seek the views of others before allowing a departure from the character of a station.
<P>

<a name="30708-27_para10"></a>I understand that my noble friend Lord Eatwell, who is unable to attend this evening, sees merit in the government amendments. I am very grateful for that. I am in some ways sympathetic to the idea that Ofcom need only consult where the departure is significant, as set out in Amendment No. 54. However, unfortunately, the amendment as drafted would create an unwelcome clash of language between the new consultation provision that would apply when the departure was significant and the language of new subsection (1A), which allows Ofcom to make a departure where it is satisfied that it would not substantially alter the character of the service.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-27_para18"></a><P>

<a name="30708-27_para19"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I speak to Amendments Nos. 57 to 69, which concern economic regulation and appeal.
<P>

<a name="30708-27_para20"></a>I return to an issue that we debated extensively in Committee, and again on Report, and which I seek again to address through my amendments. It is an extremely important issue that concerns the scope of broadcasters' rights to appeal regulatory decisions of an economic nature to the Competition Appeals Tribunal. I am disappointed that we made no further progress on this matter on Report, and I believe that the Government's answers so far have failed to address all the concerns that I have raised.
<P>

<a name="30708-27_para21"></a>Under Ofcom's Competition Act powers or its sector-specific competition powers, economic regulation is, by definition, a matter of competition, and decisions taken through these routes by Ofcom are subject to full rights of appeal to the Competition Appeals Tribunal. Regulation of broadcasters through their licences "for a competition purpose" is also subject to full rights of appeal to the CAT, when that is the only or main reason for the decision.
<P>

<a name="30708-27_para22"></a>My concern, however, lies with the very real possibility that Ofcom may decide to undertake economic regulation of broadcasters&#151;their pricing or packaging of channels, for example&#151;for reasons that <P>


<a name="column_228"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 228</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have nothing to do with competition. Ofcom could, for example, use its duties under Clause 3 of the Bill to undertake such regulation&#151;either, as I have said before, using its duties to further the interests of citizens or consumers in relevant markets or&#151;and this is important&#151;to secure the availability of a wide range of TV and radio services.
<P>

<a name="30708-27_para23"></a>In such instances, the Bill would provide no right of appeal to the CAT, and instead would allow only for the more limited route of judicial review, which looks at the decision-making process only and not the merits of the decision. That contrasts with the economic regulation of, for example, telephony providers under Part 2 of the Bill, in which all decisions are subject to appeal to the CAT.
<P>

<a name="30708-27_para24"></a>In Committee and on Report, the Minister sought to reassure me on this matter. He argued that, because the duty in Clause 3 to promote the interests of consumers is limited by the parameter,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"where appropriate by promoting competition",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-27_para25"></a>
it would be,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"hard to imagine a situation where any intervention in pricing and packaging of channels . . .  would not be undertaken using Ofcom's competition powers".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-27_para26"></a>
It therefore follows that I get the result that I desire that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Such an intervention would have a route of appeal to the CAT".&#151;[Official Report, 1/7/03; col. 867.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-27_para27"></a><P>

<a name="30708-27_para28"></a>As far as it goes, that is a welcome reassurance. At least now, in the case of the duty to promote the interests of citizens and consumers in relevant markets, we have an indication from the Minister that, in practice, any economic regulation relating to the pricing and packaging under this duty will be appealable to the CAT. However, I am afraid that this is only a partial answer. As I have said, economic regulation of broadcasters could also take place under the Clause 3 duty to secure,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the availability throughout the UK of a wide range of television and radio services".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-27_para29"></a><P>

<a name="30708-27_para30"></a>My concern, therefore, does not just lie with the duty to further the interests of citizens. In his answers on Report and in Committee, the Minister appeared to misunderstand that point. On Report, he said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The amendment . . .  stems from her concern . . .  that if Ofcom undertakes economic regulation other than for a competition purpose . . .  under its duty in Clause 3 to promote the interests of consumers that broadcaster would not have a route of appeal to the Competition Appeal Tribunal".&#151;[Official Report, 1/7/03; col. 868.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-27_para31"></a>
That is not my argument. It goes wider than that, as I have just explained and as I explained in Committee and on Report. I am mystified as to why the Minister's answers fail to address the wider concerns that I have outlined and continue to focus on just one part of them.
<P>

<a name="30708-27_para32"></a>I have been brief in my comments, given the time already taken up by the matter. I hope that, even at this late stage in our deliberations, the Government will see the merits of the arguments that I have put forward in this and other debates and will accept my amendment. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30708-27_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, emphasised, we have debated the issues at some length. I am sorry that I have not been able to reassure her sufficiently for her not to have tabled the amendments at this stage.
<P>

<a name="30708-27_para33"></a>We must be clear about the issues contained in the amendment. It is important to understand the consequences of accepting the amendments. We believe that they have been prompted by a particular broadcaster, a point that noble Lords will wish to bear in mind. Accepting the amendments would risk opening the door to a regulatory regime that is very different from that contained in the Bill. The amendments would seriously damage Ofcom's ability to regulate effectively and flexibly. In particular, they would prevent Ofcom from taking proper account, alongside the important economic and competition issues, of the wider public and consumer issues that we have been pressed to include in the Bill, as we always intended.
<P>

<a name="30708-27_para34"></a>Several noble Lords and others have expressed a strong desire to see such interests properly protected. The draft Bill contained many references to that necessity. However, we have also made changes to the Bill as a result of pressure from all parts of the House. We have explained in detail the many procedural and other safeguards against misuse by Ofcom of powers in that area. It is vital that Ofcom is not made subject to further unnecessary handicaps such as the amendments would create.
<P>

<a name="30708-27_para35"></a>The noble Baroness will appreciate that I could go on at considerable length about the Government's case. I had great difficulty engaging the attention of noble Lords on the issues in Committee and on Report. Regrettably, we have not reached the agreement that I should have liked. At this late hour, I have no intention of reiterating all the arguments that I have presented in the past. Suffice it to say that we understand that there is at least one broadcaster who is anxious about the provision. I have tried to indicate that, if we met those representations, we would recast the regulatory structure of the Bill. In particular, we would reduce the impact and the effectiveness of the structure that is being created by due deliberation in the House of propositions that we have accepted.
<P>

<a name="30708-27_para36"></a>On that basis, I hope that the noble Baroness, having moved the amendment with her usual acumen, will think that I have a strong enough case to prevent her from pressing it.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-28_para9"></a><P>

<a name="30708-28_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 71, I recall that earlier today the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, said of another amendment that it was better to be late than inflexible. Although it is late in the day, I very much hope that he will not prove to be inflexible on this issue.
<P>

<a name="30708-28_para11"></a>The intention of the amendment is straightforward. It is that there should be reciprocal arrangements between one country and another on the ownership of radio and television services. The essential proposition is that if the rules in Britain allow a company in another country to take over a broadcasting organisation, such as ITV, British media companies should have the same rights in that other country. It would allow free trade on the basis of equal rights on a level playing field. It would bring the law into line with the position inside the European Union, where there are full reciprocal arrangements.
<P>

<a name="30708-28_para12"></a>The Government's position is significantly different from that. For example, they would certainly allow American media companies to take over ITV, but they are content that there are no reciprocal arrangements with the United States. We would therefore give complete freedom to an American company to own a British television company, but British companies would face a ban on ownership in the United States. It is not a question of being anti-American or protectionist. As it happens, I am passionately pro-American, and frankly I doubt whether any American administration that I can remember would have been daft enough to contemplate the one-sided arrangement that apparently the British Government are to go along with. Nor do I think that it is protectionist to allow access to our market but to insist that we should have equal rights. It seems self-evident business common sense. If the Government's aim is to <P>


<a name="column_231"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 231</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>negotiate reciprocal arrangements, I cannot see what will have been gained by throwing away our strongest negotiating card.
<P>

<a name="30708-28_para13"></a>When the noble Lord, Lord Gordon of Strathblane, proposed a similar amendment at Report stage, the Minister sought to dismiss these arguments as of no consequence. Let us examine the Government's case. It will be noted that the legislation that the Government seek to change is the Broadcasting Act 1990, in which, I remember only too well, my noble friend Lady Thatcher took a very close personal interest, to which I and others in this House can testify. She saw no reason to change the law, and she can hardly be described as either protectionist or anti-American.
<P>

<a name="30708-28_para14"></a>Even more to the point is the fact that up to 18 months ago the present Government saw no reason to change the law either. In November 2001, the Government said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Without reciprocal arrangements with other nations that will allow our own companies to expand into their markets, we do not feel that we could justify lifting our ban at the present time".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-28_para15"></a>
That was the present Government's position only 18 months ago. Therefore, I think that we can agree, if on nothing else, to dismiss the argument that this amendment and the amendment proposed earlier by the noble Lord, Lord Gordon, are of no consequence. Until a very short time ago, that was the policy of both major parties in this House.
<P>

<a name="30708-28_para16"></a>The Minister had additional arguments. First, he said on Report that the United States were not imposing a full ban. A British company could invest 20 per cent, even at times 25 per cent, in an American broadcasting company. Therefore, the proposition is that one party can take full control and full ownership, while British companies can take 20 per cent. It is precisely because that position is so inherently unsatisfactory that in another part of the Bill we are changing the ownership regulations relating to ITV and ITN.
<P>

<a name="30708-28_para17"></a>Secondly, he said that we are not unique and that other countries have no reciprocal arrangements either&#151;namely, Finland, Belgium, the Netherlands, as well as Germany, Spain and New Zealand. In practice, I think that in some of those countries a would-be investor from overseas might find himself in some practical difficulties when it comes to it. But leave that as it may.
<P>

<a name="30708-28_para18"></a>What is beyond doubt is that the issue of direct concern is of much greater concern to Britain than to any other country. There is no conceivable doubt about that. For the chairman of a big United States media company, the prize would not be Finland or Belgium, it would be ITV in Britain, which under this Bill will have the right to own ITN. There is a big population in this country; there is no difficulty in language; and there is the opportunity to distribute programmes and share news services. It is a natural target as far as an American company is concerned.
<P>


<a name="column_232"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 232</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30708-28_para19"></a>Why therefore have the Government changed their mind? The Minister says that the reason is that they have listened to everyone who has taken part in the debate, including the Joint Committee&#151;well,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Up to a point, Lord Copper".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-28_para20"></a>
The fact is that they have listened to some. The noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, who has added his name to this amendment, can speak for himself. But I observe that the Joint Committee's point was not that this was irrelevant, it was a rather different and rather longer point than that. I hope that noble Lords will bear with me while I read it. The Joint Committee stated that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"as matters stand, we do not view the argument on reciprocity as pivotal. If the economic case for permitting US investment emerged as compelling, we would see no impediment in principle in the form of waiting for reciprocal developments. But that case has yet to be established. OFCOM will face an enormous range of challenges immediately after it assumes its regulatory functions. We do not feel that it should face the additional pressure that would arise from the lifting of restrictions on non-EEA ownership until it has established itself as an effective regulator that commands market and public confidence".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-28_para21"></a>
It went on, of course, to make a detailed proposition.
<P>

<a name="30708-28_para22"></a>The fact is that it is not just that the Government did not go along with my proposal; the Government did not go along with the Joint Committee's proposal either, which was the proposal that they voted down last week. They can hardly claim that they have been listening to what the Joint Committee said. The Minister's arguments would be stronger had not the Government's listening process led not only to the rejection of the reciprocal arrangement solution but also of the solution put forward by the Joint Committee.
<P>

<a name="30708-28_para23"></a>I have no doubt that the Government have been listening to some on this issue, but on the issue of foreign ownership I do not think that it was the Joint Committee that they were listening to mainly. The Minister says that we should not be diverted by the issue of reciprocity. Indeed, he sets out a rather wider proposition than that. Again, I quote from the debate on Report:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I really do not think, when we are considering an issue of such importance as the liberalisation of world trade, that we should be diverted by the issue of reciprocity".&#151;[Official Report, 2/7/03; col. 935.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-28_para24"></a>
That is a pretty extreme statement for the Government to make. Is that actually the Government's position? If the position was, for example, that we already had full reciprocal arrangements with the United States but not with France and Germany, would they be introducing this change to the law which would give France and Germany rights without any equality in return? I dare say that one or two newspapers might be challenging such a policy; I dare say that my party would be challenging such a policy; and I dare say that the Government would not be risking the collective wrath by introducing such a policy.
<P>

<a name="30708-28_para25"></a>There are some in this House who would impose a full ban on foreign ownership and for whom the amendment does not go far enough. I agree with them to the extent that the issues raised by the ownership of media companies are different in kind from those surrounding ownership of a normal commercial company. They are different not because media <P>


<a name="column_233"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 233</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>companies are better than normal companies, but because media companies are an integral part of the democratic process.
<P>

<a name="30708-28_para26"></a>The decision on whether there can be foreign ownership has now effectively been taken. That cannot be undone. The amendment is designed to recognise the new world in respect of that issue and to say quite simply, and fairly moderately, that British companies should have equal rights to build up their own media businesses to those we are giving to people overseas. That is our proposition, and it is not an extreme one. It is the kind of proposition that both Conservative and Labour Governments ascribed to up until a few months ago. I very much hope that, even at this stage, the Government will reverse their position. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-28_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell: </B>   My Lords, I put my name to this amendment with some enthusiasm. I made most of the points that needed to be made during the debate on non-EEA ownership. My task has been simplified by the speech of my noble friend Lord Fowler, because he has taken up two points that I was going to comment on.
<P>

<a name="30708-28_para27"></a>The Minister on Report uncharacteristically misrepresented the position of the Joint Committee. He said that our position, which was given in detail by my noble friend Lord Fowler, was a politer way of saying that the issue was a red herring. I do not think that that was the Committee's position, and my noble friend Lord Fowler has explained why that was a misrepresentation.
<P>

<a name="30708-28_para28"></a>In that debate, the Minister spoke about the importance of opening up our industry to inward investment, and said that that was the compelling argument. I spent a large part of my ministerial career in encouraging, with some success, inward investment into this country. I doubt if there was any Minister who undertook quite so many overseas foreign investment missions to the United States, the Far East and parts of Europe, all with great success, so I do not need to be told why we need foreign investment. However, the overriding reason why we sought to attract that inward investment was that it gave us a base from which we could take our industrial production into Europe and other parts of the world. That is why we did it. In this case, we are talking about our industry's ability to export its products into the greatest available markets, of which the United States is by far the most important.
<P>

<a name="30708-28_para29"></a>The Minister said on Report that when dealing with an issue of such importance as the liberalisation of world trade we should not be diverted by the issue of reciprocity. That is an odd way to enter into a negotiation about reciprocity&#151;to throw away one's cards. It does not appear that all members of the Government feel that the issue is entirely irrelevant and should be discarded. The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, when giving evidence to the Joint Committee, did not put that argument to us. Indeed, she told us that the decision to lift restrictions was being used as a negotiating tool in discussions with <P>


<a name="column_234"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 234</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>US authorities. It is a rather odd negotiating tool&#151;to say that we will give everything away. She clearly thought that it was not entirely convincing herself, as she then said that there was no case for holding out for a reciprocal agreement because no change in US policy appeared in prospect.
<P>

<a name="30708-28_para30"></a>It is extraordinary to argue that we should not attempt to get reciprocation because we do not believe that there is much chance of winning the argument. As the noble Lord, Lord Gordon, said, it is particularly perverse given that we are getting quite deep into GATT discussions on that very issue. To surrender our negotiating position in such a way is very odd indeed.
<P>

<a name="30708-28_para31"></a>The hour is now late and the arguments have been advanced. This discussion is all part of the wider debate that we have had about the good sense of allowing overseas investment without some control and protection. I warmly support the amendment moved by my noble friend.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-29_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, not for the first time in this journey, it is a pleasure to follow the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell. I should make it clear that we on these Benches have never been hostile to foreign ownership or production in our media industries. However, from the start of this exercise there have been two curious contradictions.
<P>

<a name="30708-29_para0"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Crickhowell and Lord Fowler, referred to the rum way of conducting trade negotiations, in which one throws in one's hand before the negotiations start. That ties in with another aspect&#151;how far we have retreated in recent years. I started this exercise in the belief that we had in ITV, particularly a unified ITV with its own news provider, the basis of a company that could be a world player. It has always seemed odd to me that we should put that company in play at the most vulnerable time of its existence, rather than that it should be given the opportunity to regroup and find its real worth, as the Joint Committee suggested.
<P>

<a name="30708-29_para1"></a>ITV was never given that chance, owing to what I can only call an animosity towards it from within the Government that has almost reached the stage of a vendetta. There appears to be a belief that existing ITV management had somehow betrayed and let down the Government and that it was so worthless that almost anyone would do better at running ITV. I have never really got to the bottom of that, but it is true. I have spent the past two years attending seminars, round tables and conferences, and I have heard things at the margin from very involved people working at No. 10 and in departments. That animosity is not a figment of my imagination. The Minister must know as well as anyone else the contempt with which ITV has been referred to by people who have had a hand in drafting the strategy. It is both unfair and quite barmy, and it has produced a strange policy whereby we give away our negotiating hand in advance and then go forward on what can only be called a wing and a prayer.
<P>

<a name="30708-29_para2"></a>I went to a Royal Television Society seminar address by Tessa Jowell. This takes us right back to Second Reading. She said that this was a magnificent win-win situation in which we would get American management, <P>


<a name="column_235"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 235</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>skills and money while retaining the power to make our own programmes and sustain our own creative industries. It would be a wonderful win-win situation, but there is not one shred of evidence to support that possibility.
<P>

<a name="30708-29_para3"></a>All of the pre-legislative committee's demands to give Ofcom the time to turn its expert eyes to this matter have been steadfastly refused. Instead, our approach continues to be that of a wing and a prayer. It is astonishing that some of the very successful names which might have sprung to mind a few years ago as welcome buyers of ITV have been responsible for some of the most massive losses and most astounding mismanagement in world corporate history. Again we see the danger.
<P>

<a name="30708-29_para4"></a>In this part of the Bill, as in so many other parts, I think that the Government are mounting a tiger. I truly wonder where they will end up in that rather exciting ride.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-29_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Gordon of Strathblane: </B>   My Lords, I, too, support the amendment. As I said at the previous stage, it is almost unbelievable that we should be giving away our rights without demanding something in return. The man in the street will find it even more unbelievable that the House of Commons did not debate this issue at all, and still more unbelievable that the House to which he must turn to serve as custodian of the nation's interests is liable to give in on it.
<P>

<a name="30708-29_para5"></a>It has already been stated that, until quite recently, it was government policy and opposition policy that we do not give anything without getting something in return. The Government's response has been, "We have listened to representations"&#151;but representations from whom? Have they come from the BBC? The BBC is against foreign ownership without reciprocity. Have they come from ITV? It is against foreign ownership without reciprocity. Have they come from Channel 4? Channel 4 is against foreign ownership without reciprocity. From whom have they come? Send your answers on a postcard, please. The only bodies that have offered any evidence to the Government in favour of foreign ownership without reciprocity is Sky and the allies of Sky. No one else is in favour.
<P>

<a name="30708-29_para6"></a>We have heard claims at various times in the Bill's passage that we have the finest broadcasting system in the world and we must protect it. Do we really believe that? If we believe it, why do we deny our broadcasting system access to the biggest market in the world&#151;to the United States, with which we share a common language? Why do we make it less likely that our broadcasting interests can achieve reciprocity in the United States by giving away our strongest card?
<P>

<a name="30708-29_para7"></a>When the Government published the White Paper they shocked many by saying that they favoured a unified ITV. What was their justification? It was that such an organisation could play a part on the world stage. But would it be the world stage? We would have to forget America because America will not let us in. Perhaps it could be called the world second-stage stage. It is just a nonsense.
<P>


<a name="column_236"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 236</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30708-29_para8"></a>If we believe that reciprocity is desirable, as some Ministers have said it is, then surely we should play our cards to try to achieve that end. The way to do that is to refuse America entry into the UK until we get entry into America. I fully concede that the economies of scale are such that it is unlikely that a British company will take over one of the American networks, but it could at least take over individual television stations or radio stations in major city outlets in the United States. That would be a beginning. If we truly believe that we are better at this than the United States, then that is something in which we should have confidence. We should not be virtually ruling that out by giving the Americans what they want without their having to give anything in return.
<P>

<a name="30708-29_para9"></a>It is worth remembering that America is the most powerful nation in the world with huge internal market power and yet it considers it appropriate to impose a limit that no foreigner can own more than 20 per cent of the American media. Why does it consider that appropriate? Why is it so afraid of competition from anywhere else in the world? Are there not perhaps lessons for us in that? Why should we give in so easily?
<P>

<a name="30708-29_para10"></a>On Report it was said that all this was really covered by the plurality test. It is not. It is a totally separate issue. I have never met Signor Berlusconi and I do not know whether he is a nice man or not. He may well be a lot nicer than the British media portray him to be. If he applied to take over ITV, he would not fall foul of any nationality interests because he is an EU citizen, but under the public interest test one might wish at least to examine whether it was desirable that he should own our media. The two issues are totally separate. What would happen if an American media company tried to acquire British media? If we had reciprocity with the United States, that company would be allowed in. It would then pass or fail the public interest test, but without nationality being taken into account. It would stand or fall according to how it met the other tests to which Ofcom would subject it. But if it did not grant Britain reciprocity in the United States, it would not even reach that stage. It would not be considered.
<P>

<a name="30708-29_para11"></a>It is honestly incredible that we are giving away something that we regard as one of Britain's finest achievements without a fight. I am extremely sad that the Government should have thought of this admittedly quite late in the day. It was not in the White Paper. It was only about a year ago that they dreamt up the idea of allowing foreign interests to come in without demanding reciprocity. I hope that even at this late stage the Government will change their mind.

<P>
<A NAME="30708-29_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   My Lords, I, too, support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Fowler. On the previous occasion the matter was debated I was completely convinced by the arguments. Having listened particularly to the noble Lord, Lord Gordon, again I am even more convinced than I was on the previous occasion. It seems such an obvious <P>


<a name="column_237"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 237</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>first step that one should expect reciprocity between countries on ownership of such an important asset as our broadcasting system, or part of it.
<P>

<a name="30708-29_para12"></a>The other advantage of the measure is that it would give Ofcom time to settle in before any reciprocity was arrived at and give the Government time to negotiate with the USA and come to a satisfactory conclusion. We heard it rumoured that that was exactly what was going on. In that case, why not wait until that moment? I very much hope that the Government will think again. We have heard some very important speeches this evening. They could not have been better put. I hope that they will carry the day.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-29_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I think that I have heard all this before. It has been interspersed with flattering quotes from my speech on Report, but otherwise the arguments have not moved on at all as regards the point of view of the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, and his supporters. We voted on foreign ownership amendments on Report and the Government's policy was supported on a Vote in this House. The aim of these amendments&#151;leaving aside whether they will succeed&#151;is to overturn on Third Reading the Vote of this House on Report. That is the truth of the matter. They are aimed at ensuring that television channels in this country will not be opened up to foreign ownership.
<P>

<a name="30708-29_para13"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Fowler, argues that the Government should negotiate reciprocity on foreign ownership. Generally, the United Kingdom does just that. The Government are strongly committed to trade liberalisation and work hard with their EU partners and key world trade organisations&#151;I was fascinated to hear about GATT negotiations going on, because my officials and DTI officials know nothing about them!&#151;to remove the barriers which currently block so many potential trading opportunities. However, we do not always work multilaterally if we see something in our interest.
<P>

<a name="30708-29_para14"></a>The benefits of opening up markets to foreign investment, as I made clear on Report&#151;and no one has sought to contradict that&#151;are proven. A more liberal investment environment has facilitated increased overseas investment. I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell. I am glad to hear again of his success as Secretary of State for Wales in encouraging inward investment. By 2001, the world stock of foreign direct investment was equivalent to 21 per cent of world gross domestic product, compared with less than 6 per cent in 1982. It is that investment that we want in this country, and it is those opportunities that we want to have overseas.
<P>

<a name="30708-29_para15"></a>Some people argue that we are undermining a common European Union position, and that the United States is on the brink of moving on this. Let me reassure the House. There is no common European Union position to undermine. A large number of EU and EEA countries have unilaterally liberalised: Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Denmark, Finland, Belgium and Luxembourg and the only other native English speaker&#151;Ireland.
<P>


<a name="column_238"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 238</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30708-29_para16"></a>In the World Trade Organisation, the European Union negotiates on a common position under Article 133 of the Treaty of Rome. As many noble Lords will know, France effectively maintains a veto on cultural matters and did so at Doha and in Seattle. Unless France has a drastic change of heart, there will be no negotiations on this topic. In other words, it is a matter for individual member states.
<P>

<a name="30708-29_para17"></a>So we could enter a long dialogue with the United States about some form of bilateral deal, because that is all that is open to us. We could spend years on this. However, considering the comparative gain for the United States against the comparative gain for this country, I do not somehow think that it will be top of the Federal Communications Commission's priorities.
<P>

<a name="30708-29_para18"></a>It is important to remember that some investment is already possible in the United States. The noble Lord, Lord Fowler, acknowledged that. A United Kingdom company could own up to 20 per cent of a US company with a broadcast licence, or 25 per cent of a company whose subsidiary company comes with a broadcast licence.
<P>

<a name="30708-29_para19"></a>In reality, the restrictions in place are unlikely in practice to hinder UK investment in US communications. It is doubtful that any British company would be in a position to take a stake larger than what is permitted anyway. As I said on Report, would a company such as Granada, with advertising revenues of £440 million, be likely to try to buy an NBC or a CBS, which share £3.2 billion of advertising revenue between them? If the noble Lord, Lord Gordon, thinks that we can buy individual TV companies in the United States without involving NBC, CBS or the other companies, I do not think he understands very much about the structure of television in the United States.
<P>

<a name="30708-29_para20"></a>Perhaps I may remind the House that it is not only the Government who do not think that reciprocity is a key issue. The Puttnam committee has been mentioned on a number of occasions. I remind the House that this is one of the few issues on which the Puttnam committee was divided; and, as I understand it&#151;I do not know about majority or minority views&#151;the conclusion of the committee was that the issue of reciprocity was not "pivotal". It had some reservations about foreign ownership more generally, but it stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"we do not view the argument on reciprocity as pivotal".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-29_para21"></a>
The noble Baroness, Lady Cohen of Pimlico, made a similar point in more demotic terms.
<P>

<a name="30708-29_para22"></a>The fact is that we do not want to wait for the potential benefits for the viewer. Our critics, the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, and others will say, "But it won't be better for the viewer; investors will just dump their programmes here". The remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Gordon, about Berlusconi absolutely proved my point on this issue. He said that Signor Berlusconi could not come to this country and flout all our rules. The same applies to any potential investor from outside the European Economic Area. The system protecting content is such that any investor, including those&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-30_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Gordon of Strathblane: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for giving way. There is a fundamental difference which is that Signor Berlusconi owns Italian media which do not broadcast in the same language as we do. The American media do and therefore they have the opportunity of vertical integration, which I have previously said is often called "dumping" by the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, and his committee, in terms of the British media. That is the fundamental difference.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-30_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend did not make that argument at all in his speech. Also he did not wait for me to make the opposing point that I now propose to make. My point is that investors, including those who would be allowed in by the amendment that was tabled and defeated on Report, must abide by our system. That includes quotas for original production, European Union production, regional and independent production, and it also includes the power of Ofcom to be able to review licence commitments on change of control to ensure that new owners maintain the standards of the old. How does that allow for dumping?
<P>

<a name="30708-30_para0"></a>There are provisions allowing Ofcom to review licence obligations for regional programming and production, and original production, and news and current affairs programmes at any time and, after consultation, change the licence. Ofcom will also have to protect the local content of radio. Ofcom will also be able to vary the licence conditions when local licences change control in order to preserve the local character of the station, and to maintain the quality and range of the service.
<P>

<a name="30708-30_para1"></a>Unlike the United States&#151;the debate has been very much about the United States&#151;we also have rules preventing broadcasters from using their companies to further their own political agenda. Broadcast news must be accurate and impartial and companies must not use television or radio in order to express their own views on politics or current public or industrial policy. Ofcom will have the power to regulate these provisions, imposing fines where necessary, and ultimately, revoking licences of broadcasters who do not fulfil their licence obligations. All those powers will be available to Ofcom to ensure that the quality of our broadcast media will be retained, regardless of the nationality of its owners.
<P>

<a name="30708-30_para2"></a>Again, the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, does not choose to recognise the fact, but we shall also have the protection of the new plurality test. We can intervene and investigate an acquisition even if it serves only to replace a significant player rather than consolidating. In those circumstances we can look at the need for the availability throughout the United Kingdom of a wide range of broadcasting which (taken as a whole) is both of high quality and calculated to appeal to a wide variety of tastes and interests; and the need for persons carrying on media enterprises, and for those with control of such enterprises, to have a genuine commitment to the attainment in relation to broadcasting of standards objectives set out in the Bill.

<P>

<a name="30708-30_para3"></a>I recognise that the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, and my noble friend Lord Gordon and others have argued honourably and consistently for the amendment. I recognise their sincerity although I believe that they have failed to keep up with the changes that have taken place in the Bill, particularly the changes that took place on Report as regards foreign ownership and today on plurality.
<P>

<a name="30708-30_para4"></a>I believe that this is an opportunistic amendment. Bearing in mind that the House voted last week at Report stage for opening up to foreign investment, to attempt to frustrate and to reverse that decision of the House at Third Reading is an undesirable proposition. If the amendment is moved to a Division I hope that it will be defeated.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-30_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Fowler: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord Crickhowell, the noble Lord, Lord McNally, the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, and the noble Lord, Lord Gordon, for their support. All the Back-Bench speakers who have spoken in this debate have supported my proposition. The only person who has spoken against it is the Minister.
<P>

<a name="30708-30_para5"></a>In particular, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Gordon, that the man in the street will regard it as unbelievable that we should be giving away our rights in this way. Clearly, that will be the view of many people in this country. The Minister at one stage slightly criticised the media knowledge of the noble Lord, Lord Gordon. Perhaps I may say to him that I suspect that the noble Lord's knowledge of the media is rather deeper than that of many on the Government's Front Bench.
<P>

<a name="30708-30_para6"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, is also wrong in saying that I am arguing against foreign ownership. I am not; I am saying that if there is to be foreign ownership, there should be reciprocal arrangements. That is the argument. It is fairly simple and straightforward. It is not being put opportunistically, as he says; it is the argument that I and my colleagues have been putting consistently during the passage of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30708-30_para7"></a>I shall not repeat all our arguments. I want to make two points. In no way is this an anti-United States amendment. As I have made clear at every stage, I am strongly pro-American. In no way is this anti-free trade. I am also strongly in favour of free trade: businesses competing with one another on a level playing field. But in the case of television and broadcasting, the playing field will be anything but level. Basically, the Bill allows United States' companies to buy ITV in Britain, and now ITN with it&#151;so ITV and ITN, quite a purchase&#151;without any reciprocal arrangements for British companies. That is what the public will find when they understand the implications of the Bill&#151;and that is what they will find so hard to understand. They will also find it hard to understand why this House and both Front Benches back that particular proposition.
<P>

<a name="30708-30_para8"></a>That arrangement is neither sensible nor in our national interests and, frankly, I have found few people who think it is. The hour is late. I have <P>


<a name="column_241"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 241</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>absolutely no illusions. I know perfectly well that many will have gone home. As I look around the House I see many noble Lords I have not seen at earlier stages in the Bill. The Whips on both sides appear to have done their jobs. So I am under no illusions. But I also say this: there is an important principle here. The position of both Front Benches is, frankly, disastrous and they will both come to regret it. So I believe that that opposition, however small, should be expressed and should be on the record. I want to take the view of the House on the subject.

<a name="30708-31_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 73, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 75 to 77 and 79 and to Amendments Nos. 74 and 78 in the names of the noble Lord, Lord McNally, and the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland.
<P>

<a name="30708-31_para5"></a>Amendments Nos. 74 and 78 would enable the Secretary of State by order to extend the grant-making power in the Bill to cover local digital television services. We are prepared to accept the intention behind these amendments and have therefore tabled government amendments which will allow access radio grants to be extended by order to cover local digital television services.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30708-31_para6"></a>We would, however, stress that this should not be taken as a sign that we propose to extend grants to local television in the near future. We do not want to raise unrealistic expectations. It will be difficult to secure any resources for access radio services, never mind having sufficient resources to support local TV as well.
<P>

<a name="30708-31_para7"></a>However, if circumstances change in the future, it may be possible to provide support for local TV services, and it makes sense to "future proof" the Bill in the way proposed by these amendments.
<P>

<a name="30708-31_para8"></a>We think it is unlikely that grants would be given to for-profit organisations, but do not believe that we should absolutely rule it out in advance. This is consistent with the approach in Clause 260, which refers to access radio services being "primarily" for the good of the public rather than for commercial reasons. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="30708-31_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount of Falkland: </B>   My Lords, I rose from these Benches at Report to talk about the importance of community radio and television. We are grateful that the Government have seen fit to table their own amendments which concede provision for Clause 356 to be extended to cover the possibility of supporting future community television. This is perhaps the minimum necessary for the Bill to recognise the increasingly converging nature of community media. With regard to our Amendments Nos. 74 and 77, I would like to make a couple of points. Amendment No. 74 specifies that in extending the fund to cover local digital television, it should be limited to services
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"not run for commercial purposes".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-31_para9"></a><P>

<a name="30708-31_para10"></a>We do not consider it necessary or appropriate for the fund to be used to subsidise services whose purposes are primarily commercial. The government amendment does not make that distinction clear, although it would be in the power of the Secretary of State to act later should he see fit to do so by order in Parliament.
<P>

<a name="30708-31_para11"></a>Amendment No. 78 and the government Amendment No. 77 both have the effect of removing the words "access radio" from the face of the Bill. We welcome this development. Access radio as a term is problematical and, in the firmly held view of the Community Media Association in particular, its use would be detrimental to the viability and success of community radio in the United Kingdom. The government proposals for access radio are broadly fully in line with the understood concepts and practice of community radio. Only the name "access radio" is new.
<P>

<a name="30708-31_para12"></a>This is confusing to funding agencies, as well as policy and opinion formers and others whose support of community radio is important. It sends a message about government commitment to and understanding of the sector. Supporters and practitioners of community radio have been seeking recognition for 20 years. To those in today's converging community <P>


<a name="column_244"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>media sector, it seems perverse finally to recognise the demand for appropriate legislation but not to call the sector what it calls itself.
<P>

<a name="30708-31_para13"></a>I do not think that I need to dwell on this any further. The point has been well made and recognised by the Government. Access radio is a weak brand name and community radio a strong one. I do not think that I need to add anything further. I thank the Government yet again for tabling their amendment.

<br>
(a) the need, in relation to every different audience in the United Kingdom or in a particular area or locality of the United Kingdom, for there to be a sufficient plurality of persons with control of the media enterprises serving that audience;
<br>
(b) the need for the availability throughout the United Kingdom of a wide range of broadcasting which (taken as a whole) is both of high quality and calculated to appeal to a wide variety of tastes and interests; and
<br>
(c) the need for persons carrying on media enterprises, and for those with control of such enterprises, to have a genuine commitment to the attainment in relation to broadcasting of the standards objectives set out in section 315 of the Communications Act 2003."

<br>
(5) For the purposes of section 58 where two or more media enterprises&#151;
<br>
(a) would fall to be treated as under common ownership or common control for the purposes of section 26, or
<br>
(b) are otherwise in the same ownership or under the same control,
<br>
they shall be treated (subject to subsection (4)) as all under the control of only one person.
<br>
(6) A reference in section 58 or this section to an audience shall be construed in relation to a media enterprise in whichever of the following ways the decision-making authority considers appropriate&#151;
<br>
(a) as a reference to any one of the audiences served by that enterprise, taking them separately;
<br>
(b) as a reference to all the audiences served by that enterprise, taking them together;
<br>
(c) as a reference to a number of those audiences taken together in such group as the decision-making authority considers appropriate; or
<br>

<a name="30708-33_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am in the unusual position of moving an amendment that I hope is unnecessary. The fact that I am moving it does not mean that the Government believe that the Bill will not receive Royal Assent before the Summer Recess, nor that the European Community directives will not be implemented through the Act and the instruments made under it. However, it would be irresponsible of us not to have a contingency plan.
<P>

<a name="30708-33_para12"></a>The plan has been in the public domain since March. It consists of a set of regulations to be made under the European Communities Act 1972, which would enable us to fulfil our Community obligations for the interim period between 25th July and the date on which the relevant provisions of the Bill could be eventually commenced. The DTI has consulted on those interim regulations. The response to the consultation, together with the revised draft of the regulations, is about to be published.
<P>

<a name="30708-33_para13"></a>The substance of the interim regime would be the same as the regulatory regime that will be established once the Bill is passed. But the effect of making such interim regulations would be that the regulatory framework that would exist when the Bill was passed would not be the same as that which it had been drafted to replace. That would, for example, make redundant a number of the amendments contained in Schedule 17 to the Bill and a number of the repeals and revocations contained in Schedule 19.
<P>

<a name="30708-33_para14"></a>The power proposed in the new plans would enable the raft of technical and legal modifications that would have to be made to the Bill once enacted, as a result of the making of the interim regulations, to be effected in <P>


<a name="column_251"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 251</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the most efficient manner. It would enable the foundation of the new regime to be shifted to the new Act with a minimum of delay.
<P>

<a name="30708-33_para15"></a>I hope that the new clause proves unnecessary, but it would be irresponsible of the Government not to provide for the possibility. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="30708-33_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Northesk: </B>   My Lords, I am gratified by the Minister's introduction of the amendment. It is intriguing to find this curious way of getting around a problem. None the less, I am delighted that it is there. I simply ask the Minister to explain how, under this procedure, the Bill remains substantially amendable. That is how the regulations that it seeks to circumvent need to be resolved.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-33_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, however we implement the legislation, ultimately it must be done through the Bill&#151;it must be done through primary legislation. We have the power under the European Communities Act to make interim provision. That involves certain changes in transitional provisions. However, fundamentally, we must implement the directives, and we will do so.

<A NAME="30708-33_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Fowler </B>   moved Amendment No. 125:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 359, line 14, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-33_para18"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
"( ) This Act shall cease to have effect at the expiry of five years after it receives Royal Assent, unless before that time a joint committee of both Houses of Parliament has reported on the operation of this Act, and the report has been debated in both Houses."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="30708-33_para19"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I gather that there is some speculation that I may divide the House on this amendment. For the benefit of those below the gangway, I give the assurance that I will not divide the House. I hope that that improves their arrangements. For old time's sake, in the case of the former Minister for Transport, I hope that that helps him.
<P>

<a name="30708-33_para20"></a>The point of this amendment is very simple. It may seem draconian that the Act should fall in five years, given the time and effort expended on it. It may just be that not everyone would welcome a long debate on a new Act. That fate is easily avoided by setting up a committee of both Houses to scrutinise the effects of the Act in practice and to see how it has worked out.
<P>

<a name="30708-33_para21"></a>The aim is not to reopen old debates, but to examine whether the intention of the Bill has been realised; in other words&#151;if I could have the Minister's attention for just 30 seconds&#151;I propose a post-legislative scrutiny committee. The Bill has benefited enormously from pre-legislative scrutiny. Again, I pay tribute to the committee, its chairman, the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, and my noble friend Lord Crickhowell.
<P>

<a name="30708-33_para22"></a>I know that the business managers grumbled about the delay. Indeed, the present Leader of the Commons called the proceedings a "filibuster". I do not believe that there was a filibuster. The choice is whether you want speedy legislation or good legislation. To my <P>


<a name="column_252"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 252</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>mind, the pre-legislative scrutiny strengthened the Bill immensely. I hope that that example will be followed with other legislation.
<P>

<a name="30708-33_para23"></a>In my experience as a Minister, some of the worst errors are made after the Bill becomes an Act, not because the Bill is not clear or that Ministers intentions have not been set out, but because those intentions have not been acted upon. Ministers move on to other departments, so they are not there to check. New Ministers and civil servants do not give the same priority as their predecessors.
<P>

<a name="30708-33_para24"></a>I remember that when I was Social Services Secretary, my then Minister of State, John Major, gave the clearest commitment to the Standing Committee examining the social security reform Bill that the change in the position of widows, and their rights under the state earnings related pension scheme would be the subject of a publicity campaign. Ministers moved on, there was no such campaign and civil servants gave the wrong advice in leaflets. It is inconceivable that errors of that kind would take place if there had been post-legislative scrutiny.
<P>

<a name="30708-33_para25"></a>The only argument that could be made against such a proposal is that we could have a communications Select Committee. However, my experience of Select Committees is that they are not accustomed to, nor do they want to go through, the sort of line by line examination that I have in mind. I also think that the advantage of a post-legislative scrutiny committee, which should become standard for major Bills, is that if civil servants know that the implementation of the Bill will be subject to scrutiny, their priority will be to ensure that they are meticulous in carrying out the intentions of the Bill and in fulfilling all pledges that are given.
<P>

<a name="30708-33_para26"></a>This Bill is very long and much depends on whether Ofcom has the right powers. The Government have introduced new measures such as the plurality test, which may or may not prove significant. However, at some stage during the five years after this Bill becomes an Act, a post-legislative scrutiny committee should be set up to consider how well the legislation has worked in practice. That would be to the benefit of this House and, above all, to the benefit of the public. I beg to move.

<A NAME="30708-34_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, I support this proposal. I do not think that it cuts across the idea of a media Select Committee. However, the idea of "Puttnam II&#151;The Sequel" has many attractions. Next time round, I will try to work out how to get publicity in the newspapers for what I am trying to do with the Bill without every story being accompanied by the most wonderful photograph of the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam. Regardless of what the story is about or the origins of the story, newspapers still get the same wonderful picture from their libraries.

<A NAME="30708-34_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, I think not.
<P>

<a name="30708-34_para0"></a>The idea proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, gives us an opportunity. Governments that stay in office for a while lose their desire for danger, and pre-legislative scrutiny has proved a dangerous exercise. However, I believe that it brings better legislation. It has been a great exercise, although, in the corridors of Whitehall there will be those who say, "Don't try it again, or if you do, don't put somebody as assiduous as the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, in charge of the committee". The idea of post-legislative scrutiny is one which, in one of the Government's more radical moments, they should consider favourably.

<P>
<A NAME="30708-34_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, having heard his speech, I absolve the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, of any intention to kill the Bill after five years. He did not make that suggestion, and I am grateful for that.
<P>

<a name="30708-34_para1"></a>This is the last Bill that wants post-legislative scrutiny. It has been a long and, some people would say, tortuous procedure. We started with the publication of the communications White Paper in December 2000; we had consultation on the White Paper; we had further consultation on media ownership in January 2002; we published the Bill in May 2002; and we had pre-legislative scrutiny under the able chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam. By the time that Ofcom is up and running, the process will have taken three years from start to finish.
<P>

<a name="30708-34_para2"></a>I recognise that it is not the noble Lord's intention that we should start all over again in five years' time, but even the threat of post-legislative scrutiny of the kind that he proposes&#151;I assume that he means it seriously; I do not think that he means it to be a paper exercise&#151;would wreak havoc on the communications industry. The provision that he proposes would mean that everything that Ofcom did, everything that the industry did and everything that is done on behalf of consumers&#151;all of those things&#151;would be put into the melting-pot. It does not say anywhere in the amendment what would happen if the Government had to give effect to the post-legislative scrutiny and there had to be amendments to the Bill. None of those things is in the amendment; it is only the beginning of an idea of an amendment. It is the nucleus of an amendment, but it has not been thought through.
<P>

<a name="30708-34_para3"></a>It is not within the Government's gift to set up committees of Parliament anyway. We could not accept the amendment even if we wanted to. I can tell the noble Lord, Lord McNally, that we are not giving up on the idea of pre-legislative scrutiny. As he knows, we have just proposed the setting up of a Joint Committee of both Houses for pre-legislative scrutiny of the gambling Bill for which I will be responsible. I look forward very much to that. We are in favour of pre-legislative scrutiny; we are not afraid of it. We recognise that there are dangers, but we think that there are huge opportunities.
<P>

<a name="30708-34_para4"></a>In any case, there are plenty of procedures for reporting to Parliament. The Secretary of State and Ofcom must report on the carrying out of their <P>


<a name="column_254"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 254</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>functions by virtue, respectively, of Clause 387 and paragraph 12 of the schedule to the Office of Communications Act 2002. They will have to report annually. Both reports will be laid before Parliament, and the usual channels can provide for debate. It is then for Parliament to decide whether and how to scrutinise and debate the reports. I am sure that there will be plenty of interest in this Chamber and in another place, when that time comes.
<P>

<a name="30708-34_para5"></a>I do not oppose in principle and in all circumstances the idea of post-legislative scrutiny, but we should give the industry, Ofcom and everybody concerned an opportunity to settle down and implement the provisions of the Bill. Above all, we should not introduce post-legislative scrutiny for a Bill that has already had such a degree of pre-legislative scrutiny.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-34_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Fowler: </B>   My Lords, I guess that that is the nearest that I shall get to agreement with anything that I have said during the passage of the Bill, albeit in the very mild form in which the noble Lord put it at the end of his speech. I shall do as I said, and I shall not seek to divide the House.
<P>

<a name="30708-34_para6"></a>There is a serious question to be considered by Parliament. I stand by what I said: many of the problems with legislation are due not to the drafting of an Act but to its implementation. I make no complaint about the pre-legislative scrutiny that the Bill has had. It has been a model of that. However, I guarantee that problems, issues and faults in the legislation, which none of us can forecast at the moment, will become apparent. Governments generally would be wise to think of the post-legislative stage in a way that they have not done previously.
<P>

<a name="30708-34_para7"></a>The Minister has been almost helpful to me, and I thank him for that. As this is the last word that I shall say in the debate, I also thank him for his courtesy during the Bill's passage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="30708-35_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill do now pass.
<P>

<a name="30708-35_para18"></a>Moved, That the Bill do now pass.&#151;(Lord McIntosh of Haringey.)

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-35_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Puttnam: </B>   My Lords, the hour is late. However, as I have spent two years of my life and other members of the House have spent significant periods of their lives on this Bill, it is important to make one or two small points before the Bill passes. I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, did the House a favour in raising the issues that he did. I want to speak very briefly about the principle of pre-legislative scrutiny&#151;about what I and, I am sure, the noble Lord, Lord McNally, have learned from it&#151;and offer the Government a few observations.
<P>

<a name="30708-35_para19"></a>I was delighted to hear the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, say that there was no question about the future of pre-legislative scrutiny, but that was not the story that we were being told two or three months ago, when the general word around my party was that we were seriously damaging the future of pre-legislative scrutiny by appearing to be so pernickety.
<P>

<a name="30708-35_para20"></a>The Government would do well to look again at the report of the committee and reflect on the way in which they reacted to the initial recommendations a year ago. Hours and hours of legislative time could have been saved had the Government been more moderate and more thoughtful in their response. We have made enormous progress on the Bill, but a great deal of that progress could have been made by a more thoughtful response in the first place. I take some blame for that. It is important for me to say that I think I allowed an over-adversarial relationship to be created between the pre-legislative scrutiny committee and the Bill team. <P>


<a name="column_258"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 258</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The lesson that I would offer to anyone chairing a pre-legislative scrutiny committee in future is not to allow that division to occur. It was unnecessary, but it has, I stress, caused this House many unnecessary hours of debate and dissent.
<P>

<a name="30708-35_para21"></a>I have learnt an extraordinary lesson about the parliamentary process. It is fundamental that in any forthcoming discussions in this Chamber about the future of the House of Lords, someone must take into account who will do the job of scrutinising legislation. If one thing has been absolutely apparent, it is that no form of adequate scrutiny took place before the Bill came to this House. It has been a total disgrace. No one yet has been able to explain adequately why no proper scrutiny currently takes place in another place. That is a very serious issue. I hope that someone somewhere will read these remarks and address them in a serious way.
<P>

<a name="30708-35_para22"></a>I would also suggest that any government tie pre-legislative scrutiny to a commitment to take Committee stage out of the Chamber. It would free up time in this Chamber; it would move government business along; and I do not believe that any damage would occur in the process. I pass that on as serious advice because, again, hours and hours of time could have been advantageously saved.
<P>

<a name="30708-35_para23"></a>I shall leave the last word to a man I admire very much&#151;the founder of CNN, Ted Turner. Why Ted Turner? Ted Turner is exactly the type of media entrepreneur that I think this Bill was intended to encourage into a possible interest in this country. On 30th May, he wrote in the Washington Post:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is expected to adopt dramatic rule changes that will extend the market dominance of the five media corporations that control most of what Americans read, see and hear. I"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-35_para24"></a>
Mr Turner, and not me, sadly&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"am a major shareholder in the largest of those five corporations, yet&#151;speaking only for myself, and not for AOL Time Warner&#151;I oppose these rules. They will stifle debate, inhibit new ideas and shut out smaller businesses trying to compete. . . .  When the smaller businesses are gone, where will the new ideas come from? Nor does this trend bode well for new ideas in our democracy&#151;ideas that only come from diverse news and vigorous reporting".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-35_para25"></a>
He continued:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Even more troubling are the warning signs that large media corporations&#151;with massive market power&#151;could abuse that power by slanting news coverage in ways that serve their political or financial interests. There is always the danger that news organizations can push positive stories to gain friends in government, or unleash negative stories on artists, activists or politicians who cross them, or tell their audiences only the news that confirms entrenched views. But the danger is greater when there are no competitors to air the side of the story that the corporation wishes to ignore".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-35_para26"></a><P>

<a name="30708-35_para27"></a>Anyone looking at the news coverage of this Bill as it has gone through Parliament would have seen a marked difference between the coverage it got in certain publications and the almost complete blank it received from others. Ted Turner went on to say:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Naturally, corporations say they would never suppress speech. That may be true. But it's not their intentions that matter. It's their capabilities. The new FCC rules would give them more power to cut important ideas out of the public debate, and it's precisely that power that rules should prevent".

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30708-35_para29"></a>I hope that through the amendments that we have recently attached to this genuinely excellent Bill, we have precisely addressed Ted Turner's worst fears, and as a consequence we may continue to enjoy the best and most plural broadcast environment in the world. We are handing the Bill on to the noble Lord, Lord Currie, and I am reminded very much of when my father taught me to ride a bicycle. He spent many hours running up and down the street, holding the saddle of my bike, until one day I turned around and realised that he had let go and was not there.
<P>

<a name="30708-35_para30"></a>Tonight we have let go of the bike. The noble Lord, Lord Currie, will be asked to pedal away and all our best wishes and&#151;speaking for myself&#151;our dearest hopes go with him and with Ofcom. I am grateful to all noble Lords who have taken part in this debate. The Bill has been important. We have covered very interesting and important areas in a remarkably good spirit, albeit at great length.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-36_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, I know that the Minister will groan inwardly, but there are two points that I want to make. I wish that I could wish the Bill Godspeed with the same confidence as the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, but the more I have looked at the issue, the more I have seen large global forces at work that will not go away. I said that the Government have mounted a tiger, and I wonder how many in a few years' time will be making mea culpas similar to that made by the noble Lord, Lord Renton, about the 1990 Broadcasting Bill.
<P>

<a name="30708-36_para0"></a>The other thing that I have been left with, apart from the wonderful experience of serving under the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, on the pre-legislative committee, is a determination that the next stage of this matter&#151;the defence of the BBC and the BBC Charter&#151;is a battle that has to be won. I send the Bill on with that in mind.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-36_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   My Lords, this has been an amazing experience for all of us. I want to thank all noble Lords for the great courtesy that they have shown throughout the debates and I wish the Bill well.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-36_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Currie of Marylebone: </B>   My Lords, as chairman of Ofcom, I express my thanks for the enormous care and thoroughness with which your Lordships have considered this Bill. The House has lived up to its fine reputation as an effective revising chamber. In many respects, the Bill leaves the House in a much better shape than when it arrived. I pay tribute to noble Lords from all parts of the House for the care and consideration that they have given to it.
<P>

<a name="30708-36_para1"></a>Ofcom is very much the servant of statute, and my colleagues and I have been aware that it is for Parliament to determine Ofcom's duties, responsibilities and powers and for us to make that work to best effect. That is why I have intervened sparingly in the debates. However, I <P>


<a name="column_260"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column 260</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have listened carefully and read all those contributions that I have been unable to hear in person. The debates that we have had will inform how Ofcom moves&#151;or cycles&#151;forward, and they will certainly inform the way that we set up and proceed to carry out the duties that Parliament has laid upon us.
<P>

<a name="30708-36_para2"></a>As a result of the successful amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, on Report, Ofcom now has the word "citizen" as part of its principal general duty. I, for one, would be delighted if that word remains firmly in the principal duty of Ofcom when the Bill finally emerges from the parliamentary process, which it has not yet quite done. That would provide welcome clarity.
<P>

<a name="30708-36_para3"></a>We have struck a good balance, giving Ofcom clear instructions but also flexibility to deal with the unforeseen&#151;to strike the best balance for the public interest in each individual circumstance. However, there is one issue that I must flag up. The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, had a second impact, which was to put the citizen's interest above that of the consumer in the area of broadcasting and spectrum, but not in that of telecoms. That creates different duties in different parts of Ofcom's activities, which will cause difficulty. It will make Ofcom subject to judicial review and may reduce the effectiveness of Ofcom. It will be the big players, not the small players, who will take advantage of that.
<P>

<a name="30708-36_para4"></a>I hope that the Bill in its final form will cast Ofcom's general duties in terms that put the citizen and consumer interest in parity. I emphasise that point, because some noble Lords said that they were not altogether clear where I stood at Report. The citizen's interest is very much at the heart of what Ofcom wants to achieve. My fellow members are in no doubt about the deep concern that the House has for the interests of citizens.
<P>

<a name="30708-36_para5"></a>The communications industry is not like any other industry; it is central to our society and our democracy. That is something that the Ofcom board feels with both its head and its heart. However, we believe that if Parliament defines Ofcom's general duty in terms of parity, we are confident that in all circumstances&#151;both those we can foresee and those we cannot&#151;we will be able to reach the best solutions in the public interest. Those solutions should properly reflect the keen concern for citizens that have been expressed in this House.
<P>

<a name="30708-36_para6"></a>If we are able at the end of the parliamentary process to have both clarity and parity in Ofcom's general duties, we will have a truly excellent Bill that will serve the public interest and enable Ofcom to pursue it to best effect.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-36_spnew3"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Manchester: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that all these speeches have been slightly out of order, but I cannot allow the Bishops' Benches not to be included in these final remarks. God speed the working out of the Bill and the job of Ofcom.

Therefore, the very least that I can do for the sake of courtesy is to express my gratitude to all noble Lords who have taken part in proceedings on the Bill. I hope that they listened very carefully to the wise words of the noble Lord, Lord Currie, a minute or two ago.
<P>

<a name="30708-36_para7"></a>Above all, I want to pay tribute to the work of the members of the Bill team who have been fantastic, both in the quality of the advice that they have given <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-36_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees   (Viscount Allenby of Megiddo): </B>  It may be helpful to remind your Lordships of the procedure for today's Committee. Except in one important respect, our proceedings will be exactly as in a normal Committee of the Whole House. We shall continue to go through the Bill clause by clause; Members of the Committee will speak standing; all noble Lords are free to attend and participate; and the proceedings will be recorded in Hansard. The one difference is that the House has agreed that there shall be no Divisions in a Grand Committee. Any issue on which agreement cannot be reached should be considered again at Report when, if necessary, a Division may be called. Unless, therefore, an amendment is likely to be agreed to, it should be withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="30708-36_para9"></a>I should remind your Lordships of what will happen if a Division is called in the Chamber while we are sitting. The Committee will adjourn as soon as the Division bells are rung and it will resume 10 minutes later.
<P>

<a name="30708-36_para10"></a>Clause 65 [Extradition offences: supplementary]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-36_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Goodhart </B>   moved Amendment No. 140:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 35, line 19, leave out from "in" to the end of line 20 and insert "Schedule (European framework list)"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-36_para11"></a><P>

<a name="30708-36_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 142, 143, 263 and 268. Amendment No. 269, which is also in this group, will be spoken to by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay.
<P>

<a name="30708-36_para13"></a>The group of amendments raise two separate issues, both of which are of considerable importance. Because of the form of the amendments, they must be taken as a single group. The first issue is whether the present European framework list should be included in the Bill. That is covered by Amendments Nos. 140, 143, 263 and 268. The second issue is whether there should be some form of special treatment for the category of racism and xenophobia, which is one of the 32 items on the European framework list. That is covered by Amendments Nos. 142 and 269. The problem arises&#151;I do not complain about this or suggest that it could or should have been done differently but simply place the point on the record&#151;because Amendment No. 269 is <P>


<a name="column_GC54"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC54</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not free-standing; it amends Amendment No. 268, so the two amendments must obviously be grouped together.
<P>

<a name="30708-36_para14"></a>The purpose of the first sub-group, if I may call it that, is to ensure that there is parliamentary control over any additions to the European framework list. Under Clause 65(3), the European framework list is the list of conduct as set out in Article 2.2 of the European framework decision. That means, or is assumed to mean, the list as it is enforced at any given time. Under Article 2.3, the European Council may add new categories of offence to the list. The decision must, of course, be unanimous but, so far as the United Kingdom is concerned, that decision is taken by the executive, not by Parliament. As the Bill stands, there is no provision for the involvement of Parliament in the addition of new offences.
<P>

<a name="30708-36_para15"></a>We believe that it would be entirely wrong for the executive to be able to extend the exclusion of dual criminality without approval by Parliament.
<P>

<a name="30708-36_para16"></a>The Home Affairs Committee of the House of Commons stated in paragraph 55 of its first report of 2002&#150;2003 that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We consider it highly undesirable that Parliament should have no say in regard to future changes to the categories of offence listed in the framework decision. We therefore recommend that list of offences be imported directly into the Bill".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-36_para17"></a>
The Select Committee went on to state at paragraph 56 that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Bill should also provide that any statutory instrument made under this delegated power should be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-36_para18"></a><P>

<a name="30708-36_para19"></a>The Government have conceded that exclusion of the need for prima facie evidence in category 2 cases requires an order in council approved by both Houses. We believe that the same should be the minimum requirement for any addition to the European framework list.
<P>

<a name="30708-36_para20"></a>The amendments will achieve this by, as a first step, putting the existing contents of the list into a new schedule. That is dealt with by Amendments Nos. 140 and 268. We then provide that that list can be amended by an order in council using the affirmative resolution procedure. That is covered by Amendment No. 143 and, as a minor consequential amendment, by Amendment No. 263.
<P>

<a name="30708-36_para21"></a>I turn now to the second issue of racism and xenophobia. We are not hostile to the principle of including this as one of the categories in the list. We already have in the United Kingdom several offences which are based on racism or aggravated by it. Xenophobia is perhaps more contentious because it is a word which, up until now, has not been recognised as having any specific meaning in the United Kingdom criminal law. It means, I suppose, hatred of foreigners irrespective of their race. There is uncertainty as to what it means as a legal concept.
<P>

<a name="30708-36_para22"></a>In introducing the list, Article 2.2 refers to offences in the list as they are defined by the law of the issuing member state. That means that the actual terms of the law must be covered by legislation in the member state. But that expression surely cannot mean that the state <P>


<a name="column_GC55"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC55</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>can exclude dual criminality by creating a new criminal offence and labelling it xenophobia even if it has no real connection with xenophobia. We therefore still need to consider whether any particular offence can reasonably be regarded as falling into the category of racism and xenophobia and will therefore be excluded from the dual criminality requirement.
<P>

<a name="30708-36_para23"></a>It now happens that the European Council has before it a draft framework decision on racism and xenophobia. The European Union Committee has reported on that new draft framework decision. Although agreed, the report has not yet been published. I understand that it will be published very soon, within the next day or two. It would have been helpful if it had been available for today. It will of course be available on Report.
<P>

<a name="30708-36_para24"></a>I understand that the current draft framework decision does not include a specific definition of racism and xenophobia for the purposes of the European arrest warrant. I regret that. It includes, I understand, a list of offences which would be regarded as offences of racism and xenophobia. Those offences include some that would not normally be regarded as coming within the meaning of racism and xenophobia&#151;for example, offences related to discrimination on grounds of religion.
<P>

<a name="30708-36_para25"></a>The list is important because, in the absence of a specific definition of racism and xenophobia in the draft framework decision, the question whether any offence is an offence of racism and xenophobia is likely to be decided on the basis of whether the offence is on the list which will appear in Article 1 of the draft framework decision, or is at least similar to an offence on that list. In the absence of any definition or list, it will be very difficult to decide what "racism and xenophobia" means. Progress on the framework decision on racism and xenophobia has slowed down. Therefore, it is inappropriate to consider including racism and xenophobia on the list for the European arrest warrant when a framework decision on racism and xenophobia is pending but has not yet been agreed.
<P>

<a name="30708-36_para26"></a>After the events of last week, I can understand why the Italian presidency might not wish to get involved with the question of what constitutes xenophobia. I recognise that we are, of course, supposed to implement the framework decision by 1st January 2004. In practice, it is pretty clear that that is not going to happen. So far, only three states&#151;Spain, Denmark and, I think, Sweden&#151;have yet ratified the framework decision and implemented it in their domestic laws. That process is almost certainly unlikely to be completed by 1st January 2004. Austria has an opt-out, and there are problems with Germany and Poland, where there are constant issues about the constitutional propriety of implementing the framework decision because of the tradition in their laws against extraditing their nationals.
<P>

<a name="30708-36_para27"></a>It seems perfectly reasonable for us to say that we will not treat "racism and xenophobia" as included in the list until we have the framework decision, which will at least give us some guidance as to what that is <P>


<a name="column_GC56"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC56</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>intended to mean. For that purpose, I tabled Amendment No. 142, the effect of which is to delay the application of the list to racism and xenophobia until the new framework decision is agreed.
<P>

<a name="30708-36_para28"></a>Amendment No. 269, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, goes somewhat further in one respect and less far in another. It permanently leaves out "and xenophobia" from the list in the proposed schedule, and therefore leaves "racism" on its own but does not defer the implementation of the list as so amended. I am not altogether happy with Amendment No. 269. I am sure that she will not put it in this way, but some support for it seems dependent on the belief in some quarters of the right of the true Brit to go abroad and make grossly xenophobic remarks about foreigners. However, it is important that dual criminality should be excluded from racism and xenophobia offences only where, first, those offences are serious, and secondly, where it is reasonably clear as to what they are. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-37_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I added my name to Amendment No. 143 to support the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. As he mentioned, Amendment No. 269 is my amendment to his Amendment No. 268. Like him, in one sense one regrets that we have to complicate matters by having the two debates together, but I am afraid that that is how things had to fall within the context of how the Bill is drafted.
<P>

<a name="30708-37_para0"></a>My original notes refer to the fact that there are a number of very important matters in this group of amendments, and that I shall take some time to set out my argument. I am changing that, as I shall not take some time. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, has more than adequately covered not only the principles but many of the arguments that have to be made. He said admirably much of what I would say, and I agree with him substantially.
<P>

<a name="30708-37_para1"></a>I shall skip some of my remarks and refer to what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, towards the end of his remarks. He raised the issue of definitions of xenophobia and racism, pointing out that either we should define what these offences are or there ought to be a list of offences by which we can recognise them, thus introducing clarity. He is quite right; I do not argue in any way that people from this country should be able to travel elsewhere and make what I would consider to be serious xenophobic comments. While I understand that, having watched England play and having drunk a few too many beers, someone might make certain unwise minor remarks, I certainly would not commend any comments such as those made by Signor Berlusconi, or anything of that ilk.
<P>

<a name="30708-37_para2"></a>We need further clarity in this area, and it is because of that concern for clarity that I turn to the shadowy list of 32 offences not currently included on the face of the Bill. Not all of those offences are yet clear and, of course, not all are offences in this country. The issue here is that, although it grieves us, we would rather see the list set out in the Bill than introduced off the face of the Bill, if only so that others can see exactly what we are being saddled with. So although we do not like <P>


<a name="column_GC57"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC57</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the list and we shall never like it, while we are being forced to accept all 32 offences, we see merit in what the Liberal Democrats are trying to achieve.
<P>

<a name="30708-37_para3"></a>I recall, when reading the Hansard report of the debate in another place, that the Minister said in response that if, between the Bill leaving another place and being debated here, concerted pressure to see the list was maintained, the Government would consider again whether the list should be put in the Bill. I hope that, when she responds to the amendments, the Minister will be able to bring us up to date on the Government's consideration of this matter.
<P>

<a name="30708-37_para4"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, has already quoted extensively from the House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee. Like him, I agree entirely with those views, in particular, for the sake of reference, with what is set out in paragraphs 53 to 56 of the proceedings.
<P>

<a name="30708-37_para5"></a>I turn now to the issue of xenophobia itself. I noticed that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, was unhappy with my Amendment No. 269 as it stands. Of course I have tabled it as a tool with which to open consideration of the general issue of xenophobia. In any case it must be in the nature of a probing amendment since we are debating it in Grand Committee. I want to make it clear that whatever the Government's response, I shall want to consider my position on the matter of xenophobia in that light before we return to the matter on Report to consider how the Bill might be amended.
<P>

<a name="30708-37_para6"></a>At this point it is right that I should put on the record the fact that we support the thrust of Amendment No. 142 tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, which, as he explained, would place a form of embargo on including the offences of racism and xenophobia in the list until the member states of the European Union have adopted a framework decision on them. The noble Lord has made an important point and I am grateful to him for today putting on the record what he understands is the updated status of the debate on those matters. It is important that we learn from the Minister how far those discussions have progressed.

<A NAME="30708-37_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </B>  I am grateful to both the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, for tabling these amendments, thus giving us the opportunity to consider again&#151;as the noble Baroness has invited us to do&#151;how we define what would constitute an extradition offence under Part 1. I believe that I am in a position to give noble Lords some good news as regards including the list of generic offence categories on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30708-37_para7"></a>As the noble Baroness has just indicated, this is a topic which has been raised a number of times during the passage of this Bill through another place and in this House. There is no doubt it is clearly and rightly a matter of considerable interest. Perhaps I may first consider the effect of Amendments Nos. 140, 143, 145, 263 and 268 which pertain to the list of offences as set <P>


<a name="column_GC58"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC58</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>out in Article 2.2 of the framework decision on the European arrest warrant. I intend then to turn to Amendments Nos. 142 and 269, which focus specifically on the racism and xenophobia offence categories. I understand that there is great interest in these matters and therefore I shall seek to explain fully our reasoning in relation to the amendments. In that way I hope to satisfy the probing nature of the amendments and to give both the noble Baroness and the noble Lord no just cause to return to these issues on Report.
<P>

<a name="30708-37_para8"></a>The effect of the first of these amendments is relatively clear. They import the list of 32 generic offences categories set out in Article 2.2 of the framework decision on to the face of the Bill and provide that any changes to those categories would be subject to approval by both Houses under the affirmative resolution procedure. As I am sure your Lordships are aware, these changes were recommended by the Home Affairs Select Committee and were tabled in similar terms for debate in another place. It has been our contention that the Bill makes it clear that the list of offence categories to which the dual criminality test is sometimes disapplied is contained in Article 2.2 of the framework decision. Clause 65 makes this quite clear, and we do not believe that it gives rise to confusion or ambiguity.
<P>

<a name="30708-37_para9"></a>Furthermore, we want to ensure that the Bill contains the necessary flexibility to deal with any changes in the list. Although there are no plans afoot to alter the list, it is worth stressing that any changes would require a unanimous decision of the Council. That has been mentioned, rightly, by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, and noble Lords will know that that means each and every state being in agreement. I do not think there is any danger that changes which would add items to the list which were contentious or trivial would come about with any degree of ease. Nevertheless, we recognise that there are strong feelings on this matter. In the light of that, we intend to bring forward government amendments, at a later stage, which will set out on the face of the Bill the 32 offence categories listed in the framework decision. We will also need to find some way to accommodate any changes to the list&#151;unlikely though I believe such changes to be&#151;without the need for further primary legislation. We are still considering how best this can be achieved. I hope that noble Lords will welcome this as good news.
<P>

<a name="30708-37_para10"></a>I should now like to turn briefly to Amendments Nos. 142 and 268 which seek to amend the racism and xenophobia category. I am very grateful to the indication given by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, that he is not hostile to the inclusion of xenophobia in this clause per se.
<P>

<a name="30708-37_para11"></a>The list is significant, for it sets out the categories of offences&#151;and they are broad headings, not specific crimes&#151;for which the dual criminality test is disapplied. This is in line with one of the fundamental principles of Part 1&#151;that a person should not be able to escape justice just because they manage to skip <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>across the border. I was very grateful to hear that echoed in the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay.
<P>

<a name="30708-37_para12"></a>I recognise, as did the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, that the United Kingdom does not use the term "xenophobia" in its legislation. However, I respectfully suggest that it is not for us to pass judgment on the type of offences contained in other EU countries' legislation. That is not in the spirit of mutual recognition and co-operation. We have traditionally respected each other's cultures, laws and traditions and have understood why things are framed differently.
<P>

<a name="30708-37_para13"></a>Removing xenophobia from the list, as Amendment No. 269 would do, reinstates the dual criminality test for offences classed as xenophobic in other member states. This means that a person who has committed a xenophobic offence such as Holocaust denial in Germany could not be extradited because that is not recognised as an offence in this country. We really do not see why that should be so.
<P>

<a name="30708-37_para14"></a>Before any noble Lord seeks to pick me up for drawing on the example of Holocaust denial, which I shall be using again in a moment, perhaps this might be a convenient moment to draw your Lordships' attention to the annexe to the report of the Home Affairs Committee on the Bill, which was published last December. It contains the Government's response to some questions which the Committee had earlier sent. Included in these is the list of responses from certain other EU member states to the question of which offences in their countries fell within the definition of racism and xenophobia. I think noble Lords will find it quite illuminating.
<P>

<a name="30708-37_para15"></a>It also explains why we so often draw on the Holocaust denial example. There are quite simply very few offences in the racism and xenophobia category that we would not recognise under our own law. We call the offences by a different name, but the substance of the issues are very clearly spelt out in our legislation. It is right to remind ourselves that in relation to racism and issues involving culture of that nature, Britain has a very proud tradition and a very fine legislative framework with which to deal with them.
<P>

<a name="30708-37_para16"></a>Amendment No. 142 seeks to restrict the removal of dual criminality for racist and xenophobic crimes to those covered by the framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia when it is approved. In the mean time, all offences which fall under the racism and xenophobia category will be subject to a dual criminality test. While I can appreciate that it is desirable to seek some measure of commonality in law on racism and xenophobia across the EU, the framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia is a separate instrument from the framework decision on the European arrest warrant, which I think the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, fully recognised. Not only that, but the framework decision is designed to set only some minimum standards. If a member state feels the need for a law which goes above and beyond those covered by the framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia and a British <P>


<a name="column_GC60"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC60</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>citizen goes to that country and, while there, commits the offence, he or she should not be exempt from extradition.
<P>

<a name="30708-37_para17"></a>I am sure all Members of the Committee can understand why, for all sorts of historical reasons, Germany feels that it must have an offence of Holocaust denial on its statute book when most of the rest of Europe does not. If a British person goes to Germany with deliberate intent to deny the Holocaust&#151;and we can all think of a certain historian, although I use that term in the loosest possible sense, who might want to do that&#151;I see no reason of principle why we should refuse extradition if he manages to come back to Britain before the German police can arrest him.
<P>

<a name="30708-37_para18"></a>In addition, I fear&#151;and this has been hinted at by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart&#151;that there is a logjam on the measure to combat racism and xenophobia and progress could be stalled indefinitely. I made reference to this at Second Reading. That being the case, I am sure noble Lords will agree that it is not desirable to reinstate the dual criminality test for all offences which fall under the racism and xenophobia heading on the off-chance that a separate EU instrument may be approved.
<P>

<a name="30708-37_para19"></a>No doubt we shall return to these issues, but in the mean time, I repeat that we intend to bring forward amendments to put the list of 32 generic offences categories on the face of the Bill. I hope I have said enough about the clauses in relation to xenophobia to reassure your Lordships in relation thereto.

<P>
<A NAME="30708-38_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   Before the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, speaks to his amendment and naturally, as we are in Grand Committee, withdraws it, perhaps I may add a couple of remarks and questions to the Minister.
<P>

<a name="30708-38_para0"></a>She referred specifically to the arguments that we have had many times about xenophobia being included in the list of offences for which dual criminality will no longer be a requirement. One of our arguments is that if such a narrow band of offences comprise xenophobia, it would be far better if the Government were to define them. We could then at least have a debate about whether specific offences should be included. That refers back to a comment made by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, in introducing his amendment: that at least if there were a list of the offences, there would be greater clarity.
<P>

<a name="30708-38_para1"></a>The Government always refer to Holocaust denial as being an important offence in Germany&#151;and it is. The problem is that it appears that that item on the list of 32 is being designed against one particular writer&#151;like the noble Baroness, I shall not dignify him with the name of "historian"&#151;who has taken a particular course, as he considers his right. We are trying to achieve a system whereby the Bill can operate satisfactorily not just for individuals now but for the whole of its future. We are still concerned that it will not do so while xenophobia appears on the list, unless <P>

<A NAME="30708-38_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   Before the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, rises to reply, like other noble Lords, I welcome the fact that the 32 offences are to be included in the Bill. That is essential, but I am not quite so pleased about how they may be altered. I should have thought that the Minister could have given us an assurance this afternoon that any alteration would be made, if not by primary legislation, at least by affirmative resolution. I did not hear her give that assurance. I should have thought that that was an easy&#151;and essential&#151;assurance to give us at this stage, to save our time on Report.
<P>

<a name="30708-38_para2"></a>With regard to racism and xenophobia, I think that every one of us knows what racism is. We can define racism quite easily. For example, I am Welsh. When I came to England, I got used to being described as a Taffy&#151;and a Taffy who went into a butcher's shop and stole a leg of beef. As it happens, we were able to shake off that sort of racism in those days. We laughed it off and gave back as good as we got. But times have changed. So I think we understand what racism means. But I am not at all sure that anyone in this room&#151;including me&#151;really knows what xenophobia means.
<P>

<a name="30708-38_para3"></a>Before I came out, I looked in my dictionary. It states that xenophobia means dislike, hatred or fear of foreigners. People can be imprisoned for disliking a foreigner, for hating him&#151;not doing anything about it; just hating him, as far as I can see&#151;or even for being afraid of him. There are some foreigners of whom I have had experience in my lifetime of whom I am still afraid. How are we to define xenophobia given those dictionary terms?
<P>

<a name="30708-38_para4"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, instanced the disgraceful remarks of Signor Berlusconi, but I would not describe them as xenophobic. I would describe them as insulting and unnecessary and, if I had been Mr Schultz, I should have replied that Signor Berlusconi was giving a good imitation of Signor Mussolini. But I am not at all sure that I would have said that he was being xenophobic. It is extremely difficult to define that crime&#151;because that is what it will be, a crime&#151;of xenophobia.
<P>

<a name="30708-38_para5"></a>I could go on at great length&#151;so could we all&#151;but that word does not have a place in the Bill. Nor, indeed, should it have a place in the law of any other nation of the European Union because it smacks of the withdrawal of freedom of speech. It is essential in a free society that you should be able to speak freely&#151;without the intent to hurt or insult people but to give your view on virtually everything.
<P>

<a name="30708-38_para6"></a>I therefore do not believe that that word, which can have so many definitions and which is viewed in different ways in different cultures, should be part of <P>


<a name="column_GC62"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC62</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>any Bill passed in this country. Indeed, I recommend that the Government say, "No, no, no, no", to its inclusion in any list. Having said that, I hope that the views of the Committee will be taken into account before we reach Report.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-38_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I endorse what the noble Lord said. I have said more than once during our proceedings&#151;I apologise for saying it again&#151;that what most people who understand the Bill are frightened about in it is that they may make a mistake and commit a crime without knowing it. The noble Lord&#151;and my noble friend Lady Anelay&#151;reflected the British attitude to such matters. People often make a casual half joke, which in this country is understood as a joke that is perhaps a little near the edge but which would in another country be regarded as xenophobic. That could easily happen. That is a real risk if we include the offence and make it possible for people to be extradited for it.
<P>

<a name="30708-38_para7"></a>I think that the noble Baroness said that the Government are trying to find a way of adding a new offence to the list. Does she mean other than by order or simply that they are wondering whether to do so by affirmative or negative resolution? Are they contemplating another way? If so, can we know what the alternative is so that we are prepared when she tables her amendment at the next stage?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-38_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   Perhaps I may first deal with the question asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy. We are still considering how we should deal with any alteration to the list, so I cannot tell her whether it will be by affirmative or negative resolution. We are at present considering how to respond. We have taken on board what has been said in Committee about the importance of changing the list. As I said earlier, we think it unlikely that any significant changes will be made to the list very soon. The noble Baroness will know that when enlargement takes place, there will be 25 or 27 member states, and there are hugely important issues for us to address.
<P>

<a name="30708-38_para8"></a>The work on the framework decision involved many hours, months and years of deliberation to reach this stage. Your Lordships will see that the list is fairly comprehensive. It covers the majority, almost to the exclusion of the offences that should be covered. At present, we do not see the need to increase the number of offences, not least because your Lordships will see that the list deals with generic types of crime as opposed to specific crimes. That leads to what I said earlier&#151;we have not defined them and we use different names. I also say to the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, who rightly raised the same issue, that we shall continue to consider the matter. I can assure him that everything said in the Committee will be taken into account.
<P>

<a name="30708-38_para9"></a>However, I must say as gently as possible that we cannot really define the nature of other countries' offences and how they craft offences within their own states. I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, said that these laws should not have a place in any other nation in the EU. As is the case with other <P>


<a name="column_GC63"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC63</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>countries, we are not subject to anyone else's diktat. I know from the many contributions that the noble Lord has made to our debates in a very energetic and thoughtful way that he would be absolutely appalled if anyone else in Europe sought to tell us what should be on the face of our statute book.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-38_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   Unfortunately I have to deal with things that are. It is true that I not only would resent but would always resent being told by other countries what we should do. But, of course, the whole essence, and indeed the whole concept, of belonging to the European Union depends on democracy and free speech. If you do not believe in that, you really should not be in the European Union. It was in that sense that I said that the term "xenophobia", which is difficult to interpret, should not be part of any free and democratic state which believes in free speech. If it is, then that state should not be in the European Union in the first place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-38_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I believe that takes us down a very difficult and thorny path. Of course, implicit in the debate that we have had is a recognition that certain forms of xenophobia are illegal in our own legislation and are also illegal in the legislation of other states. However, the issue is whether we can confine how this generic term should be used.
<P>

<a name="30708-38_para10"></a>I believe it is right to say that the countries which at present have crafted their laws while pursuing the generic term "xenophobia" have all created laws which pertain to the needs of their particular state. Of course, I recognise the sympathy that has been shown and the acknowledgement that has been expressed in this Committee and, indeed, elsewhere with regard to the nature of Holocaust denial in relation to Germany. We are not including this generic term on the face of the Bill for any one writer. I believe we all know that that is simply an example of the problem that we might need to face.
<P>

<a name="30708-38_para11"></a>Therefore, we cannot have a definitive list because we cannot force any other EU partner to say that it will never seek to change its law. As I said earlier in Committee, the whole premise upon which this issue is founded is that we work in comity with our partners and we respect their traditions and their ability as democratic states to craft laws which meet the needs of their systems. Provided the offences fall within the criteria set out in the framework decision, we believe that we should properly respect that agreement. I do not believe that we will be able to give the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, the definitive list that she seeks, because that is simply not within our control. We can say what it is now and where there is dissonance or difference, but we would not be able to say that for all time. Certainly, before the list changes, we could determine what each European Union state believed to be included within the generic term. I hope that Members of the Committee will understand the limitations that we face in relation to these matters.

<P>

<a name="30708-38_para12"></a>I agree, somewhat unusually, with the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart of Swindon, and, perhaps less unusually, with the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy. Like them, I am puzzled as to why the Government are not prepared to take the obvious course in relation to adding new offences to the list, which would be through an Order in Council approved by the affirmative resolution procedure. It seems to me that anything less than that would be entirely inappropriate.
<P>

<a name="30708-38_para13"></a>On xenophobia and racism, the Government are, of course, much less accommodating and indeed have not moved at all. I understand the difficulties that the Government face, but the issue certainly worries us. If I might hark back to a debate that we had at our previous sitting, I think that our concern would be that much greater if the Government were to insist on applying the abolition of the dual criminality rule to offences that carry&#151;to use an oxymoron&#151;a minimum maximum sentence of 12 months, when they could perfectly legitimately stick to the minimum maximum sentence of three years, which is the sentence that is required by the European framework decision.
<P>

<a name="30708-38_para14"></a>In light of that, the inclusion of racism and xenophobia in its present and entirely undefined form becomes increasingly objectionable. That will have to wait for another occasion to be further debated, as I have every expectation that it will be. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30708-39_para2"></a>As we have said repeatedly throughout the debate on Part 1 of the Bill, significant safeguards are being removed. We have concerns about that.

<FONT SIZE=3>currently they feel they are not so exposed. Those fears are, perhaps, nowhere more acute than in the international sporting community.
<P>

<a name="30708-39_para3"></a>As a matter of course, accidents abound in international sport, whether in motor racing, equestrian sports, yachting, rugby or football&#151;all those sports lead to players sustaining serious injuries. Depending on who is found to be at fault in accidents of that nature, it is possible that extradition may be sought under the category of murder or grievous bodily harm. More concern will be voiced, especially among the motor-sports community, if legislation is introduced for corporate manslaughter and that becomes a category of offence in the list of 32.

<A NAME="30708-39_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   The noble Baroness mentioned a number of points in connection with international sporting events. Is there anything that is not caught by the criminal law in any event?

I had not; I had actually spoken to a quarter of a page. There are four pages and perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, will excuse me if I complete the rest, as that will answer his question. I raise the issue because members of the motor-sports community in particular are concerned by exactly the point that he raises; that is, under the Bill, they would be exposed to extradition where currently they feel they are not. They feel that something new is developing; hence the amendments. Members of the sporting community want to ask the Government to put on the record whether their fears are properly grounded.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>not collide with another car and there seemed to be no reason for him to veer off the road. However, a unique set of factors, I am advised, combined to cause the fatal accident.
<P>

<a name="30708-39_para7"></a>There was an immediate investigation into the accident. Motor racing experts believed that the cause must have been mechanical failure. They believed that Ayrton Senna could not have lost control of his vehicle for any other reason. An inquiry concluded that the accident was caused by a snapped steering column. As a result, manslaughter charges were brought against six members of Senna's Williams racing team, including Frank Williams himself. All were eventually acquitted and, in 1997, the prosecutor's appeal was rejected.
<P>

<a name="30708-39_para8"></a>But the snapped steering column theory gave way to a new explanation at that time that Senna's death was simply a freak accident, a tragic consequence of a unique combination of factors. Given Ayrton Senna's status within Formula 1 and given that there had been two deaths at Imola over that weekend in May 1994, it is hardly surprising that it took no time at all for journalists, motor-racing experts, fans and others to come up with possible reasons for the accident.
<P>

<a name="30708-39_para9"></a>I have spent some time referring to that specific case because it has focused the mind of the international motor sport industry on the issue of extradition. It has highlighted the complexities of fatal or near fatal accidents in that industry, one where it is hard, if not impossible, to ascertain who is to blame. We know that inquiries are often long and controversial but it is absolutely clear that accidents such as that involving Ayrton Senna are not infrequent.
<P>

<a name="30708-39_para10"></a>Not only the motor sports industry is concerned about this issue. We should bear in mind that the Olympics are to be held in Athens in 2004. We have brought forward the amendments to probe this complicated issue. We feel that the motor sports industry has a right to be wary of the implications of the European arrest warrant. It is concerned that every case involving accidents or injuries could lead to the possibility of numerous arrest warrants being issued for the prosecution of those involved.
<P>

<a name="30708-39_para11"></a>As to the earlier intervention of the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, the difference between the extradition system in the Bill, which will be used in the future, and the extradition system that has pertained until now is that the existing arrangements have a back-stop in that the Home Secretary is able to decide whether or not an extradition should go ahead. That falls within Part 1. As we have discussed this matter on previous occasions, I shall do no more than outline that point telegraphically.
<P>

<a name="30708-39_para12"></a>We have been told several times by the Minister and her predecessor, the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, that the purpose of the European arrest warrant is to fight international crime&#151;not only terrorism but drugs trafficking, fraud and so on. Everyone is wholeheartedly behind the Government in that fight. But we would argue that an accidental death or injury in an international sporting event resulting from a combination of unfortunate circumstances, such as in <P>


<a name="column_GC67"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC67</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Ayrton Senna case, is in a different vein. It is important that the Government should set out why they believe that such cases should be included in the extradition procedure.
<P>

<a name="30708-39_para13"></a>The position of sport within the international community is unique and my noble friend Lord Moynihan, who has recently been appointed as our Shadow Minister for Sport, covering both Houses, will deal later with that specific issue.
<P>

<a name="30708-39_para14"></a>The amendments seek to ask the Government to put assurances on the record as to why international sport should not be concerned. If they are able to put such assurances on the record, no one&#151;apart from the international sporting community&#151;will be happier than we.
<P>

<a name="30708-39_para15"></a>The first amendment would ensure that the Secretary of State retained discretion in matters relating to international sport where extradition was being sought. The second amendment would make an exception in the category of events of murder and grievous bodily harm in circumstances where the offence was committed by a participant in an international sporting event.
<P>

<a name="30708-39_para16"></a>I accept that my amendments are not perfectly drafted. They are a tool for debate. I appreciate in particular that participants in sporting events raise specific problems. I look carefully at the noble Viscount in saying that because I am sure that he will tear apart the drafting. As the Minister often tells us, it is a small thing, but my own. It is my fault entirely. I could not think of any other way. I understand full well that they could be thought to include fans in the terraces cheering on their teams. I know they are faulty. They are brought forward in an attempt to raise the issue and to give the Government the opportunity to satisfy the international sporting community that it has nothing to fear, because at the moment that fear is real. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-39_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   I raised an objection earlier to the amendments we are now considering. Everything the noble Baroness has said supports my objection. I understand why she raises the issue and she is entitled to adduce some sort of evidence&#151;I emphasise the words "some sort of evidence"&#151;before the Committee, but there is nothing in this. I have a real objection to debating issues merely for the sake of debating them. I understand why she does it, but I believe that she is wrong.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-39_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   Before the noble Lord goes any further, perhaps it might assist if I give him some of the background. I shall be a little indiscreet in so doing.
<P>

<a name="30708-39_para17"></a>This matter was raised behind the scenes in another place with my honourable friend. There was an attempt to seek assurances from the Government on the record. Those reassurances were not given on the record. We are sure that the Government made serious and concerted attempts to give the assurances behind the scenes. Those were not accepted. What I am doing, therefore, is perfectly proper in the circumstances. We <P>


<a name="column_GC68"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC68</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>want to give a significant part of the public&#151;those involved in international sports&#151;the opportunity to be heard.
<P>

<a name="30708-39_para18"></a>I made clear in my opening remarks that the fear is that Part 1 removes safeguards. We have discussed the safeguards in great detail in the past and I do not feel that it is proper for me to do so again. If the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, wants me to rehearse those arguments once more, I shall&#151;but I suspect that I will try the patience of the Committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-40_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   Never. Impossible. The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, knows that I have the highest regard for her, but I believe&#151;and I am prepared to emphasise the point&#151;that it is possible to achieve her aims in another way&#151;for example, by tabling Questions or by seeing the Minister privately. If she cannot do that, there are other ways&#151;for example, the newspapers, the broadcasting media and so on. It is wrong in principle to address an issue here which can be addressed in other ways.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-40_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I need to intervene at this point because the noble Lord is going to the heart of what I consider to be the principle of parliamentary democracy&#151;namely, the right of the people to have their issues raised here. If the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, believes that that is not proper, then I am afraid that he and I have completely opposite views on the function of Parliament.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-40_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   Nothing the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, has said alters what I said before. I have the highest regard for her, notwithstanding her intervention. However, I believe that addressing issues on the basis that "It is not really material but we want to do it" is wrong. I have made my objection very clear, but nothing will alter my friendship for the noble Baroness notwithstanding that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-40_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   These are moving interventions but perhaps we might speed matters up so that we can hear whether the Minister is prepared to go a little further in public than her colleague in the other place. A clear explanation has been given by my noble friend as to why she has brought the amendments forward&#151;it seems entirely proper&#151;and we look forward with keen anticipation and some optimism to a positive response from the Minister.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-40_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Bledisloe: </B>   Before the Minister responds, I cannot resist the temptation cast before me to draw attention to the many defects in the drafting and to say something about the substance.
<P>

<a name="30708-40_para0"></a>As to the drafting, it is amazing that, first, it applies only if an act has been committed&#151;so it is no good for someone who is innocent, only for someone who is guilty. Secondly, it governs only a participant in a sporting event&#151;so the various manufacturers and managers to whom the noble Baroness referred would not be affected. Thirdly, and even more curiously, it is not limited to offences committed in an international sporting event. If the fight Mr Tyson had in his hotel <P>


<a name="column_GC69"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC69</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>had been an international sporting event, it would have applied to him in relation to his rape. But it does not. The drafting is, if I may say so, miles out.
<P>

<a name="30708-40_para1"></a>Secondly, and much more importantly, I simply see no substance to the amendment. Why on earth should those who consciously go to a foreign country to take part in a sporting event have greater protection than casual visitors to that country if it is said that, in the course of that sporting event, they killed or injured someone grievously by going miles outside the sport? What criteria is it suggested that the Home Secretary apply? In the case cited by the noble Baroness, the Home Secretary is seemingly to investigate matters of high mechanical technology and first-guess the court of the country as to what the real cause of the accident is.
<P>

<a name="30708-40_para2"></a>Why on earth should those who choose to indulge in the noisy and tiresome sport of motor racing have greater protection than those who take their car to a foreign country and merely drive it around? The amendment seems misdrafted, misconceived and altogether undesirable.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-40_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I am sorry that the noble Viscount is quite so critical of my noble friend. The amendment is probing, and we are all sorry that it is not better drafted, but the fact remains. It occurs to me that people get extremely worked up at sporting events, feel rather nationalistic, and do not always play absolutely fair. In the high dudgeon of a sporting event, it is possible that someone might be charged with corruption, swindling or fear of foreigners. That seems a very good example of the problems of the Bill, albeit that the solution may not be such an amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-40_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Moynihan: </B>   I am reeling and recovering from the idea that anyone could describe motor racing as noisy and tiresome. It is, of course, one of the finest sports in the land, and we should be very proud of our success in it. Equally, we should have a duty associated with that pride in supporting our motor-racing teams and all those associated with motor racing in international sport when they travel to Grand Prix around Europe and the world.
<P>

<a name="30708-40_para3"></a>One of the important arguments levelled against the amendment is that there is nothing in it&#151;that we should simply raise the issue with the press because it has no basis in legislation. That is totally misguided. My noble friend Lady Anelay was wise to focus on the extraordinary implications of the Senna case. That case goes right to the heart of a widespread concern in British sport as to the safeguards that exist in the context of extradition that will be lost with the passage of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30708-40_para4"></a>There is no doubt that it is wise for the Committee to focus, first and foremost, on the fact that there is widespread concern, and not only in motor racing. The amendments address that concern. There is knowledge and awareness that there could be a costly government penalty, not only in the pit lanes of every motor-racing team in the land, but for all those involved in motor <P>


<a name="column_GC70"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC70</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sports, cycling, boxing and all sports in which there is an element of danger and, in extreme circumstances, in which someone can be injured or killed.
<P>

<a name="30708-40_para5"></a>In particular, the Bill will damage the high standing of motor racing, and will render the United Kingdom less likely to be the leading home to the sport. As has been expressed by other Members of the Committee, we are worried that it will severely deter voluntary officials from taking up assignments, not to mention those who are asked to be responsible for licensing or to accept the job of a steward in a European event. If the Bill is passed, they may simply say no.
<P>

<a name="30708-40_para6"></a>That is not only my view. In the first week in which I have been back in this job, I have spoken to Frank Williams, discussed the subject with Bernie Ecclestone in the House, talked through the implications with Max Mosley, as well as seeking advice and support from a range of governing bodies. I have to report&#151;I would like the Minister to reflect on this before the Bill returns to the Floor of the House&#151;that no one in sport sees anything but damage to the organisation and management of international sport, the support staff, volunteers and employees if the Government's legislation is passed unamended.
<P>

<a name="30708-40_para7"></a>Members of the Committee have asked what is so special about sport&#151;what makes it different from other areas in European law. The position of sport in the international community is unique. The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, and I had the opportunity to review and reflect on that in some detail when it came to the Nice treaty, when I was on the Front Bench in a different capacity. To use a phrase that he used earlier, different issues are seen in different ways in different countries and cultures. For that reason, and because there is no legal basis for sport within European treaties&#151;sport is on the whole self-regulating through international bodies&#151;sport is rightly subject to the subsidiarity principle and is a matter for member states.
<P>

<a name="30708-40_para8"></a>EU states agreed a declaration on sport in Nice in 2000, however. Again, I urge the Government to have another close look at that before Report, subject to the wisdom of the Minister in accepting in principle the thrust of what is behind opposition amendments today. I fully appreciate, however, that they are probing amendments, in the true practice of the House and, indeed, another place. The idea is to probe government thinking and, if necessary, come back at a later stage with more polished amendments to address the valuable contributions that Members of the Committee have made.
<P>

<a name="30708-40_para9"></a>That is essential. If the matter is not addressed, there will be very genuine concern across British sport about the grey area between the laws of different member states and the self-regulation at the heart of sport. That is especially so in sports where there is a high level of danger such as those that I mentioned, sometimes leading to injury or very regrettably to death, despite the highest standards of safety applied by the international and national governing bodies. Unless the problem is addressed, there will be real concern that the Government have let down British sport by <P>


<a name="column_GC71"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC71</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>taking away the safeguards that it has at present. From all those to whom I have spoken in my first week back in the job, that view is unanimous. If that voice is misplaced, it is incumbent on the Government to address it in detail and allay the concerns that exist outside this House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-40_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   I ask the Minister to address in her remarks a more modest aspect of international sporting events. She or her officials may be aware that a number of school sporting tours to the continent are having to be cancelled because of the difficulty&#151;the impossibility in terms of costs&#151;in obtaining insurance cover for people participating. In particular, the problem revolves around rugby tours in France, where there have been accidents and where, regrettably, people have been left not dead but paraplegic because of difficulties in the scrum.
<P>

<a name="30708-40_para10"></a>Referees and coaches have been involved by the government in France&#151;I am not quite sure at what level of government&#151;in the inquiries and prosecutions following that. Referees have been involved because they are responsible for controlling the game, so the fact that that happened in scrums is believed to be their responsibility. The coaches have been involved because they are alleged to have engendered an over-aggressive attitude towards the playing of the game that has led to undue physical violence, leading to the paraplegic and other damages to which I have referred.
<P>

<a name="30708-40_para11"></a>So far, the problems have been with insurance&#151;the costs of dealing with the inquiry and providing cover for it. Supposing that the Bill were passed unamended, when members of the opposing team were inadvertently injured&#151;no one properly suggests that there has been an attempt to injure them deliberately; indeed, some of the injuries have been among those from English schools&#151;would coaches and referees from schools in this country fall to be extradited under Part 1?

<P>
<A NAME="30708-41_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   In listening to the speeches of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, and the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, I have been reminded of the immortal words of the legendary Bill Shankly, who said, "Football isn't a matter of life and death&#151;it's more important than that". Looking at the amendment, I can see no reason whatever why sport in general, or motor racing in particular, should be given an exemption that does not apply across the board.
<P>

<a name="30708-41_para0"></a>Why should people involved in sporting accidents who are accused of manslaughter be entitled to an exemption that does not apply to the United Kingdom manufacturer of a product sold to some other country of the European Union where there is an allegation of defects so serious and negligence so great that it amounts to manslaughter? No exemption is entitled to the manufacturer in such a case, and I can see no reason for making a special exemption for sport. After all, when it comes to a choice between justice and sport, justice is the more important of the two.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-41_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   For the same reasons as the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, I cannot support the <P>


<a name="column_GC72"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC72</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendment. It is too narrow. One immediately has to ask whether international sport covers professional or amateur events. If it covers both, what about the entertainment industry? A lot of ballet dancers can get badly hurt when dancing on stage, for example. Circus performers are certainly at great risk. Why should the provision not apply to them? Scouts on a jamboree could be at risk, and could have just as deserving a case as an international sportsman.
<P>

<a name="30708-41_para1"></a>If the amendment were differently worded and applied to all people who might be at risk of extradition, and if the appropriate Minister had the last say, that would be a different matter. We had a discussion about that earlier in our deliberations. By taking away the political judgment in the high court of Parliament, if I can put it that way, we now have one of the laws of unintended consequences. As I said earlier, I believe that there are circumstances when the political authority has the right to intervene to defend the interests of a British citizen.
<P>

<a name="30708-41_para2"></a>Before Report, I hope that people will reflect on that. Perhaps we can table an amendment to ensure that, in certain circumstances, all citizens will in the ultimate degree have the benefit of the protection of the political authorities in Parliament.

<A NAME="30708-41_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   We have had a very full debate and I have rarely heard such sporting contributions to an amendment. I hope that what I have to say in response will give a modicum of satisfaction to all Members of the Committee. Before I do so, however, perhaps I may warmly welcome the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, back to a much more familiar place on the Front Bench. I congratulate him on his new role as the shadow Minister for Sport in both Houses. I shall be very interested to see how he exercises his duties in the other place, although they will not have the pleasure that we have had this afternoon.

<P>

<a name="30708-41_para3"></a>I should say straightaway to the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, that, notwithstanding the imperfections which were so graphically and succinctly outlined by the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, I accept absolutely that she tabled the amendment in order for us to debate it. I do not seek to make further sport of the issue at her expense.
<P>

<a name="30708-41_para4"></a>We have some interesting issues to discuss here, although if this were a sporting event then I have to say to the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, that I think he would lose. But this is far more important than a mere game and therefore I say to him that I really do not think there is much to fear; we are not changing the system so as to make sportsmen and women and those engaged in sporting activities more disadvantaged than they are at present.
<P>


<a name="column_GC73"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC73</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30708-41_para5"></a>I listened with great care to all that was said by the noble Lord, to seek to ascertain from him the basis of his concerns. He explained that he thought that damage would be caused to sport&#151;he made many assertions to that effect&#151;but I had a little difficulty in getting a clear statement from him on exactly what those concerns were based. Having said that, I hope that I shall be able to give a definitive response, but if there are other matters of particular concern to Members of the Committee, I hope that, after my explanation, they will say so.
<P>

<a name="30708-41_para6"></a>It will probably not surprise the Committee to learn that I do not think we can single out sporting activities in the way suggested, which was the point made by the noble Lords, Lord Goodhart and Lord Stoddart, and in a different way by my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis. I am sure that the Committee will recall that we touched on this issue when we considered Amendments Nos. 112 and 126, relating to conduct which may have occurred in the United Kingdom. On that occasion I sought to deal with some of the anxieties that had been raised by people in the sporting world. The noble Baroness was kind enough to indicate those anxieties at the time and I sought to address them.
<P>

<a name="30708-41_para7"></a>I pointed out then that the Bill as now amended provides that if any part of the conduct occurs in the United Kingdom, we can extradite only if that conduct would be seen as illegal over here. On that basis, I do not believe that those who run the United Kingdom-based Formula 1 teams need have any concerns about the introduction of the European arrest warrant. The amendment provides that where death or serious injury has resulted from a sporting event, the case should come to the Secretary of State for him to decide whether extradition would be proper. I have to ask what the word "proper" means for these purposes. I can foresee all kinds of legal challenges turning on that point. I mention this element because I know that it is very much a part of the plea which has been made&#151;that the Secretary of State should remain engaged.
<P>

<a name="30708-41_para8"></a>I also do not believe that it would be sensible to single out sport in this way. Tragically, sporting activity can lead to serious injuries and deaths, but it is not the only such activity. If we were to accept the amendment, presumably we would then face pressure for an equivalent provision from every UK mining company engaged in work overseas and from every construction company undertaking jobs in other countries. They would pursue the same theme. No doubt airlines would join the queue for a special exemption, as would almost any British company which owned or ran a factory outside these shores. Quite simply, I do not believe that that would be workable.
<P>

<a name="30708-41_para9"></a>Those individuals whose specific actions lead to death or injury will continue to be liable for extradition, as they are at present. Those who have not been directly involved, but who perhaps set the general company policy and direction from the United Kingdom, will be able to establish that part of their action took place in this country, so they will be safe from extradition as long as their conduct was not <P>


<a name="column_GC74"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC74</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>deemed criminal over here. If their conduct would constitute an offence in the United Kingdom, there is then no reason why they should be exempt from extradition, but so long as the United Kingdom does not regard their conduct as criminal, they are protected from the possibility of extradition.
<P>

<a name="30708-41_para10"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness will be content with that assurance, but it is right that I touch on the other position she raised because, as she pointed out, there is an issue as regards what would happen if, in due course, corporate manslaughter became a matter of criminal consequence here in the United Kingdom. If corporate manslaughter were to become a criminal offence in this country, punishable with a term of imprisonment in excess of one year, it would become an offence which could be capable of extradition.
<P>

<a name="30708-41_para11"></a>Of course, as I am sure the noble Baroness will agree, it is the function of Parliament to decide whether corporate manslaughter is a proper offence that should appear on our statute book. If it should, the conditions on which it should be established and any safeguards that are necessary will, I know, be anxiously and creatively debated&#151;if in no other place, then right here. I have enjoyed the company of noble Lords on a number of Bills and I do not anticipate that they will stray very far when that issue comes to be debated. At that point all the vigour and verve brought by noble Lords to the consideration of this matter will be heard.
<P>

<a name="30708-41_para12"></a>As I have said, individuals directly responsible for death or injury will be extraditable, as they are at the moment. Let us look at the position of the Secretary of State in this. One has to ask whether the Secretary of State would have a reason to refuse an extradition request where it involved death or injury, whether or not it occurred in a sporting context. I ask that because these are extremely serious matters which need to be resolved in a court of law.
<P>

<a name="30708-41_para13"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, asked what would be the position in terms of school sports and pointed out the fears that have arisen in relation thereto. I can respond to the noble Lord by saying that that self-same matter has become an issue for the playing and maintenance of sporting conditions in this country. I refer to claims properly made by those who have been injured that rely on lack of proper regulation, lack of proper instruction or lack of proper opportunity. Such issues are now a feature of sport, in particular those sporting activities perceived to be dangerous. Rugby, boxing and a number of other sports would be so classed.
<P>

<a name="30708-41_para14"></a>Here we face a challenge, not only internationally but in this country, to ensure that the way in which we regulate sport&#151;the noble Lord pointed out that sport is self-regulated and it is right that it should be&#151;means that the regulations in place enable our young people and all those who engage in sport to do so safely, in accordance with the law, and to ensure that there are no breaches. I say that because the knowledge that there are justiciable consequences for negligence and failure have enabled us to maintain very robust <P>

<A NAME="30708-42_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   While I accept all that the noble Baroness has said, the point I sought to make is that it is not clear exactly what are the justiciable conditions she has just referred to in France and Italy in relation to, say, a British football referee taking a school sporting event in which an injury occurs. I understand that until now there has been the failsafe of the Secretary of State. Under this procedure, that failsafe will no longer be available, so that such a referee, perhaps a schoolmaster doing his best, could be extradited to France, Spain or Italy without being able in any way to hold back the procedure in order to discuss the justiciable conditions in that country vis-a-vis the ones in place here.
<P>

<a name="30708-42_para0"></a>I cite here people who are not engaged in any form of commercial activity. They are only endeavouring to improve the educational experience of schoolchildren. Notwithstanding the points made in the Minister's response, it seems to me that what is needed here is clarity and knowledge of how those countries treat these kinds of events. At present there is a great fear that what goes on in those countries is quite different from our approach; it is a much more legalistic and less insurance-based process.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-42_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I understand the fears expressed by the noble Lord, but I should say to him that that is the position now. I say that because at the moment countries can seek the extradition of sports coaches and referees. Whether they are extradited would depend on the offence for which extradition is sought. If it is an offence of serious injury or manslaughter, those people will be extraditable, as they are now.
<P>

<a name="30708-42_para1"></a>It is important for us to remind ourselves of and understand the process that is to be adopted both in relation to Part 1 and Part 2 applications. It is a judicial process during which the skilled district judge will have an opportunity to consider whether the grounds have been made out. Earlier in Committee we were able to explore the way in which that can be done. It is not proposed that there should be ministerial involvement in Part 1 cases. However, as the Committee knows, in Part 2 the Home Office will satisfy itself, first, that the request comes from a bona fide source; secondly, it is for the court to consider; and thirdly, the Home Secretary will make the surrender decision and consider the basis for extradition.
<P>

<a name="30708-42_para2"></a>Nothing that we have done in this part will impinge on the need to go through the same legal process. We would argue strongly that those who are anxious about the changes should be no more anxious than they are at present&#151;and we hope that they are appropriately anxious about the way in which they discharge their duties.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-42_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I thank the Minister for her full and clear explanation of the Government's position. She has quite properly recognised the <P>


<a name="column_GC76"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC76</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>concerns that have been expressed by representatives of the motor-sport industry as well as by people involved in other sporting activities. It is right that, for our part, we should go back to those who have expressed anxiety and seek their view on the position as the noble Baroness has laid it out today.
<P>

<a name="30708-42_para3"></a>There is one point that I should have made in opening this wide-ranging debate which has covered many different sports: I do not have any personal interests to declare here. Perhaps that is more of an embarrassing admission than anything else, but with regard to motor sports, I have to say that as yet I have not even been to a motor race. My noble friend the shadow Minister for Sport looks a little shocked at that revelation, but I have to say that the closest I have ever come to a Formula 1 car was when Team McLaren was kind enough to hold a British Heart Foundation charity event in Woking. We were allowed to get as close as possible to the car, but not close enough to spoil the paintwork.
<P>

<a name="30708-42_para4"></a>I raise these questions not out of personal interest but out of interest in all matters raised with Members of this House by individuals and organisations outwith this House. I understand the points made by the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, and the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, that they do not see sport as something special that needs different treatment. However, the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, really got to the core of my difficulties in this part. He said that I have drawn these amendments too narrowly and that we should be concerned about the generality of people who will be affected by Part 1. He is right in saying that we lose the protection of the backstop of the Secretary of State's decision.
<P>

<a name="30708-42_para5"></a>When the Minister was answering my noble friend Lord Hodgson about the impact on school sports, she referred, quite rightly, to the fact that in Part 2, the Home Secretary's position remains. We support that entirely, as we have said in the past&#151;we simply lament that it is going from Part 1.
<P>

<a name="30708-42_para6"></a>We shall consider the position very carefully between now and Report. I assure the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, that I will look carefully at drafting an amendment that will not fall foul of the very proper chiding that I received on this drafting from the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC77</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30708-42_para12"></a>The amendments are intended to probe the issue of who should be "the appropriate judge" in Parts 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Extradition cases in England and Wales are handled by Bow Street Magistrates' Court. I am sure that all those who have been working on the Bill realise the complexity of extradition law. I certainly admired the way in which it was handled by the judges at Bow Street when I was observing them.
<P>

<a name="30708-42_para13"></a>The Bill allows the Lord Chancellor&#151;while he still exists&#151;to designate as the appropriate judge in England and Wales any district judge (magistrates' courts) and in Northern Ireland any county court judge or resident magistrate. In Scotland, the sheriff of Lothian and Borders will be the appropriate judge. That seems a somewhat curious state of affairs. I was grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, who wrote to us after we had a meeting on Scotland. Let me say again that it was a most useful departure to have that meeting on Scottish law matters. The letter written subsequently answered so many questions that my noble friend Lady Carnegy was able to withdraw several amendments.
<P>

<a name="30708-42_para14"></a>Paragraph 2.2 of the letter made it quite clear on what basis the appropriate judge had been so named in Scotland:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Part 1 makes reference throughout to the appropriate judge. For Scotland this is defined in clause 66 as the Sheriff of Lothian and Borders. This continues the exclusive jurisdiction of the Sheriff of Lothian and Borders to hear extradition cases as provided for under the 1989 Act. It makes sense to do so for two reasons. Firstly it will build the experience of extradition gained by sheriffs in Lothian and Borders since the enactment of the 1989 Act and secondly there is insufficient extradition business in Scotland to justify hearing extradition cases in more than one Sheriffdom".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-42_para15"></a>
I would like to pick up on the two reasons and say why I think they could be argued to apply equally well to England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="30708-42_para16"></a>Bow Street Magistrates' Court has considerable expertise in hearing extradition cases. I have some concerns about the implications of designating other district courts which have never before dealt with extradition cases.
<P>

<a name="30708-42_para17"></a>How many courts is the Lord Chancellor intending to designate for this purpose? What criteria will be followed in so designating them? Our amendments would ensure that no court could be designated under Parts 1, 2 or 3 unless the judges have undertaken the required course of training and development in extradition procedure, as introduced by this legislation.
<P>

<a name="30708-42_para18"></a>With due humility, I made sure that the Bow Street magistrates knew I was tabling this amendment. I made it clear that I appreciated that they would not need any training and that I was not seriously saying that they would all have to troop off for a specified course of training but was trying to probe the Government's intentions. I was intrigued by their response that it is quite difficult to provide training in this matter because of its rarity and the fact that it has been concentrated in the hands of so few people. If the Government are going to roll cases out to other courts, it will be quite difficult to provide training, much of which has to be done on the job, especially since the <P>


<a name="column_GC78"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC78</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government tell us that they expect an expansion of extradition business, if I can call it that, as a result of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30708-42_para19"></a>The second reason given by the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, was that there are not many extradition cases in Scotland. I should have thought there might be even fewer in Northern Ireland, although I have not looked at the figures recently. As for England and Wales, we know that figures average at about 100 cases a year. Could the Minister clarify how many district judges are likely to be designated? We accept that the Government have a responsibility to ensure that the courts are properly funded and resourced to carry out these cases. Have they assessed the costs for ensuring that more courts deal with these cases, rather than just Bow Street?
<P>

<a name="30708-42_para20"></a>I observed the difficult conditions under which Bow Street operates. It is not the most lavishly equipped court. I am trying to be diplomatic&#151;I do not mean to be too offensive to the Government. I realise that some money has been spent on Bow Street Magistrates' Court, but not a lot. It still operates under very difficult conditions. What estimate have the Government made of future budgetary needs to ensure that Bow Street is fully able to deal with cases in the appropriate conditions without sitting cheek by jowl, as happens in Court 3 at the moment? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-43_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for having tabled the amendments; they provide us with the opportunity to set out more clearly how we see this aspect of extradition working in the future.
<P>

<a name="30708-43_para0"></a>As the Bill is drafted, Clauses 66 and 139 define the appropriate judge for hearing extradition cases under Parts 1 and 2 of the Bill. The appropriate judges are as follows: in England and Wales it is any district judge designated by the Lord Chancellor&#151;while he exists. In Scotland, it is the sheriff of Lothian and Borders and in Northern Ireland any county court judge or resident magistrate designated by the Lord Chancellor.
<P>

<a name="30708-43_para1"></a>I do not think anyone has any doubt that cases in Scotland will be handled well by the sheriff of Lothian and Borders. What may in due course change is how cases in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are dealt with. At present, anyone arrested for extradition purposes anywhere in any of those three countries is brought to London for the case to be heard at Bow Street Magistrates' Court. Although Court 3 may not be the most salubrious of settings, it is nevertheless a very sensible location.
<P>

<a name="30708-43_para2"></a>There is a good reason for this central location. Extradition law is very specialist and Bow Street has a cadre of district judges and clerks who have a great deal of expertise in this area. It has been very helpful that the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, has spent time there, although I am not sure that it was something she delighted in doing. I spent a bit of time there some years ago for other reasons&#151;I cannot remember when or why, but it was not the most gratifying experience. I pay tribute to her for her particular interest in this matter and for taking the time to understand how things work.
<P>


<a name="column_GC79"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC79</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30708-43_para3"></a>The Government believe they need to examine whether it is sensible for every extradition case in England, Wales and Northern Ireland to be heard in London. It is commonly understood that there will be an expansion in the numbers of cases heard. While at the moment it is a tiny handful, we all accept that there will be an increase. For that reason, we think there should be or will be a small number of judicial centres outside London where these cases can be dealt with.
<P>

<a name="30708-43_para4"></a>There are sound practical reasons for this. If a fugitive is arrested in Carlisle, Cornwall, Cardiff or Coleraine, it does not really make sense for them to be transported all the way to London for the extradition hearing. For that reason, we envisage having district judges presiding over extradition hearings in a handful of judicial centres outside London. What is a handful? There will be perhaps three or four, all of which will need several district judges to make sure they can provide year-round service and cover. So it will be a small number of people. We believe that they will need to be trained but we do not expect the demand to be immediate. I suspect that it will be a slow and incremental process, with the new locations dependent upon the number of requests received, the balance of where the cases fall, the areas in which they fall and where arrests are made.
<P>

<a name="30708-43_para5"></a>The other reason why the development of regional centres dealing with extradition cases will be a slow and gradual process is because, as I have already indicated, extradition law is complex and specialist. Clearly, before any place could begin operating as a regional extradition centre, there would need to be a sufficient number of district judges and clerks based there who were fully conversant with our extradition law and the requirements it imposes.
<P>

<a name="30708-43_para6"></a>That brings me to the heart of the amendments. I agree absolutely with the spirit behind them. District judges must receive proper, effective and skilled training and development before they can expect to preside over extradition cases. I can give the assurance that the noble Baroness is after&#151;the Lord Chancellor is very seized of this point and no district judge will be designated to handle extradition cases unless he or she has been properly trained for that role. We believe that to be very important. They will need to be very skilled and to include in their CV much relevant experience, perhaps based on practice.
<P>

<a name="30708-43_para7"></a>It would not be in the United Kingdom's interest, the fugitive's interest, the requesting state's interest and certainly not in the interests of justice to have a person who was unqualified and ill prepared in charge of an extradition case. I can give the assurance that that will not happen.
<P>

<a name="30708-43_para8"></a>Amendments Nos. 237 and 238 are concerned with who can issue outgoing extradition requests. If your Lordships care to look at Clause 149, you will see that the field is rather that for hearing extradition cases wider since it includes any JP or, in Scotland, any sheriff. The reason is that issuing an outgoing European arrest warrant is very similar to issuing a normal domestic arrest warrant, with the same <P>


<a name="column_GC80"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC80</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>considerations applying. Nevertheless, I can assure your Lordships that we will be issuing guidance to JPs&#151;the noble Baroness has experience in that field&#151;on the exercise of this new function.
<P>

<a name="30708-43_para9"></a>I hope that, having heard what I have said, and, in particular, the firm undertaking that no district judge will be designated without proper training, the noble Baroness will agree with my earlier suggestion that we are at one on the point and withdraw her amendment with some comfort.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-43_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for his assurance that no district judge will be able to hear a case unless he or she has been properly trained prior to that. It is important to consider that when these complex cases are rolled out to this handful of centres they are not only properly dealt with but the courts are properly resourced.
<P>

<a name="30708-43_para10"></a>I referred&#151;not too flippantly, I hope&#151;to Court 3; I do not want to be flippant about the circumstances under which its operates. Court 3 is probably the smallest court that one could get into, so the number of interpreters necessary and the interest of the press makes things quite difficult. I suspect that it is used less frequently than the others, because people whose cases are heard in Court 3 are on bail&#151;it is not a secure court. The other courts also labour under difficulties, and I hope that the Government can take on board the budgetary implications of rolling out these cases to other courts nationwide.
<P>

<a name="30708-43_para11"></a>Just before I withdraw the amendment, I notice that yet again, as the Minister mentioned, the clause refers to the Lord Chancellor. It therefore crosses my mind again what a torrent of legislation we shall face if the Government persist in wanting to abolish the post of Lord Chancellor. We shall need to change every reference to that post in our legislation. I must say that I look on that task with dread. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="30708-43_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   This is one of very few clause stand part debates in Part 2 to which I have given notice that I should like to speak.
<P>

<a name="30708-43_para19"></a>Part 2 retains some of the protections that will now be excised from Part 1. We generally welcome what is in Part 2 and have said several times that we feel that Part 2 would do the job for extradition in total; we do not need Part 1. But that does not mean that we have no problems with Part 2; there are still matters that we need to scrutinise and probe&#151;most importantly, the provisions laid out in Clause 83. We still wonder which countries will be in category 2. When I read the record <P>


<a name="column_GC81"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC81</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of proceedings on Part 2 in another place, I noticed that my honourable friend Nick Hawkins remarked on that point:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It would be even more helpful if the Government were to produce a comprehensive list, because this afternoon the Minister was able to refer only to countries such as Canada, Switzerland and Australia".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 14/1/03; col. 141.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-43_para20"></a><P>

<a name="30708-43_para21"></a>The Minister gave an evasive response, but we have subsequently managed to discover a little more about which countries might be designated as category 2. The Home Affairs Select Committee report in another place showed that of the 139 extraditions from the UK during the three years from 1999 to 2001, 57 were to non-EU member states and 23 of those 57 were to the USA, while the others were to Australia, Canada, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Hong Kong, India, Lithuania, Norway, South Africa, Switzerland and Uganda.
<P>

<a name="30708-43_para22"></a>Furthermore, on 20th May&#151;after the Bill had left another place&#151;the then Minister, Mr Robert Ainsworth in answering a Written Question listed all the countries with which the UK has extradition agreements, falling into four categories: Commonwealth countries, British Overseas Territories, parties to the European Convention on Extradition and those with which we have bilateral extradition treaties. Countries in the fourth category include not only the USA but Iraq, Colombia and Liberia, to name a few.
<P>

<a name="30708-43_para23"></a>It is important that the Government give us some idea of which countries we are referring to when we discuss Part 2 procedures. It struck me that countries which would fall into category 2 territories range from those which could indeed guarantee a just and fair trial to those with appalling records on human rights and corruption. For that reason, it is imperative that the Order in Council for designating category 2 countries should be made by affirmative resolution. We are grateful to the Government for conceding that point early on.
<P>

<a name="30708-43_para24"></a>However, perhaps this is the appropriate time for the Government to put on record why they dropped the idea of having four tiers of designated countries, as suggested in the draft Bill. It is clear that there is a great disparity between Canada and Liberia in the quality of their justice systems. On that note, the creation of a sub-tier is what really worries us in Clause 83. In that clause, we learn that some category 2 countries&#151;we do not know which&#151;will be exempt from the requirement to provide prima facie evidence and that that will be done by Order in Council. A sub-tier seems to us a worrying thing to create, being neither one thing nor the other.
<P>

<a name="30708-43_para25"></a>In response to a previous amendment, the noble Baroness answered the remainder of the questions that I should otherwise have asked now. However, I look forward to hearing from the Minister the Government's thoughts behind the Part 2 procedure in general, and, in particular, which countries it will cover.

<A NAME="30708-44_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I answer the noble <P>


<a name="column_GC82"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC82</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Baroness. I am sure that she gave notice that she intended to speak to clause stand part, but that fact did not seem to permeate down to me. Because of our work schedule, I accept that that is probably entirely my fault.
<P>

<a name="30708-44_para0"></a>As the noble Baroness said, category 2 will break down into three broad categories: those with whom we have a bilateral treaty&#151;our bilateral treaty partners&#151;Commonwealth partners and the non-EU members of the European Convention on Extradition. ECE partners are all listed. Perhaps the Committee would find it helpful to read the Home Office publication, The Law of Extradition: a review, in the March 2001 edition. It sets out all the countries that are within the European Convention on Extradition. If it would assist the Committee, I am happy either to read them into the record now or provide the list in due course. Perhaps it is easier if I read them now.
<P>

<a name="30708-44_para1"></a>As the Committee will know, the ECE was opened for signature in 1957. It came into force in the United Kingdom in 1991 and all ECE extraditions are governed by Part 3 of the Extradition Act 1989. The following countries have been designated by Order in Council under Section 4(1) of that Act: Albania in 1999; Austria in 1991; Estonia in 1997; and Finland, France, Germany and Greece in 1991. Hungary was designated in 1993; Iceland, Israel and Italy in 1991; Latvia in 1997; Liechtenstein in 1991; Lithuania in 1995; Luxembourg in 1991; Malta in 1997; and Moldova in 1998. The Netherlands and Norway were designated in 1991; Poland in 1993; Portugal in 1991; Romania in 1998; Slovakia and Slovenia in 1995; Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey all in 1991; and the Ukraine in 1999.
<P>

<a name="30708-44_para2"></a>The Commonwealth partners with whom the United Kingdom has extradition arrangements encompass most Commonwealth countries under the Commonwealth scheme that was first adopted in 1966. The arrangement relies on parallel legislation supported by a formal undertaking on speciality&#151;or specialty; I am never quite sure which we decided on in the end&#151;perhaps I shall stick with specialty and hope that Members of the Committee will forgive me if they disagree.
<P>

<a name="30708-44_para3"></a>As the Committee will know, in the United Kingdom extraditions are governed by Part 3 of the Extradition Act 1989 and the prima facie requirement applies, although the scheme was amended in 1991 to allow for alternative arrangements to be reached on a bilateral basis. The United Kingdom still applies the prima facie requirement to all requests from Commonwealth partners on which I know that we shall touch later. The noble Baroness has tabled an amendment to which I telegraph that I shall say that she has forgotten the Commonwealth. This may be an opportune moment for us to include it.
<P>

<a name="30708-44_para4"></a>The provisions of the Extradition Act relating to requests from Commonwealth countries differ in some respects from those relating to foreign states. There is no provision for making representations prior to surrender, although the provisions are applied in practice. A person convicted in absentia must be <P>


<a name="column_GC83"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC83</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>treated as an accused person and there is no provision for special extradition arrangements with Commonwealth countries. Specialty provisions are slightly different; a certificate is issued by the Secretary of State confirming the existence of specialty arrangements.
<P>

<a name="30708-44_para5"></a>[The Sitting was suspended for a Division in the House from 5.40 to 5.53 p.m.]

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-44_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   Before the break, we were dealing with the issue of Commonwealth partners. I believe that I can short-circuit the list of Commonwealth countries by saying that all members of the Commonwealth designated by Order in Council under Section 5(1) of the Act are included, save Pakistan, Namibia, Cameroon and Mozambique, which have not been designated under Section 5(1). In September 1992 an extradition treaty was agreed between the Government of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of India. In saying that, I remind your Lordships that the Human Rights Act 1998 provision would apply in relation to all the countries about which I now speak.
<P>

<a name="30708-44_para6"></a>The bilateral treaty partners are to be found in Schedule 1. Schedule 1 to the Act applies where bilateral treaties signed before 1989 under the Extradition Act 1870 are the basis for extradition arrangements. Most bilateral treaties date from the late 19th or early 20th century and are seldom used. The United States is the only treaty partner with which the United Kingdom has regular extradition traffic.
<P>

<a name="30708-44_para7"></a>The dates when the bilateral treaties were signed are as follows: Argentina, 1894; Bolivia, 1898; Chile, 1898; Columbia, 1889; Cuba, 1905; Ecuador, 1886; El Salvador, 1882; Guatemala, 1886; Haiti, 1876; Iraq, 1933; Liberia, 1894; Mexico, 1889; Monaco, 1892; Nicaragua, 1906; Panama, 1907; Paraguay, 1911; Peru, 1907; San Merino, 1900; Thailand, 1911; Uruguay, 1885; the USA, 1876; Yugoslavia, 1901; and Brazil in 1997. In addition, extradition between the UK and its overseas territories takes place under Order in Council made under the Fugitive Offenders Act 1967. I believe that noble Lords are familiar with our overseas territories and therefore I shall not list them.
<P>

<a name="30708-44_para8"></a>The reason that we did not proceed with the four categories is that we thought there was no point in doing so. Three fell into the three categories and we had very similar conditions in relation to all the category 2 countries. I hope that that is a sufficiently comprehensive explanation to satisfy the noble Baroness as to why we have so defined this issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-44_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for her comprehensive answer. She has rectified the omissions made by her honourable friend Mr Robert Ainsworth in another place.
<P>

<a name="30708-44_para9"></a>At this stage, it may be helpful if I refer back to the clauses on which I have given notice of my intention to speak on the question of clause stand part. I believe that the confusion may have arisen in the Government's mind because, when we dealt with Part <P>


<a name="column_GC84"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC84</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>1, I had to lodge stand part objections to each and every clause because they were included in the second or third group of amendments that we discussed when I sought to delete Part 1 from the Bill.
<P>

<a name="30708-44_para10"></a>I subsequently gave notice of about only three or four clauses in Part 1 to which I wanted to see stand part objections left on the Marshalled List. I wanted to be sure that other noble Lords could participate if they so wished and I did not want to prevent them from having their rightful opportunity to speak.
<P>

<a name="30708-44_para11"></a>However, from Clause 68 onwards&#151;we now reach Part 2 of the Bill&#151;where notice of intention to oppose clause stand part is printed in the Marshalled List, as is the case for Clause 68, I shall indeed speak to those clauses. The next one will be Clause 83, which I have grouped with amendments in order to reduce the time spent on it. I notice that Clause 148 appears at the end of the groupings list, but we shall certainly not reach that today. I shall not pursue Clause 68 further.
<P>

<a name="30708-44_para12"></a>Clause 68 agreed to.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-44_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton </B>   moved Amendment No. 148A:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 37, line 6, leave out subsection (10).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-44_para14"></a><P>

<a name="30708-44_para15"></a>The noble Lord said: I hope that I can be brief in dealing with these amendments and that your Lordships will not have too much difficulty in accepting them. They all refer to the Secretary of State's role in the certification process of a Part 2 extradition request and, in particular, to the documents that will be required to be sent to the district judge.
<P>

<a name="30708-44_para16"></a>When a request from a Part 2 country is received, the Secretary of State is required to certify that it has come from a bona fide source and that it contains the requisite information&#151;the same role that NCIS and the Crown Office will perform for Part 1 requests. As the Bill is drafted, if the Secretary of State certifies a request, he is obliged to send all documents that he has received from the requesting state in connection with the request to the district judge, who will, in turn, disclose them to the fugitive. In turn, the district judge will disclose the documents to the fugitive.
<P>

<a name="30708-44_para17"></a>At first glance, all that appears to be completely harmless, but potentially it has some unsatisfactory and perhaps unintended consequences. The requesting state may, for example, provide the Secretary of State with highly sensitive intelligence information detailing how to locate the fugitive. That would then have to be shown to the fugitive after his eventual arrest.
<P>

<a name="30708-44_para18"></a>I am sure your Lordships would agree that that information could include details of informants or other intelligence material that has been obtained by means that we would certainly not want put in the public domain. That could of course have the potential, if revealed, to put individuals&#151;and, by extension, perhaps, their families&#151;at risk.
<P>

<a name="30708-44_para19"></a>The effect of the amendments that the Government are proposing would be that the Secretary of State would be required to send to the judge only the request, the certificate that he issues (certifying that the <P>


<a name="column_GC85"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC85</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>request has come from a bona fide source and contains the necessary information) and a copy of any Order in Council designating the country as an extradition partner.
<P>

<a name="30708-44_para20"></a>I should perhaps also add, for completeness, that the Secretary of State will retain discretion to send any other relevant papers. That would clearly include all those that may be of use to the fugitive.
<P>

<a name="30708-44_para21"></a>In normal practice, it is our assumption that all the papers received by the Secretary of State will be sent to the district judge. However, it is important that some discretion must be available to protect sensitive intelligence material. That is why we have removed the automatic requirement.
<P>

<a name="30708-44_para22"></a>I realise that that may offer some disquiet but, in the circumstances, noble Lords will probably find a way to agree with the amendments because they cover a very sensitive area of intelligence materials. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-45_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns </B>   moved Amendment No. 150:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 37, line 29, leave out subsection (4).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-45_para0"></a><P>

<a name="30708-45_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 167 and 197 and the Question whether Clause 83 stand part. I have already drawn attention, when speaking to the Question whether Clause 68 stand part, to the fact that, whereas we welcome most of Part 2, there are some issues about which we need to raise questions and probe.
<P>

<a name="30708-45_para2"></a>I shall begin with Amendments Nos. 150 and 167. Amendment No. 150 would remove subsection (4) from Clause 70, and Amendment No. 167 would remove subsection (5) from Clause 72. Those subsections allow for an Order in Council to designate specific category 2 territories so that when they issue an arrest warrant or provisional warrant they need supply only information, not evidence. Our problem with that is that it effectively involves the removal of the prima facie case requirement on the face of the arrest warrant for certain unspecified category 2 territories. Clause 83(6) goes further. Clause 83(1) requires the judge to decide whether there is sufficient evidence for a case to be answered by the defendant on trial. Subsection (6) provides for the judge to pass over that consideration in the case of specified category 2 territories and to move on to the next stage of the proceedings.
<P>


<a name="column_GC86"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC86</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30708-45_para3"></a>We have some concerns with that. We asked the Government to set out their justification for the exemption from prima facie evidence both for the warrant and for the judge's consideration at the hearing by an Order in Council which will not be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. I welcome the guarantee given by the Minister with regard to a designation of a country as a Part 2 extradition partner. He said that any orders designating a country as a Part 2 extradition partner will also, if appropriate, contain provisions removing the prima facie requirement.
<P>

<a name="30708-45_para4"></a>Yet there still seems to us to be a potential for a new sub-tier of category 2 territories to be created, which essentially have one more safeguard for the British citizen removed. We are concerned about that. We have had plenty of debates in relation to Part 1 about the protection which the prima facie requirement provides. The country must provide information and we feel that it is important that there should be as much evidence as possible before someone is extradited. I believe that I can ignore some of my notes, given the Minister's response to the previous clause stand part debate.
<P>

<a name="30708-45_para5"></a>Our concern with category 2 countries that have no guarantee of the European Convention on Human Rights is that if we relax the safeguard with regard to prima facie rules, we have no assurance that, when extradition takes place, it will happen only when there is enough evidence for the prosecution to go ahead safely.
<P>

<a name="30708-45_para6"></a>Amendment No. 197 picks up on a point made by the Home Affairs Select Committee of another place. It stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We consider that the power delegated by Clause 83(6) is too broadly defined. As currently drafted, Clause 83(6) would allow any territory whatsoever to be designated as exempt from the prima facie case requirement.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-45_para7"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We recommend that the power delegated by Clause 83(6) should be specifically limited to a power to make Orders in Council to exempt from the prima facie case requirement only: . . . those European states that are signatories to the European Convention on Extradition but that are not EU members . . . [and] any other state with which the UK has a bilateral agreement which requires that state, in making an extradition request, to meet evidential requirements equivalent to those set out in the Convention".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-45_para8"></a>
We tabled Amendment No. 197 on the basis of that recommendation. I hope that the Minister will consider the amendment to be a viable alternative to the current unspecified exemption in the Bill as drafted. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-45_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I am grateful for the opportunity to respond to these amendments but on this occasion I cannot support them because they would put the United Kingdom in breach of its international obligations and be a great step backwards.
<P>

<a name="30708-45_para9"></a>Clauses 70 and 72 deal with, among other matters, requirements of prima facie evidence to be produced in category 2 cases. Clause 70(4) and Clause 72(5) provide that a request from a country specified by Order in Council need be accompanied only by information rather than evidence.
<P>


<a name="column_GC87"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC87</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30708-45_para10"></a>Amendments Nos. 150 and 167 would remove those provisions with the effect that all Part 2 requests would have to be accompanied by prima facie evidence. I know that that is what the noble Baroness seeks to achieve. However, I am somewhat perplexed that she should do so on behalf of Her Majesty's Opposition, for reasons that I shall explore.
<P>

<a name="30708-45_para11"></a>The provisions in question hardly represent a new or startling development. If noble Lords look at Section 8(3) of the Extradition Act 1989, they will see that very similar wording can be found; in particular, the substitution of evidence by the word "information". We are not doing anything new by preserving the status quo. Those subsections are designed to meet our existing obligations under the European Convention on Extradition, the ECE, which we have now been operating for about 12 years.
<P>

<a name="30708-45_para12"></a>The UK ratified the ECE in 1991. It is hardly for me to make this point, but I am sure that the noble Baroness well remembers the complexion of the government who were then in being. Perhaps I need not remind noble Lords of the identity of the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, whose company we have had on a number of occasions, or of the venerable and much loved then Attorney-General, whose company we may have this afternoon. Under the terms of the ECE, we cannot demand prima facie evidence and if we were to seek to refuse a request from an ECE partner on the grounds that it lacked prima facie evidence, we would be in breach of our international obligations. That change was one with which the Government were content and, sparing the blushes of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, I am in total agreement with the stance he took on that change. As on so many occasions, he and I seem to be at one.
<P>

<a name="30708-45_para13"></a>Were the amendments to be made, we would require prima facie evidence to accompany every single Part 2 request. The UK would have to withdraw from the European Convention on Extradition and seek to negotiate a new bilateral treaty with every single non-EU Council of Europe country, which I had the pleasure of listing earlier. At best, there would be a gap while those treaties were renegotiated; at worst, other ECE countries might not take it entirely kindly that we had withdrawn from the ECE and refuse to negotiate, leaving us with no extradition relations with the countries in question. Removal of the prima facie requirement has caused us no difficulties with ECE countries during the past 12 years. To go back on that now would be a retrograde step.
<P>

<a name="30708-45_para14"></a>Perhaps I may say something about the wider world outside the ECE. The Bill, like the Extradition Act 1989, allows for the removal of the prima facie requirement for any country in the world. However, there is one important difference. Following the recommendation of the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform, we have agreed that orders removing the prima facie requirement all be subject to the affirmative resolution <P>


<a name="column_GC88"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC88</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>procedure, giving Parliament increased scrutiny opportunities. I know that the noble Baroness acknowledges that.
<P>

<a name="30708-45_para15"></a>Until now, no non-ECE country has had the prima facie requirement removed. We do not intend to change that generally; we intend to go slightly further, but only in a limited way. As the Committee will be aware, the new bilateral extradition treaty that we have negotiated with the United States will remove the prima facie requirement in respect of requests made by that country. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, is especially exercised and spoke strongly of his opposition to that withdrawal. I am sure that we shall read of that issue in due course.
<P>

<a name="30708-45_para16"></a>However, we feel strongly that because of the history and nature of our long and well-established partnership with the United States, that will not cause us difficulty because it has faithfully honoured each and every agreement that we have ever had and given us no cause to believe that it will renege on the conditions that we have jointly set and agreed. I reiterate that we do not currently require prima facie evidence for a whole host of European countries, including places such as Latvia, Turkey and Albania. We can see no case for imposing a more stringent requirement on an established, mature democracy, such as the USA.
<P>

<a name="30708-45_para17"></a>I know that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, is also concerned about the question of reciprocity. I must confess that I am a little puzzled about that concern. It is of course the job of this Parliament to decide what barriers and hurdles to extradition there should be. That includes setting the evidential test. If we take the view that for a country such as the USA, with a proper judicial system and where the rule of law is respected, the ECE standard is the appropriate one, that is an objective decision. So we must ask: why is that decision affected by what the other country decides to do? I cannot see how a decision to remove the prima facie evidential requirement from incoming USA requests becomes any more or less correct simply because, for constitutional reasons, the US cannot do the same.
<P>

<a name="30708-45_para18"></a>Beyond that, I assure the Committee that we have no current plans to remove the prima facie evidential requirement for any other of our bilateral treaty partners. There is a case for removing the prima facie evidential requirement for a small number of Commonwealth partners whose criminal justice systems can be trusted and with whom we have a significant volume of business. No final judgments have been made, but we have in mind, as I mentioned the last time that we discussed the issue in Committee, countries such as Australia, Canada and New Zealand.
<P>

<a name="30708-45_para19"></a>I am sure that noble Lords would not object to any of those three countries being exempted from the burden of having to supply prima facie evidence. Our relations with those countries are based on the Commonwealth extradition scheme&#151;the London Scheme for Extradition Within the Commonwealth, to give it its full name. The Commonwealth scheme does not take the form of a binding agreement. Rather, it is <P>


<a name="column_GC89"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC89</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a set of model principles around which all Commonwealth countries are expected to base their legislation. They can then designate all other Commonwealth countries that operate extradition on a similar basis as extradition partners. That is precisely what the United Kingdom has done, with the result that we have extradition relations with almost every other Commonwealth country.
<P>

<a name="30708-45_para20"></a>If the amendment were made, that would become impossible, which would be a very unfortunate step. Knowing the warmth of feeling that exists within Her Majesty's Opposition for the Commonwealth, I should be surprised if they sought that. I also know of the long tradition of communication with and support for the Commonwealth among Liberal Democrats.
<P>

<a name="30708-45_para21"></a>I hope that I have clearly stated the Government's intentions and that that has been useful. I remind the Committee that all Orders in Council designating countries as exempt from the prima facie requirement will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, so Parliament will have the fullest involvement.
<P>

<a name="30708-45_para22"></a>The amendments are not desirable. The first two would result in the UK being forced to withdraw from the ECE, while the last would deny us the opportunity to treat trusted Commonwealth partners on a par with our Council of Europe partners. Having heard what I have said, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment and that the Committee will recognise that Clause 83 effectively preserves the status quo. It is an important clause and I hope that the Committee will recognise that it should stand part of the Bill.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-45_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   The noble Baroness raised the question of reciprocity and spoke to it at some length, so I hope that the Committee will not object if I deal with my argument on that now. I intended to raise it by my next amendment, Amendment No. 151A, but if I speak to that now it will save us having the same debate again then.
<P>

<a name="30708-45_para23"></a>I should say that Amendment No. 151A is probably in the wrong place; it should have been tabled as an amendment to Clause 83 rather than Clause 70. As I understand it, Clause 70 deals with the information that must be provided to obtain an arrest warrant, but the actual hearing is dealt with under Clause 83. It is at that point that the question of the need to produce evidence arises.
<P>

<a name="30708-45_para24"></a>Having said that, it seems to me that it is inappropriate for the Government to have agreed to dispense with reciprocity in the new treaty with the USA. The United States gets from the agreement the benefit of the easier extradition of people it wants to have back in order to try them, but what does the United Kingdom get from it? I appreciate that other aspects of the treaty will simplify the extradition process on both sides and are unobjectionable, but I am concentrating on reciprocity. As far as that is concerned, the United Kingdom gets more or less nothing.
<P>


<a name="column_GC90"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC90</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30708-45_para25"></a>In some limited sense it is an advantage to the United Kingdom that we can now extradite alleged criminals to the USA more easily and therefore do not have to keep them in prison here, but that is a fairly minimal advantage. We lose something of considerably more advantage&#151;namely, the bargaining power to get the Americans to change their laws to enable us to get defendants back here more easily.
<P>

<a name="30708-45_para26"></a>There are other reasons for objecting to making extradition to the USA easier&#151;for instance, the low standards of criminal justice in some states. While the noble Baroness refers to the observance in the United States of the rule of law&#151;which is in general true&#151;I am deeply concerned about agreeing a treaty of this kind at a time when the present Administration are showing their contempt for due process and the right to fair trial in relation to the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay.
<P>

<a name="30708-45_para27"></a>It is correct as a general principle that rights under extradition agreements should be reciprocal. As I understand it, the Minister said that there is no other agreement to which the United Kingdom is a party in which we have dispensed with the need for evidence except where there is equal and reciprocal dispensation the other way. In that respect the American treaty is unique. If that is so, it creates a bad precedent.

<A NAME="30708-46_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   I support the arguments of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. I am very concerned about the present situation, particularly in regard to reciprocity. Like the noble Lord, I believe that we obtain very little advantage in the present arrangements. As he rightly said, at the moment there is a variety of standards of justice and in some states it is very minimal indeed.
<P>

<a name="30708-46_para0"></a>There is very little we can do about it. My noble friend should take into account what the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, has said because he is not without support on this side of the Committee. I want him to know that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-46_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I say straightaway that I understand the concerns that the Committee has raised in relation to the issues now pertaining at Guantanamo Bay. Members of the Committee will remember the recent good and thorough debate on that issue which was answered by my noble friend Lady Symons of Vernham Dean. It is right that those strongly held views should be expressed and noble Lords will have heard the Government's robust response in relation to them.
<P>

<a name="30708-46_para1"></a>I can assure the Committee that there is no question of the Government agreeing to extradite individuals to Guantanamo Bay. Any extradition to the mainland would be subject to the agreement that we have already in relation to capital and other punishments, and the human rights provisions contained in Clause 86 would prevail.
<P>

<a name="30708-46_para2"></a>Noble Lords will remember that we have discussed issues such as the right to trial, the right to representation, the right to interpretation and so on. I know and hear what the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, <P>


<a name="column_GC91"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC91</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>says in relation to the standards that may pertain in some states in the United States of America, particularly in the deep south&#151;Texas featured very clearly in that discussion&#151;where all is not as it should be.
<P>

<a name="30708-46_para3"></a>All I would say in response is that no country, including the United Kingdom, has a perfect criminal justice system. We still believe that the quality of justice in each of the states is on par with those to be found in the Council of Europe countries. As a result of our agreement there are some who would say that we are able to secure for those persons who are extradited from this country to the United States a better system of provision and protection than is available to United States citizens, particularly in relation to the application of the death sentence: capital punishment. To date, that part of the agreement with our US partners has, without exception, been honoured. If we compare what would happen to a person extradited from here with what would happen to an individual American facing the same charges and found guilty, in some states that person could not avoid capital punishment in the way that we have been able to secure avoidance for persons extradited from here.
<P>

<a name="30708-46_para4"></a>We are not looking at the individual concerns that we have about several countries, but at whether it is right and just for the United States to be treated in a way similar to that in which we treat other countries, with all the caveats and hedges we have put around it. We say that it is because we are able to ensure that our concerns are expressed and dealt with in a way that bites upon the operation. Clause 86 is a powerful instrument in helping us to do so.
<P>

<a name="30708-46_para5"></a>With the Committee's tacit consent, I hope that I have merged these answers with those I had intended to give to the next amendment. It will not help if I repeat much of the ground. I simply say that the prima facie requirement is not necessary in relation to this issue.
<P>

<a name="30708-46_para6"></a>I said earlier that, for constitutional reasons, the United States of America was in difficulty in providing reciprocity. I need to explain that further. For constitutional reasons the Americans are unable to remove the prima facie evidential requirement from a request made to them. If noble Lords look with care at the relevant provision enshrined in Article 4 of the Bill of Rights, they will see why that is so. It is not that they do not wish to; constitutionally they are not able to do so.
<P>

<a name="30708-46_para7"></a>Changes to the US Constitution are made very rarely and only with the greatest difficulty, so there was never any question that the US would be able to lift the prima facie burden from the United Kingdom. We are not in the same position. The Extradition Act 1989 enables us to remove the prima facie evidential requirement&#151;as will the Bill if enacted&#151;and the question for the United Kingdom was whether we should let the constitutional inability of the United States to remove the prima facie requirement influence <P>


<a name="column_GC92"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>the evidential standard that we set for requests made to the United Kingdom by the United States. We do not believe that it should.
<P>

<a name="30708-46_para8"></a>It is up to Parliament to determine the appropriate level of protection for people in this country whose extradition has been sought. We need to consider what evidence and safeguards there should be. If we conclude that in respect of a particular country there need be no requirement for prima facie evidence, we fail to see how that position suddenly becomes inappropriate if that country, for wholly understandable reasons, is unable to reciprocate.
<P>

<a name="30708-46_para9"></a>I hope that with that further and fuller explanation noble Lords will feel more content than they have been hitherto.

<a name="30708-46_para10"></a>The reason for this series of amendments is linked to our whole concern about the removal of prima facie evidence from Part 1 and our worry that in Part 2 we might end up with a system whereby the prima facie evidence requirement is also gradually whittled away. The amendments were tabled with that in mind. They were also intended to be a warm-up act for Amendment No. 151A, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, which we knew would be winging its way onto the Marshalled List.
<P>

<a name="30708-46_para11"></a>I am grateful for the Minister's indication that there are no plans to remove prima facie evidence from our bilateral partners except in the case of the United States. Our concern is that we might go further in future because the number of exceptions could increase.
<P>

<a name="30708-46_para12"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for setting out the Government's position on this matter. I have no doubt that we will need to look at the issue again, although in a more refined form, when we get to the Report stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="30708-46_para16"></a>The noble Lord said: I again hope to be brief in dealing with the amendments. I am confident that the Committee will have no difficulty in accepting them as they were trailed at an earlier stage and welcomed by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts.
<P>

<a name="30708-46_para17"></a>The amendments are concerned with the power of customs officers to carry out arrests in Part 2 cases. As the Committee will be aware, the Bill was amended on Report in another place to make it absolutely clear who had the power of arrest in Part 1 extradition cases. <P>


<a name="column_GC93"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC93</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>This put it beyond doubt that foreign police officers will have no power of arrest in this country in those matters.
<P>

<a name="30708-46_para18"></a>Among those given powers of arrest in Part 1 cases, as well as constables and service police forces, are officers of Her Majesty's Customs and Excise. These amendments to Clauses 70 and 72 make corresponding changes to Part 2 of the Bill and give Customs officers powers of arrest in those cases. I should remind noble Lords that the definition of a "Customs officer" can be found in Clause 203(6).
<P>

<a name="30708-46_para19"></a>The Committee touched briefly on this subject on day three&#151;it seems a long time ago&#151;during our debate on the definition of a constable. I gave notice at that stage that these amendments had been tabled, as reported in Hansard at col. 304. Let me say a little more about how we envisage things operating in practice.
<P>

<a name="30708-46_para20"></a>We intend that when we receive a request from a Part 2 country the police will carry out the arrest in the United Kingdom even if the person is wanted for a Customs offence. However, there may be instances where, in pursuit of his or her normal duties, a Customs officer comes across someone who is wanted for an extradition offence. This is a perfectly plausible scenario because Part 2 arrest warrants will be entered on the police national computer, to which Customs officers have access.
<P>

<a name="30708-46_para21"></a>So Customs officers may raid premises looking for a Mr Jones, who is wanted for alleged VAT fraud, and encounter a different person, Mr Smith, who, when checked out through PNC, is found to be wanted for an extraditable offence. If the Bill were to remain unamended, customs officers in such a circumstance would be unable to hold or detain Mr Smith unless they had a Customs reason to do so. Thus Mr Smith, having committed an alleged indictable offence, could simply walk away. I am sure the Committee would agree that that would be most unsatisfactory. The amendments have been tabled to remedy the situation and to give Customs officers powers of arrest in Part 2 cases.
<P>

<a name="30708-46_para22"></a>Perhaps for the sake of completeness I should answer a question that may be asked. As I have indicated, in Part 1 of the Bill a European arrest warrant can be executed by a police officer, Customs officer and service policeman. Part 2 the Bill provides that any police officer will be able to execute an arrest warrant and, if these amendments are made, any Customs officer. The Committee may ask why there is no reference to the service police forces. The answer is quite simple. Clauses 75 and 72(6) allow the warrant to be directed to a specific person, which would enable them to deal with a situation where the person was known to be on a military base. However, service police officers will not, unlike Customs officers, come across those who are wanted for extradition by random chance, so there is no need to make explicit provision for them in this way. I hope that with that explanation the Committee will agree to the amendments.
<P>

<a name="30708-46_para23"></a>On Question, amendment agreed to.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="30708-47_para7"></a><P>

<a name="30708-47_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving the amendment, I also want to speak to the two amendments on the same topic tabled in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay. The area is complex and it would be appropriate if I set out the background and what happens at present. I apologise in advance if I have to speak at some length. I hope that I shall be able to present the framework so that Members of the Committee can understand how everything fits in. It is a difficult little journey on which we have to go.
<P>

<a name="30708-47_para9"></a>What we are concerned with here is provisional arrest in Part 2 cases and what happens immediately following it. In cases where the person has been provisionally arrested, he must be brought before a district judge for an initial hearing as soon as practicable. At the initial hearing, the judge must decide whether to grant bail or remand the fugitive in custody and give the fugitive information about consenting to extradition. He must also set the date by which the requesting state has to produce the full papers, and that is what the amendments are concerned with. Failure to meet the deadline leads to the fugitive's discharge.
<P>

<a name="30708-47_para10"></a>That is all fairly familiar as it is similar to what happens under the present system, but there is one important distinction. The Extradition Act 1989 is essentially silent on how long the period should be. By seeking, as we do in Clause 73, to set a firm time limit, we are providing a degree of clarity and certainty that has always been lacking. I trust that Members of the Committee will welcome that.
<P>


<a name="column_GC95"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC95</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30708-47_para11"></a>Given that the Extradition Act 1989 contains no defined periods, it is worth looking at what the established practice is, not least because it determined how we went about framing Clause 73(10). In deciding how long to give the requesting state to produce the full papers, the district judge will look at which requesting state it is.
<P>

<a name="30708-47_para12"></a>Requesting states fall into three broad categories. The first is those countries which are parties to the European Convention on Extradition&#151;the ECE&#151;about which we have already spoken. In the case of a provisional request involving an ECE country, the district judge will apply the ECE procedures. Article 16(4) of the ECE states that following provisional arrest the requesting state has 40 days in which to produce full papers, and that, therefore, is the figure which our district judges will apply.
<P>

<a name="30708-47_para13"></a>The second group of countries is our bilateral extradition partners, and here the picture is much more mixed. Quite simply, our bilateral extradition treaties contain a wide variety of figures and the district judge will use whatever figure is in the relevant treaty.
<P>

<a name="30708-47_para14"></a>I shall give a few examples. Our treaties with Argentina and Ecuador put the figure at 30 days. Our treaties with the USA and Brazil put the figure at 60 days. Our treaties with Monaco and Iraq refer to two calendar months, while our treaties with Peru and Chile set the time limit at 90 days. I should make clear that, in relation to Monaco and Iraq, the two calendar months are not chosen. Therefore, we do not know whether those months will be February and December or whether some other arrangement will apply.
<P>

<a name="30708-47_para15"></a>Incidentally, it gives me great pleasure to refer to our extradition treaty with Brazil. Thanks to the escapades of a certain Mr Biggs, the myth that the United Kingdom has no extradition relations with Brazil appears to be a very persuasive one, which I am happy to knock down. That is a digression.
<P>

<a name="30708-47_para16"></a>The third group of countries which may be involved in provisional arrest cases is our Commonwealth partners. Here, the situation is even messier as our extradition relations with those countries are based on the Commonwealth extradition scheme, which does not contain any figure at all. The normal practice of our judges, when faced with a Commonwealth provisional arrest case, has been to set a 60-day deadline for the production of the papers, although it is fair to say that that has not been so in absolutely every case. Therefore, I hope that the Committee will see that at present we have a rather complex situation of which we must try to make some sense.
<P>

<a name="30708-47_para17"></a>However, there is one further, but very important, factor which I need to throw into this delightful mix. When the judge sets the deadline, he sets the time by which the papers must be received by the Secretary of State. He is not setting the deadline by which he, the judge, must have them before his court. So long as the Secretary of State receives the full papers at the end of the period which the judge has set, the judge can then set a further deadline for the papers, accompanied by <P>


<a name="column_GC96"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC96</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Secretary of State's authority to proceed, to come before him. Again, rather unhelpfully, the Extradition Act 1989 is silent on how long that second period should be. The normal practice is for it to be seven days, but there have been plenty of cases where longer periods&#151;of 14 days or more&#151;have also been set.
<P>

<a name="30708-47_para18"></a>Therefore, having looked at what we have now, perhaps I may set out the approach that we have sought to adopt and say why we now believe that an amendment to the Bill is required. As I have already indicated, we took the view that it would be beneficial to spell out, so far as possible, on the face of the Bill the time allowed for the production of full papers following provisional arrest.
<P>

<a name="30708-47_para19"></a>Accordingly, Clause 73(10) sets the limit at 40 days. Perhaps I may explain why we have gone for that figure. As I indicated, that is the figure in the ECE and we anticipate that a significant volume of Part 2 requests will come from ECE countries. For those countries, stating the 40-day limit in the Bill will make no difference in practice.
<P>

<a name="30708-47_para20"></a>By contrast, for Commonwealth countries, which are used to having 60 days in which to produce papers, this represents a very real change. They may find it an unwelcome change. But I am sure that Members of the Committee agree that, in the interests of the fugitive, we should try to reduce the period so far as we can. A period of 40 days is all well and good but, as will be appreciated, for some of our bilateral treaty partners it is longer than the treaty allows. However, for the great majority of them, it is shorter than the treaty permits. That is why we included Clause 73(10)(b). It allows us to vary the period to reflect the terms of the particular bilateral treaty so that when we come to designate, for example, Brazil as an extradition partner, the order will provide that Brazil will have 60 days rather than 40 days to provide full papers, to conform with our treaty with Brazil. I remind Members of the Committee that, following an earlier government concession, all the orders will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.
<P>

<a name="30708-47_para21"></a>If we did not have Clause 73(10)(b)&#151;I am aware that one of the opposition amendments seeks to remove it&#151;we could be faced with the situation where Brazil supplies full papers on the 55th day, fully in accordance with its international treaty obligations, only to find that the UK, contrary to its treaty obligations, has already discharged the person. I am sure that Members of the Committee would agree that that would be unsatisfactory. Equally, I am sure that they will recognise that seeking to renegotiate all our bilateral extradition treaties simply to deal with the issue would not be a sensible or practical approach. I hope that the Committee recognises that we need the flexibility provided by Clause 73(10)(b), and that the noble Baroness will not seek to press her amendment which removes it.
<P>

<a name="30708-47_para22"></a>Having set out the case for 40 days&#151;one rather feels that that is appropriate for being in the desert&#151;let me explain why we seek to amend it and substitute 45 days. The key point is that the Bill specifies that at the end of the period the papers must be with the district <P>


<a name="column_GC97"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC97</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>judge, having first been certified by the Secretary of State. We have deliberately sought to avoid the situation of the 1989 Act, where there is first a deadline for papers to get to the Secretary of State, and then a further deadline for him to get the papers to the district judge. Instead, there is a single deadline by which all the necessary documentation has to get to the district judge.
<P>

<a name="30708-47_para23"></a>The problem arises if, say, an ECE country provided the full papers on the 40th day&#151;as it would be fully entitled to do under the terms of the ECE&#151;it is most unlikely that we could get the papers certified by the Secretary of State and to the court before the fugitive had to be discharged. Accordingly, the Government seek to build in an extra five days to allow for the Secretary of State's certification function. That is similar to the second period allowed for in current legislation. The Committee will recall that I said a few minutes ago that the practice is for that period to be set at seven days or longer, so again we are shortening the process to the benefit of the fugitive.
<P>

<a name="30708-47_para24"></a>That is the case for the Bill and the amendment to it which we are proposing. I have already dealt with Amendment No. 181 from the noble Baroness, and explained why it would not be desirable in the circumstances. Let me turn to Amendment No. 180, which would remove the figure of 40 days and put in its place 28 days. It will not surprise Members of the Committee to know that I am not in favour of it. I have explained that we are bound by a number of international obligations. The shortest of those give our international partners 30 days to produce full papers, while most set a significantly longer period than that. Specifying 28 days in the Bill would lead to a large number of fugitives being released and the UK regularly breaching its treaty obligations. Neither of those would be desirable.
<P>

<a name="30708-47_para25"></a>I apologise for having spoken at such length, but the issues are important. I hope that the Committee will feel that I could not have explained the complexities without going through the issues step by step. The Government's approach brings a measure of certainty to what I hope all Members of the Committee will accept has been a somewhat confused area. It allows the United Kingdom to comply fully with its international obligations, while, at the same time, in a number of cases significantly reducing the time that countries will have to produce full papers. For the reasons that I have given, we do not believe that we need to extend the period in the Bill further than 40 days, but extending the period to 45 days simply copies the seven or more days that exist in current legislation. If noble Lords are not totally exhausted by that explanation, I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="30708-48_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   As the Minister said, I have tabled amendments in this group. I put them forward in order to probe the Government's intent in fixing the 40-day period. The noble Baroness has no reason to apologise for the length of her answer today because she has been able to give an explanation that was missing in the debates in another place. I appreciate the Government's concern to try to provide <P>


<a name="column_GC98"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC98</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>just one time limit within which all papers should reach the district judge in one fell swoop while reflecting the difficulties that may arise in different countries in so doing.
<P>

<a name="30708-48_para0"></a>When we looked at the Bill and saw the 40-day time limit, the first matter that came to mind was that there were no comparable limits within the 1989 Act. We then considered the matter further and thought that surely, in those 10 years, things must have improved with technology so that tighter time limits could be considered. Therefore, we chose our limit simply as a tool to open up the debate.
<P>

<a name="30708-48_para1"></a>I accept entirely the explanation given by the Minister. Therefore, she will be pleased to know that, because of her lengthy explanation, I do not intend to return to this matter on Report. However, I believe that it was important for her explanation to be placed on the record.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-48_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I concur entirely with the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay. I quite understand what she said but I want to make one or two comments. Given the age of some of the treaties and the length of time provided, it sounds as though they go back to the days when documents were transmitted by steamer, if not by sail&#151;long before the days of air mail, let alone fax or e-mail. While I entirely understand why the Government chose that time limit, I want to express the hope that, when they negotiate new treaties, they will go for a somewhat shorter period.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-48_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   I congratulate my noble friend Lady Anelay on these probing amendments. Seldom can a probe have disclosed so much. The only question that I want to ask, arising out of what I found a fascinating expose by the Minister, concerns the extradition treaty with Brazil. If it could not get Biggs back for us, what went wrong?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-48_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   The noble and learned Lord may remember that when I read out the list, I said that the Biggs extradition treaty was signed in 1997. Therefore, fruit came from the trouble that I know the noble and learned Lord may have had in relation to this issue when he was Attorney-General. We did get Brazil to agree. Those who sit beside me&#151;indeed, I would include myself if the Government were so minded&#151;would be quite happy to travel the world renegotiating these treaties.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30708-48_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 185, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 211. These are probing amendments and, again, concern the subject of time limits, although the argument is slightly different. I shall be brief.
<P>

<a name="30708-48_para9"></a>Amendment No. 185 concerns the time limit within which an extradition hearing on a Part 2 warrant must commence. Clause 76, which we are about to come to, states that in the case of such a hearing in Scotland, the judge's powers will be substantially the same as if the proceedings were summary proceedings. In such proceedings, according to the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, a person awaiting trial must not be detained for more than 40 days after the complaint has come to court.
<P>

<a name="30708-48_para10"></a>If summary powers are being exercised, the Law Society of Scotland sees no reason to depart from the time limit set in Scotland. Indeed, the society suggests that, for the rest of the United Kingdom, a period of 40 days might be better than the two months proposed in the Bill. The society has asked how many days would constitute a period of two months. Would that be two calendar months? The amendment therefore proposes a limit of 40 days for the whole of the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="30708-48_para11"></a>Amendment No. 211 makes the same suggestion for the same reasons in relation to Clause 98. It would reduce the period during which the Secretary of State must respond with his decision on a person's extradition from two months to 40 days. After discussion with the Law Society of Scotland, I beg to move Amendment No. 185.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-48_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   I rise to endorse what has just been said by my noble friend Lady Carnegy. I recall that, in her response to an earlier group of amendments, the noble Baroness highlighted the difficulties of making arrangements when other countries specified periods comprising months but did not state which months. Here is set a limit of two months, but it is the case that different months contain different numbers of days. I shall be interested in an explanation of why the Government have alighted on such a period.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708-48_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, for tabling these amendments. They are concerned with the time limits set out in Part 2. Perhaps I may say straightaway that we are very willing to listen to arguments about the limits we have set and to questions as to whether they are right. We certainly do not claim to have a monopoly of wisdom in this area. There is an interesting debate to be had and I shall come to that in <P>


<a name="column_GC100"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC100</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a moment. I was also very interested to hear what the noble Baroness had to say about the practice in Scotland.
<P>

<a name="30708-48_para12"></a>However, since one of the issues at stake is the time in which the Home Secretary has to make his decision in particular cases, this seems a good moment to try to respond to some of the issues that were raised earlier by, I think, the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson. I believe that the matter was discussed during the first day or two of these Committee proceedings. Unfortunately I was not present and I do not know whether those days are now so thoroughly passed by that I do not need to address these issues: such peace has broken out in the Committee since those early heady days.
<P>

<a name="30708-48_para13"></a>At that point the noble Lord suggested that in certain particular cases my right honourable friend the Home Secretary had been dilatory, which led to delays. Noble Lords will appreciate why I cannot comment on individual cases, but I can answer the point in general terms. First, however, I can assure your Lordships that the Secretary of State takes his responsibilities in extradition cases very seriously and acts with all due expedition on every occasion. He certainly does not sit on cases unnecessarily&#151;if, for no other reason than that no Home Secretary would want to see a valuable prison place taken up if he could possibly avoid it.
<P>

<a name="30708-48_para14"></a>As noble Lords would expect, the Home Secretary considers all representations very carefully. Therein lies one of the problems and one of the reasons why cases can appear to sit for a long time on the Secretary of State's desk. There is no limit to the number of representations that can be made or, more important, when. So the Secretary of State can have considered all the representations very carefully and be about to reach his decision when fresh representations are made. Those can and do amount to 10, 20 or even 30 full box files, all of which have to be studied in detail. Moreover, of course, the other side may need to be given the opportunity to respond to the arguments in the new representations.
<P>

<a name="30708-48_para15"></a>All of this takes time. I am sure that noble Lords would want all representations to be considered with the greatest care. I hope therefore that noble Lords will accept that perhaps it is not right to criticise my right honourable friend when he does exactly that and gives proper consideration to each and every one of those recommendations. Perhaps I may gently suggest that it is particularly unfair to chastise him by reference to individual cases knowing that in this House he is not in a position to answer directly, even though he would have a very good story to tell.
<P>

<a name="30708-48_para16"></a>I turn now to the specific amendments before the Committee. I am sympathetic to their motivation and I can reassure noble Lords that the Government are as keen as the Committee to ensure that no fugitive is held in custody for longer than is absolutely necessary. The Government would not want to create a system which contains avoidable inefficiencies.
<P>

<a name="30708-48_para17"></a>As currently drafted, Clause 74 requires that the main extradition hearing in a Part 2 case should begin within two months of the fugitive's first appearance <P>


<a name="column_GC101"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC101</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>before the judge. This is in cases where the person has been arrested under a full order request made under Part 2. Similarly, under Clause 98, if the judge has sent the person's case to the Secretary of State for consideration, the Secretary of State must decide whether the person is to be extradited or discharged within two months. In each case these amendments would reduce the period from two months to 40 days.
<P>

<a name="30708-48_para18"></a>The first point I should make is that our current legislation, the Extradition Act 1989, contains no time limits. Clearly there is no right answer to the question. As I have said, I am perfectly willing to listen to the arguments put for different limits. It might be helpful if I explain in detail why we settled on the period of two months.
<P>

<a name="30708-48_para19"></a>I shall deal first with the time limit for the hearing to start. The two-month time limit has been given careful consideration. It aims to provide a balance between ensuring that the fugitive's case is heard as quickly as possible&#151;we certainly do not want anyone languishing in gaol at the taxpayer's expense for longer than is absolutely necessary&#151;while ensuring that the fugitive's solicitor has sufficient time in which to prepare his case.
<P>

<a name="30708-48_para20"></a>This may sound like an obvious point, but we must remember that in some Part 2 hearings the fugitive's brief may have to make a defence against a prima facie case. This could require obtaining witness statements and other material from the requesting state, which&#151;let us be frank&#151;may not have the communication facilities that we have come to expect in the developed world. I recognise that this also allows the requesting state the time to put together its own case and, in the interests of a comprehensive and just judicial process, I am sure that noble Lords would agree that that is right.
<P>

<a name="30708-48_para21"></a>If the 40-day limit were to be imposed, as the amendment moved by the noble Baroness suggests, I fear that the number of applications for a later date to be fixed would rise, particularly in light of the discussions in Committee on 19th June when it was noted that lawyers are a very thorough breed&#151;this was a point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay&#151;and need a lot of time, and more if possible. One can anticipate that this would be an issue.
<P>

<a name="30708-48_para22"></a>I turn now to Amendment No. 211, which would reduce the amount of time the Secretary of State has to make his decision on a Part 2 case. Again I understand the desire of noble Lords to streamline the process as much as possible. As I have already outlined, the Secretary of State will have to consider various representations. Those representations will come primarily from the fugitive's legal representatives, although it is possible that the requesting state, other organisations such as Amnesty International, as well as members of the public, may also make representations about the individual's case.
<P>

<a name="30708-48_para23"></a>In order to allow sufficient time for these representations to be put together and submitted, we felt that a time limit of two months would be appropriate. Indeed, reducing the time-scale in Clause 98 might actually have the effect of putting the fugitive <P>


<a name="column_GC102"></a>

<B>8 Jul 2003 : Column GC102</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>at a greater disadvantage if, for example, he was seeking to obtain material to counter assertions made by the requesting state.
<P>

<a name="30708-48_para24"></a>One matter that we shall certainly want to consider is whether we should seek to impose a deadline within the time limit by which all representations have to be submitted. This would ensure that the Secretary of State has proper time to consider them and avoid the problems of the late and multiple representations which bedevil the current system.
<P>

<a name="30708-48_para25"></a>If there is one recurring feature of the Bill, it is that extradition is a balancing act between the interests of justice and the need to safeguard those who are subject to the extradition process. These amendments raise such issues in a nutshell. We all want to speed up the process and, in particular, to ensure that those who are the subject of extradition are not held in custody for unnecessarily long periods. However, we need to ensure that both sides have adequate time in which to prepare their cases and to submit whatever representations they consider necessary.
<P>

<a name="30708-48_para26"></a>I hope that by now Members of the Committee will have detected that the Government are uncertain about the best approach to take. We will study the remarks made by the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, with the greatest of care. It may be that the course hinted at by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, of picking two months and putting a figure to it might be better&#151;we are really not sure. So we are open to further argument as to how to draw it. We want certainty; if certainty is better met by providing for 60 days or whatever, we can see that. We see the force of providing 40 days&#151;I have explained at great length why we chose that time limit for other provisions. But we know there are difficulties in terms of what is happening on the ground.
<P>

<a name="30708-48_para27"></a>We have listened to what the district judges who have been dealing with these applications have indicated to us so that we could fashion something which will be practical and will work, but we are not tied to this figure. So if any Members of the Committee would like to make representations before we think again about this, I would be most grateful to receive them.

<A NAME="30708-49_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I thank the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, and my noble friend Lady Anelay for their support. In particular, I thank the Minister for a very interesting and full reply&#151;fuller than I expected. She said she would study what I had said. She will not find very much there because the argument for the precise need for 40 days was not given in my short speech. The Law Society of Scotland said that the summary proceeding in Scotland would normally allow 40 days, and it could not see why it should be longer. Its members will doubtless read with great interest what the Minister has said; I shall talk to them and see what they have to say.
<P>

<a name="30708-49_para0"></a>I was interested to hear that the Government were wondering whether to impose a deadline. I am sure my noble friend will want to consider that carefully, because it is an interesting idea.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30708-49_para1"></a>I have one question for the Minister about the discussions with Scottish Ministers when the Bill was being drafted. To what extent has there been a discussion between officials of the Scots Parliament about the desirability of trying to match, where possible, time limits in various parts of the Bill with Scottish practice? It is obviously desirable; the sheriff of Lothian and Borders will be familiar with that procedure, as are all those concerned. I expect that there have been discussions, but it would be interesting to know. If not, perhaps there should be before these proceedings are finished because new time limits are being set.
<P>

<a name="30708-49_para2"></a>I do not think Scottish Ministers are particularly worried about diverging, but it would be nice to know whether that has been properly discussed. Would the Minister like to reply before I withdraw the amendment?

<P>
<A NAME="30708-49_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   Although this issue is retained in terms of jurisdiction, on a case-to-case basis, those persons who are discovered to be in Scotland are dealt with as a matter of custom and practice by the Scots jurisdiction&#151;by the Scots courts in accordance with their laws.
<P>

<a name="30708-49_para3"></a>We have kept in close contact with our Scottish counterparts on all aspects of the Bill. But extradition is a reserved matter, so ultimately it is for the United Kingdom Parliament to set the rules for the whole of the United Kingdom. The experience of our Scots colleagues is obviously very important. As the noble Baroness is aware, our Scottish colleagues have fewer cases with which to deal than those colleagues who deal with these matters in London. The nature and breadth of the countries from which and to which individuals are extradited are therefore very broad in the London jurisdiction.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="30708-49_para4"></a>The noble Baroness is absolutely right: we shall continue to talk to our Scottish colleagues. But I say very gently that because of the difference in the volume and scope of the applications dealt with in London, the time frame within which individual matters must be dealt with may appear slightly different because of the number and nature of the countries to which and from which our Scottish colleagues will have dealt on extradition issues. We will certainly continue to look at this very closely.

<A NAME="30708-49_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I thank the Minister very much for that explanation. It is probably not a major problem but the Law Society has raised an interesting point, and I shall talk to them. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708w01_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor   (Lord Falconer of Thoroton): </B>  The office of Lord Chancellor is an ancient one under the Crown. In latter days the Lord Chancellor has been a Minister of the Crown and head of the judiciary as well as Speaker of your Lordships' House. The office has a wide range of powers, duties and privileges which have been conferred over time by the sovereign, by law, by custom and usage, by charters and other instruments, and by your Lordships' House. They can be alienated by primary or secondary legislation, by agreement with the conferring authority and others, or by amendment of the relevant legal instruments. The Government will be publishing a consultation document in September setting out the issues to be addressed in relation to the Lord Chancellor's roles that do not relate to the Speakership, his functions as departmental Minister or his judicial capacity.
<P>

<a name="30708w01_para0"></a>None of the important powers, duties or privileges of the Lord Chancellor has been alienated since 30 January. Although it was announced on 12 June that the Office of Lord Chancellor is to be abolished in its present form, I have been appointed as Lord Chancellor in order that I may continue to exercise the powers of that office for the transitional period. Certain responsibilities in relation to children and families including responsibility for the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS) are to be transferred to the Secretary of State for Education and Skills. These changes have not yet been given formal legal effect. An initial transfer of functions order under the Ministers of the Crown Act 1975 is expected to be made at the Privy Council meeting on 17 July and will be laid before Parliament in the usual way. This order is intended to transfer <P>

<P>
<UL>What is the rate of unemployment in Strabane District Council area; and what steps they are taking to reduce that figure.[HL3611]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708w01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn:  </B>  Unemployment statistics at district council level are only available from the claimant count. At May 2003 the number of claimants in the Strabane District Council area stood at 1,147, which represents 5.0 per cent of the resident working age population. This compares with a rate of 3.3 per cent for Northern Ireland as a whole. Over the past 12 months the number of claimants in the Strabane District Council area has decreased by 7.9 per cent compared with a 5.4 per cent decrease for Northern Ireland as a whole.
<P>

<a name="30708w01_para1"></a>Government is using a variety of methods to help reduce the level of unemployment in the Strabane area. It is one of the areas for targeted initiatives drawing together the relevant statutory, voluntary and community organisations and employers in a new level of partnership aimed at helping individuals who are jobless, particularly the long-term unemployed, to identify and address their particular barriers to employment and thereby making them more ready to take up available job opportunities. Staff from Strabane Social Security Office actively work with unemployed people and numerous groups in the Strabane area to encourage and support the movement from benefits to work.

<a name="30708w01_para2"></a>Invest NI is also working with Strabane District Council to deliver a Business Start programme specific to the area.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708w02_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   The Government received 630 responses to their consultation on draft regulations to implement the EC Article 13 Race Directive and elements of the EC Article 13 Employment Directive. Although not all of these responses raised issues in respect of the draft race regulations, a significant number did. The issues raised covered the full range of amendments to the Race Relations Act 1976 encompassed by the regulations, as well as questions about the Government's implementation policy generally.
<P>

<a name="30708w02_para1"></a>The aim of the consultation exercise was to elicit constructive views on the draft regulations in order to help to ensure that they properly implement the directives. Changes were made to three specific race issues&#151;seamen recruited abroad, charities and small dwellings&#151;as a result of suggestions made during the consultation process. These changes were reflected in the draft regulations. Where suggestions were rejected, they were rejected on the basis that they were inappropriate, that they did not add to the existing implementation strategy, or that they went back over issues where the Government had reached a decision.

<P>
<A NAME="30708w03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal:  </B>  This statement is to confirm advice to businesses and inform the House of our view on the question of whether organisations should acquire their own equipment to detect chemical, biological or radiological materials as part of their contingency plans.
<P>

<a name="30708w03_para1"></a>The Government take contingency planning for potential terrorist attack very seriously, and are working with emergency services to ensure that they have the equipment they need to protect the public from the use of chemical, biological or radiological (CBR) materials. Government are also ensuring that effective measures are in place to detect such substances on a routine basis, where required. Such equipment is regularly tested by independent scientists and by users in the relevant agencies, including the emergency services, to ensure that it is of the standard required. Staff are also well trained in its use.
<P>

<a name="30708w03_para2"></a>The Government's advice is, therefore, that other organisations, including businesses, leave the demanding and potentially dangerous job of detecting CBR materials to personnel in the emergency services and responsible agencies which are professionally trained in the necessary equipment. Any business considering measures to prevent or reduce the impact of terrorism should contact the counter-terrorist security adviser in their local police force who will be able to give further advice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708w04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   In 1998 we instituted a series of recruitment goals to ensure that appropriate levels of recruitment from Britain's ethnic minority communities took place. Running for four years, the goals aimed at increasing the recruitment of ethnic minority young people incrementally by 1 per cent each year until the forces reached 5 per cent. In the event the outcome for 2001&#150;02 was a very creditable 4.4 per cent, although this figure contains a large number of Commonwealth nationals recruited in this country. Given the nearness to publication of the national census, and therefore access to new and up-to-date research data, an interim goal of a further 1 per cent from the previous year's outcome was agreed.
<P>

<a name="30708w04_para0"></a>We have found that quite significant numbers of young people travel to the United Kingdom and join the Armed Forces, particularly the Army, which has the greatest number of trades open requiring relatively low security clearances.

<P>

<a name="30708w04_para5"></a>The numbers of Commonwealth nationals of all ethnic backgrounds seeking to join the Armed Forces is a clear indication of the success of our race equality policies in recent years. Although we welcome the resulting increase in the diversity of the forces, we should not forget that the original intention of the recruitment goals was to increase the proportion of UK ethnic minority recruits; this remains the objective today. Accordingly, the aim for the next three years is for each service to increase incrementally each year the proportion of UK ethnic minority recruits by at least 0.5 per cent with the tri-service aim of reaching 5 per cent as soon as possible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708w04_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Warner): </B>  The United Kingdom is obliged to implement the provisions of Directive 2002/46/EC into national legislation. The conclusions of the regulatory impact assessment undertaken in relation to the Food Supplements (England) Regulations 2003 were that making the regulations was the best option available. Doing so allowed the UK to fulfil its Community obligation to implement the provisions of the directive, maintain the widest possible consumer choice of safe and properly labelled food supplements consistent with the directive, and impose the minimum burden on industry.
<P>

<a name="30708w04_para8"></a>The lists of permitted vitamins/minerals and vitamin/mineral sources in the Food Supplements (England) Regulations 2003 can be extended if additions are made to the permitted lists in the annexes to the Food Supplements Directive 2002/46/EC on which the regulations are based. These annexes remain open pending safety assessment of additional vitamins and minerals and their sources. Industry is currently working to compile safety dossiers for some of the vitamins and minerals and vitamin/mineral sources currently omitted from the annexes.
<P>

<a name="30708w04_para9"></a>The Food Standards Agency, in recognition of the difficulties associated with dossier production and the timescale for dossier submission, is pressing the European Food Safety Authority for an urgent, substantive meeting with relevant parties to discuss dossier requirements.

<A NAME="30708w04_wqn7"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Why previously untransfused males are perceived as the safest possible blood donors with respect to transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) when a product, widely used in other countries, which can eliminate the risk of TRALI is commercially available.[HL3489]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30708w04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Warner:  </B>  The Government's Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Blood and Tissue for Transplantation have considered the relative efficacy and risks of the different types of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) available.
<P>

<a name="30708w04_para12"></a>Occasionally, FFP causes a rare condition called transfusion-related lung injury. This can happen if the donor plasma contains antibodies that can react with the patient's white blood cell. Donors generally produce these antibodies after pregnancy or transfusion. The National Blood Service (NBS) is considering plans to produce FFP from male donors.
<P>

<a name="30708w04_para13"></a>There are two types of FFP available to the National Health Service. Clinicians have a choice of which products to use. United Kingdom sourced single unit FFP available from the NBS is more commonly used by the NHS. Each unit of FFP available from the NBS is made from plasma from single donations from donors who have been previously tested for viruses to minimise the risk of infection.
