<H4><center>Tuesday, 9th June 1998.</center></H4>
<H4><center>The House met at half-past two of the clock: The LORD CHANCELLOR on the Woolsack.</center></H4>

<H4><center>Prayers--Read by the Lord Bishop of Ripon.</center></H4>



<A NAME = "80609-01_head0"></A><H3><center>House of Lords Reform: Pay Implications</center></H3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Renfrew of Kaimsthorn </B>   asked the Leader of the House:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "80609-01_para0"></a>Whether he considers it equitable that, over the last financial year, the aggregate of parliamentary salaries (exclusive of ministerial salaries) for Members of the House of Lords was about &#163;156,000 compared with &#163;42 million for Members of the House of Commons; and what commitments of time the Government will expect of unpaid working Peers in a reconstituted House of Lords.
<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="80609-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Privy Seal   (Lord Richard): </B>  My Lords, the noble Lord asks an interesting Question, or rather he asks two interesting questions. I am sure that the whole House will be aware that your Lordships are not paid a salary for all your hard work. Members of the other place are paid a salary for the job they do, which includes representing their constituents. The noble Lord thus draws a false comparison. Direct questions of equity between the two Houses do not arise.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-01_para1"></a>As regards the noble Lord's second question, the Government continue to expect from all Peers the commitment of time necessary to ensure that the House as whole fulfils its functions. If only all noble Lords would take their duties as seriously and work as hard as the noble Lord, Lord Renfrew.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Renfrew of Kaimsthorn: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord the Leader of the House for that exceptionally courteous reply. I assure him that it is extremely welcome at last to hear some thinking on this subject from the Government in this House on this occasion. Is there perhaps some new Labour principle of noblesse oblige that working Peers should work without pay? Have the Government given thought to the composition of the House? Will its members not have to be either very old, with Peers in receipt of retirement pensions from other employment, or in receipt of private means, like not a few of the recent appointments to your Lordships' House?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, I think of little else other than the composition of your Lordships' House. It is with me daily. The noble Lord asks a very interesting question. We must wait to see what the House looks like when the interim House has arrived.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Dean of Beswick: </B>   My Lords, although a certain lightheartedness has crept into the questions <P>


<a name="column_868"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 868</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and answers, is the noble Lord the Leader of the House not aware that this is a serious matter? Is he not aware also that at this point in time Ministers and Members in your Lordships' House are perhaps the most poorly paid members of any major legislative body, certainly in Europe? If my noble friend wishes to defend the situation, can he tell us of any major legislative chamber in Europe which treats its members worse than Members of your Lordships' House are treated at present?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, I am indeed well aware that Ministers of your Lordships' House are underpaid and overworked. I am aware also that the allowances and expenses paid to your Lordships for the work that your Lordships do occasions a great deal of unrest. Being aware of those two facts, it is incumbent upon me, as Leader of the House, to make sure that my ministerial colleagues are also aware of them.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Waddington: </B>   My Lords, in what respects will the Bill which the Government now propose to introduce differ from the Parliament (No. 2) Bill of the 1968-69 Session? Were Michael Foot, Robert Sheldon and other Labour MPs right to destroy that Bill on the basis that it would create a quango based on party political patronage or were they guilty of constitutional outrage in allowing themselves, with Enoch Powell and many hereditary Peers, to destroy the Bill?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord must wait for the terms of the Bill which will be published in due course at a time when the Government believe it proper to do so. He can then no doubt make a proper comparison.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that the great problem with Peers' expenses is that they are updated with reference to the RPI? Therefore, in real terms, they can never improve. However, the expenses in the other place are updated in all kinds of strange and wonderful ways which mean that they improve all the time.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, I am well aware that that is my noble friend's view because he has expressed it to me on a number of occasions.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   My Lords, has my noble friend read the Fabian pamphlet published by my noble friend Lord Desai and the noble Lord, Lord Kilmarnock, on the future composition of your Lordships' House? It suggests a Wednesday night lottery draw with a seat in your Lordships' House instead of money for the winners.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, I have read the pamphlet. I did not realise that it was quite as colourful as my noble friend now reminds me.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Lord the Lord Privy Seal accept that <P>


<a name="column_869"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 869</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Ministers in this House are certainly not well paid compared with their colleagues in the House of Commons? This is totally altruistic from my point of view, obviously. However, will the noble Lord assure me that he is doing his best for his colleagues just as my noble friend Lord Cranborne did for his? Secondly, in any reform which the Government propose, will they cost the proposals? Does he believe that a reformed House of Lords will be nearer the cost of &#163;311,000 per Member of the other place or nearer to the &#163;918,000 per Member of the European Parliament?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, the answer to the noble Lord's first two questions is yes as, indeed, is the answer to his final question.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, as Members of your Lordships' House can claim just over &#163;30 per day in out-of-pocket expenses and bearing in mind the fact that the House sits on average for just under seven hours a day, that equates to an hourly rate of about &#163;4.50 or &#163;4.60. Does my noble friend the Leader of the House think that that is a reasonable recompense for the efforts of noble Lords?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, I am aware of how long the House sits, and I am also aware of the expenses that noble Lords are entitled to draw. Further than that, my noble friend must not tempt me.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   My Lords, can the noble Lord the Leader of the House say whether there is any truth in rumours which are circulating to the effect that quite a few of the new Peers on the opposite Benches are finding their duties rather more onerous than they expected? If that is so, can the noble Lord tell the House with what confidence he approaches the appointment of so many more Peers on the Benches opposite?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, I approach the possibility of the creation of sufficient Labour life Peers to give us broad parity with the number of Conservative life Peers with a great deal of equanimity.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-01_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Glenamara: </B>   My Lords, is it not a bit much that we have to subsidise the House in the matter of our travel refunds, sometimes for a period of six weeks? Cannot a system of vouchers be introduced as is the case in the other place? After all, the number of times that noble Lords are travelling is known and, therefore, such a system could not be abused. I believe that that would be very much better.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-01_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, that is an interesting possibility. With the permission of my noble friend and of the House, I should like to look into the matter.

<A NAME="80609-01_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Dormand of Easington </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "80609-01_para2"></a>What action they are taking following the recent representations made by American power companies about coal-powered generating stations in the United Kingdom.
<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="80609-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry   (Lord Clinton-Davis): </B>  My Lords, the Government have noted carefully all the representations which have been made during the review of energy sources for power generation. The review is still under way. The Government will make an announcement when a conclusion is reached: we hope that this will be soon.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-01_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Dormand of Easington: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend the Minister for that Answer. Can my noble friend confirm reports that the Government intend to arrange for the generators to take 26 million tonnes of coal a year for the next five years? Further, in view of what he said, can my noble friend say whether the Government believe that electricity from gas-fired power stations really is cheaper than that from coal-fired stations, especially when one has to take into consideration the huge cost involved in building new gas-fired stations? Finally, how much importance do the Government place on security of supply, bearing in mind that the generally accepted reserves in this country would last about 100 years?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-01_spnew21"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend is tempting me to anticipate the conclusion of the review which, as I indicated, will shortly be forthcoming. However, I fear that I must disappoint him in that regard. The point about security of supply to which my noble friend alluded is something which falls to be dealt with in the review.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister indicate what the position is with regard to the coal-fired power stations at present? Are they all in operation or have some been mothballed? Further, if they are in operation, where do they stand in the merit order bearing in mind that they must all be written down virtually to nil?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, I cannot answer the noble Lord's detailed question, especially as he asked me about all coal-fired stations. I shall be happy to write to the noble Lord on the subject, or he may prefer to table a specific Question for oral answer.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Marsh: </B>   My Lords, I have a purely factual question for the Minister. Does the noble Lord have any estimate of how many billions of pounds have <P>


<a name="column_871"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 871</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>been spent over the past 40 years in trying to prevent the decline in the coal industry at no benefit to coal miners and with a great deal of distress to taxpayers?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, I should like to have those facts at my fingertips; but, unfortunately, I have not.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mason of Barnsley: </B>   My Lords, can my noble friend the Minister confirm that the Government's policy is to have a moratorium on the building of gas-fired stations with a view to helping the coal mining industry? If so, and if that remains so, what can these American power companies do to affect us? What is the real threat?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, the term "moratorium" is incorrect because it implies that no consents would in fact be given. There are exceptions based on reasoned requests which are being considered, especially with regard to CHP projects. Again, I cannot go into any further detail because I would be anticipating the outcome of the review.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-02_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Attlee: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister assure the House that any arrangements made to solve the problem will be transparent with all costs being identified?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, this Government are significantly more transparent in their operations than their predecessor.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-02_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, in view of the statement made by the noble Lord, Lord Dormand, in which I believe he said that 100 years of supply was assured in coal, can the Minister tell the House what is considered to be the assured lifetime of supply of our natural gas?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   No, my Lords; I cannot give any assurance in that respect. Such factors will be set out in the review. I do not have that information with me at present. However, I urge the noble Baroness to be a little patient. It will not be long before the review is published.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Dormand of Easington: </B>   My Lords, in view of the threats which are now being received from American companies, can my noble friend the Minister comment on another important matter which will be discussed in the consideration of the report which is soon to be issued: namely, whether the Section 36 consents are legally binding?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, as far as I know, they are.

<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "80609-02_para0"></a>Whether they are satisfied with the Forestry Authority's performance in monitoring privately owned British forestry, particularly in relation to planting, harvesting and policy on sustainability.

<P>
</UL><A NAME="80609-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Scottish Office   (Lord Sewel): </B>  My Lords, we are satisfied with the Forestry Commission's performance in monitoring privately owned forests in Britain. The commission inspects forests to ensure that they meet a wide range of silvicultural and environmental standards and comply with our commitments on sustainability. The UK forestry standard explains how further monitoring will be carried out through a combination of scientific study and national surveys.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-02_spnew13"></A><B> The Earl of Bradford: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for that extremely reassuring reply. However, is he aware of the aims of the Forestry Stewardship Council--an unaccountable foundation based in Mexico--which seeks to impose a new regulatory scheme on British forestry which is going through an extremely difficult time at the moment? Does he not think it right that the Government should try to persuade the Forestry Stewardship Council to accept the Forestry Authority as the necessary regulatory body in this country?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, I am indeed aware of the activities of the Forestry Stewardship Council. We are, of course, committed to the idea of sustainable forestry. I believe that the UK forestry standard is the appropriate test. We must recognise that some large retailers--commonly known as the 95 Plus Group--are concerned to establish independent certification. I believe that could best be done by all parties agreeing to use the UK forestry standard as a base with independent audit and thus obtaining certification in that way. I believe that is the appropriate way forward. I hope that the Forestry Stewardship Council will be able to accept that.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Taylor of Gryfe: </B>   My Lords, I express an interest as the chairman of the all-party forestry group in both Houses. Is the Minister aware that we are all concerned about the destruction of tropical forests but have serious doubts about the ability of some campaigners to monitor that process? As regards the United Kingdom, does the Minister really believe that it is necessary to impose on the industry a new body, the Forestry Stewardship Council, when the Forestry Commission has an international reputation for good research and management in forestry and has grant giving powers to the private sector? Has it not sufficient expertise and sufficient power without imposing a new organisation on the industry?
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, I have no intention of imposing the Forestry Stewardship Council on the industry but, as I have said, I recognise that some major retailers and purchasers of timber at this moment look to the Forestry Stewardship Council as a certifying body. I believe that the way forward is not down that route but through the UK forestry standard.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, at the risk of Question Time becoming a little wooden, does the Minister realise that I agree with him absolutely? Can the noble Lord use his influence to persuade some of these companies of the reality of the situation? While standing in a Sitka spruce forest in Argyll, one sometimes feels that one is in a rainforest, but that is not the case. It is a perfectly sustainable form of forestry and has certainly been planted and felled during the lifetime of the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Gryfe, and perhaps during my lifetime, I regret to say. Our forestry is sustainable. The Forestry Authority's standards are excellent. It supervises planting, thinning and felling. There is no need for an extraterritorial body to monitor what we already do well in this country.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, I am happy to accept everything that the noble Lord has said. The noble Lord and I are in agreement today and I am sure that will be the case in the weeks that lie ahead.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-02_spnew19"></A><B> Baroness Nicol: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that the World Wildlife Fund International has placed British forestry 12th out of 15 countries as regards quality of forestry? Does he agree that that is unfair? Is the Minister's department doing anything to try to cancel that stigma which has been placed on British forestry? Is he satisfied with the general advice which is given to those concerned with forestry in this country on sustainability and biodiversity? My understanding is that at the moment it is site specific and there is a need for more general advice on this issue. Is that available?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-02_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, a considerable amount of general and specific advice is available on sustainability and biodiversity. As regards the so-called European "score-card" published by WWF, that is a total and complete nonsense. The main criterion it uses is the extent to which a nation has been able to retain its ancient forests. Britain experienced the industrial revolution and the agricultural revolution some time ago which inevitably destroyed a large proportion of our ancient forests. However, WWF's "score-card" makes it impossible to improve one's score as once an ancient forest is lost, by definition it cannot be recovered.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-02_spnew21"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister admit that in the Government's promotion of their excellent native pinewood schemes in Scotland, the Forestry Authority can occasionally be a little bureaucratic in insisting on natural vegetation censuses when there is really no point in them? Will the Minister look into the problem and remove this unnecessary and <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-02_spnew22"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, I am well aware of the noble Lord's interest in this area. He has made a major contribution to land use in Scotland, in particular as regards natural forests. I shall look into the specific point he makes, but I am sure he realises that one needs regulatory schemes when one is distributing public funds.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "80609-03_para0"></a>When the Green Paper on pensions policy, promised for June this year, will be published.
<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="80609-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Social Security   (Baroness Hollis of Heigham): </B>  My Lords, the Green Paper will be published later this year and it will be followed by a period for consultation.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Castle of Blackburn: </B>   Do not these repeated postponements mean that we shall reach no firm decisions on pensions policy in time for next year's uprating of the basic pension due to be announced in November? Is the Minister aware that Mr. Tom Ross, who has chaired a committee set up by the Prime Minister to inquire into the position of pensioners, has found that they are not sharing in economic growth? Will the Government therefore please at least take one decision immediately, and that is to restore the earnings link in time for the next uprating?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-03_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, as I think my noble friend will know, the Ross Report shows that on average pensioners' incomes overall are predicted to rise over the next 20 years in line with earnings, not prices. But clearly those pensioners who are dependent on state, let alone means-tested benefits, will not share in the same growing prosperity as those who have occupational pensions. That is why as part of our consultation we have been working on proposals for a stakeholder pension because the state pension alone will not, and cannot, guarantee people comfort in old age. We need to have proper, second-tier provision. The stakeholder pension, together with the citizenship pension for the future, and our concern to ensure take-up of income support for pensioners now, will address the real problems that my noble friend has identified.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, as the deadline for publication of this important document has been postponed from the first half of this year to 30th June and now, apparently, until later in the year, I support what the noble Baroness, Lady Castle, has said. Can the <P>


<a name="column_875"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 875</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Minister give us a more precise date? Can she also give us an assurance that the Government have no intention of publishing this document during the summer Recess?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-03_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I wish I could give the noble Lord the information that he requests. I do not know when the report is expected to be published. It will be later this year, but I cannot give the timetable. I take the noble Lord's point; however, there is certainly no intention that I am aware of to bring a document out during the Summer Recess, but again that timetable is not in my hands.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para1"></a>Over the past year since coming to power the Government have had in place from July onwards a pensions review consultative exercise, which has given rise to 2,000 replies. We followed that with a stakeholder consultation paper, which gave rise to 200 replies. That was followed by the Ross report group. Its report has just been published. A pensions education group is about to publish a report. I am sure that the noble Lord will accept that this Government are seeking the widest possible consent and consultation, so that any proposals we bring before the public will be robust and have all-party agreement.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, why, if this Question has been on the Order Paper for some time, is the noble Baroness quite unable to give a more satisfactory and intelligible, quick, accurate answer?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-03_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I can give an intelligible, accurate answer. I cannot, however, give the answer that the noble Lord wishes me to give regarding the timetable.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-03_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Castle of Blackburn: </B>   Is it not the truth that the Government and the Cabinet are deeply split on this matter, and that Mr. Frank Field's wilder ideas have proved financially impossible? Is it not a fact that, for nearly two years, some of us have been supplying the material for which the Government say they are now waiting and that they have set up more pilot schemes to inquire into what everybody knows is the position--that pensioners cannot wait any longer?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-03_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend will not need me to remind her that there are two problems. There is the problem of the poorest pensioners now. They are mainly single women over 75 who have not built up a pension in the past and are not claiming the income support to which they are entitled. Many are losing &#163;17 a week. That means that they are not heating their homes and not eating the food that they would choose to eat. We have proposals in place for pilot schemes which we hope to roll-out nationwide so that pensioners claim the benefits to which they are entitled. That is the short-term problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para2"></a>There is a longer term problem. Given our changing labour market, more self-employment--which has doubled since 1979--more part-time jobs, more women entering the labour market with intermittent earnings, and pensioners living longer, we need to ensure that decent second-tier pensions are in place for all people. <P>


<a name="column_876"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 876</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>We believe that that requires a stakeholder pension. The consultation exercise has been held, and we are working on proposals. As soon as those proposals are ready, we shall come before the House with a Green Paper.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Davies of Coity: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that we are continually bombarded with evidence that we are sitting on a pensions time bomb? Is it perhaps time to consider returning to our former position; namely, that membership of occupational pensions is a condition of employment? Where that does not exist in employment, should there be some compulsion for every worker to take out a pension scheme?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-03_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, there is already a considerable amount of compulsion in the pension scheme, as my noble friend will appreciate. Anybody presently earning above the lower earnings limit, some &#163;64 a week, who is not in an occupational pension scheme and is an employee will currently pay into SERPS. But of course SERPS does not cover the self-employed, or part-time and low-paid workers. People cannot pay into SERPS when they are not in work, and many women have broken patterns of employment. So although my noble friend's suggestion will not be unfamiliar to my colleagues in other departments, it still does not address the problem. Many people need a decent second-tier pension in old age, and there is no product in the market-place which offers them that.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-03_spnew11"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that this subject is made up of many complicated interlocking parts, of which yesterday's welcome publication on pension splitting in divorce is one? Does she further agree that it matters desperately to get it right as well as to get it done quickly?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-03_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Earl for that contribution. I am sure that the House, like me, will be delighted that, yesterday, we were able to publish the draft Bill on pension-splitting, which was an all-party move by this House. I am delighted that the noble Earl was generous enough to draw that to the attention of the House today.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para3"></a>The noble Earl is right. Since 1988, in the reforms to SERPS, we have put forward various proposals for changes in second-tier pensions over and beyond those in the Pensions Act 1995. The Opposition, when in government, produced Basic Pension Plus, a scheme that has now been dropped. That scheme found no broad consent. If we are to produce a framework for pension provision that offers security as well as comfort in old age, it is clear that it must have staying power. That can happen only if it is based on widespread consultation, not only with the industry and the pensioners' movements, of which my noble friend is such an important advocate, but in all sections of this House. That is why we have now held four consultation exercises and may still need to consider consultation.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-03_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, I agree that my noble friend is entirely right to take a long view and get this matter <P>


<a name="column_877"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 877</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sorted out correctly, but does she accept that it is impossible for those pensioners who are alive now, and whose primary source of income is a pension geared only to the RPI, to participate in this country's prosperity unless we move away from indexation by the RPI and back to the policy that we used to advocate of indexing according to the average wage? In other words, there is no conflict as I see it between the position of my noble friend the Minister and that of the noble Baroness, Lady Castle. Surely the two are compatible. What puzzles some of us is why, in relation to my noble friend's request, there is no action in the short term. Some pensioners alive now are rather poor.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-03_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, the short-term action proposed by my noble friend of linking the state pension to earnings rather than prices would raise pensioner incomes this year by 40p. Yet something like 1 million pensioners are going without &#163;17 a week in income support. Comparing 40p with &#163;17 a week, I know what I think is the best way of helping the poorest pensioners.

<A NAME="80609-03_spmin1"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees   (Lord Boston of Faversham): </B>  My Lords, I beg to move the Motion standing in my name on the Order Paper.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para4"></a>The Procedure Committee's Third Report deals with a number of important questions. Although, strictly, we should deal with the two amendments in turn first, I hope that noble Lords will not feel constrained by their presence and will feel free to range over the report as a whole so that we can have just one debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para5"></a>On the matter of using the Queen's name to influence debate, the Procedure Committee considered a lengthy and learned memorandum by the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, another by the noble Earl, Lord Russell, and a letter from the noble Lord, Lord Blake. The committee decided that the doctrine as stated in Erskine May is correct and should normally apply, but that it was undesirable to impose any absolute rule because circumstances had to be taken into account.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para6"></a>It has to be acknowledged that exceptional circumstances may arise in future. It is not inevitable; indeed it may well be unlikely; but they may do so. In the event of a situation recurring such as the Succession to the Crown Bill, the Procedure Committee thought that it would be desirable if discussions could be held through the usual channels to resolve the extent to which the doctrine in Erskine May should apply in those particular circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para7"></a>The committee believes that our procedure must retain some measure of flexibility to take account of exceptional circumstances, and for that reason did not recommend that the rule in Erskine May should be regarded as absolute. The noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, <P>


<a name="column_878"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 878</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>has, however, indicated on the Order Paper that he wishes to debate the matter further, and your Lordships and I will be able to hear what he has to say.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para8"></a>The Procedure Committee was particularly concerned about the conduct of Starred Questions. I was asked to draw to your Lordships' attention the rules which should govern this procedure. Supplementary questions should ask for information, and not take the form of statements. They should be short. They should not be read. Noble Lords are also reminded that time is often wasted by two or more Peers refusing to give way to another Peer. If questions are short, and Peers give way more quickly, more opportunities will be available to put questions to Ministers, who are in turn invited by the noble Lord the Leader of the House to give shorter, sharper replies.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para9"></a>On carry-over of Bills, the significance of paragraph 2(f) in the report is that the new procedure which is recommended for the carry-over of Bills has no immediate practical consequences for your Lordships' House. Initially the only Bills which will be candidates for the new procedure will be Bills introduced into another place. At this stage in the development of the procedure for carry-over, no Bill which starts off in your Lordships' House and which is still here at the end of a Session will be carried over. It is clear from paragraph (e) that any Commons Bill which is carried over in that House will, when it reaches your Lordships' House, be treated in exactly the same way as any other Bill introduced into another place and brought to this House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para10"></a>On the matter of hands in pockets and the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Henderson of Brompton, I would only say that the committee has been concerned that the traditional way in which the House behaves has in recent times been somewhat eroded. One reason may be that some noble Lords simply do not know, or have perhaps forgotten, some of the little courtesies which characterise the way in which we conduct our business and our debates.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>1. USE OF QUEEN'S NAME TO INFLUENCE DEBATE
<P>
<BR>
On 27th February, during the second reading debate on the Succession to the Crown Bill, Lord Williams of Mostyn, the Home Office Minister, informed the House that The Queen had no objections to the bill. Several Lords argued that this disclosure was contrary to the rule in Erskine May that the irregular use of The Queen's name to influence a decision of the House was unconstitutional and inconsistent with the independence of Parliament (p 382). On 2nd March the Leader of the House, after having consulted the clerks, advised the House that on a bill which was so fundamentally personal to The Queen it was only sensible for Her Majesty's views to be made known to the House. He also said that procedural rules should always be applied with commonsense and with due regard to all circumstances. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>The Committee has considered the exchanges of 27th February and the Leader of the House's statement of 2nd March. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>The Committee believes that Erskine May correctly states the rule, which should continue to be observed by the House. However, the Committee recognises that exceptional circumstances may arise, such as the Succession to the Crown Bill, which make it desirable to depart from the strict application of the rule. The Committee does not recommend that the rule should be regarded as absolute. <P>

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>2. CARRY-OVER OF BILLS </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>On 19th November 1997 the Committee considered a proposal made by the Commons Modernisation Committee <sup>1</sup> , and endorsed by the House of Commons <sup>2</sup> , that it should be possible for Government bills to be "carried over" from one parliamentary session to the next in the same way as hybrid and private bills. The Committee accepted that there was a case for the carry-over of some Government bills in certain circumstances; and asked the Clerk of the Parliaments to prepare, with the Clerk of the House of Commons, a memorandum in which the practical details and any necessary safeguards would be examined. The Committee has now considered this memorandum. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>The Committee recommends that the principle of carry-over should be endorsed by the House and that--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(a) only Government bills should be eligible for carry-over; </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(b) carry-over should be restricted to bills which have not yet left the House in which they originated; </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(c) the eligibility of bills for carry-over should be settled by informal discussion through the usual channels; </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(d) bills should be carried over by ad hoc motions, at least initially; </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(e) a Commons bill carried over before it reaches the Lords should not be treated differently from other bills when it reaches the Lords; </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(f) no procedure should be agreed at this stage to carry over Lords bills still in the Lords when the session ends. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>3. QUOTATION FROM COMMONS SPEECHES IN THE CURRENT SESSION </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>The present rule is that it is undesirable (i.e. out of order) in the House of Lords to quote from a speech made in the House of Commons in the current session, unless it is the speech of a Minister in relation to Government policy. A similar rule applies in the House of Commons. The Commons Modernisation Committee has reported (Fourth Report, 1997-98, HC 600) that the rule seems to them to be neither logical nor necessary, and that it is difficult to enforce since by the time the facts have been established it is generally too late to prevent a breach of the rule. The Committee agrees with the analysis of the Modernisation Committee and recommends that the rule relating to Commons' speeches should be abolished in the House of Lords.</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>4. STARRED QUESTIONS </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>The Committee is concerned about the conduct of Starred Questions and the number of occasions recently when the Leader of the House has had to intervene. The Committee reminds the House of the guidance in the Companion: </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> "Starred Questions ... are asked for information only, and not with a view to stating an opinion, making a speech or raising a debate." (p 84) </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>The Committee also wishes to stress the following points: </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>--supplementary questions should not be read, and should be short; and ministerial replies as short as possible, consistent with answering the question; </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>--Lords should give way to each other promptly; </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>--shorter, sharper questions and answers will allow more Lords a chance to take part. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>5. CONDUCT IN THE CHAMBER </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>The Committee reminds the House that--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(a) it is undesirable to use first names in the Chamber; </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(b) Lords should not pass between the Woolsack (or the Chair) and any Lord who is speaking, but if they have to do so, they should bend down as they pass: </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(c) Lords should not speak with their hands in their pockets; </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(d) The correct way to refer to a Minister is "The noble Lord, the Minister"; it is not correct to refer to "The noble Minister";</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(e) the correct way to address the House is "My Lords", or, where appropriate, to use the expressions "Your Lordships" or "Your Lordships' House". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-03_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Marlesford </B>   moved, as an amendment to the Chairman of Committees' Motion, at end insert ("save for the words "such as the Succession to the Crown Bill" in paragraph 1").
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para13"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving my amendment to the report, I seek to give the House the opportunity to maintain fully an important constitutional convention which protects the independence of parliamentary proceedings from interference or undue influence from the Crown; and, no less important, protects the Queen from party politics. It was, I had thought, a convention well known to Members of both Houses. It has been enshrined in successive editions of Erskine May, our parliamentary bible, ever since the publication first appeared in 1844. Previously all governments have felt tightly bound by it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para14"></a>Your Lordships can therefore imagine my astonishment when, on 27th February, during the Second Reading debate on the Succession to the Crown Bill, introduced by my noble friend Lord Archer, I heard the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, on behalf of the Government, say:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Her Majesty had no objection to the Government's view that in determining the line of succession to the throne daughters and sons should be treated in the same way".--[Official Report, 27/2/98; col. 916.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para15"></a>I should say at once that I attach no personal blame to the noble Lord, who, as he explained to me subsequently, was merely saying what he was told to say. Nor do I blame the Palace, who, we have been told, agreed the form of words to be used. Nor do I blame my noble friend Lord Archer, who tells me that he had no idea that the Government were going to reveal the Queen's view on the Bill. Nor do I blame the Clerks, who, the Lord Privy Seal has told us, produced the advice that he used on 2nd March as an ex post justification for what had happened the previous Friday afternoon. The Clerks had not been consulted before the event, more is the pity. They might have urged caution before endorsing so flagrant a breach of the convention.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para16"></a>I suspect and fear that the origins of what happened on 27th February lie in the spin doctors' Downing Street surgery, where the temptation to manipulate the monarchy to support the "Cool Britannia" image proved in this instance as irresistible as it was unwise.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para17"></a>In another place the matter would have been dealt with on the spot by Madam Speaker who, I suspect, would have ruled in favour of Erskine May's Parliamentary Practice, where it is stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The irregular use of the Queen's name to influence a decision of the House is unconstitutional in principle and inconsistent with the independence of Parliament. Where the Crown has a distinct interest in a measure, there is an authorised mode of communicating Her Majesty's recommendation or consent, through one of her Ministers; but Her Majesty cannot be supposed to have a private opinion, apart from that of her responsible advisers; and any attempt to use her name in debate to influence the judgement of Parliament is immediately checked and censured". <P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para18"></a>We do not know, of course, what Madam Speaker would have said, but the Procedure Committee, to which I referred the matter for adjudication, was told by the noble Lord, Lord Weatherill, that, as Speaker, he would have "jumped on" such an incident.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para19"></a>The Lord Privy Seal, in his own statement to the Procedure Committee, reaffirmed his justification for the incident. That did not totally surprise me; he is not someone who easily changes his mind. I hope he will not regard it as disrespectful--and I certainly do not intend to be acerbic--if I suggest that just occasionally I wonder whether there is not a touch of hubris in his attitude to the British constitution.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para20"></a>I am, of course, glad that the committee has endorsed the Erskine May rule. I do not object to the committee's conclusion that exceptional circumstances may arise which may make it desirable to depart from its strict interpretation. But in our parliamentary system, and indeed our legal system, rules are modified by precedent. I therefore strongly object to the reference to the Succession to the Crown Bill as an example of where the departure is justified. If the House were to accept these words, it would at once form a precedent--in my view, one which is both unnecessary and undesirable. I do not believe that the summing up of the Chairman of Committees, as reported in the minutes of the committee, justify the inclusion of the words to which I object.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para21"></a>Before I go any further in putting my case, I have been asked by my noble friend Lord Blake, who also gave evidence to the Procedure Committee and whose opinion in these matters is, I believe, deeply respected, to say that he much regrets that, due to a very temporary medical indisposition, he is unable to be here today to support my amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para22"></a>In his statement of 2nd March the Lord Privy Seal recognised the importance of the issue but justified the use of the Queen's opinion on this occasion on three grounds: that on a matter which was so fundamentally personal to the Sovereign and her family, it would have been unhelpful to the House for the Government not to have made her view known; that the procedure must always be applied with common sense and due consideration for the circumstances; and that Her Majesty's views would soon have become apparent through other channels.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para23"></a>Before I specifically refute these reasons, I would ask your Lordships' indulgence to allow me to refer to the historical background to this issue. It is not surprising that the constitutional convention should have originated in the time of Charles I. It was then that the fundamental right of Parliament to be free from Crown interference was fought for and established. It would therefore seem specious to argue that there are earlier historical precedents which now justify what was done in February 1998. The wording of the doctrine as laid down in the current 22nd edition of Erskine May is identical to that of the first edition of 1844. However, the first edition makes it clear that the origin of the issue <P>


<a name="column_882"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 882</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>dates to the remonstrance of the Lords and Commons to Charles I of December 1641, when it was declared:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"That it is their ancient and undoubted right and privilege that your majesty ought not to take notice of any matter in agitation or debate in either of the houses of Parliament, but by their information or agreement; and that your majesty ought not to propound any condition, provision, or limitation, to any bill or act in debate or preparation in either house of Parliament, or to manifest or declare your consent or dissent, approbation or dislike of the same, before it be presented to your majesty in due course of Parliament". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para24"></a>Erskine May refers to the next occasion when the doctrine was spelled out as December 1783, when the Commons resolved:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"That it is now necessary to declare, that to report any opinion or pretended opinion of his majesty, upon any bill or other proceeding depending in either house of Parliament, with a view to influence the votes of the members, is a high crime and misdemeanour, derogatory to the honour of the Crown, a breach of the fundamental privileges of Parliament, and subversive to the constitution of this country". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para25"></a>That resulted from George III's written message on Fox's India Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para26"></a>Erskine May makes it clear that the doctrine should not exclude a statement by a Minister of the facts in which the Queen's name may be concerned. Even this has led to problems. Sir Robert Walpole, in 1729, and Sir Robert Peel, in 1843, were challenged for giving purely factual accounts of the Sovereign's position on issues. Peel was merely repeating what William IV had already said in a speech from the throne. Even then, Speaker Shaw-Lefevre thought it necessary to reaffirm the underlying position:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It was quite true that it would be highly out of order to use the name of the sovereign in that house so as to endeavour to influence its decision, or that of any of its members, upon any question under its consideration". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para27"></a>The next major battle started in 1909 and led to the Parliament Act 1911. The parliamentary proprieties were observed and Asquith took the greatest pains to avoid any action which might reveal the King's view. After the Liberal victory of February 1910, Asquith told the Commons:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it is the duty of statesmen and of responsible politicians as long as possible and as far as possible to keep the name of the Sovereign and the prerogatives of the Crown outside the domain of party politics". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para28"></a>In November, Edward VII having died, the Cabinet minuted George V,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Ministers are fully alive to the importance of keeping the name of the King out of the sphere of party and electoral controversy ... it would be inadvisable in the interests of the state that any communication of the interests of the Crown should be made public unless and until the actual occasion should arise". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para29"></a>Only on 20th July 1911 was the King's agreement to create Peers privately notified to the Opposition leaders and to the House of Lords on 10th August, the last day of the final debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para30"></a>Thus parliamentary history underlines the seriousness with which both Houses have, for at least 150 years, treated the constitutional convention that the Sovereign's views should not be used in debate in a way which might be thought to influence Parliament and thus undermine its independence. The Speaker checks even the most minor infringements in the House of Commons.
<P>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 883</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para31"></a>There seems to me to be neither authority nor precedent for arguing that, in the words of the Lord Privy Seal, in the case of,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a Bill which is so fundamentally personal to the sovereign and her family", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para32"></a>the convention should not apply. Indeed, a new phrase which is potentially even more pernicious was put the committee. It was said that the Queen's opinion was,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"structural to the Archer bill". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para33"></a>After the justification given we are left with a situation in which it would seem to be open to any Peer to argue in debate on any matter before the House that one of the three criteria of the Lord Privy Seal applies and that the Queen's view on the merits of the matter could or should be revealed. That is clearly unsatisfactory, especially as it is anticipated that there could soon be further constitutional legislation under which hereditary Peers, including Royal Dukes, may lose their membership of the House of Lords.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para34"></a>While common sense and due consideration of the circumstances are good rules to apply to behaviour in and out of Parliament, they hardly justify on their own overturning an important constitutional convention. If the Queen's view on legislation can be given by a government Minister, is it open to the Opposition or Back-Benchers from any party to comment on or even refute that view? Indeed, is the right to put forward the Queen's view to be left solely to the government of the day?
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-03_para35"></a>Finally, as we all know, Erskine May applies to both Houses. If we were to endorse this totally new precedent as an exception to the convention, where would that leave another place? Surely in such matters symmetry between both Houses of Parliament is important. I hope that the Lord Privy Seal will indicate that he is prepared to think again and therefore accept my amendment. If the House were to agree to the report unamended, I fear that it would result in a constitutional shambles. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80609-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, it may be of assistance to the House if I make one or two points at this stage. I am being accused of all sorts of things these days--conceit yesterday, hubris today. One thing of which I suppose I am guilty is not communicating with the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, before he gave us the benefit of his extensive knowledge and historical research on this issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-04_para0"></a>I do not intend to oppose the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford. The Procedure Committee had a thorough debate on the use of the Queen's name to influence debates and its conclusions are set out in paragraph 1 of the report. The committee concluded that the rules stated in Erskine May should continue to be observed by the House, but recognised that exceptional circumstances may arise under which it was desirable to depart from the strict application of the rule.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-04_para1"></a>The committee suggested that the Succession to the Crown Bill--the one to which the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, referred--should be cited as a specific example of such an exception. It is that example that <P>


<a name="column_884"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 884</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, is today seeking to delete. It is clear--at least, I thought it was--that there is a difference of opinion between the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, and the Procedure Committee on the question of whether the Succession to the Crown Bill does or does not properly form an exception of the kind which the Procedure Committee indicated might arise. However, the noble Lord's amendment does not undermine either of the fundamental principles set out in the Select Committee's report; namely, first, that there should be a rule and, secondly, that exceptions could arise.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-04_para2"></a>Under those circumstances it would not be profitable for the House to spend a great deal of time debating the noble Lord's amendment today, nor would it be profitable for a Division to arise upon it. For those reasons I am prepared to accept the noble Lord's amendment without prejudice to the correctness or otherwise of the Procedure Committee's opinion on this specific case. I am sorry that I could not communicate with the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, in advance of his rising to speak to indicate that that was the procedure I intended to adopt.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-04_para3"></a>Since I am on my feet, perhaps I may say a few words in relation to the second amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Henderson of Brompton. It is not a matter upon which I have strong views. The Procedure Committee was persuaded, at the instigation of the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers--I am sorry to see that he is not in his place--to recommend that noble Lords should not speak with their hands in their pockets. The noble Lord, Lord Henderson of Brompton, is intending to delete that recommendation from the Procedure Committee's report on the grounds that it is possible to go too far in prescribing such minutiae of conduct for your Lordships.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-04_para4"></a>As I said, I do not hold strong views one way or the other on the issue. I remind the House that the three Chief Whips and the Convenor of the Cross-Bench Peers agreed last week to circulate a paper on conventions in this House which was distributed with all party Whips. The paper covered a number of aspects of behaviour of the House but did not cover the specific point raised in the Procedure Committee by the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers. Given the existence of that paper and the guidance set out in the report before the House today, I hope that noble Lords will feel that they have been given a wide range of guidance on what perhaps may sometimes appear to be arcane points in relation to the way your Lordships' House behaves. Under those circumstances, I hope that the House will be able to decide this matter too without the necessity for a Division.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, I should mention that, alas, the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, is extremely ill in hospital.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, I am very sorry to hear that. I hope that, had he been here, he would not have taken exception to anything that I said.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-04_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, the third report from the Select Committee on Procedure of the House, as your Lordships will have observed, covers a number of matters. Some are of obvious importance, like the matter covered by my noble friend Lord Marlesford, and others are more trivial but which we as a House would be wise to take seriously.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-04_para5"></a>I should therefore like to say, if the Leader of the House will allow me, how grateful I am for the early opportunity that he has given us to debate the report and for the guidance he gave us on a number of the matters it covers. The opportunity is one which we particularly appreciate, given the pressures an overloaded legislative programme puts on the time available on the Floor of this Chamber.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-04_para6"></a>Of the five matters covered in the Select Committee report, I suspect that the one which concerns us most--and rightly so--is the use of the Queen's name to influence debates. I was grateful to the Leader of the House for what he said. However, I should like to come to this matter a little later in my brief intervention and to take the matters covered by the report in reverse order.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-04_para7"></a>The last two matters to which the report refers may seem trivial, but we should be grateful to the Leader of the House for emphasising the importance he attaches to them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-04_para8"></a>Conduct--the way we behave and the way we observe the rules--is perhaps more important to us in this House than to another place. We all know that we regulate ourselves and that the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack has no power to keep order. This makes our rather elaborate courtesies a gavotte of real practical value. These are the rails which keep our wheels running on track. If we observe them we are less likely to be carried away by convictions, however passionately held.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-04_para9"></a>I believe that the importance of these courtesies has increased over recent years rather than diminished. After all, the House is, by common consent, I believe, busier and fuller and more Members wish to intervene, particularly at Question Time, than six short years ago when I first joined your Lordships' House. That inevitably makes the conduct of our affairs more difficult and puts self-regulation under strain. Our rather elaborate courtesies seem to me, therefore, more of a very present help in trouble than perhaps they used to be, even a few years ago. So I believe that we would do well to heed the advice that the committee has tendered in the fifth item of its report. Certainly we on the Opposition Front Bench will do our best to encourage this side of the House to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-04_para10"></a>The advice of the Leader of the House seems to me to be wise and timely in the matter of Starred Questions. As Ministers, all of us have been presented with draft answers of inordinate length. Officials are perhaps understandably anxious to ensure that Ministers cover every aspect and sometimes forget that some answers are more effective for being kept in reserve for supplementary questions; and indeed that Ministers sometimes have to be trusted to be masters of their brief.
<P>


<a name="column_886"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 886</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-04_para11"></a>Equally, us questioners all too easily forget that, above all, brevity is the soul of wit at Question Time and that it can also stump a Minister completely. I remember all too vividly, when I was a Member of another place, Mr. Tam Dalyell asking a one word supplementary, "Why?". Needless to say, the Minister was beaten all ends up. Perhaps we should equally remember that we in this House are often at our most effective when we are not being too partisan. The words at page 84 of the Companion, therefore, and which are quoted with approval in the committee's report, seem to me to be particularly to the point.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-04_para12"></a>On the question of quotation from speeches in the current Session in another place, I can add nothing to the paragraph in the report. This seems to me to be a sensible and practical change and I hope that the House will take the same view.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-04_para13"></a>The question of the carry over of Bills is perhaps more contentious. A number of your Lordships have expressed concern this afternoon about this proposal, particularly since it seems to them to threaten the powers of delay of your Lordships' House under the Parliament Acts.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-04_para14"></a>As a former government business manager, I can say that we, too, looked at the question of carry over when we were in government. We rapidly came to the conclusion that it would hinder the effective completion of a government's legislative programme rather than help it. The reason of course is that, above all, it removes one of the few restraints on great Secretaries of State to moderate their passion for legislation. I hope that I do not misinterpret him, but from the hints that the Leader of the House has let drop from time to time he shares that view, although he might not be able to say so quite as frankly in public as I do now that I am on this side of the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-04_para15"></a>For that reason, too, I think Oppositions should welcome the idea of carry over. However, perhaps oppositions which expect to return to government should welcome the caution with which this Government are beginning to treat the idea.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-04_para16"></a>As far as this proposal affects the powers of this House, I think it probably enhances them rather than the reverse. So long as only Government Bills are eligible; so long as the only Bills carried over are Bills that have not left their House of origin; so long as the Opposition Whips have an effective veto through the usual channels on which Bills are selected for carry over, it seems to me that your Lordships would, in theory at least, have an extra Session in which to delay the passage of a Bill before the Parliament Acts applied. As someone who would like to see this House use its powers more and who regards that as perhaps one of the greatest arguments for reform of your Lordships' House, I suspect we should welcome the committee's report as a small step, at least at the margins, towards achieving that aim.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-04_para17"></a>This brings me--I hope briefly--to the most difficult matter which we have discussed this afternoon. It has been most elegantly resolved by the noble Lord the Leader of the House. I believe that we should be extremely grateful to him for his statesman-like <P>


<a name="column_887"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 887</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>approach. It is a matter that aroused a good deal of well-justified anxiety in this place; an anxiety which I am bound to say I share to some extent. Therefore, I believe that the whole House should be grateful to my noble friend Lord Marlesford for the role that he has played in bringing the matter to the Procedure Committee's attention and also for the distinguished contribution that he made both to the committee's proceedings and to our debate this afternoon.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-04_para18"></a>It is a sensible practice of the House that on non-political matters we should follow the advice of the Leader of the House. It is something that the noble Lord did when our present roles were reversed and I was always extremely grateful to him for doing so, particularly when I was wrong. I certainly think that we were right to follow the advice of the Leader of the House in this instance and would not dream of questioning the advice which he offered us. Indeed, I accept it completely.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-04_para19"></a>Nevertheless, I wonder whether the time has not come for us to change the practice of this House, as set out by the Leader of the House, as a result of the worry so well articulated by my noble friend.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-04_para20"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Russell, in his evidence to the committee, as I understood him, endeavoured to draw a distinction between the Monarch acting in her personal capacity and the Monarch acting, if I may put it this way, as the Monarch. He argued that in the former case it was right for the Monarch to make her views known in advance of Bills being discussed in your Lordships' House and in the latter, not.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-04_para21"></a>As a matter of academic interest, I would be interested to know if there has ever been an example of the Monarch's private views being used in this way until this year.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-04_para22"></a>However, I have in particular two practical worries about the noble Earl's argument. First, the demarcation line between the two categories seems extraordinarily difficult to define. After all, in the case that we are discussing, the succession to the Throne must, it is true, affect the Monarch personally. That is the advice which the Leader of the House gave us. But the question of who is to be our next Sovereign surely also affects the rest of us as well. A question that affects all of us is surely one that affects the Sovereign as Monarch as well as the Sovereign in her personal capacity. Secondly, the question of the Monarchy--and indeed the role of women--has moved steadily up the political agenda in recent years. This is a matter which is now part of the day-to-day warp and woof of political life. Seeking to involve the Monarch in the day-to-day warp and woof of political life seems to me to be something that perhaps we should try to avoid from now on.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-04_para23"></a>For both these reasons, therefore, I think it would be wise if from now on we altered the procedure currently laid down quite rightly for us in the interpretation of Erskine May by the noble Lord the Leader of the House. I endeavoured to make the same argument in discussions at the Procedure Committee. I understand that the committee had accepted that a new general rule, following the substance of the argument of my noble <P>


<a name="column_888"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 888</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>friend Lord Marlesford, should be recommended to your Lordships' House and that in particular that rule should cover the matter of succession to the Throne.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-04_para24"></a>If my memory serves me right--and it is not always a very reliable instrument--the committee also accepted that it would be impossible to anticipate every eventuality and that if the Government wished to ignore this new rule they should do so only by agreement with the usual channels in this House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-04_para25"></a>In the light of my recollection of the proceedings in the committee, I confess to being a little surprised by the words,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"such as the Crown Succession Bill", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-04_para26"></a>which appear in the third paragraph of the report. Certainly the minutes of the proceedings of the committee seem to me to convey a slightly different emphasis, although I confess that I was grateful to the noble Lord the Chairman of Committees who, in his introduction to our exchanges this afternoon, seemed to me to perhaps set my recollection more closely in tune with his. For those reasons, I am delighted that, on reflection, the noble Lord the Leader of the House has decided not to oppose the view of my noble friend Lord Marlesford, as expressed in his amendment. I am extremely grateful to the noble Lord for that, as should be the whole House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-04_para27"></a>In expressing my gratitude for the way in which the noble Lord the Leader of the House has guided us on this matter, perhaps in finishing I may thank him for what I had hoped would be rather more definite guidance on the second amendment before the House. I refer to that standing in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Henderson of Brompton. If your Lordships find yourselves in the same position as me with regard to the noble Lord's amendment, your Lordships will be on the horns of what seems to me to be an impossible dilemma. On the one hand, there is clearly no one more deeply versed in the procedure and practice of this House than the noble Lord. As a former Clerk of the Parliaments, his knowledge is well known to your Lordships and, in normal circumstances, I would not hesitate to urge your Lordships to accept his advice.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-04_para28"></a>However, there is a difficulty. As the noble Lord the Leader of the House rightly pointed out, my noble friend Lord Ferrers disagrees with the noble Lord, Lord Henderson. I have always regarded my noble friend as the final arbiter of manners in this place. Perhaps I may echo the sentiments already expressed this afternoon and say that I feel particularly sad that my noble friend cannot be here today to argue his point. I hope that the whole House will allow me to convey its very best wishes to my noble friend for a speedy recovery.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-04_para29"></a>Perhaps I may make one plea to the noble Lord the Leader of the House: can he offer those of us on this side of the House a little more definite guidance with regard to the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Henderson? It is something which I find myself quite incapable of resolving.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="80609-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank: </B>   My Lords, I should like to comment on the report of the Select Committee <P>


<a name="column_889"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 889</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>as a whole and to leave it to my noble friend Lord Russell, if he so chooses, to pursue the remarks made by the noble Viscount in so far as the House may wish to spend a great deal more time on the question of the use of the Queen's name. I think that we all recognise the importance of these issues, but I hope that the House will not become too pompous about them or allow them to consume too much of your Lordships' time. Although they are important, my view, after a very thorough discussion in the committee, is that I hope that the House will accept the report as it stands.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-05_para0"></a>In that respect, I find paragraph 1 of the report a fair recommendation of the conclusions reached. It represents the balance of the discussion and of the decision. I dissent from the view of the noble Viscount in so far as he feels that it might be expressed differently. I would not dissent if the advice of the Leader of the House were accepted and we deleted those words, as proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford. Having said that, I believe the report to be a fair minute of our discussions under the chairmanship of the noble Lord the Chairman of Committees.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-05_para1"></a>On the final subject of the report--conduct in the Chamber--and the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Henderson, it is fair to say that we reached that item late in the afternoon after discussing other matters, and that such were the persuasive powers of the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, that none of us felt able to dispute what he was proposing. Therefore, given that I was silent on the matter at that time, I cannot now argue for any amendment to the report.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-05_para2"></a>Nevertheless, returning to what I said at the beginning, I think that we can often be too pompous. If a noble Lord finds it more comfortable to speak in your Lordships' House with his hands in his pockets, I do not think that we should unreasonably object, any more than we should unreasonably object if a noble Lord turns up wearing trainers from time to time--

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Henderson of Brompton: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may put in some very brief words. First, as other noble Lords will agree, I must record the fact that the noble Lord who has just sat down spoke with his hands in his pockets. I have no objection. Having heard what various noble Lords have said on this matter, I believe that perhaps it should be referred back to the Select Committee. The draft of the recommendation is incomplete. It states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Lords should not speak with their hands in their pockets". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-05_para3"></a>But which pockets? I suppose that it means "trouser pockets", but, like the noble Lord from the Liberal Democrat Benches, quite a number of noble Lords speak with their hands in their jacket pockets. Why should <P>


<a name="column_890"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 890</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>they not do so? I think that we are too much governed by too many small, pettifogging recommendations of one sort or another. Quite honestly, that recommendation reminds me of school more than of anything else.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-05_para4"></a>I have no idea whether Members of the House of Commons are allowed to speak with their hands in their pockets, but nervous Members of another place will quite often speak with their hands in their trouser pockets. That gives rise to the opportunity for others to disrupt that Member's train of thought by shouting, "Hands in pocket!" or something like that. I do not think that we want to follow that in this House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-05_para5"></a>One Peer whom I particularly admire, who is one of the wittiest among us and whose words I would never miss if I could possibly avoid it, spoke the other day with both hands in his trouser pockets--and he spoke most eloquently. I would regard it as a criminal act to interrupt his flow of speech by telling him to take his hands out of his pockets. It would be an insolent thing to do to a man of great distinction. I say no more on that, other than to ask that we do not say "yes" or "no" today, but send the matter back to the Select Committee and ask it to make its recommendation a little more precise.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-05_para6"></a>Perhaps I may make one other point. I refer to the carry-over. I am very pleased that the Select Committee has made the recommendation that it has, following the House of Commons. For years, the Whips have unanimously vetoed any change in that regard. One small area of our legislative work is very important but hardly gains any recognition in the House. I refer to the work of the committee--its name escapes me--which is always chaired by a Law Lord--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-05_spnew4"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   The consolidation committee.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-05_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Henderson of Brompton: </B>   My Lords, thank you. I refer to the work of the Select Committee on Consolidation Bills. The programme of consolidation is artificially squeezed because every Bill that is introduced as a consolidation Bill or a statute law revision Bill must be completed within that Session. That wretched committee has to consider perhaps five or six Bills in the first part of a Session while in the second part of the Session, when it could consider another five or six Bills, it is not allowed to do so because those Bills cannot be carried over. I recommend that Bills which start in this House and which deal with consolidation or statute law revision should be allowed to be carried over. I believe that that most important recommendation would be well received by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor if he were present on the Woolsack.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-05_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   My Lords, I came prepared to speak in support of the amendment which has been called and, if the House was divided, to vote in favour of it. I am very glad that that now appears to be unnecessary. The noble Lord the Leader of the House has been very wise and generous to accept the amendment without a Division. It leaves the substances of the report of the Procedure Committee unimpaired <P>


<a name="column_891"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 891</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and saves the controversial matter of the Succession to the Crown Bill from going into a footnote of Erskine May by way of a precedent.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-05_para7"></a>If this problem arose again it would be useful to apply two criteria. The first is whether the measure is controversial. Undoubtedly the Bill proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Archer, was controversial. Fifty-six noble Lords took the quite unusual--to my knowledge, unprecedented--course of voting against the Motion of an Address to the Sovereign to allow the matter to be discussed in Parliament. In considering whether there should be an exception to the general rule, it will always be relevant to apply that criterion. Is the measure a matter of controversy?
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-05_para8"></a>As to the second criterion, it is useful to look at the mirror image of what is done. Would it have been acceptable if the Minister--I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, that he should not be thought to be in any way blameworthy in the matter--had said that Her Majesty had indicated that she disagreed with the Government's view? Obviously that would have been quite unacceptable and inconceivable, as the noble Lord, Lord Richard, put it in a letter to me when I took up the matter with him. That being so, I believe that the House has been very well advised to accept the report without the words that the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, has moved to expunge.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-05_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Dean of Harptree: </B>   My Lords, I too am grateful to the noble Lord the Leader of the House for accepting the amendment in the name of my noble friend Lord Marlesford. I direct your Lordships' attention to the suggestion relating to the carry-over of Bills. I was somewhat reassured by the comments of my noble friend Lord Cranborne but have some anxiety about where this proposal may lead. Admittedly, the proposal has safeguards. It is said that it should be applied to some government Bills in certain circumstances. It is also said that the eligibility of Bills for carry-over should be settled by informal discussions through the usual channels. While that is to some degree reassuring, the House is being asked to endorse the principle of carry-over. I find that worrying. This could easily be the thin edge of the wedge. One of the most powerful checks that Parliament has over any government is that, if the government are unable to persuade Parliament to accept a Bill by the end of the Session that Bill falls; it is dead. If the government wish to pursue the matter they must table a completely new Bill in the following Session.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-05_para9"></a>It would be a dangerous move for Parliament to surrender that very important power. Reforms such as this--noble Lords have seen many over the years--invariably make life easier for the Government of the day and more difficult for Parliament to act as an effective check on the Executive. I hope that noble Lords can have an assurance on this matter. I address my remarks much more to the Leader of the House than to the Lord Chairman of Committees. I seek an <P>


<a name="column_892"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 892</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>assurance that this new power will be used with great moderation and will not be extended in any circumstances to all government Bills.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-05_spnew8"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I believe that after this lapse of time it would be an abuse of the time of the House to engage the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, in discussion of his precedents from the reign of Charles I. However, I hope that it is not a waste of the time of the House to say that I am in full agreement not only with what is said in the report but also with the remarks of the noble Lord the Lord Privy Seal.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-05_para10"></a>It has never been in issue that the rule in Erskine May stands. When the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, refers to the overturning of Erskine May I am not aware of any noble Lord in the House who believes that that should be done. The point at issue has always been simply whether that rule is capable of exception. To borrow a phrase used by the noble Viscount, Lord Cranborne, there is no suggestion that the Queen's name should at any stage be drawn into the warp and woof of political debate. I believe that noble Lords would unite in deploring such a notion.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-05_para11"></a>The noble Viscount said that I had endeavoured-- I believe that was his word--to draw a distinction between the Queen's personal and public capacity. I shall not bore the noble Viscount with a list of the literature on that distinction, to which I am only one of the most recent contributors. He is undoubtedly right that it is a difficult distinction to apply. Good sense is always difficult, but that is no reason for giving up trying to have it. Finally, Erskine May is only 2,000 pages long. It is very dangerous to rest an argument solely on the silence of Erskine May.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80609-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, a number of my concerns have already been covered adequately by other noble Lords. One matter that concerns me that so far has not been touched upon relates to the third section of the report that deals with quotations from Commons speeches in the current Session. Those noble Lords who have glanced at the Companion will understand why that rule exists. If I may paraphrase the Companion, the rule is intended to ensure that debates in the House of Commons are not carried over into the House of Lords. It is important that there should be a distinct and separate debate in the House of Lords from the House of Commons, and vice versa. I hope that when the Companion and Erskine May come to be re-written the importance of the separation of debates in the House of Lords and House of Commons is assured, even though noble Lords will accept the common sense of allowing quotations from speeches in either House to be referred to. But if that should be seen as an opportunity for Members of this House effectively to carry on a completely separate debate in the House of Commons that should not be allowed.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, in support of my noble friend Lord Dean of Harptree, I ask the noble Lord the Leader of the House to provide a little more information as to what is intended by sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph 2. It is proposed that the eligibility of Bills for carry-over <P>


<a name="column_893"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 893</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should be settled by informal discussion through the usual channels. Read literally, it can mean either that the usual channels will decide whether or not a Bill has started in this House and remains in this House and is a government Bill, in which case it means that all government business can potentially be carried over, or that the Government will come to a conclusion with the usual channels as to which of those Bills are eligible for carry-over on this occasion. Those are two very different propositions, both of which can be read from this paper.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-06_para0"></a>Given that the threat of the loss of a Bill at the end of the Session is a real one--as a former Minister I remember how real it was--I regard that as one of the rapidly diminishing means by which Parliament can maintain control of the Executive. Those of us who feel that the Executive is getting further and further out of the control of Parliament believe that we should retain these restraints. I am not speaking of any particular government; I am talking of a continuing process. I for one would be comforted if the noble Lord the Leader of the House would say that agreement would be reached between the usual channels as to the volume of business that might be done in carry-over rather than that the whole volume of available business might be carried over.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, I share the disquiet of the noble Lord, Lord Dean of Harptree, and the noble Lord, Lord Elton, about the carrying over of Bills. Can the noble Lord the Leader of the House say, first, whether there is any precedent in peacetime--obviously things may be different in time of war or national emergency--for a government Bill, as opposed to a private or hybrid Bill, being carried over from one parliamentary Session to another?
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-06_para1"></a>Secondly, in its third report, published on 2nd March this year the Commons Select Committee states that the carry-over should not be a device by which the Government impose their will on the minority. Can we be assured--and here I echo the noble Lord, Lord Elton--that "agreement through the usual channels" means not only securing the agreement of the two main opposition parties, I suppose in both Houses, but also the agreement of the smaller parties and, ideally, Cross-Benchers through the medium of their Convenor bearing in mind that we on these Benches outnumber the Liberal Democrats and all other smaller parties in both Houses put together?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, I too feel obliged to follow up what is said in sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph 2. The trouble, I think, is caused by the use of the word "settled". Settled normally means decided finally. If it be the fact that the usual channels--that means the Whips, coupled no doubt with the Leader of the House, the Leader of the Opposition and perhaps the leader of a minority party--were to decide these things (Front Benches only), they might place themselves in conflict with Back Bench opinion throughout the House. That is a serious proposition.

<P>

<A NAME = "80609-06_para2"></a>If the word "eligibility" is considered to modify the word "settled", a different conclusion might be reached. But it is the word "settled" that we need to be very careful about. I was rather disappointed that the noble Lord, Lord Henderson of Brompton, with whom I have worked in various ways in the past and for whom I have such great respect, decided not to move and press this amendment. I think it is one of great importance. It comes to this: that the responsibility and power for deciding this important matter will be granted to the Front Benches, and to them alone if we are not careful.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-06_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Brightman: </B>   My Lords, I am much obliged. Can the Lord Chairman of Committees confirm my own impression that the effect of paragraph 2 of the Report on the Procedure of the House will be absolutely minimal? I take four examples.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-06_para3"></a>First, if a Bill starts in this House and gets only as far as Third Reading when the parliamentary Session is about to end, the Bill cannot be carried over. It cannot be carried over because under sub-paragraph (f) the new procedure does not apply to a Lords Bill still in this House when the Session ends.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-06_para4"></a>Secondly, suppose a Bill starts in the Commons, is passed in the Commons but gets only as far as Third Reading in this House when the Session is about to end. The Bill cannot be carried over. That is because under sub-paragraph (b) carry-over is restricted to Bills which have not yet left the House in which they originated.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-06_para5"></a>Thirdly, suppose a Bill, which started in this House, has been passed by this House but is returned to us with Commons amendments. Again, the Bill cannot be carried over because under sub-paragraph (f) a Bill which starts in this House and is in this House when the Session ends cannot be carried over.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-06_para6"></a>Fourthly, suppose a Bill, which started in the Commons, has passed through all stages in this House but is returned with Commons amendments. Again, the Bill cannot be carried over because under sub-paragraph (b) a Bill cannot be carried over which has left the House in which it originated. It follows that the carry-over of a Bill under paragraph 2 will be confined to extremely rare occasions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-06_para7"></a>In those circumstances it does not seem to me that the procedure is capable of being used in this House to deprive the Opposition of a power to disrupt Bills which are incomplete as the Session nears its end.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-06_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-06_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, I shall speak briefly. I know the Lord Privy Seal is becoming impatient but there are important matters here and I think that we have the right to discuss them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-06_para8"></a>I am very glad that the noble Lord has accepted my noble kinsman's amendment. I am sure he is right to do that. What in fact happened was, in my view, a mistake, for the reason my noble kinsman has said.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-06_para9"></a>On the question of carry-over, I notice that noble Lords have been paying a great deal of attention to the sugar on the pill. But the pill itself is that a new principle is being established. The previous principle--and if it was not a principle it was certainly treated as one--that carry-over did not exist except in exceptional circumstances--is being discarded; and now the principle is being established, sugared though the pill is, that carry-over is possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-06_para10"></a>During my 16 years in this House as a Back-Bencher I have observed the salutary effect in practice of Parliament having to resolve matters before the deadline. A government seldom wants, despite what the Lord Privy Seal has said, the embarrassment of a Bill falling and having to be reintroduced in the next Session. That is an embarrassment and governments shrink from that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-06_para11"></a>With or without the sugar--and, as my noble friend Lord Cranborne said, this measure could increase the power of this House--it is a very big change. I am sorry that it came to the House tucked between a big constitutional matter and matters of noble Lords' pockets. I do not think women's pockets are under consideration. I am sorry that such a big measure came in this way to the House. I feel that it should have been first discussed in a debate purely about that. But we have taken advantage of the discussion of the report and I am glad of that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-06_para12"></a>I hope that, in future, big changes which affect the practice of Parliament--not just of the House of Lords, but of the House of Commons--will not be discussed here simply as matters almost hidden in a report of the Procedure Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-06_para13"></a>It seems to me that, accept it though we must, we should take note that a big change is being made, albeit by this method.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-06_spnew8"></A><B> The Earl of Onslow: </B>   My Lords, it seems to me that my noble friend Lord Dean needs support on this. This is a constitutional innovation. It is a constitutional innovation, however small the pill--I take the points made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman--in that it is a mini-Aspirin; it is not a block-buster or a Viagra. It is however a small pill and it is a start. It is extremely dangerous for such constitutional changes to be introduced by the back-door, which this almost is, with the check on it which states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the eligibility of bills for carry-over should be settled by informal discussion through the usual channels". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-06_para14"></a>What happens if the usual channels do not agree and the Government want the Bill carried over? I presume, because they have a precedent, that the Government will have their way. I am sorry. This is dangerous. We should not allow it. I beg the noble Lord, Lord Richard, who is not arrogant or conceited and is quite our favourite Leader of the Government Front Bench at the moment, please, because he is a good lad, to go away and think about it again, because he cannot but see the force of the arguments of my noble friend Lord Dean.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="80609-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, someone should be on record as saying that they agree with paragraph 2, which <P>


<a name="column_896"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 896</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I do most strongly. I assume, first, that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, is correct: the proposal does not apply to this House anyway. I am sorry that it does not, but that is by the way. As I read it, unless I have misunderstood it, the words:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"endorsed by the House of Commons", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-07_para0"></a>are merely a way of saying that they are proposing to do it. I agree with that also.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-07_para1"></a>I assume that sub-paragraph (c) amounts essentially to a view that if they can agree, it will happen; if they cannot agree, in practice, it will not happen. We are discussing technical Bills of the type with which I had to deal on the Front Bench, of the most boring, tedious kind, which most noble Lords do not turn up to debate. On the whole, we get them through anyway. If, for example, the Trade Marks Bill had not got through in time, it would have been sensible with no constitutional--I regard as preposterous the suggestion that we are involved in the most fundamental constitution-making here--aspects, to have said, "We have got this far, but no further. Let us get it cleared off when we come back, without starting it again".
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-07_para2"></a>Someone, at least, should congratulate the Commons--if I dare use the words--on the slight possibility that they might modernise themselves. They usually set their face totally against modernisation in any form. I should have thought that that was a good thing. Speaking entirely for myself, I hope that one day your Lordships might also consider this and one or two other modernisations. If I may put it in the vernacular, it is no big deal.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   My Lords, item 2--the carry-over of Bills--with great respect to the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, was discussed in the Procedure Committee. It appeared in the report of the Procedure Committee, which we are now debating. It has not been sneaked into the House in any underhand manner. It is up to all noble Lords, as I am sure they are all aware, and noticeably aware, judging by how full the Chamber is, to debate all reports of the Procedure Committee. This has not been sneaked in in any manner. That is not to say that I do not have grave reservations about the carry-over of Bills. I think that I share the reservations of a number of noble Lords, because I have a nasty feeling that this could be the thin edge of a wedge.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-07_para3"></a>I should turn to the question of Peers speaking with hands in their pockets. This is an example more than a reality. All of us in the Procedure Committee, and outside it, are concerned that the guidance given in the Companion to the Standing Orders should be read, understood and obeyed by Members on all sides of the House. That is what we are concerned about.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   My Lords, I support the points put by my noble friend Lord Dean of Harptree. My main intervention concerns item 5 of the report which relates to our conduct in the Chamber. There are two areas which do not appear to have been mentioned in the report which may be significant, about which I could perhaps ask the noble Lord the Chairman of <P>


<a name="column_897"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 897</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Committees while we are debating the matter. The first area is the method by which we address one another. I agree with my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition, Lord Cranborne, that courtesy in your Lordships' House leads to our self-regulating discipline. I may not be alone in noticing that there is a growing habit of referring to a noble Lord just as "Lord So and So" or "Lord Surname", without prefixing that address with "the noble Lord, Lord So and So" or "my noble friend". The use merely of the surname without the prefix "the noble Lord" or "my noble friend" diminishes our self-regulating discipline in the House. That was my first question.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-07_para4"></a>The second may be a little more controversial. It is whether the noble Lord's committee has considered the dilemma of noble Lords appearing to slumber in the Chamber. We all know that noble Lords do not slumber in the Chamber. The lights are strong, some of us are hard of hearing and getting harder of hearing, and we put our heads back to the loud speakers to hear what is going on. It appears to me to be a sensible time to raise this issue, because the public is not generally aware of the enormous service which your Lordships' House gives to the nation. In view of the scrutiny which, one way or another, your Lordships' House is undergoing at the moment, I should have thought that that is an area which, if not on this occasion perhaps on the next occasion, the noble Lord's committee might care to look into, to the profit of us all.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, I have listened with patience. I have the assurance of the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, that I am not behaving arrogantly. I am not full of hubris. My hands are not in my pockets. Perhaps I may now say something on the carry-over point.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-07_para5"></a>Perhaps I may give the assurance that the noble Lord, Lord Dean, wants. It is not the Government's intention, for one instant, that carry-over should apply to--if I may use the phrase--the bulk of the Government's programme. That is not the object of the exercise. The Leader of the House of Commons wrote to me indicating the sort of circumstances in which the Government might wish to carry over a Bill. The analysis of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, seemed to me to be absolutely apposite, and frankly a strong argument in favour of the proposal.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-07_para6"></a>Perhaps I may also make it clear that the proposal does not apply to this House. It does not apply to Bills which originate in this House. It applies only to Bills that originate in the Commons.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-07_para7"></a>The circumstances that the Government have in mind are, first, a programme Bill which was announced in the Queen's speech, which is introduced late because of some external event, such as a court decision or prolonged consultation, which could only complete its passage in the Session of its introduction if it were rushed through. A second possibility would be a programme Bill which is on target to complete its passage shortly before the end of the Session but which is displaced by an urgent Bill introduced on another matter. Another example might be a programme Bill <P>


<a name="column_898"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 898</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which is introduced late in the Session but which is referred, after discussion through the usual channels, to a Special Standing Committee in the Commons, thereby delaying its arrival in the Lords.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-07_para8"></a>In all those circumstances, it would not be unreasonable for the Government to consider the possibility of carrying over the Bill, provided that it was still down in the other place. One final possible case for carry-over might be of a government Bill which is intended to be introduced in the following Session, but which has been drafted in advance which is ready for introduction in the previous Session. Introducing it in the previous Session would allow for much fuller parliamentary consideration than if it were held over into the following Session.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-07_para9"></a>I wish to make two further points. The noble Earl, Lord Onslow, said that the matter had been sneaked in by the back door. With great respect to the noble Earl, the House has debated this previously on a Procedure Committee report. I have forgotten the exact date, but I remember that the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, was concerned, as the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, pointed out. The House has had an opportunity on at least two occasions--on the Floor of the House and in Procedure Committee twice--to express a view.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-07_para10"></a>Finally, it is perfectly clear that the eligibility for Bills to be carried over should be settled by informal discussion through the usual channels. If the usual channels cannot agree, prima facie there will be no carry-over. I should have thought that there were sufficient protections built into that procedure at least for this House to agree that the other House be allowed to conduct the experiment that it has proposed to the modernisation committee.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-07_spmin0"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees:</B>  My Lords, in view of the discussions we have had, and the business to follow, I hope that noble Lords will forgive me if I do not refer to all those who have taken part in the debate. Indeed, most noble Lords spoke on the question of carry-over. Those matters have been dealt with in the remarks made by the noble Lord the Leader of the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-07_para11"></a>I mention two points on paragraph 1 of the report regarding the use of the Queen's name. First, it is necessary to place this on the record. The Procedure Committee's debate on the matter was thorough and lengthy.  I was grateful for the substantial contributions made to that debate by the noble Lord the Leader of the House, the noble Viscount the Leader of the Opposition, the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, the Leader of the Liberal Democrat Peers, the Convenor of the Cross-Bench Peers, the noble Lord, Lord Weatherill, and the Chief Whips. From that alone your Lordships may feel satisfied about the weight of the discussion. Apart from the useful contributions from the Back-Benchers of the Procedure Committee, perhaps I may mention the helpful contribution by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern. On behalf of your Lordships, perhaps I may express our best wishes to Lady Mackay of Clashfern for a speedy recovery from her accident in Scotland.
<P>


<a name="column_899"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 899</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-07_para12"></a>I refer to the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford. In the light of what has been said in your Lordships' House, and by the noble Lord the Leader of the House, I hope that noble Lords will feel able to accept the amendment to the Procedure Committee's report.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-07_para13"></a>One point arising from the debate is whether or not Erskine May is binding, or applies in this House as it applies in another place. The committee was firmly of the clear view that Erskine May applies in this House just as in another place. It is not binding. While Erskine May is a powerful authority, it represents a statement of the decisions which your Lordships have made on procedural matters. If any amendment is to be made in your Lordships' procedures, no doubt this would be duly recorded in Erskine May in a subsequent edition. Noble Lords may agree that it would not be appropriate for the suggestion made in some quarters that an amendment to Erskine May be put forward by your Lordships' House to be followed. It is not within our power to do that. It is a commercial undertaking. It simply records what we have decided, and another place has decided. I am sure that any changes made by your Lordships will be recorded in future in precisely that manner.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-07_para14"></a>I need say nothing on carry-over, because those matters have been dealt with by the noble Lord the Leader of the House. However, I should mention the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Henderson of Brompton, on the question of hands in pockets. I am grateful for the indication the noble Lord has given that he does not propose to move the amendment. However, what has been said has been noted and will be taken into account. As noble Lords will know, there is nothing to stop matters being raised again in the Procedure Committee, if it is appropriate to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-07_para15"></a>I can answer the noble Lord on one point. I hesitate to do so because it concerns another place. Another place regards it as undesirable for honourable and right honourable Members to speak with their hands in their pockets. I well remember one occasion during the speakership of the late and very much loved Sir Harry Hylton-Foster. As noble Lords know, as in this House, remarks have to be made through the chair in another place. We are not allowed to address noble Lords as "you". Matters were becoming heated and the Scottish Member on the Labour side was driven to say at one stage, "Stand up straight, man. Take your hands out of your pockets", whereupon Sir Harry rose rather meekly from the chair and said, "But I didn't have my hands in my pockets". That is one salutary lesson that we in your Lordships' House might learn from another place.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-07_para16"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Henderson of Brompton, and the contributions made on that matter will be taken into account. I hope that I have not left out any vital matters. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, will indicate what he will do about his amendment.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<FONT SIZE=3>discussed. I was not a member of the committee and I greatly appreciate the courtesy and welcome that the Chairman of Committees gave me.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-08_para0"></a>One other matter arises from the initial remarks by the noble Lord, the Leader of the House. I gather that at some stage we shall have a statement on various matters under consideration. Will the carry-over issue be included in the document? It has been discussed adequately today. I prefer to refer to it as the product of a cabal. As a Lauderdale I regard the title Cabal with some respect. However, I treat the usual channels with some suspicion having been a rebel when I was in another place.

<A NAME="80609-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy </B>   moved Amendment No. 205: 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 41, line 15, after second ("time") insert (", recognising the needs of Wales in relation to the United Kingdom as a whole,").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80609-08_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: We have just had an important debate involving noble Lords in all parts of the House. Important though that debate was, we are one-and-a-half hours short of time for this all-important Government of Wales Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-08_para12"></a>If the national assembly is at the heart of the Bill and the assembly's functions are its arteries, Clause 82 provides the assembly's life blood--its finance. It has come as a surprise to most readers of the Bill that the entire financing of the assembly and all its works is largely dependent on that one clause and the absolute discretion of the Secretary of State. There is no guarantee to the assembly that it will be provided with adequate funds to perform its statutory duties and to enable others within its sphere of responsibility to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-08_para13"></a>There is no mention in the Bill of needs in the context of Wales alone or in relation to the whole of the United Kingdom. We regard a reference to the needs basis of spending--the traditional basis recognised by successive governments--as all important. We include such a reference in Amendments Nos. 205 and 206.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-08_para14"></a>It is well known that public spending per head is higher in Wales than in England for a variety of factors, including lower gross domestic product, that add up to the need to spend at a higher rate. Without some acknowledgement of that fact and an assurance that the needs of the Welsh people will be properly and fairly considered, and that the assembly's grants will not be entirely dependent on the whim of the Secretary of State, the people of Wales will be taking an almighty gamble with their future. The bareness of Clause 82 as it stands sends a shiver down most Welsh backs.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-08_para15"></a>Underlying it all is the uncertainty of the Government and Ministers as to the resources that will be available and who will be there to claim them. Will the Secretary of State have a strong voice in the Cabinet after the assembly is established? More importantly, will he have a strong voice in the Treasury? The fear is that the Secretary of State will be a fading figure in the higher reaches of government.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-08_para16"></a>Clause 88 does make provision for the assembly to consider its financial requirements and to state them publicly before the start of the financial year, but that is far removed from the statement of estimated payments required of the Secretary of State in Clause 83. What is to be the relationship between the two statements? What will happen if the financial expectations of the assembly greatly exceed the expenditure proposed by the Secretary of State--as I suspect will be the case? Will the matter be resolved by some Star Chamber procedure involving the Treasury? The least we should expect is consultation and dialogue between the Secretary of State, assembly and other interested parties--as proposed in our Amendment No. 207.

<P>

<A NAME = "80609-08_para17"></a>I note in the Guide to the Transfer of Functions Order that the Treasury is withdrawing from the position where its consent and approval is required in the exercise of a multiplicity of functions and powers. When I was a Minister, I could never quite understand why the Treasury had to be so deeply and intimately involved in day-to-day matters. I came to appreciate its value as a long-stop guardian of the public purse. I am not sure whether to welcome or regret the Treasury's withdrawal from many areas of the assembly's expenditure. That development suggests a disinterested view of detailed expenditure and concentration on the main allocations on the part of the Treasury.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-08_para18"></a>There has been much discussion here and in the other place of the Barnett formula. I am delighted to see the noble Lord in his place. That formula decides the public expenditure increases appropriate to Scotland and Wales following agreement on similar increases in the budgets of major Departments of State in England. The formula, which is based on population shares, deals only with year-on-year increases in public expenditure. The noble Lord, Lord Barnett, believes that there is a case for a review and revision of the formula 20 years after he devised it, and the Treasury Select Committee is of the same opinion.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-08_para19"></a>Assurances are given in the Financial Memorandum in this Bill and in the Scotland Bill that the Barnett formula, with minor modifications, will continue to apply--at least in the initial stages of Welsh and Scottish devolution. One understands the Government's reluctance to write the formula into the Bill but I hope that the Government appreciate the wish to see something more concrete than the Secretary of State's discretion. Amendments Nos. 207A and 208B in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, express the desire for greater certainty.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-08_para20"></a>Even more important than the Barnett formula are the baseline allocations that are the real foundations of public expenditure in Wales. It is argued that they have developed over time in relation to perceived and proven needs, but the needs of different parts of the United Kingdom are relative and constantly changing. We heard recently the demands of north-eastern England for parity of treatment, and south-west England is also becoming increasingly vociferous. The Government are undertaking a comprehensive survey of public expenditure and it is becoming increasingly clear as time passes that a special survey of the needs of the regions is required, to ensure fair and equitable distribution of resources. If such a survey clearly to spell out the common criteria by which needs are assessed and allocations made is not undertaken, there will be bitter wrangles for resources and recriminations that can only damage the unity of the kingdom.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-08_para21"></a>The Government appeared to acknowledge that argument obliquely in response to the Treasury Select Committee's second report of 10th March. The Government, after referring to their undertaking to update population figures underlying the application of <P>


<a name="column_903"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>the Barnett formula from 1999 to 2000 and annually thereafter, quoted the Scottish White Paper, stating that
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"any more substantive revision of the Barnett formula would 'need to be preceded by an in-depth study of relative spending requirements and would be the subject of full consultations between the Scottish executive and the UK Government'. An equivalent commitment was given in the Welsh White Paper." </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-08_para22"></a>I am sure that the Minister is aware that GDP in Wales is well below the UK average, and that full-time earnings, household income and economic activity rates are also lower, so Wales should be expected to gain from any equitable reallocation of resources on a needs basis. But meanwhile Wales is being asked to rest content with the status quo and to take a gamble as to the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-08_para23"></a>The Welsh Affairs Committee is rightly concerned about the non-statutory basis of the Barnett formula and agrees with the Treasury Committee,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"that the needs assessment within the Formula should be brought up to date". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-08_para24"></a>That appears in paragraph 90. The longer this issue is allowed to lie on the table, the more agitated people will become at the unfairness of the system within the United Kingdom as a whole. Feelings both within and outside the assembly may be exacerbated by the capital and running costs of the assembly itself, which will be subtracted from other expended areas at a time when the anticipated receipts from Europe are falling away.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-08_para25"></a>While the assembly will have no tax varying powers "initially"--as the Secretary of State once famously said--there is clearly the looming possibility that it could raise extra money in Wales through the local authorities, especially after rate capping is abolished and the business rate returns to local authority control. Local authority grant from the assembly can be reduced and council taxes increased. We hope to return to that subject in due course, but meanwhile Ministers may care to enlighten us as to the Government's intentions in this area where there is a great deal of anxiety which some of us have expressed time and time again. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   First, I wish to make two apologies. I apologise for interfering in Welsh affairs. I hope that Members of the Committee will not mind if I do so and that after our discussions on the previous business it is not out of order to do so. The previous business is one of the reasons for my second apology. I had thought that we would start our debates at three o'clock and I have an appointment at a quarter-past five which I cannot cancel. I shall be brief.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-09_para0"></a>I wish to refer to Amendment No. 207A in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, which refers to the Barnett formula. When I invented it, if that is the correct word, I did not expect it to become a formula. My noble friend Lord Callaghan referred to the formula at some length in his Second Reading speech. He said that he found a "slight odour of sanctity". I did not expect any odour of any kind in relation to the Barnett formula.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-09_para1"></a>On Second Reading, my noble friend said that the formula is really quite simple. It is in one sense, but in another it is complex, as my noble friend made clear. He said, if I am allowed to quote--I have lost track of what one can do and what one cannot do. All I know is that I am not speaking with my hands in my pockets, or in any <P>


<a name="column_904"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 904</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>pocket, although I gather that now one can speak with both hands in one pocket! I am not sure how one does that. To continue, my noble friend said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It was adding something which was fairly rational on to something which was completely irrational".--[Official Report, 21/4/98; col. 1055.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-09_para2"></a>He is right, because the Barnett formula, while it is simple, as the noble Lord said--although he said that any increases would be in the ratio of 85:10:5--applies also to any decreases. However, I am not expecting the present Chief Secretary to propose any decreases in public expenditure. My noble friend Lord Callaghan concluded his remarks by saying that the formula will have to be re-examined. Of course, he is quite right.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-09_para3"></a>First, we need to know what the formula is. It is more than just 85:10:5. It is more than being based only on population. Again, as my noble friend rightly said, it is based on the needs of the population. And rightly so; it should be based on the needs of the population.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-09_para4"></a>I am astonished that what is now called a "formula" has lasted for 20 years under the former Prime Ministers, Margaret Thatcher and John Major. In another sense, I am not astonished because my experience is that governments do not like to change anything if they can help it. They would rather do very little--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   Quite right!
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   Who said that? However, the formula has lasted all this time, so if the current levels of expenditure are to provide for current needs, clearly something needs to be done. While Scotland, for example, now has a per capita income well in excess of many regions of England, Wales does not, as I have said on a number of occasions. Certainly, one does not need to change the formula simply to help Wales. Wales is helped by having the Barnett formula. However, it is not right that there should be such irrational haggling between the Chief Secretary and Cabinet colleagues in order to set their departmental budgets and then exclude the Scottish and Welsh.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-09_para5"></a>My noble friend Lord Callaghan was right in saying that one of the reasons I invented the formula was to make life a little simpler. At least when Cabinet colleagues had accepted that, I could deal only with England, which was difficult enough.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-09_para6"></a>The simple formula is quite complex. Perhaps I may quote the fourth Special Report from the Treasury Committee, to which I was honoured to give evidence. Paragraph 10(c) informs us that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The difference in spending per head between England and the other countries of the Union on some non-Block programmes, though greater, is significantly narrower than the overall average: for example; social security spending per head in Scotland, which accounts for close to 40 per cent. of all identifiable government spending in Scotland, is only 9 per cent. above the equivalent figure in England, so that once it is excluded and its dampening effect removed, the difference in spending per head widens". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-09_para7"></a>I mentioned that to show that the issue is complex. It is not as simple as working on the basis of whatever happens to be the population because other factors are involved.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-09_para8"></a>Paragraph 10(e) of the Treasury Select Committee Report refers to a range of external factors such as sparsity and climate,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"which would add to the costs of providing services in Scotland and Wales even if policy and demand were broadly the same as England". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-09_para9"></a>I am sure that that is right and those who have greater knowledge of Wales than I would agree. I know that it is the case in Scotland because it is one of their arguments for keeping it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-09_para10"></a>There is a need for a re-examination. It is important that that takes account of all kinds of factors referred to in another part of the Treasury's response. Appendix 1, paragraph 5, states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In view of these commitments, the Government sees no case for reviewing the appropriateness of the Barnett formula now". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-09_para11"></a>I emphasise the word "now", although the committee did not do so in the response. The paragraph continues:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"As the Committee itself observed, the formula is simply used to share out changes in public spending plans in public expenditure surveys. It does so on the basis of population", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-09_para12"></a>which provides a fair and objective basis. With great respect to my friends in the Treasury, it does nothing of the kind. Of course, it was not done on a fair and objective basis; it was done in order to make life a little simpler for me. Astonishingly, it has existed for 20 years. I am honoured. I have grown fond of my name and therefore of the name "the Barnett formula". The Government are and were committed in the devolution debates, in the referendum and so forth to maintaining the Barnett formula. I should be delighted but, basically, I am not because I believe it is wrong. However, rather than losing the words "Barnett formula" I suggested to the Treasury Select Committee--and I believe it has accepted the suggestion--that it should be "Barnett formula mark II"; that is, it should be reviewed to take account of current circumstances. I am sure that must be right. We know that the Government are committed not to change it. I regret that and I hope that they will reconsider the matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-09_para13"></a>Amendment No. 207A states:

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"All Ministers of the Crown and all government departments making payments to the Assembly shall have regard", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-09_para14"></a>and I emphasise the words "shall have regard",
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to the arrangements known as 'the Barnett Formula' and any future arrangements which may be substituted for it". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-09_para15"></a>That is a lot better than the amendment which I gather was moved in another place. That sought to place the Barnett formula into the legislation. That clearly would be crazy and far too rigid and inflexible. I totally disagree with any such amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-09_para16"></a>However, I see no harm in this amendment. Any Treasury Minister--and I include my right honourable friend the present Chief Secretary to the Treasury--would be bound to have regard to the arrangements known as the Barnett formula because that still exists. But regard must be had also to,

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"any future arrangements which may be substituted for it". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-09_para17"></a>Therefore, I believe that the amendment does no harm and I could support it in that way. I do not believe that it is necessary but if the Committee agreed to it, I should <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>not object. For the moment, we have the Barnett formula. I am not unhappy to have my name associated with something which for a long time has been relatively rational and intelligent. But today, it is long overdue for reform. Does the noble Lord wish me to give way?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I was merely trying to ascertain whether the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, wishes to speak to his amendment next.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   Happily, that is not a matter for me. I hope that the Government will, in the very near future, review the Barnett formula in order to change it to take account of current circumstances. If they happen to call it "Barnett formula mark II", I shall not object.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-09_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Elis-Thomas: </B>   To give living proof of the intervention, I shall now speak. However, I thought it was preferable to hear from the prophet himself, although I shall not refer to him by his first name because that would be out of order. He is a good prophet Joel on this and other matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-09_para18"></a>I refer now to Amendments Nos. 207A and 208A and 208B, which stand in my name. Amendment No. 207A proposes that the Barnett formula or any formula or its equivalent should be included in the legislation. I am grateful for the indications of support for it. The argument is that there should be some objective basis for the allocation of resources to the assembly and, indeed, to the Scottish parliament and, I would argue, to the regional spend in England which is perhaps even less apparent in that the whole of England is still lumped together for most expenditure purposes in the allocation between the different functional departments.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-09_para19"></a>The Treasury Select Committee in another place, to which reference has been made, discussed that issue in some detail. It emphasised the nature of the formula and I shall not go through that debate. I wish to stress that there are two components in this regard--the inherited expenditure and the incremental expenditure, the increase.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-09_para20"></a>My first concern is the future basis on which the inherited expenditure is to be assessed. Is there to be some form of political, if not objective, public expenditure round which takes place involving the Treasury, or are we to move towards the very interesting suggestion made publicly, and also in evidence to the Treasury Select Committee, by Professor Heald, on page 9 of its report, that there should be some kind of territorial exchequer board which would be involved in UK-wide needs assessments. It seems to me that there is much merit in that proposal. We should be looking for a body which is removed from both the immediate political process of the government of the day and that of the funding and spending activities of the assembly and Parliament in order that there should be an assessment of the need and the spending plans.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-09_para21"></a>Indeed, in the memorandum to the Select Committee from the Welsh Office, there is a series of statements on comparisons between the need to spend in Wales and England. I shall not go through that at this stage but it refers to education and training, health indicators, <P>


<a name="column_907"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 907</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>employment indicators, housing, transport, environment and demographic indicators. They indicate the difference in levels of need in those countries. Therefore, there is a need for that to be included in an assessment of spending if we are to avoid continuing political argument between the assembly and the Treasury. As Professor Heald said of the Barnett formula in his evidence, it was a rough rule of political judgment. What is important about rough rules of political judgment is that they should have some socio-economic basis to them in terms of indicators. That will then provide a serious basis for political debate rather than having what we have suffered from over the years in Wales; that is, a tendency to blame what some nationalists call the "London government" for all the ills of the nation. We must move on from that kind of discourse in the national assembly.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-09_para22"></a>I have tabled Amendment No. 208A which relates to Europe. That seeks to make transparent the transfers from the European Union to the UK Treasury for purposes relevant to the assembly. This relates not to transfers of expenditure from the UK Treasury but from the European Union. In the past, there has been criticism about Treasury claw-back. The amendment seeks to make transparent any such funding which appears in the Treasury and then appears as part of the funds of the assembly. The statement referring to that makes it even more transparent.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   Perhaps I may speak first to Amendment No. 207A in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas. I have in this grouping Amendments Nos. 208 and 209 which apply to Clause 83. As the Bill is drafted, they must inevitably appear after we have the debate as to whether Clause 82 shall stand part of the Bill, which I oppose. Therefore, it may be for the convenience of the Committee if I address that particular issue also.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-10_para0"></a>I am not competent to answer the question of whether or not it is proper to use the Barnett formula as the exclusive denominator in this instance, but I suspect that it is not. It is a remarkably simple and durable formula and like many simple and durable things, it has stood the test of time. Therefore, it is right that we still have it and the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, is drafted sufficiently openly not to impose any unreasonable restrictions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-10_para1"></a>A large part of the funding to the national assembly of Wales will consist of local government funding. For years, that has been calculated on--dare I say it?--a more sophisticated and complex formula than the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, had the wisdom to provide. When I was dealing with it intimately, I always said that if you programmed that formula to produce lamb chops, it would come out with lettuces. It was a wonderful mechanism for causing dissatisfaction in local government. It was adjusted every year to take account of demographic change and the effects of that obviously delighted some people and vexed others. The result was a considerable lack of both transparency and clarity which ordinary members could not understand and those <P>


<a name="column_908"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 908</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of us who were deep in the workings of the system learned to live with it and perhaps had a glimmering of light in respect of it on some occasions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-10_para2"></a>Perhaps I may now move on to the issue of whether Clause 82 should stand part of the Bill. I am opposing the inclusion of Clause 82 for the very good reason that, in my view, it is almost the very ultimate in obscure legislative drafting. The question I ask myself is whether we are dealing with the intention of the Bill here or whether we are dealing with the words that are actually written; in other words, which is superior in this particular instance? Whenever I am dealing with a contract outside of this place--and I take legislation as being in the form of a contract--my lawyers always advise me very clearly that it is the wording of the contract that matters and that, if we make a mistake in the wording, the consequences could be rather difficult.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-10_para3"></a>As has already been pointed out, Clause 82 says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State shall from time to time make payments to the Assembly out of money provided by Parliament of such amounts as he may determine". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-10_para4"></a>I accept that the Secretary of State is answerable to Parliament and that, therefore, he must appear before it to explain and justify himself. But it seems to me that that drafting is just a little too whimsical to be satisfactory. Therefore, I have attempted--although I may not have done so adequately--to remove that element of "whimsy" from the Bill by opposing the Question that Clause 82 should stand part and by seeking to amend Clause 83 by way of Amendment No. 208. That would both ensure clarity as regards the funding that will go to Wales and also ensure that the authority of Parliament is stamped on those payments. That is the reason for Amendment No. 208.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-10_para5"></a>Amendment No. 209 deals with a very simple and basic matter which I hope the Government will accept in principle, even if we do not have to put it on the face of the Bill. The amendment would ensure that, when the new assembly comes into being, it knows what funds are available to it from day one. It would require the government statement to be made,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"before the Assembly takes up its authority". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-10_para6"></a>I believe that to be an essential administrative procedure. What I have proposed is a package, which I do not believe to be unreasonable. I wait with interest to hear the Minister's reply because he may be able to allay my worries.

<P>

<A NAME = "80609-10_para12"></a>The assembly will be the bona fide government of Wales. It does not require any legislation to mandate the Secretary of State to receive representations or to consult anyone. Presumably, that will be done as a matter of form. As regards revenue, I should tell noble Lords opposite that the Government will be providing the money for the Welsh assembly and it will not be raised by way of taxation. This Government are a government who want to democratise at local level. This Government want to ensure that the Welsh assembly succeeds. Therefore, it is this Government who will provide the money to enable it to do the job that it has been established to do.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-10_para13"></a>It strikes me that noble Lords opposite seem to be tabling amendments and seeking to insert caveats in the legislation which can only frustrate the activity of the Welsh assembly and perhaps not let it work as successfully as it otherwise would. Then they might be able to say, "Well, we told you so; we didn't want it in the first place".
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell: </B>   I do not believe that any of the three amendments under discussion would do anything to frustrate the work of the assembly. On the contrary, they seek to obtain guidance as to the effect and meaning of Clause 82, and of the related Clause 83, so as to give us a clearer understanding of the financial arrangements for the assembly. I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, had to leave the Chamber for reasons that we fully understand, because I should like to say a few words about the Barnett formula. It is absolutely appropriate that the name of the noble Lord should be so commemorated because of his introduction of the formula in the manner described by the noble Lord, Lord Callaghan, at Second Reading.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-10_para14"></a>However, in that context, I believe that we should perhaps also commemorate the name of Goschen. In my time in the Welsh Office, whenever we discussed Scottish affairs we remembered the earlier formula dating back to the end of the 19th century, which was the basis upon which money had been distributed to the <P>


<a name="column_910"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 910</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Scottish Office for many years. What the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, did was to update Goschen in a sense and thereby bring Wales into the formula.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-10_para15"></a>We were told that one of the intentions of introducing the formula was to eliminate some of the conflicts that previously took place. However, if that was the objective, it was not entirely successful. Certainly, during my time in government, there were frequent and sometimes stormy discussions in Cabinet, and in Cabinet committees, about the application of the formula and whether it needed change and reform. Indeed, I recall one such debate in which the Scottish Secretary took part. In those days I was in a happy position because the Barnett formula, as it applied to Wales, was rather favourable to the Principality. It was the Scots who came under the most attack. The balance was pretty reasonable for Wales in that there were no great grounds for the English wanting to give us less or for our formula to come under attack.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-10_para16"></a>However, that was not the case in Scotland. There were strong moves to say that the problems of the north-east of England had become much more severe relative to those in Scotland than had previously been the case, and that there should be a change in the formula. On the occasion to which I referred there was a vigorous debate. Strong words were advanced on behalf of the north-east and, finally, my right honourable friend the Scottish Secretary, as he then was, had to give some ground and a change was made in the formula. But that change had to be so small that it could not be recognised outside because it would be politically unacceptable.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-10_para17"></a>The Barnett formula has survived largely because, up until now, it has not been thought politically acceptable to change it. But that is not a situation which can continue forever. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, set out the reasons why change will be necessary. The Barnett formula no longer accurately reflects the balance of needs among Scotland, Wales and England or, indeed, among the component parts of England which, in some cases, are perhaps in great need of support.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-10_para18"></a>Change will undoubtedly come. We should not get too carried away by these references to the Barnett formula in the sense that we should not be misled into thinking that all we are concerned with in our consideration of the future financing of the assembly is the application of the Barnett formula. As has already been pointed out, it basically deals with incremental changes. But even on that basis it was always possible for Ministers, faced with a particular need or a particular situation, to make a change. I can think of a number of occasions on which, whatever the Barnett formula stated, I negotiated a specific amount to meet a specific need for Wales. I am sure that my successors did exactly the same.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-10_para19"></a>As my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith rightly pointed out, a different formula applied--certainly in my time--to local government. In my time Wales did rather well out of the local government formula. There was always a certain tension in English local authorities because Welsh local authorities appeared to be treated so favourably with regard to the rate support grant. I make <P>


<a name="column_911"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 911</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>these points because at times even Ministers appear to be guilty of inserting in the Barnett formula characteristics that it does not have. The noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, seeking to respond to points that I had made on 2nd June about the funding of the university sector in Wales, turned his attention to the Barnett formula. He said that he could not see why the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"should be treated any differently vis-a-vis assembly decisions, decisions with respect to the Welsh Development Agency, funding for local government or, for instance, plans for improving the trunk road network".--[Official Report, 2/6/98; col. 226.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-10_para20"></a>In fact local government funding was not--and I do not believe is--covered entirely by the Barnett formula. On that occasion because of the grouping of amendments I was not able to respond to some of the points that were made during the brief discussion we had on the funding of the university. However, I return to the issue again because it illustrates well the point I wish to make.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-10_para21"></a>During that debate I expressed concerns about the funding for the university institutions in Wales. I pointed out that it appeared that the funding would come out of the block grant on the basis of the Barnett formula, which is substantially related to population. I expressed concern because the university institutions in Wales have a large number of students who do not come from Wales. Their requirements have to be set in the context of the United Kingdom as a whole. On that occasion the noble Lord, Lord Callaghan, did not side with me because he felt that I sought to do away with the arm's length principle and he feared interference. That was far from my thoughts. I am as robust a defender of the arm's length principle in this connection as he is. However, I fear that the Minister did not reply to the point that I had made. He stated, again at col. 226 of the Official Report of 2nd June, in relation to the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The functions of that council will remain the same. All that the assembly can do is what is presently capable of being done by the Secretary of State for Wales. It is possible, of course, that the assembly might wish to give increased funding to HEFCW within its budgetary constraints". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-10_para22"></a>My fear is not that it might wish to give more, but that it might be forced to give less because the funding formula that establishes the block grant does not adequately provide separately for university funding. It is possible for the Secretary of State for Wales, or for any other Minister, to make special arrangements each year and to negotiate them with the Treasury and with colleagues to meet the specific needs of any institution, whether it be a university institution or any other institution in Wales.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-10_para23"></a>I hesitate to write formulae into Bills which establish exactly how money should be allocated for the obvious reason that has already been enunciated; namely, that the formulae become outdated. However, I have much sympathy with the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, which at least does not fix the formula on the basis of the existing Barnett arrangements but envisages a future change. It seems to me that we do not know exactly what the Government's intentions are. We are told by the noble Lord opposite that the present Government's intentions towards the assembly are entirely warm-hearted. But that is hardly <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>the basis on which to prepare legislation to last for many decades. We do not really know how this process will work. The paragraph entitled, Financial effects of the Bill, states,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Bill requires the Secretary of State to make payments to the Assembly out of money provided by Parliament. The Assembly will thus become responsible for most of the &#163;7 billion annual budget which is currently controlled by the Secretary of State for Wales. This budget will be updated in future using the existing (population-based) "Barnett" formula, so that its amount will change in line with changes in comparable English spending programmes. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>The Assembly may also receive payments from Ministers and government departments". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-10_para24"></a>That leaves a good deal of uncertainty as to exactly what money will be allocated under what arrangements. We owe a debt of gratitude to those who tabled these amendments in that they will enable Ministers to give us some greater understanding of what they have in mind.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-10_para25"></a>It seems to me that what is important in the Bill as it is drafted is the relationship between Clause 82 and Clause 83. Clause 83 tells us that the Secretary of State has to prepare a statement which shows how the money is to be distributed and made up. It tells us, incidentally, that the statement is to be laid before the assembly. That prompts me to ask, "What about Parliament?" I recall that whenever I allocated funding for institutions in Wales--certainly for local government in Wales--I had to make a statement in the House of Commons and I was vigorously cross-examined. I am not clear whether it is the intention that when this statement about an important matter is made in future it should be made in both Houses so that questions can be asked in Parliament about it. It seems to me an issue which is of some importance.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-10_para26"></a>To my mind I suppose the best defence for the assembly--that is to say, the best guarantee that it will be adequately funded by future governments, whatever their political make-up--is that there should be full and adequate statements, preferably made to Parliament and to the assembly, concerning the detail of the funding, how it is made up and whether there are any special allocations included that do not come under the Barnett formula, for example in order to provide for higher education on a basis that compares with university institutions in other parts of the United Kingdom. If we are to have full and comprehensive statements made in both parliaments--if it is appropriate to use that term--then we shall begin to have a defence in future and we shall begin to have a basis on which we can proceed, not on the basis of a rigid formula, or of a formula that may be subject to subsequent change but will always be flawed, imperfect and inadequate, but to a formula and a clear declaration by Ministers of what other factors they have taken into account in making their allocations, what additional items they have included, or what they may have taken away in allocating the funds.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-10_para27"></a>It is only by having openness and the ability of Parliaments to audit and debate what they have done that we provide an adequate defence both for the Parliament of the United Kingdom that the money is being properly distributed and allocated in an <P>

<A NAME="80609-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dean of Beswick: </B>   One mistake is being made. It was made by my noble friend Lord Davies. It is that the new assembly, once it is under way, will decide how much it wishes to spend, and on what, and that it is bound to be given the okay on spending levels by the Parliament at Westminster. My noble friend referred to the assembly being brought into being to govern Wales. That is not the case. It is being given certain areas of responsibility. The final governance of Wales will happen in another place, as will that of Scotland, and of Britain. So we shall never arrive at a stage when the Secretary of State for Wales makes out his tab for what he wants, goes in to see the Chancellor of the Exchequer and automatically receives that amount. The Chancellor of the Exchequer may well say, "I'm sorry, but that is far too high. The ratio is not correct. You are even exceeding the amount that Scotland receives per capita". So it will not be as easy as all that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-11_para0"></a>Amendment No. 207A can be construed as having various interpretations. During the passage of the Scottish Bill, I shall attempt to wreck the Barnett formula. I shall move an amendment seeking a fresh start as regards allocations of finance based on equal distribution. Does the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, accept the very generous settlement that Scotland presently receives, and the much poorer one for Wales?
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-11_para1"></a>In Scotland, per capita spending is &#163;871 more than in England; the excess is over twice the amount. I am sure that anybody who wants to battle the case for Wales will not accept Scotland being so generously treated. If we start to cut back on that &#163;871 differential for over 5 million people, there will be a lot more money to spend in Wales and the English regions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-11_para2"></a>Members present may recall that, some time ago, I tabled a Question on the different per capita spending in England, Scotland and Wales. I asked the Minister what it would cost to bring up the levels of spending per capita for the English regions, for the 50 million people in England, so that it is equal to spending for Scotland, instead of reducing the amount for Scotland. The figure was over &#163;300 billion. It is a sum that cannot even be contemplated.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-11_para3"></a>Whatever happens in relation to this Bill, we have to be careful if we change the Barnett formula. The Scots will say that that is the sort of differential they have, that is the sum they wish to remain in place. It may well be that the pressures are now starting in the English regions. Some of those regions, like the regions of Wales, are probably much poorer than the poorest parts of Scotland. There are now terrible areas in the English regions. In some of the big cities, deserts of squalor have appeared. Houses have been bulldozed that were built less than 20 years ago at enormous expense. Industrial buildings have been bulldozed. They were a total waste of time. There is nothing in their place, merely desert.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-11_para4"></a>My point is that, if more money is required, we should not be too ready to talk about the Barnett formula unless we are prepared to think that government will cut the funding for Scotland. Money of the dimension that is asked for will not be available.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-11_para5"></a>I shall say no more on this Bill. However, I give notice now that I shall attempt to wreck the special financial arrangement which is totally over-generous to the Scots.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   We are opposed to the Barnett formula appearing on the face of the Bill, or indeed any formula. What is necessary is maximum flexibility.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-11_para6"></a>Two arguments are advanced to support the idea of having a formula, guidance, reference to needs, and so on, on the face of the Bill. One is a fear that is said to be widespread in Wales--though I confess that I have not come across it myself--that this Government will starve Wales of funds as soon as the Welsh assembly is in position. I rather agree with the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Coity. This being the important part of the present Government's legislative programme, it is inconceivable that they will starve Wales of funds in the years to come. Should they do so, or should any future government of a different hue attempt to do so, they will meet their nemesis in the usual democratic way through the ballot box. They will lose their seats in Wales, and there will be pressures from all parts of Wales to ensure that fairness continues and that the needs of Wales are met.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-11_para7"></a>The second argument appears to be this. Unless there is guidance, a reference to needs, or a formula--as the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, said, that causes problems with local government--there will be rows and arguments. The people of Wales will use London government, to use a phrase that the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, now eschews completely in his vocabulary. There will be rows about London government.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-11_para8"></a>I do not see it that way at all. My view is that there will be constructive argument as to what are the needs of Wales. There will be constructive debate and discussion. Different responsibilities will be exercised by the assembly from those of the current Secretary of State for Wales. They may not be all that different; but they will be different. Over a period of time, arrangements which are practical and achieved in a flexible way may result in some formula which will avoid future argument. But that day is in the future. It will be for the parties on both sides, for the assembly and for the Westminster Government to discuss among themselves what is the appropriate level of funding to cope with Welsh needs and to see whether that cannot be reduced at a later date, after all the arguments have been gone through, into something that is sensible and acceptable and avoids further problems.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-11_para9"></a>To say now in this Chamber that we must adopt this or that formula, or even to suggest that the Government will have no regard to the needs of Wales, and to say that the Government will have no regard, as the noble Lord, Lord Dean has put it, to the needs of other parts <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>of England is fanciful. Keeping the approach simple, straightforward and without formulae in the Bill is in our view the way to proceed.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   Before the noble Lord sits down, perhaps he will answer one small concern that I have. I have a great deal of sympathy with what he said, not least with his point about the problems that we shall all face in the future. What is a sensible and rational debate in the Westminster Parliament may be portrayed as such here, but may be portrayed in a totally different way, as a destructive debate, in far-flung parts of the country such as Wales or Scotland. I believe that that is a danger we all face, which has the potential to do great harm to the future unity of the United Kingdom.

<P>
<A NAME="80609-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hooson: </B>   I did not intend to intervene, but I wish to make one or two comments about a point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell. In a debate of this kind we tend to illustrate the division which is apparent in this House. Although I had doubts when I first saw the Bill, I entirely approve of the Government's flexible approach. I think they are entirely right that devolution is a process and not a formulation of something that is to be set in stone. People tend to forget that there will be Welsh MPs. The Secretary of State for Wales will be answerable to Members of Parliament in the House of Commons. He can be interrogated at Welsh Question Time. There will be a Welsh Grand Committee in the other place. That committee, unlike the Scottish Grand Committee, will be concerned with all legislation that affects England and Wales.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-11_para10"></a>If we were concerned with the Scottish Bill, in which there is legislative devolution, or were concerned with giving Wales a federal government, then we would be concerned about the exact words and the dots and commas, because they would be very strictly interpreted. But this is a process. I have no doubt that adaptation will be necessary along the line. For the success of this process, a great deal depends on good will in both Cardiff and London.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-11_para11"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, referred to taking legal advice when entering into a contract and being very concerned about the exact meaning of the words. I think lawyers would tell him that, where there is to be an ongoing process and there is a great need for flexibility of approach on both sides, the most dangerous form of words would be one that would restrict that flexibility.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-11_para12"></a>The debate on these amendments seems to me to illustrate the division. Dozens of amendments have been submitted to us by various bodies and individuals suggesting that this or that would improve the Bill. I have come to the conclusion that the basic government approach to the Bill is the right one. We must not write things in the Bill in a way which could be interpreted as being embodied in stone, which would prevent the developing relationship which is so necessary if the assembly is to succeed.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-11_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Prys-Davies: </B>   I am more cautious in my approach to Clause 82 than my noble friend Lord Davies <P>


<a name="column_916"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 916</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of Coity and the noble Lords, Lord Thomas of Gresford and Lord Hooson. I have some sympathy with the idea behind Amendments Nos. 205 and 206. My noble and learned friend the Solicitor-General was unequivocal in stating that the present Government had no intention of departing from the existing arrangements. That is excellent, up to a point. That point could come during a process of change. Governments come and go; circumstances change. There is no assurance that the present intention, as expressed by my noble and learned friend the Solicitor-General, will outlive the present Government. Surely we have a duty to Wales to consider that position.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-11_para13"></a>The omission seems to me to raise two wider issues. First, if a future United Kingdom government decided to apply different criteria for deciding the allocation to the assembly which was less favourable to Wales than the current arrangements, there would be a grave possibility that the assembly would not be able properly to perform the functions over which it has statutory responsibility as it has no revenue-raising capacity of its own. That was a point made by my noble Lord, Lord Dean. That situation would be a recipe for trouble.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-11_para14"></a>Secondly, the Welsh assembly will be a powerful body, its members directly elected. Those members will be men and women of ability. An assembly made up of such members, which has no statutory say in the amount of the block grant given to it by the UK Government to perform its statutory functions, could quickly become dissatisfied with its position and could blame the UK Government for its shortcomings. I believe that in that situation the members would have a genuine grievance. That again seems to me to be a recipe for trouble and would offer no hope of stability.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-11_para15"></a>It has been clear from day one of the Bill that it is a compromise between the status quo and the Scottish Bill. But the Welsh assembly must be a stable assembly if it is to have a future. It seems to me that this clause and another clause which we shall discuss at Report stage may be a recipe for instability. Surely that is not what we want.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80609-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Davies of Coity: </B>   I addressed earlier the amendments put down by the noble Lords, Lord Roberts and Lord MacKay. I think I must have missed something in what the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, said in respect of his Amendment No. 208. That amendment relates to Clause 83(1), which states:

<P>

<A NAME = "80609-12_para2"></a>With the removal of Clause 82, which is what the noble Lord proposes, what payments will be referred to?
<P>


<a name="column_917"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   That question is simply answered. If Clause 82 is removed, so that Clause 83 becomes Clause 82, the Bill would then read:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State shall for each financial year of the Assembly make a written statement showing--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(a) the total amount of the payments which he estimates will be made by him for that year to the Assembly as approved by Parliament". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-12_para3"></a>That gives a statement of what the payments are; a statement that the Secretary of State will make them; and the authority of Parliament for the payment of those sums. It seems to me that in one simple phrase we encapsulate the totality of Clause 82 and the first part of Clause 83. I suggest that the Bill would therefore be that much simpler, more straightforward and more understandable, which is surely what we should all be aiming for.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Davies of Coity: </B>   It seems to me that, if the clause which gives Parliament the authority to provide the money is removed, it will be extremely difficult for the Secretary of State to provide a written statement.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   Perhaps we should not continue this exchange.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-12_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   This is obviously an important group of amendments, because if there is any area which is likely to cause trouble, it is finance. All of us want to see this assembly succeed. In view of that there seem to me to be two overriding principles of approach. The first is to eliminate areas of contention and misunderstanding; the second is not to devolve power in any niggardly way.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-12_para4"></a>As for the first, there seems to me to be advantage in the proposal of my noble friend Lord Elis-Thomas to write in the Barnett formula, provided that there is provision--as there is in his amendment--for its improvement. Whatever the position was in the past, in the operation of the Barnett formula we have seen that Wales received less than it should on considerations of comparative need and population. As the noble Lord, Lord Dean of Beswick, pointed out on several occasions, Scotland has done well and, as he never fails to point out, has been considerably better off than the North East of England. The Barnett formula therefore needs to be brought up to date, and that is what the amendment provides for.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-12_para5"></a>I can see no objection to specifying the Barnett formula by name. It is known as such to political scientists, to students of the constitution and to students of public finance. It is a perfectly well understood precept and we should be no more afraid of introducing it than we were afraid of introducing the term "Prime Minister" in the process that took so long before we got round to admitting that there was such a creature in our constitution. Finally, after centuries, it was admitted that there was and that title was admitted to legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-12_para6"></a>We should not be afraid of the Barnett formula. Its advantage is its certainty--that was emphasised by the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith--and its retentiveness; it has stood up to time and does not really admit much room for argument. Although the devolution should be <P>


<a name="column_918"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 918</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in no niggardly spirit, I do not believe that the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Davis of Coity, is acceptable; that is, that we should merely say that it should be a payment according to need. That is an open formula which gives ample scope for contention.

<A NAME = "80609-12_para7"></a>Nor, for once, do I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, or the noble Lord, Lord Hooson, although it is even rarer for me to disagree with him. These matters cannot be airily dismissed by referring to "constructive discussion". It is over a quarter of a century since I was a Treasury Minister. But the phrase "constructive discussion" is not what sticks in my memory, and I suspect that the noble Lord, Lord Callaghan, who was First Lord of the Treasury, would bear that out.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-12_para8"></a>The great advantage of the formula is that it limits discussion. Therefore it would be most safe for us to adopt Amendment No. 207A in the name of my noble friend Lord Elis-Thomas. I venture also to comment on the amendment which is rather on its own, Amendment No. 209, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith and the noble Earl, Lord Northesk. It is important that everybody should know where they are before the assembly meets.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-12_para9"></a>I have one final query on Clause 82 which the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, described as "whimsical". Does subsection (1) cover the ground that is at present covered by the Barnett formula? Is subsection (2), those other contributions mentioned, not covered by the formula? In other words, what are the ministerial payments that are not made by the Secretary of State for Wales at the moment?

<A NAME="80609-12_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Callaghan of Cardiff: </B>   I regret to say that in my experience the elevated tone of the discussion this afternoon is not reflected in the Bear Garden of the Cabinet at 10 minutes to one before lunch on a Thursday morning when we are arguing about the last &#163;1 million. That was put in a more vernacular and less elevated way than the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon, puts it now.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-12_para10"></a>When we deal with the realities of the situation, the Secretary of State is protected by the Barnett formula in the sense that he has a fixed ratio upon which he can rely without fighting too hard. He can sit back and watch the Secretary of State for Defence defend himself against the Secretary of State for Education in the Cabinet discussions that take place and say, "However these two chaps fight it out, at least I have got a formula that I know will be of great benefit to me and I have got a fixed amount".
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-12_para11"></a>We must have regard to the realities of the situation. The Secretary of State joins in the argument on the side of the Secretary of State for Education; he does not get much out of defence, but he gets an awful lot out of education. I am talking about the reality of the discussions and not, I regret to say, the rational arguments that affect Members of the Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-12_para12"></a>The Government therefore would be ill advised to depart from the Barnett formula. It is a formula that is well known. It gives protection in a different situation <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>from the one we have had so far. Whether it works out better or worse for Wales in the long run, I am not sure; that may be argued both ways. I notice that the former Secretary of State, the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, appears to agree with me.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-12_para13"></a>Recognising that this Government clearly have, as a major preoccupation, the necessity of ensuring that the national assembly starts well, works well and has adequate finance to carry out its duties, I have little doubt that the Barnett formula will be under no pressure to whittle it away from the Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-12_para14"></a>As regards the future, with respect to my noble friend Lord Elis-Thomas, I would not wish to tie us down to a specific formula of that sort. If one has a good Secretary of State for Wales he will have plenty to do. He will have to argue the matter in Cabinet and get the benefit that he can. He will be backed by a very powerful public national assembly which can easily rouse the opinion of Wales for what he is going to do. Therefore, I would not write in firmly the Barnett formula. I remember all the rough and tumble that goes on in Cabinet.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-12_spmin0"></A><B>The Solicitor-General  (Lord Falconer of Thoroton): </B>  In responding to this debate I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 205, 206, 207, 207A, 208, 208A, 208B and 209. As the Committee is aware, all these amendments relate to the financing of the assembly's activities. We are very aware of the importance of Clauses 82 and 83. Therefore, this is a very important debate. I am grateful to be given the opportunity to explain how the financial arrangements are intended to work.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-12_para15"></a>I start by saying as clearly and simply as I can the intentions as regards the funding of the assembly. I hope that I shall put many of the Committee's concerns at rest. The Government made it clear in the White Paper A Voice for Wales that we were committed to retaining the present arrangements for deciding the size of the budget allocated to Wales. We have no plans for a fundamental review of the block and the Barnett formula rules. That formula has been in operation for nearly 20 years and it has been accepted and used by successive governments. We are going further than simply using it; we are making it transparent in its operation. For the first time, last December we published the principles to the block--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-12_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   Does the noble and learned Lord really dispute that the formula is now out of date and that it has operated to the disadvantage of Wales?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-12_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   We do not accept that it is out of date. We believe that it still has considerable life in it. It is appropriate for the present circumstances. As I was saying, we are making its operation transparent. Last December we published the principles to the block and formula arrangements. We shall be publishing the detailed rules in due course. Therefore, as regards the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, it will be clear as to how the sums are calculated.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-12_para16"></a>It goes further than that because as the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell has pointed out, Clause 83 of the Bill requires the Secretary of State to publish a written statement for each financial year showing what sums will go to the assembly both from him and from other departments and sources. If and in so far as the sums being paid to the assembly do not fall within the application of the block, increased by the Barnett formula, such as for exceptional items of various kinds, that will have to be made clear on the face of the statements made by the Secretary of State. So the people of Wales will be able to see how the sums are calculated.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-12_para17"></a>We do not believe that the formula gives Wales a disproportionate share of the United Kingdom's resources; it is a purely mechanical exercise based on relative populations. Criticism of Barnett often arises because of confusion between the absolute size of the block and the mechanism for adjusting--<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="80609-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dean of Beswick: </B>   During my short speech on this amendment I brought in the Scottish factor as regards the Barnett formula. I was making the point that the Scottish allocation should be a more realistic figure. There must be something wrong with the Barnett formula because, per head of population, Scotland is much richer than Wales, but it can still draw &#163;871 per capita more than England. Wales comes about one-third of the way in between. I do not accept the Government's statement that the Barnett formula has worked well. It has worked very well for the Scots, but not for those south of the Border.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   It is a formula that has stood the test of time. It has many of the advantages that have been referred to in the debate, particularly those referred to by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, as to certainty and the noble Lord, Lord Callaghan. It gives the Secretary of State for Wales a great degree of protection in his disputes with other Ministers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-13_para0"></a>It does not take into account, or seek to reflect, spending needs; it is simply a fair way of dealing with year-to-year changes in public expenditure. Our basic position is that we stick with that approach. We believe that it brings certainty and sense to the position and that it has stood the test of time. We believe that we bring transparency to the arrangements. We also believe that it would be wrong to try to incorporate into the Bill the provisions of the Barnett formula.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   Is the noble and learned Lord being more "Barnett" than the noble and eponymous Lord himself?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton:  </B>   I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, is not in his place at the moment. I believe that he was being too modest in defending his own formula. We believe that it is the appropriate means for dealing with the spending needs of Wales at present. We have no intention of changing it at the moment. If there were to be a change in the expenditure system, it would be only after a full <P>


<a name="column_921"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 921</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>spending needs assessment had been undertaken. The review would have to take into account factors such as the levels of GDP, deprivation and unemployment. The assembly would be fully involved in any such review. But we have no plans for such--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-13_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Dean of Beswick: </B>   Is the Minister saying that there is a review under way at present?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-13_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I am saying two things. There is certainly no review under way at the moment and there is no intention to start one. I said that if there were one--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-13_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Dean of Beswick: </B>   Then why did the Minister use the word? Why did he bring in the word "review"?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-13_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   Simply to say that there is neither a review going on nor any intention to have such a review. I apologise if, by using that word, I gave rise to any other impression. I did not intend to do so. I hope that I have made that clear.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-13_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Elis-Thomas: </B>   I am trying to be helpful. Would the Minister care to speculate on the scenario of a possible review? For example, the noble Lord, Lord Dean of Beswick, quite rightly spoke for the English regions. Were those regions to have regional assemblies, would there not then perhaps be a case for reviewing public expenditure and its allocation throughout the regions and nations of these islands?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-13_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I do not believe that it would be particularly helpful for me to speculate about the circumstances in which it might be appropriate to have a review. I hope that I have made it clear that no review is taking place at the moment and that there is no intention at present for such a review. We believe it important that that is made clear so that the people of Wales know the basis on which the sums of money will be allocated to Wales once the assembly is operating.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-13_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I wish to be clear in my own mind. I presume that we are talking about a review of the Barnett formula. There is a review going on of government expenditure called the fundamental expenditure review. It is being conducted by the Treasury. In my capacity as the Treasury shadowman here, I am assured that it is looking at all aspects of government expenditure. The Minister should be careful because of the review that is going on covering all aspects of government expenditure.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-13_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   There is a comprehensive spending review going on, but it is not looking at the application of the Barnett formula.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-13_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I accept entirely that the review may not be looking at the "Barnett formula". That deals <P>


<a name="column_922"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 922</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with year-on-year change. Can the Minister also tell the Committee whether that review might involve the base line which is where the fundamental debate lies?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-13_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   Of course it may. The comprehensive spending review will be looking at expenditure in all major departments of state. If there are changes in those departments, they will extend into Wales through the Barnett formula. But with great respect to the noble Lord, that is a completely different point. The suggestion that any government does not look at their expenditure for such things as health, education or whatever, is absurd. I simply point out that we are looking at expenditure, but that does not seem to me to take the debate very much further forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-13_para1"></a>In the light of that basic structure, which we have set out as our policy in relation to payments to the assembly, perhaps I may deal with the amendments proposed, first making the point that there has been much debate about whether we should put the Barnett formula on the face of the Bill. We believe that it would be wrong to put on the face of the Bill any formula or statement in relation to funding. That would almost certainly lead to unworkable complexity.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-13_para2"></a>However, there is a further fundamental constitutional point. The money that will go to the Welsh assembly ultimately has to be voted to it by the UK Parliament. As noble Lords opposite have repeatedly made clear, supply is ultimately a matter for the other House, which is sovereign in that respect. Irrespective of what might be put on the face of the Bill, Parliament--in effect, that means the other place--must approve the supply for the government of Wales, for the assembly. In the light of that fundamental constitutional point, it seems wrong to specify on the face of the Bill how those sums should be calculated. However, I hope that I have made clear on behalf of the Government our policy on the funding of the assembly.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-13_para3"></a>Finally, on the detail, money could not go from the Secretary of State to the assembly without Clause 82 because, despite the ingenious argument of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, Clause 83 deals only with statements of what is to come; it does not give the Secretary of State the power to release that money. We have to have Clause 82; otherwise there will be no power for the Secretary of State to give the assembly any money.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-13_time0"></A><H5>6 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-13_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell: </B>   I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for giving way. He has made some helpful remarks about the details to be provided under Clause 83. However, can he answer my question about the way in which Parliament is to be informed of those details? The Bill states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State shall lay before the Assembly any statement made under this section". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-13_para4"></a>That Vote must not be lost in any general Vote which provides funds. We need a clear statement of detail to be given to this Parliament as well as to the assembly in Wales.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-13_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   The noble Lord is right to point out that Clause 83 relates to written statements <P>


<a name="column_923"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 923</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>made to the assembly, not to this House. The amount to be given to the assembly will have to be referred to in the supply provisions considered by the other place. I cannot give the detail of how that will be done, but I shall write to the noble Lord about it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-13_para5"></a>I turn now to the detail of the amendments. Amendments Nos. 205 and 206 would require the Secretary of State to take into account the needs of Wales in relation to the United Kingdom as a whole in determining the money he makes available to the assembly. The amendments would require changes to, or even the complete abandonment of, the Barnett formula and I have already said that we have no plans to do that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-13_para6"></a>Amendment No. 207A seeks to require that payments made to the assembly should have regard to the Barnett formula or any arrangements which replace it. As I have just said, to include any references to the Barnett formula on the face of the Bill would mean that the whole system would need to be built into the Bill and we do not believe that it would be helpful or practical to freeze the details in statute. The amendment would also require the Secretary of State to consult the assembly about any proposals to change the Barnett system. I have already given my assurance that the assembly would be consulted; there is no need for the requirement to be included on the face of the Bill. In view of this, Amendment No. 207A is unnecessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-13_para7"></a>Amendment No. 207 provides for statutory consultation. The assembly will be able to make any representations to the Secretary of State about funding that it wishes. We gave this commitment in paragraph D.14 of the White Paper, which stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State will provide the channel through which the Assembly can conduct any discussions it might wish to have with the Government on financial matters. Thus, for example, if it has any concerns about the detailed operation of the Block formula, the Assembly will be able to make representations to him". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-13_para8"></a>Clause 34 of the Bill already allows the assembly to consider and make appropriate representations about any matter affecting Wales. So the assembly may make such representations to the Secretary of State, if it so wishes. During Committee stage in another place, my honourable friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, gave the Government's commitment that there would be discussions about funding between the Secretary of State for Wales and the assembly during the public expenditure survey. No doubt the assembly will wish to give its views on the resources which should be made available to it and any special factors it believes the Government should take into account in reaching their decision. It may also want to give its views on the operation of the block formula.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-13_para9"></a>Amendment No. 208 seeks to amend Clause 83 to insert a reference to the approval by Parliament of the payments the Secretary of State made to the assembly. I remind your Lordships that Clause 82(1) already makes clear that the grant paid by the Secretary of State to the assembly will be out of the moneys provided by Parliament. Thus Parliament will have already approved the money available to the Secretary of State and I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, will therefore agree that his amendment is not needed.
<P>


<a name="column_924"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 924</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-13_para10"></a>Amendment No. 209 seeks to require the statement under Clause 83 in respect of the first financial year to be made prior to the assembly taking up its authority. The first financial year is defined in Clause 155 and means the period from the first elections on 6th May 1999 to 31st March 2000. While the Government have not taken a final decision yet, we would expect that the final transfer order might come into effect in June or July 1999. There is no need for the Bill to spell out when the Secretary of State is to give the statement. For obvious reasons, the assembly will need to know the amount of money available to it before it starts business. There is no need to have a specific provision in the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-13_para11"></a>I would submit to the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, that his amendment, Amendment No. 208A, is inappropriate. Subsections (1)(b) and (1)(c) of Clause 83 already require the financial statement to include details of payments received from a Minister or government department, thus covering EU payments received through the intervention board for example, and otherwise than from a Minister or government department, which would cover any payments received direct for the European Union.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-13_para12"></a>The Government very much appreciate the concerns that the noble Lords in whose names these amendments stand have shown for the funding of the assembly. However, I respectfully suggest that their solutions are not practical. We have thought this through carefully and this is the best method of funding, legally, from the point of view of Wales. I invite noble Lords not to press their amendments.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80609-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </B>   Before the noble and learned Lord sits down, will he clarify one point for me? He said that our amendments, Amendments Nos. 205 and 206, would mean the abandonment of the Barnett formula. Can he explain that comment further?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   The Barnett formula is based solely on applying a particular formula to increase the baseline figure year on year. It is not calculated by reference to need. It is simply a formula.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </B>   As we had expected, we have had an interesting debate in which a variety of significant points have been made. It seems to me that the key issue is whether or not we should include the Barnett formula in Clause 82. We heard a statement from the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, to the effect that the formula should be reviewed to take account of current circumstances. The noble Lord pleaded for Barnett mark II. I should add that I listened carefully to the remarks made by the former Prime Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Callaghan of Cardiff.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-14_para0"></a>Members of the Committee are taking two views of the future. Uncertainty has been expressed by my noble friend Lord Crickhowell. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, said that it was inconceivable that a government should starve Wales of funds. Perhaps "starve" is not the right word, but it is not inconceivable <P>


<a name="column_925"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 925</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that a future government may preside over a reduction of funds to Wales or an absence of an increase in the funds available to Wales in future years.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   Does the noble Lord agree that even when the Barnett formula was applied by the previous government the then Secretary of State for Wales, Mr. Redwood, returned &#163;135 million from Wales to the central Treasury? We have never understood why that happened.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </B>   I am not sure that it did happen. I believe that the noble Lord should address that question to the right honourable Mr. John Redwood. It may be that there was an underspend at the end of a particular year. However, the Barnett formula operated throughout the 18 years of the previous Conservative government and Wales had an increase under that formula year upon year.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-14_para1"></a>I believe that we heard the authentic voice of the English regions from the noble Lord, Lord Dean of Beswick. I am sure that we shall hear that voice further in future. It is very much with that thought in mind that we have adopted the form of words that the Committee sees in Amendments Nos. 205 and 206. We speak of,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"recognising the needs of Wales in relation to the United Kingdom as a whole". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-14_para2"></a>I do not believe that there is any fairer form of words.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-14_para3"></a>Although I agree with my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith that the clause is the ultimate in obscure legislative drafting, I cannot support him in his intention not to vote for Clause 82 stand part, for the simple reason that if we do not vote that the clause stand part the assembly will get no money at all. We have been confronted with that situation before in connection with the rate support grant. Although one may be very critical of the Government's proposal, there is no option but to vote for it; otherwise, the local authorities will get nothing.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-14_para4"></a>The Minister said that it would be wrong to incorporate the Barnett formula. I am inclined to agree with him. Nevertheless, his statements about the comprehensive spending review, as he called it, or the fundamental spending review, as my noble friend Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish called it, were not entirely clear. It is possible that such a review can affect the working of the Barnett formula. As the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, himself told us, the formula covers the situation where spending decreases as well as increases. It may very well be that the comprehensive spending review decides that too much is being spent in Wales on, say, health, in which case there may be an adverse effect on that area of spending through the operation of the Barnett formula.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-14_para5"></a>I am concerned that the inclusion of our words that require the Secretary of State from time to time, recognising the needs of Wales in relation to the United Kingdom as a whole, to make payments to the assembly out of money provided by Parliament should mean the abandonment of the Barnett formula. That gives me pause. Were that not to be the case I would divide the Committee on this issue.

<A NAME = "80609-14_para6"></a>expressed sympathy for the English regions, whereas when he sought to justify the argument at the outset he expressed sympathy with the needs of Wales.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-14_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Elis-Thomas: </B>   My noble friend referred to the Barnett formula operating in relation to a decrease in expenditure. Surely, a problem would arise if hypothetically the fundamental spending review proposed a reduction in health expenditure for England and there was a subsequent decline in the resources available for health in Wales hypothecated within the block as a result of that variance. That would be entirely against the health indicators as set out in the memorandum of the Welsh Office to the Treasury Select Committee. It is when the Barnett formula operates in a negative way that there are cuts if the needs of Wales are shown to be greater than the needs of England in a particular area. Health may not be a good example. The Committee will be able to think of a number of examples--one is education and perhaps a better one is road spending--where there may be a reduction in the Wales block as a result of the reduction in England which is carried through in percentage terms to a reduction in Wales.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-14_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   Perhaps the noble and learned Lord the Solicitor-General will permit me to probe slightly the question of the comprehensive spending review that is taking place. I believe that the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Dean, is a very important one. The comprehensive spending review might reveal that some of the English regions were at present disadvantaged. It might reveal that particularly the Scots and in some respects even the Welsh were advantaged. Let us suppose that as a result of that the Government decided to enhance expenditure in those English regions. That would enhance the volume of the English block. If that occurred and the Barnett formula was applied it would also enhance the Welsh and Scottish blocks and thereby defeat the purpose of the exercise. I believe that that illustrates the concern of the Committee about this particular area.

<P>
<A NAME="80609-14_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   In principle, the Barnett formula looks at changes in expenditure in England and applies formulaically that increase to Wales and Scotland. The comprehensive spending review involves looking at expenditure in all major departments of state. It means that there can be changes in the amount of such expenditure in England. The Barnett formula will then <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>be applied to that, as it has been for the past 20 years. There is nothing sinister or secret about it. Therefore, one can see precisely how it works.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-14_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   I think that this is probably the time that I should have asked the question that I did ask, namely what is the relationship between subsection (1) and subsection (2). In other words, what are the moneys in general which the Secretary of State pays to Wales at present and will in future pay to the assembly, and what relation does that have to the Barnett formula? And for subsection (2), which Ministers of the Crown make payment to Wales separately from the Secretary of State?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-14_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   There are certain payments that are made by the Secretary of State at the moment but will be made directly by the Secretary of State to the assembly after the assembly is set up. Clause 82(2) will include payments which do not come through the Secretary of State for Wales. These will include, for example, agriculture payments for the common agricultural policy which come through the intervention board and from MAFF. These are dealt with outside the block and Barnett formula arrangements. Payments made by the Secretary of State under Clause 82(1) will obviously be calculated using the Barnett formula. I hope that answers the question, but if there is any part I have not answered, I shall be more than happy to do so.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80609-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish </B>   moved Amendment No. 209A: 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 42, line 7, after second ("the") insert ("House of Commons and the").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80609-15_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: I beg to move Amendment No. 209A and with it to speak to Amendment No. 211A.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-15_para4"></a>These two amendments link Clauses 83 and 88. Clause 83 lays out quite clearly that each year the Secretary of State has to produce a written statement that shows how much money he intends to pay the assembly that year, how much other Ministers of government departments are expected to provide and any other sources of revenue to the assembly and other relevant financial information.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-15_para5"></a>This bringing together of the money which is to go to the national assembly of Wales, as I should properly call it, is to be laid out, interestingly enough, by the Secretary of State, who is not a member of the national assembly of Wales. The Secretary of State is to lay before the national assembly of Wales any statement made under this section, in other words a statement about the money which will be provided.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-15_para6"></a>I am adding in, as my amendment, that he should also lay that information before the House of Commons. The Minister may well say that that has already been done because the Votes laid before the House of Commons will contain all that information. But they will contain it in different and diverse places. It seems to me that if the Secretary of State is to go to the trouble of bringing this altogether in order to lay it before the assembly, it would not cause any additional work to lay it before the House of Commons. That seems to me to be a mild request. The information is already going before the House of Commons in the various Votes, but the bringing together would be important, especially as that bringing together is happening as far as the assembly is concerned. It is important that the Welsh Members of the other place--indeed all the Members of the other place--see how much money is going to the assembly.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-15_para7"></a>Clause 88 is linked to that money because it deals with the expenditure. On the one hand, Clause 83 tells us how much money is going to the assembly and then Clause 88 is a statement which lays out the expenditure of the assembly. Clause 87 deals with expenditure by the assembly, but it is Clause 88 that I am dealing with, which is the statement of that proposed expenditure. I have no quarrel with what the clause says. It quite rightly lays out that the assembly will have to know how the money is to be spent. Subsection (4) says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A statement under this section shall be published by the Assembly as soon after being made as is reasonably practicable". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-15_para8"></a>I am suggesting that when the assembly publishes this information it should also be laid before the House of Commons so that the House of Commons can see how much money it has voted in various Votes and has ended up in the Welsh assembly. It can also see how that money is being spent. I think that is wise. I am being careful here because I was reprimanded by the noble <P>


<a name="column_929"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 929</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, for attempting to take back powers from the assembly on the last Committee day. I am not doing that; I am just saying "inform the House of Commons". It will be informed about the amount of money it sends. I think it should also be informed properly about how that money will be spent. That seems to me to be logical. As the Secretary of State is doing the one partly, he should do the whole thing, and bring the House of Commons in.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-15_para9"></a>If that is not done and the justification for the expenditure is not laid out--because that is what I am asking for--here is this great pot of money. How will it be spent? That is how it is to be spent, and Members of the other place will be able to see that. I think it is important that Welsh Members of the other place can see that. They are rapidly going to become the forgotten men and women in Wales if they are not careful.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-15_para10"></a>It is also important that the other Members of the House of Commons clearly see, as we have said, why Wales is getting more money per head than England. I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Dean of Beswick, is not in his place because we have heard from him this afternoon, as we have already heard from other English regions--not just about Wales because I shall be looking at the same problem with Scotland--and we have heard it in London. Every person from wherever they come in this place who fancies himself as mayor of London is busy saying that the Scots and the Welsh are getting too much money.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-15_para11"></a>I believe that Scotland and Wales can show why their expenditure per head should be higher. I hope that one day we will be able to say that it no longer needs to be higher. That is an ambition which the previous government certainly had. They went a long way along the road to getting that income for Scotland and Wales increased. We brought new jobs and new prosperity to Scotland and Wales. But we have to be prepared in the future. It is not my doing that the United Kingdom is being partially broken up, but the more that happens the more people will look over the garden fence and ask "Why is Wales and Scotland getting this extra money?"
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-15_para12"></a>I believe we need to lay out the "whys" and "wherefores" as clearly as we possibly can. There is no better place to do that than in the other place. There is no better occasion than once a year, coinciding with the Statement made and published by the assembly about the various ways in which the money it has received will be spent. That is the right way to do it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-15_para13"></a>I have little doubt that there will be a few Members of the other place who will want to debate those issues. If the information is there, it will at least be an informed debate. If the information is not presented to the other place, it will be an uninformed debate. That will put Wales--we shall come to Scotland--in a poorer position with regard to the arguments with the rest of the UK, as there assuredly will be. There has always been a bit of argument. My noble friend Lord Crickhowell and I have been present when the Treasury tried to take back money from Scotland and Wales. They are not alone. The Treasury tried to take back money from every department. It does so under every government, if the gossip in the press is to be believed.

<A NAME = "80609-15_para14"></a>What one needs to fight the Treasury, and perhaps other parts of the Kingdom, is information. I do not believe that my amendments damage the Bill in any way.

<P>
<A NAME="80609-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell: </B>   My noble friend has, with great clarity, and with more thought than I have given to it, elaborated upon the demand that I made during the previous group of amendments. I set out my reasons then for saying that we should have clear presentation to Parliament so that there would be an absolute understanding of what the money was going for, in order to avoid conflict and not create it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-15_para15"></a>It is important that we should have openness. I did not challenge the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, who replied on that point, but his response about how the matter was going to be put to the other place was less than complete. If he has now had a greater opportunity to ponder upon the question, it would be helpful were we to have a clear statement as to how information is to be put to the assembly and Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-15_para16"></a>I would add just one further comment. It was prompted by the little aside made by my noble friend about the Secretary of State's role. As I have listened to the debate this evening, I have remembered again and again the extraordinary debate we had, many weeks ago now, about the remarkable possibility apparently being considered by the Government that the Secretary of State should also be leader of the assembly. Every time I hear the assembly's duty and the Secretary of State's duty being discussed, the more extraordinary a proposition I believe it to be. It is one to which I shall wish to return at a later stage.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Elis-Thomas: </B>   I try not to become provoked, but I have been provoked again by the noble Lord, Lord Mackay. Surely he is into second-guessing again. How much of the activity of and decisions taken in Cardiff Bay are to be second-guessed by Westminster in his scenario? As we have said before in our debates, this is a serious devolutionary measure, where responsibility for the allocation of resources, once transferred, lies with the elected people who will make those decisions. That is, once the block has been determined, subject to the variants of the Barnett formula and once it has been--to use the expression--sent down by the 125, it is Cardiff's allocation. If there are to be continual debates at Westminster second guessing the assembly's activities, that is a certain way of undermining it fiscally.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-15_para17"></a>As to the continual persistence by the former Secretary of State on the issue of Mr. Ron Davies, that is a red herring. If Mr. Ron Davies is to be elected, possibly by one member, one vote, as I read in the press by the Labour members in Wales, of whom there must be about 20,000, to become the assembly's first <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hooson: </B>   It is an extraordinary proposition that one should embody in a Bill such as this a clause that would require that information be provided to the other place. The other place is a sovereign body. This is the devolution of powers to a Welsh assembly. The suggestion that the 40 elected Welsh MPs and the Secretary of State for Wales would not give the information to the other place is ludicrous.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-16_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>   I hesitate to intervene in something of a family discussion as an outsider, although one with a great deal of sympathy for the Principality and the new Welsh assembly. I would utter one word of caution, because we in Northern Ireland, until now, when the UK has started to break up, had what was called a separate Appropriation Fund debate, usually twice a year. Colleagues representing hard-pressed regions of England, such as the north-east and north-west, invariably inquired why the headage contribution for Northern Ireland schoolchildren, people in hospital and road expenditure was more than that for their region.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-16_para0"></a>The Northern Ireland Members had to fight a rearguard action in which we said that it was not our fault that the housekeeping accounts were kept separately from those of Great Britain, whereas Northern Ireland had its own, wherein all was revealed. That might be an honest thing to do, but I issue one word of warning. It might bring down upon the heads of the Welsh representatives a degree of criticism from those areas of England which, as yet, do not have separate Secretaries of State.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 209A and 211A. Without amendment, the Bill provides that Supply will be dealt with by the other place; the other place can debate in extenso the amounts of money that will go to the Secretary of State for Wales in relation to the assembly. After Supply has been voted by the other place, the Secretary of State must then make deductions for the running of his own office and for the provision of the lord lieutenants of Wales.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-16_para1"></a>The Secretary of State then provides the net balance to the assembly. In providing the net balance to the assembly, he must make the written statement required by the Bill. The statement will set out the amounts of money available to the assembly, including credit approvals. The statement will explain how those amounts have been calculated; the calculations will of course be based on the block and formula rules, including the Barnett formula which was debated earlier. That will provide a reassurance to assembly members that the grant made available to them has been calculated correctly.
<P>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 932</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-16_para2"></a>The statement will, for the first time, make publicly available details underlying the Welsh block grant, and goes well beyond the current Vote arrangements. Those are principally issues, after Supply has been voted, for my right honourable friend the Secretary of State and the assembly. When the assembly has prepared its expenditure plans, it is obliged to publish the written statement required by Clause 88.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-16_para3"></a>As I understand them, the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, would provide that the Secretary of State would have to make his statement to the other place about the sums of money going to the Welsh assembly and, what is more, the Welsh assembly, before it tells itself what its expenditure proposals are, has to publish a statement to the other place, which, with the greatest of respect to the noble Lord, appears to involve a degree of not accepting devolution. Surely the Welsh assembly should publish to itself its expenditure programme rather than be forced to send it back to the House of Commons.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-16_para4"></a>The noble Lord's amendment suggests that he does not accept the principle of devolution but presupposes that everything, including the most important element of the assembly, should be supervised by the House of Commons. That is not what devolution is about. I invite the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-16_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   The noble and learned Lord introduces a red herring when he says that I want the House of Commons to supervise. If I had wished the House of Commons to supervise, I would have inserted the words "and approve". I did not insert those words but simply provided that the statement shall be laid before the House of Commons. If the order in Amendment No. 211A bothers the noble and learned Lord, I am happy to change it at the next stage of the Bill, to insert that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A statement under this section shall be published by the Assembly and laid before the House of Commons". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-16_para5"></a>I want the House of Commons to know what is happening to its money, rather than to approve or disapprove. The noble and learned Lord made it clear that supply would remain a matter for the House of Commons. Having accepted that, I do not see the problem with laying before the House of Commons the same statement that will be made to the Welsh assembly.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-16_para6"></a>I was not sure whether the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux of Killead, suggested that it was best to keep the matter so grey that no one can see through it, otherwise they will all start to complain. I can see some argument for that as regards the English regions. But we shall not get away with that. The noble and learned Lord could easily have argued that whether or not the statement is laid before the House of Commons, anyone who wants to know about it will find out. Unless the minutes of the Welsh assembly are to be secret--I do not believe that they will be--it will be easy for Members of another place to find out what has been laid before the assembly.

<A NAME = "80609-16_para7"></a>I do not see the problem. I say this to the noble Lord, Lord Hooson. If the House of Commons raises the taxes, then it has a right to be at least informed of the expenditure.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-16_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hooson: </B>   If the noble Lord will give way, surely he is consistently confusing two issues. This is an act of devolution, not of abrogating the sovereignty of the House of Commons. The noble Lord has been a Member of another place, as I have. He knows that there would be no difficulty at any time in raising questions that would disclose all the information before the assembly.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-16_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I am not sure that there is much between the noble Lord and myself except that I wish the information to be placed publicly in the House of Commons and he sees no problem in the House of Commons devilling around and finding it out.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-16_para8"></a>It is not a question of second guessing, as the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, suggested. It is simply informing the House of Commons where the totality of money is and how the Welsh assembly proposes in the headlines of its statement to spend it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-16_para9"></a>We shall come to this issue. I find it impossible to believe that the same person can be the Secretary of State for Wales in one government, with Cabinet responsibility, and the first secretary of another entirely separate government. I believe that that is a constitutional impossibility. However, at present it is a red herring that the noble Lord introduced. No doubt we shall discuss it later.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-16_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Elis-Thomas: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, introduced it. It is becoming an obsession with him.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-16_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I am not sure that it has become an obsession with my noble friend, but it is a matter to which we shall have to return. I cannot see how such a system can work. If it works--I hate to say it--it suggests to me that the Secretary of State from Whitehall will run this devolved assembly. That is total contradiction of devolution. My little amendments are as nothing compared with the suggestion that the Secretary of State for Wales should run the assembly. It does not bear thinking about. If noble Lords want devolution, that is not the way to go about it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-16_para10"></a>The issue is complicated and difficult. Not only shall I study what the noble and learned Lord said, although I heard it clearly enough, I shall consider again in particular Clause 83(3). It refers to the total amount which the Secretary of State proposes to expend in that year out of the money provided by Parliament. The provision is vague as to whether the proposal is in global terms or in detail.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-16_para11"></a>I shall return to the matter. I take on board some of the points made. I am reassured that the House of Commons will be able to discuss how its money is being spent. However, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME = "80609-16_para15"></a>The noble Earl said: Unfortunately, from time to time circumstances can change quite dramatically. In the course of this century we have had to go through two terrible wars to preserve our democracy; and in the 1930s we had the worst depression ever. My idea is to create some flexibility for the Secretary of State by allowing him to provide a greater or lesser amount of money. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-16_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   Amendment No. 210 seeks to allow the Secretary of State, with the consent of the Treasury, to raise or lower the total amount of loans he might make available to the assembly from the National Loans Fund.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-16_para16"></a>It may be helpful if I explain the purpose of Clause 84. The clause enables the Secretary of State to advance temporary loans from the National Loans Fund to the assembly. The Treasury will set the terms of the loans, including the repayment dates and interest rates. This power is necessary to meet such possibilities as a natural disaster in Wales, which requires the assembly suddenly to incur more expenditure than it had planned.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-16_para17"></a>The option of issuing a temporary loan to the assembly gives the necessary flexibility to meet circumstances such as these where the assembly's outgoings are greater than its income. But I stress to the Committee that the decision on whether to advance a loan would rest with my right honourable friend and the Treasury, not the assembly. The upper limit of &#163;500 million was decided by the Government, and also applies in the Scotland Bill. I stress that it is an upper limit, and a lower amount could be advanced in a particular case if the circumstances demanded.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-16_para18"></a>The value of money rarely, if ever, goes down and I do not believe that it would be appropriate to lower the &#163;500 million limit set down in Clause 84, which would be the effect of the noble Earl's amendment.

Can the time limit on such loans endure from financial year to financial year? Alternatively, must they be repaid within the course of the financial year in which they were originally made? It is a most important point. Loans could drag on for a long time. Is there any limit in the aggregate? Let us suppose that there is a loan of &#163;500 million in the aggregate in one financial year that is not fully repaid in the course of that financial year. Can the Secretary of State make a further loan which would take it over the &#163;500 million limit in the <P>

The precise repayment date within the financial year is a matter for the Treasury. The aggregate outstanding at any one stage cannot exceed &#163;500 million. I think that that answers all the noble Lord's questions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-17_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I do not think that it is. The relevant provision is Clause 84(3) which states that,
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "80609-17_para0"></a>That aspect is not on the face of the Bill but it is envisaged that loans will always be repayable in the financial year, and the aggregate cannot be more than &#163;500 million.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   If I heard the noble and learned Lord correctly, he told my noble friend Lord Rees that any money under subsection (1)(a)--because it is unlikely that there will not be a time when the assembly will need a working balance under subsection (1)(b)--would be for temporary excess expenditure. I understand the sort of reasons that may require a loan, when the government in Wales needs money for which it has not budgeted. I want to ask when that money will be paid back. The noble and learned Lord told my noble friend that every loan given would have to be repaid in the same financial year. If funds are given under subsection (1)(a), the problem for the assembly may be that it might exceed its expenditure for that year. I was surprised to hear the Solicitor-General say that. If at the end of the financial year any surviving unpaid loan remained, would that be taken off the top of next year's money as a more sensible way of dealing with crises? If the noble and learned Lord's answer to my noble friend is correct, that is fine--but I thought that the assembly would at the very least be able in special circumstances to repay a loan the following year; otherwise, the need for the loan may not be as urgent as I expected when I read the Bill.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-17_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Harrowby: </B>   It seems extraordinary to discuss this matter because such payments are by their very nature made in a crisis. The odds are that they will never be repaid but will have to be funded from the following year's budget or another source. Actual repayment will not be possible. Supposing there is a major earthquake or something like that, the money will be spent. Such loans can be funded only from another source and almost certainly at a later date, not the same financial year.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-17_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   It is envisaged that where there is an emergency of the sort that I described, by the end of the financial year in which the disaster has <P>


<a name="column_936"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>occurred and the need has arisen, the assembly will have the necessary funds to repay the loan--whether from a supplementary estimate or its own resources. That is the answer to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-17_spnew7"></A><B> The Earl of Harrowby: </B>   So the assembly would not repay the loan?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-17_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   It would, because there would be a supplementary estimate. The money would come from central government and would be repaid that way. The loan provision is a sensible way of making money available when one cannot go through the usual necessary procedure quickly because a national emergency of some sort has overtaken Wales.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-17_spnew9"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour: </B>   I am grateful for this short debate because I did not fully understand the meaning of Clause 84. I am grateful also to the noble and learned Lord for his explanation. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<A NAME = "80609-17_para2"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 84 shall stand part of the Bill?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-17_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I am grateful to the Solicitor-General for his response to the amendment of my noble friend Lord Balfour, which helped clarify the background, and for his letter to me, in which he explained the emergency purpose for which such sums are provided. I am still not wholly convinced as to the need for the clause.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-17_para3"></a>To cite local government precedent in respect of emergencies, it has for a long time operated under the Bellwin formula, whereby a local authority would be required to meet the first product of a penny rate itself. Thereafter, the Government would step in and meet expenditure pound for pound over and above that first sum. That is one way of managing things.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-17_para4"></a>The second problem is that we are dealing with an assembly that will have a budget of around &#163;7 billion. A competent county treasurer--and I assume that the national assembly will employ somebody superior to a competent county treasury--would expect to run his funds with a balance of between 2 per cent. and 3 per cent. at most. On occasion, treasurers have been squeezed down to between 1 per cent. and 2 per cent. The sum of &#163;500 million happens to represent 7 per cent. of budget. I accept that one might be dealing with a great emergency but I find it extremely difficult to conceive of an emergency on the scale that Clause 84 implies that would not involve the UK government immediately, as of necessity. So I have some difficulty with the need for the clause.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-17_para5"></a>Where will the &#163;500 million reside? Clearly it will not reside with the assembly, so presumably it will reside in the English Parliament and in the English Treasury, with the Secretary of State having a right to draw funds down in an emergency situation. I infer that the fund will be part of the Chancellor of the Exchequer's contingency reserve but I am not certain. It would be useful to know <P>


<a name="column_937"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 937</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>precisely where the &#163;500 million will reside. If it resides in the UK, its expenditure will have to be authorised automatically in emergency situations. If so, I am almost convinced that Clause 84 is not needed because the money will be provided anyway from funds that already exist elsewhere in the UK budget. I am sorry to trouble the Solicitor-General further but I must press him for a greater explanation.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-17_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   While my noble friend was talking, I realised that I had a second point to raise with the Solicitor-General. Let us assume that the government in Wales need extra money to meet some eventuality and a loan is granted. It is possible that the government in Wales might not be able to find the money from their budget to pay it back. In that case, the supplementary vote would be called into question, but that vote is of the other place. What would happen if the other place decided not to agree to give a supplementary vote? Would it be possible for the Welsh assembly to carry over the loan to its next financial year? If it is not possible to do that, would it be possible for the assembly to do a sleight-of-hand and obtain another loan in the following financial year in order to pay back the loan for the current financial year? In that circumstance, no loan would be carried over into the next financial year. I should be grateful for guidance on what the Government envisage in such a situation, which is new to this country. However, as my noble friend rightly reminded us, although the Bellwin formula caters for such similarities in local government, there must be a clear understanding of what will happen in the kind of eventuality I have put forward.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-17_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, indicated that the circumstances in which he thought the national loan fund would be called upon under Clause 84 were difficult to imagine and would be of an exceptional kind. We agree. It is a remote fall-back position. Indeed, it is unlikely that Clause 84 will ever be called upon. However, we believe that it is sensible to make such a provision. It would be an exceptional circumstance in which the assembly could not provide the money in the short-term. If in a substantial national disaster the assembly could not meet the cost, it would apply through the Secretary of State to the Treasury for a short-term loan in order to deal with the matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-17_para6"></a>The Government believe it entirely sensible to provide that fall-back arrangement, and it is difficult to see the arguments for not doing so. If the provision were not made, taking the advice of the lawyer of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, it would have to be written in. That seems to me to be a very silly circumstance indeed. One should prepare against the day, hoping that the provision will never be used. The noble Lord's comparison with local authorities is, with the greatest of respect to him and his experience, misconceived. The assembly does not have any tax-raising power, whereas local authorities have limited tax-raising powers. It is unlikely that the provision will be used, but it is sensible to make it.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-17_para7"></a>The point made by the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, amounted to asking what happens if the loan is made but the Commons does not agree to it. That is a risk that one must take, but having regard to the nature of the Treasury, one would imagine that it is unlikely to grant the loan unless it is sure that ultimately supply will be granted by way of a supplemental estimate. In effect, a bid is being made on the reserve, a reserve is being held in the National Loans Fund, and I suspect that the situation would be so unique that few people would doubt the correctness of such a loan being made.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-17_para8"></a>For all those reasons, the clause is sensible. It is right that the matter has been raised in the Committee and I hope that I have put everyone's mind at rest as to its "sensibleness".<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="80609-18_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I thank the noble and learned Lord for his explanation. Perhaps he will allow me to press him on a narrow point. I accept the generality of his argument, but the specific point which causes concern is how the &#163;500 million was arrived at. Clearly, it is an arbitrary sum. However, I am puzzled by the fact that the sum is the same for Scotland. As Scotland has double the budget, one might have assumed that the sums would be different.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-18_para0"></a>Perhaps the noble and learned Lord would prefer not to have to answer that question tonight. He might prefer to reply to it by letter, because it seems entirely unreasonable, if one looks at fairness and proportionality, that the two separate organisations should have the same fund for emergency purposes.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-18_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   It is an upper limit. When one is talking about remote and unforeseeable consequences, it is difficult to provide any mathematical or scientific basis. It simply seems to the Government to be a sensible figure to take for the upper limit. I can take the point no further. I shall not write to the noble Lord because that is as far as we can take it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   After dealing with important questions of public finance which the Committee has been canvassing, I feel diffident in raising a small drafting point on subsection (6). I feel all the more diffident because I have raised the matter previously in connection with other Bills without getting anywhere. But hope springs eternal in the legislative breast.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-18_para1"></a>Subsection (6) states:

<P>

<A NAME = "80609-18_para2"></a>The words "with the consent of the Treasury" are utterly unnecessary. They turn up in Bill after Bill and are repeated in subsequent editions and in the Acts. Cumulatively, enormous sums are expended quite unnecessarily. It is only in the Wonderland of Whitehall that a Secretary of State would exercise a statutory power to increase a limit on lending without the consent of the Treasury. The words are included in Bill after Bill <P>


<a name="column_939"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 939</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>simply as a sop to Treasury paranoia, which is terrified that spending Ministers are in some way subverting its strict regime.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-18_para3"></a>I invite the noble and learned Lord to say specifically whether he can conceive it possible that if the words were omitted the Secretary of State would increase the loan limit without consulting and obtaining the consent of the Treasury. That question can easily be asked and I invite the noble and learned Lord to answer it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-18_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   The noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, is right in saying that it is extremely unlikely that the Secretary of State would increase the limit without first obtaining the consent of the Treasury. Indeed, the Treasury controls all access to the loans fund and therefore it could be increased in practice only with the consent of the Treasury. But far from that being a reason for not including the words on the face of the Bill, surely it is a reason for including them. It means that the Bill sets out precisely what has to be done and who has to do it before the limit can be increased. Surely, accuracy in a Bill as to what is to happen is a good thing rather than a bad thing.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-18_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   We have at least been given a reason this time. All too often the reason has been that the words are not necessary or, as my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern used to say, "not strictly necessary". To include unnecessary words in order to make things quite plain is not good enough in drafting. If we were going to adopt that course we should mention every consultation between any two Ministers. No one suggests that we should do that, not even the noble and learned Lord. Therefore, if the words are unnecessary it is no good saying that that is all the more reason for including them. It is not; it is a reason for omitting them.

<A NAME = "80609-18_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a not very cunning and rather transparent attempt before supper to seek to enable the assembly to retain some resources which it might generate as a result of its own income-raising activities. That would provide it with a little entrepreneurial activity and give it some incentive. The sums that would result from the sale of goods and services by the assembly or on its behalf would not be substantial sums and not of the order set out in our earlier debate on emergencies. It would provide the assembly with a small source of income or revenue which would be of benefit to it in the carrying out of its services. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-18_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </B>   It seems to me that the noble Lord has a very fair point. The assembly will have goods of which it may wish to dispose as surplus to <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>requirements. It may also provide services for which it can charge. It would be a shame if all the proceeds disappeared into the Consolidated Fund.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-18_para8"></a>Perhaps I may introduce another item into this amendment; that is, property. I presume that if the assembly were to sell property, the proceeds of the sale would be retained, I hope, by the assembly.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-18_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   It may assist the Committee in considering Amendment No. 210A if I explain why Clause 86 is is in the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-18_para9"></a>The general effect of legislation is that receipts earned by the Crown have to be paid into the Consolidated Fund. The Treasury, however, has the power under the Public Accounts and Charges Act 1891 to direct that sums do not have to be surrendered but may be used as if voted by Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-18_para10"></a>Unfortunately, the provisions of the 1891 Act will not apply to the assembly because they relate only to government departments that prepare appropriation accounts. The assembly will not prepare appropriation accounts because it will obtain its funding from the Secretary of State and not directly from Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-18_para11"></a>Clause 86 is necessary both to make it clear that the assembly's receipts are to be surrendered to the Consolidated Fund but also to provide for certain exceptions. One of those exceptions, which is Clause 86(6), is a power for the Treasury to direct that the assembly does not have to surrender certain receipts to the Consolidated Fund, in just the same way as it can direct the Welsh Office not to surrender certain sums now. The underlying principle is to ensure that the assembly will be in no worse position than the Welsh Office is now.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-18_para12"></a>Amendment No. 210A makes the point that income from any goods and services that the assembly may provide must be retained by the assembly. However, the Bill can allow such income to be retained because it could be the subject of a direction under subsection (6). An example at the present time is the income which Cadw generates from entrance fees, sales of souvenirs and so on. Under a current Treasury direction, the Welsh Office is able to retain this income to help meet Cadw's running costs. These matters are better handled through Treasury directions, which have a flexibility that this amendment lacks. In view of my explanation, I invite the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-18_para13"></a>It goes without saying that the point that I have made in response to the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, applies also to the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy. Any property sold could be the subject of a Treasury direction which would permit the assembly to retain the receipts.

<A NAME="80609-18_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   These proposed amendments to Clause 87 should be seen in the context of Clause 41, which provides supplementary powers to the assembly to do anything which is intended to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the exercise of any of its functions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-18_para19"></a>The effect of the amendments would be to restrict the assembly's expenditure specifically to the functions of the assembly, or to the attainment of objectives within the competence of the assembly. So the amendments would apparently preclude expenditure on such incidental action, notwithstanding that the Bill authorises such action. Therefore, the assembly can do things incidental to its functions but cannot pay for them if these amendments are accepted.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-18_para20"></a>By tying its hands in that way, the assembly would not be able to support activities unless they were specified as functions, or linked to the attainment of objectives of the assembly itself. In this way, for example, the assembly would be unable to pay for the running costs of the assembly itself as this was not a function per se of the assembly. Nor would it be able to support the activities of another body which lay outside the direct competence of the assembly, but where the assembly had an important supporting role to play.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-18_para21"></a>I am sure that the Committee would wish the assembly to have greater flexibility than is allowed for in these amendments, consistent with Clause 41, and I invite the noble Lord to withdraw these amendments.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<BR>
("( ) Where in any year the Assembly proposes to vary the sums received from the Secretary of State relating to local authorities, it may do so only with the prior agreement of the Secretary of State and the local authorities.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80609-19_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 211 standing in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Northesk is an attempt to provide some degree of clarity and certainty in the financial arrangements between the Secretary of State for Wales, the national assembly for Wales and local government.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-19_para6"></a>The matter is not at all straightforward. At present, the financial arrangements for local government are the consequence, if I can call it this, of a bipartite negotiation with the Treasury as a shadowy third party in the background, probably operating a force majeure clause which no one really appreciates but which everyone has to accept exists.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-19_para7"></a>That negotiation is, perforce, very complicated. Mention has already been made of the distribution formula for local government moneys. It is rarely a negotiation which satisfies everyone. I have a strong suspicion that it does not satisfy the Secretary of State for Wales because of the force majeure operated by the Treasury, which is not a party to the negotiation. But now we are about to insert a third party into that negotiation process. The money will go from the Secretary of State for Wales to the assembly, which, as I understand it, has the power to adjust it. Otherwise, it would simply be a post-box and there would be no point in the exercise.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-19_para8"></a>Indeed, part of the purpose of my amendment is to enable the assembly to adjust that sum but also to ensure that it is a negotiated change involving the other two parties rather than, if you like, a power to change the arrangements which have been arrived at in quite a difficult way unilaterally. It is really how we change that negotiating situation from two or three parties to three or four parties that has given rise to the need for my amendment. Without it, we would have a situation where the current negotiations would be meaningless. It seems to me that those negotiations must go on because, in his turn, the Secretary of State has a negotiation going on in parallel with the Treasury to determine his funding which he will then hand back. It is quite a round-about situation.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-19_para9"></a>However, there is a complicating factor behind that negotiation; namely, that local government has its own tax raising powers. It is possible that the assembly could decide, as a matter of tactics, that it wished to adjust the funding that it receives by giving local government less. That would enable it to spend more elsewhere and, thereby, inadvertently, raise or compel additional taxation on the people of Wales. I am not saying that that is wrong and, similarly, I am not saying that the assembly should not do so. However, what I am saying by way of my amendment is that it should be an open negotiation in which everyone plays a part so that the outcome is agreed. It may not satisfy everyone as regards such outcomes; it will inevitably have to be a compromise and one which may well leave an element of distaste in every participant's mouth.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-19_para10"></a>As I said, my amendment is an attempt to clarify a change in a negotiating pattern so as to try to keep everyone in some degree of agreement--certainly the greatest degree of agreement possible--and, at the same time, give local government the greatest degree of certainty that is possible as to what its funding should be in this new situation. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </B>   I am grateful to my noble friend for explaining the purpose of his amendment and its background so clearly. It has been made abundantly clear that, unlike the Scottish parliament, the Welsh assembly will not have a tax varying power. Indeed, unlike Scotland, no such question was put to the Welsh people in the referendum. Therefore, the assembly will be largely dependent on the grants given to it by the Government under Clause 82.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-19_para11"></a>Nevertheless, the assembly will no doubt have its own priorities for expenditure and may find itself with inadequate resources to meet its proposed commitments. Naturally it will look for possible savings and other means whereby it may raise additional finance. One of the major areas of public expenditure financed by direct grant from the assembly will be local government which takes up about one-third of the Welsh block total of &#163;7 billion. Another third is taken up by health and personal social services where the pressure is for ever more expenditure and where there is very little scope to raise extra revenue while the service remains free at the point of delivery.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-19_para12"></a>Therefore, it would be surprising if the assembly did not consider the possibility of reducing its financial support to local authorities, thus forcing them to raise a higher proportion of their total expenditure from council tax and the business rate. The rate support grant has traditionally covered a higher proportion of the totality of local authority spending in Wales than in England because of the lower rateable values prevailing in Wales. Rate support grant is not hypothecated and its level is determined by the Secretary of State. It will be similarly determined by the assembly.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-19_para13"></a>My noble friend's amendment would simply require the assembly to secure the agreement of the Secretary of State and the local authorities before it varied the sums payable. That is very much in tune with the spirit of partnership between the assembly and local authorities that later clauses in the Bill seek to encourage. Local authority spending and the rate of council tax have been <P>


<a name="column_944"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 944</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>restrained in the past by central government control, coupled with rate capping. The business rate has also been constrained by central government.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-19_para14"></a>As the Secretary of State's functions in relation to local government are being transferred to the assembly, it looks as if the rate capping restriction on local authorities will come to an end. Indeed, as late as February of this year, the Secretary of State said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Certainly, I want to get away from the capping regime. I think that it is unhealthy ... as a Government we are opposed to the crude and universal system of capping".--[Official Report, Commons, 11/2/98; cols. 385-387.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-19_para15"></a>If the assembly were to reduce the rate support grant, local authorities could make up the shortfall by raising council tax rates. Of course, if rate capping were to be abolished, they could raise council tax rates anyway, and probably would.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-19_para16"></a>If the business rate were to return to local control and cease to be uniform, I fear that, as in the past when that situation prevailed, local businesses would bear the brunt of increased local authority spending. They would be discouraged from investing in and providing local employment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-19_para17"></a>If those things were to happen, one assumes that they would not go unnoticed by the Treasury. In the other place my colleagues tabled a new clause to stop the assembly forcing local authorities to raise their council tax without Treasury approval. However, as I said earlier, the Treasury's attitude towards the assembly appears to be one of withdrawal from the detailed supervision and concentration on the main spending allocations. An increase in council taxes would mean an increase in the general level of taxation in Wales and might breach the principle of Exchequer control over such matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-19_para18"></a>The key points that I have made were very well put by Robert Hazell of the Constitution Unit of the School of Public Policy at University College London in his commentary on the Welsh White Paper, issued in September of last year. He said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If the Assembly's budget is squeezed, it could in turn squeeze revenue support grant to local authorities, and rely on their capacity to increase levels of council tax to make up the difference". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-19_para19"></a>He goes on to explain that further. He says,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The only other variable source of revenue would be non-domestic rates. If these were returned to local authority control--as local government has demanded--there would be a greater capacity for the Welsh Assembly to precept because local authorities would have a stronger revenue base". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-19_para20"></a>He then makes the following interesting point:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"As with law making powers, the real issue behind revenue-raising power is one of autonomy ... if the principal purpose behind devolution is the more efficient administration of policies determined by central government, then it is appropriate for the Welsh Assembly to continue to be funded entirely through block funding. But if the Assembly is to have responsibility for making real choices about the level and nature of public spending in Wales it will need power to raise some of its own revenue. Without such power the Assembly will have no fiscal accountability to the Welsh people". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-19_para21"></a>I detected no strong demand during the referendum campaign for the assembly to have tax-raising powers or the fiscal accountability that goes with it. Nevertheless, it would seem to be an imminent possibility, although it seems strange in a country that requires fiscal support from central government rather than additional burdens <P>


<a name="column_945"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>placed on its people. My noble friend's minimal safeguards would appear to be the minimum necessary to keep the assembly's spending plans in check. Some of us would argue that primary legislation should be required before that kind of back-door taxation is allowed.

<P>
<A NAME="80609-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Elis-Thomas: </B>   The Opposition are yet again falling into this trap of seeking to give devolutionary powers and take them away. Let us introduce some realpolitik into this issue. Let us imagine a governing party or a governing coalition in the national assembly facing election at the end of the first four-year term on the same day as local government elections are held. In year three there will begin to be flexibility. Clearly there will be no flexibility up until year three because the current Welsh Office budget applies until then. As I said, flexibility begins to emerge in year three. As regards negotiations between the national assembly--which will take over from the Secretary of State responsibility for local government funding--and local government surely the various parties that will sit in the national assembly will tell the secretary for local government and environment and the members of the assembly subject committee on local government, "For goodness sake, make sure that you have a good settlement because remember we all face election next year". That is what fiscal accountability is all about. There will be fiscal accountability as regards the Welsh electorate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-19_para22"></a>Of course the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, can argue--he has been involved in discussions with Welsh local authorities--that this is back-door tax raising and an indirect taxation power, but surely devolution is all about granting the block, and the distribution of the block for local government, to the assembly and leaving the assembly to determine the interrelation between local government spending and its own spending, given that that all happens in the full light of day of a political process. That is what it is all about.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="80609-20_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, seeks in effect the agreement of the Secretary of State and local authorities before the assembly could vary the sums it receives from the Secretary of State relating to local authorities. I fear that the amendment starts from a misconception. The Secretary of State's grant to the assembly will not be hypothecated; in other words, the grant will not be allocated for a specific purpose. Therefore the assembly will receive no sums from the Secretary of State relating to local authorities. With the greatest respect to the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, the amendment starts from the wrong proposition.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para0"></a>But there is a much more important point than that the amendment starts from the wrong basis, and it is the point that the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, made so effectively. The assembly will get the money from the Secretary of State. It will be for it to decide how it spends its money. The amount of money that it gets from the Secretary of State will be determined in <P>


<a name="column_946"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 946</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>accordance with the block and then the application of the Barnett formula. Having got that money, the assembly will be a directly elected body which will be answerable to the electorate for the decisions it takes. It will be answerable to the electorate of Wales in a much more direct way than the Secretary of State for Wales.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para1"></a>It would be quite wrong to seek to fetter the assembly's resource allocation decisions in the way that the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, suggests. Moreover, with the greatest respect to him, I suspect that his proposal would simply lead to chaos, where the local authorities, the Secretary of State and the assembly would all have to agree the expenditure of each penny. That seems to me an ambitious target having regard to all of the people involved. For those three reasons--namely, it starts from the wrong basis; it is fundamentally opposed to the basic principle of devolution; and it is impractical--I respectfully ask the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for his explanation. I may well take his advice. However, it is easy to over-simplify what is happening. I am quite prepared to accept that the assembly is taking over the function of the Secretary of State in this regard, and therefore that the negotiation will in future take place between the local authorities in Wales and the assembly. I have no difficulty with that. That is easy to understand. However, it leaves me with a problem. The Secretary of State will, of course, make a block grant to the National Assembly for Wales. He will have to arrive at that sum which will be made up of many parts. Those parts--hypothecated or not--must have an origin somewhere. Unlike the &#163;500 million figure that I was so concerned about a little while ago--which is an arbitrary sum--the one-third or so of the budget of the National Assembly for Wales relevant to local government will be arrived at through a distribution formula (which is a sophisticated and complex distribution formula) which relates, I assume, to that of England and Wales. I have not yet heard that although Wales has a separate negotiation it has a separate distribution formula.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para2"></a>Although I am quite happy with the fact that this negotiation will in future take place between local government and the assembly, the fact of the matter is that the sum of money will originally have been arrived at through the application of a formula. That is not hypothecated and the parties concerned will negotiate something else, but that formula applies different results to different authorities. Therefore the matter will not be straightforward. I shall need to consider further what the noble and learned Lord has said, as I hope he will consider further what I have said. We may need to return to this matter at a later stage of the Bill. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para8"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, I am grateful to those noble Lords who are attending the debate. I am particularly grateful to those who have indicated an intention to participate. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the subject while there is still time to influence the outcome.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para9"></a>When future historians are asked what was the outstanding achievement of the 20th century, I believe that very near to the top of the list will be the establishment of a regime of international law and order and the concept of an international community.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para10"></a>There is still a long way to go. National sovereignty is still cited when a nation state is called to account for the damage which its activities have imposed on the global community. But we now have in place a wide system of treaties and conventions imposing obligations on individual states and a network of bodies to regulate activities on a global scale and to attach some sanctions to those obligations.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para11"></a>Even the most powerful nation states--those which are aggressively conscious of their national sovereignty--now operate within a framework of constraints which would have been inconceivable at the beginning of this century. Unhappily, the 20th century has also witnessed horrific crimes against individuals, often on a massive scale.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para12"></a>Among the last of the no-go areas where the writ of the international community does not run is the right of a nation state to protect its individual nationals from accountability to the international community, even when they have been guilty of actions which they must know infringe worldwide standards of morality and which are a flagrant infringement of international convention.
<P>


<a name="column_948"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 948</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para13"></a>Since the 1940s, when the world community, speaking through the United Nations, declared genocide to be outlawed, there have been discussions as to the creation of an effective global system of criminal sanctions applied to individuals and administered by an international criminal court. Tribunals established ad hoc to deal with a particular situation such as Nuremburg, and more recently Croatia and Rwanda, are susceptible to taunts that they present victors' justice and do not carry the authority of a court which is already in place administering an accepted system of substantive and procedural law.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para14"></a>In 1989, the General Assembly instructed the International Law Commission to prepare a draft statute for the establishment of an international criminal court. It returned with a text in 1993. But the assembly could not reach agreement. A number of states declared that they could not see the need for such a court. Then the assembly established an ad hoc committee, open to all United Nations members, to draft a treaty giving effect to the statute.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para15"></a>The committee has done a great deal of work, seeking where possible to overcome the objections of states whose consciences have told them that their nationals might find themselves before the court. The committee has been greatly assisted by members of the NGO community, who have provided a high degree of expertise. In particular, I am grateful to the Coalition for an International Criminal Court, consisting of a number of leading NGOs in this country, for keeping me up to date with developments. I also wish to express my thanks to Assistant Professor Hays Butler of Rutgers University for his valuable bibliography on the subject. Next month, it is hoped that a draft text of the statute will be put to a gathering of national representatives in Rome.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para16"></a>The progress that has been made should be an occasion for rejoicing. But at this moment that would be premature. There are three possible outcomes from the Rome discussions. We may present history at the close of the 20th century with a great step towards a safer and more just world; or there may be no agreement and no court; or they may cobble together a compromise which enables them to announce the establishment of a new court but which in fact is without teeth and without the power to curb the atrocities and suffering which we have seen in Bosnia and Rwanda. There will be some hard bargaining in Rome.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para17"></a>Among the questions which remain to be decided is whether prosecutors shall be independent, able to decide on jurisprudential criteria as to whether a prosecution shall be initiated or whether it should require the consent of the state to which the accused belongs or the state in whose territory the alleged crime took place. One United Nations official is quoted in a recent article in the Guardian as saying that if you kill 100,000 people you are more likely to escape justice than if you kill one.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para18"></a>A possible compromise may be to make prosecution subject to the consent of a chamber of the court at a pre-trial hearing. That would operate as a safeguard against frivolous prosecutions, although if we may assume that the prosecutors who are appointed will be <P>


<a name="column_949"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 949</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>responsible and trustworthy individuals, frivolous prosecutions are not likely. I should be grateful to hear my noble friend's comments on that question.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para19"></a>Then there is the role of the Security Council. Should it have power to stop a prosecution and, if so, for what reasons and on what grounds; or should the constraint go further, and a prosecution require the positive consent of the Security Council before it can proceed--bearing in mind that that would require unanimity so that a single member could veto any prosecution. In a world which now believes itself subject to the rule of law, is there a place for a veto on prosecutions by a political body?
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para20"></a>Thirdly, what is to be the interface between national domestic jurisdictions and the international court? No one wants to duplicate prosecutions, and there may well be problems of double jeopardy. But can a nation state be permitted to exclude the jurisdiction of the court simply by initiating a show trial designed to produce a whitewash? Surely the final decision on whether there is an effective national jurisdiction should be with the international court. Perhaps my noble friend will tell us the Government's thinking on what has come to be called by a new word which is not likely to find its way into any poetry books--"complementarity".
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para21"></a>A fourth question is whether the court will have power to operate and enforce a reparations regime to compensate victims. The criminal courts of this country have power when someone is convicted of a criminal offence not only to pass sentence on the offender but to order him to pay compensation to the victim. It is part of the process of bringing home to the offender the loss that his conduct has caused and of reassuring the victim that the community understands the injury that he has suffered. The draft statute makes reference to the United Nations Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and to the reparations guidelines. I am grateful to Redress for reminding me of the issue, and I look forward to my noble friend's comments on that matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para22"></a>To date, the Government have a good record in these discussions. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary has done great service to the reputation of this country among those who care for human rights and who value the rule of law. But on all these issues there will be a need for a clear statement from the United Kingdom and for a leadership which, if it does not come from this country, is unlikely to come from the western hemisphere. I hope that my noble friend can assure us that the Government will seek to secure for the 20th century a place in history as a period of compassion, of the control of power and of respect for the rule of law.

<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para23"></a>There was a certain poignancy, two weeks ago, to find oneself reading the obituaries of that outstanding American war crimes prosecutor, eminent lawyer, <P>


<a name="column_950"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 950</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>historian and human rights activist, Telford Taylor, who died on 23rd May at the ripe old age of 90. He must have thought it sad, perhaps intolerable, that 50 years after the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials and all that should have been learned from them, there was still no permanent court to try and to punish the perpetrators of the kinds of crimes that had so horrified the world at that time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para24"></a>It is an irony that might have brought a wry smile to Telford Taylor's lips that, three weeks after his death, the international community is finally sitting down to negotiate the international human rights treaty which will set up an international criminal court. When 185 nations gather in Rome next week, they will, we hope, put an end to this unacceptable situation in which for so long the myth of impunity has unbalanced the scales of justice.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para25"></a>We are here tonight to seek assurances from Her Majesty's Government that during these difficult negotiations they will not only continue to support strongly the creation of the court, which they have done so far and on which I congratulate them, but that they will insist on its unassailable independence.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para26"></a>My noble and learned friend Lord Archer has very well described the intended remit of the international criminal court. It is hard to conceive how any modern democracy could wish otherwise than to see established a permanent tribunal to bring to justice the perpetrators of genocide and crimes against humanity. We cannot for ever rely on the kinds of ad hoc arrangements such as the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague, which the war crimes in the former Yugoslavia made necessary, or the Arusha tribunal for Rwanda. I do not criticise the work that they have done, but they are ad hoc arrangements, and we need a permanent court.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para27"></a>The negotiations have proved, and continue to prove, extraordinarily difficult. As my noble and learned friend indicated, one reads that there are still 1,700 square brackets to be removed from the texts. From my days at the United Nations I remember how square brackets used to keep us up all night and how difficult they sometimes are to get removed. In this case, the devil is not just in the detail. The key question of the independence of the court is still on the table, and that is what I wish to address in the remainder of my brief remarks.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para28"></a>The international criminal court must be an impartial, independent and legitimate court. If it is not, it will be useless and one would then be forced to agree with Amnesty International's sad opinion that no international criminal court would be better than a weak international criminal court.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para29"></a>It has, of course, to be a United Nations body, for only the United Nations can invest it with the international legitimacy and authority which it must have. What is clearly not acceptable is that its status as a UN-created body should confer any licence on the Security Council or any UN member state to interfere in its operations.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para30"></a>That raises the question, also raised by my noble and learned friend Lord Archer, of the independence of the court's prosecution service. The court's chief prosecutor should have the right to initiate investigations on his or her own initiative, based on whatever sources are accessible, and subject only to the appropriate scrutiny by <P>


<a name="column_951"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 951</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a chamber of the court's own judges. That should maintain the court's independence, while deterring politically motivated or frivolous investigations.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para31"></a>However, if reports are to be believed, there are some states, such as France, the United States, China and Russia, which insist that no investigation can be triggered unless and until the Security Council refers the matter to the court. That is unacceptable. The court cannot be kept subordinate to the Security Council. Those who claim that it should be argue that it is the only way to prevent ill-advised prosecutions from interfering with the council's primary task of maintaining international peace and security. They further argue that crimes should, where possible, be dealt with by the state in which they are committed, with the international court as a last resort. We know what the problem is when it is left to the state to decide whether a prosecution should be brought. These are weak arguments.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para32"></a>Maybe others who know the issues better than I do can correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that Singapore has put forward a compromise which would permit the Security Council to decide, on a vote, to bar the court from involving itself in an area of conflict already on the council's agenda. I should like to ask my noble friend the Minister whether that is acceptable to Her Majesty's Government. I fear that it is, but I rather hope that it is not. It is the foot of interference in the door of independence, and in time that door will simply be pushed open wider and wider. I hope that Her Majesty's Government will not feel in any way intimidated by the fact that other permanent members of the Security Council appear to disapprove even of the Singapore compromise for just the opposite reasons and want the council to give positive approval for any and every prosecution in areas of active interest to the council.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para33"></a>The Rome negotiations may well be the last opportunity we have to fill a most glaring gap in the armoury of world justice. We must not allow a weak, half-hearted solution to emerge. As Telford Taylor memorably declared:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There are some universal standards of human behaviour that transcend the duty of obedience to national laws". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para34"></a>It would be a fitting recognition of his high principles if a permanent international court were established that would ensure that a failure to live up to those universal standards of human behaviour would be impartially judged and appropriately sanctioned by the international community. That can only be realised if the court is truly impartial and not in any way subject to political interference.

<A NAME = "80609-20_para35"></a>He had genocide in mind, and so it is hoped that the establishment of an international criminal court will ensure that humanity's response to genocide will be swift and just. It is 50 long years since the United Nations first recognised the need for an international criminal court to prosecute crimes such as genocide, with the court being referred to as the missing link in the international legal system. I can only partly agree; much else needs to be done, in my view.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para36"></a>It is true to say that too often acts of genocide and gross violations of human rights go unpunished and a practical need for such a court, recognising that the Court of Justice only handles cases between states, could well be a practical necessity.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para37"></a>Fundamental questions of a practical nature, however, must be asked. What law is the court going to apply? What states will be agreeing to it? What procedure will it be following? What will be the standard of proof? How will penalties be determined and applied and what will be the appeals process? And, more generally, to what extent will the court, whilst serving principled aspirations, purely be an ineffective vehicle for practical realities?
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para38"></a>The world now faces a multitude of differing odious crimes. There is a fundamental united desire for the majority of those crimes to be addressed by all civilised states in order to bring the perpetrators to justice.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para39"></a>I would not necessarily limit the court to genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. It could, under certain circumstances, relate to drugs, terrorism, asylum, corruption, child abuse, whether bonded labour or pornography--the list goes on.

<A NAME = "80609-20_para40"></a>I accept that Trinidad and Tobago did make a start in 1989, through the General Assembly, by asking the International Law Commission to resume work on an international criminal court to include drug trafficking. What happened in that regard? The court, as being considered, might be too cumbersome an institution to refer or determine such equally malodorous matters, facing a constant conflict between national legislation weighed against its ideals.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para41"></a>Is not there a real case to be made for a more harmonised approach among members states towards national legislation, which would ensure general and more consistent standards, and one would therefore hope enforcement, as felt generally applicable.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para42"></a>I do not wish to go too wide of the Question of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer. But two examples come to mind where a common approach to national legislation would be beneficial, and could be in tandem as establishing an international court, so as to give the court real teeth through being effective and able to deliver a rapid response.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para43"></a>The first example has an immediate relevance given that our Home Secretary is going to make a statement before the Recess on matters relating to corruption. In addition, the noble Baroness, Lady Chalker--who is not in her place--recently sent around a note expressing concern about the,

<A NAME = "80609-20_para44"></a>By coincidence and extension, I am considering the merits of a private Member's Bill to address the broad responsibility of British multinationals abroad covering a wide range of environmental and human rights issues, which would also take in issues of corruption. The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1998 initiated talks between many countries, including the United Kingdom, with the object of agreeing on common legislation to combat bribery and corruption of public officials in international business transactions. And again, in the area of terrorism, we all know that organisations and individuals based in the United Kingdom are funding or otherwise aiding terrorism outside the United Kingdom, generally making this country a safe-haven.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para45"></a>So again we can turn to the United States. Under a 1996 law relating to anti-terrorism legislation, it is a criminal offence to provide funds or other forms of material support or resources to designated foreign terrorist organisations. I hope our Ministers are considering a similar approach, as failure to do so would not be targeting the nub of the problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para46"></a>Finally, the partly misunderstood, outgoing Colombian President, who has been in the front line in the fight against drugs, has long advocated greater global co-operation in the fight against criminal organisations. One of his proposals, in a speech to the United Nations, referred to the need to reach global agreement on judicial co-operation that would include judicial reciprocity and assistance in the exchange of evidence, judicial seizure of assets derived from drug trafficking, terrorism, and extradition.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para47"></a>So the case, in summary, would be to proceed with the international court, but also to work as a matter of urgency to harmonise national legislation, with a view to the future dismantling of intra-regional borders, and then to get on and put all the world's ills to right.

<A NAME="80609-20_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   My Lords, the commitment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, to international affairs and international justice is of long standing and I thank him for raising this issue tonight.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para48"></a>In the latter days of the Second World War the name of Belsen was branded upon my mind, young though I was. As the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, pointed out, those who were closely involved in the liberation of those camps and who, like Telford Taylor, were involved in the Nuremberg trials, must have believed that horrors on that scale could never happen again. The United Nations organisation was to be the safeguard of collective security and the Genocide Convention, adopted on 9th December 1948, must have appeared at that time to be a potent weapon to deter the war criminal and the mass murderer.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para49"></a>In its judgment the Nuremberg tribunal said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"crimes against international law are committed by men and not by abstract entities and only by punishing individuals who commit such crimes can the provisions of international law be enforced". <P>

<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para50"></a>Thus it was that the 1948 convention recognised that genocide could be committed by constitutionally responsible rulers, by public officials or by private individuals and the principle of individual criminal responsibility and accountability against all persons who commit acts of genocide was then established. It is the foundation of the draft code formulated by the International Law Commission in 1996 at the request of the General Assembly. It applies equally, without any exception, against anybody through the governmental hierarchy or the chain of military command all the way down to the private citizen.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para51"></a>Yet genocide has not been stopped. The optimism has not been fulfilled. Cambodia lost 2 million lives in the killing fields; Bosnia devised ethnic cleansing; the scale of the original genocide in Rwanda could barely be grasped. Saddam Hussein was responsible for attacks upon his own citizens, the Kurds and the Marsh Arabs. And perhaps on this very day in Kosovo, in the Great Lakes of Africa and in Algeria the killing, raping and torturing of civilians continues. Law is meaningless unless it is enforced.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para52"></a>Hence the vital importance of the Rome Conference to commence on Monday next. Many thought it would be 50 years before an international criminal court could come into being. But there has been progress. The preparatory committee, which held its sixth and final session at the United Nations headquarters in New York in March and April, was able to adopt a draft statute for the establishment of the court. The Rome Conference will, it is to be hoped, finalise and approve a convention for setting up the court. It hopes to produce a draft which can be submitted to the General Assembly for approval and adoption later this year.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para53"></a>Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General, has already been quoted. But I do not apologise for quoting his words again. He said this further:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In the prospect of an International Criminal Court lies the promise of universal justice. That is the simple and soaring hope of this vision. We are close to its realisation. We will do our best to see it through to the end. We ask you to do yours, to ensure in our struggle that no ruler, no junta, no State, no army anywhere can do anything to abuse human rights with impunity. Only then will the innocents of distant wars and conflicts know that they too may sleep under the cover of justice; that they too have rights and that those who violate those rights will be punished". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para54"></a>The United Nations is well served by its Secretary-General.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para55"></a>Perhaps I may address some of the core issues raised by your Lordships, matters which will have to be determined. There is the question of jurisdiction to consider. The noble Viscount, Lord Waverley, asked what law would be applied. The court should have jurisdiction over genocide as defined in the 1948 convention, committed in times of both peace and war; other crimes against humanity, when committed on a systematic basis or large-scale murder; extermination; the forced disappearance of persons; torture; rape; enforced prostitution and other sexual abuse. Justice for women in that regard must be at the forefront of the court's responsibilities. The court should also have jurisdiction over arbitrary deportation across national frontiers and the forcible transfer of population within national frontiers. Other crimes that the court should cover include arbitrary detention, enslavement, <P>


<a name="column_955"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 955</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>persecution on political, racial, religious or other grounds. One has only to go through the catalogue of those crimes to realise how grave an issue faces the proposed international criminal court.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para56"></a>It should also have jurisdiction over serious violations of humanitarian law in international and non-international armed conflict. There should be no threshold, no requirement that the violations of humanitarian law in either type of conflict were part of a plan or policy or part of a large-scale commission of such crimes. There is much work to be done.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para57"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer of Sandwell, when introducing this Question, referred to consent to prosecution. A requirement that the consent of any state is needed before any investigation can commence will wreck the effectiveness of the court, whether it be the consent of the state which has the custody of the suspect or the accused, or the state where the offence occurred; or the state of the accused or of the victim's nationality. The purpose of the court is not to supplant the national jurisdiction of any court, but to step in when it perceives that the organs of a particular state have completely collapsed, as happened in Rwanda; or that the political will to bring offenders to justice is lacking, as has happened, regrettably, in Bosnia. The court must therefore have an inherent jurisdiction without the requirement of consent. It must have universal jurisdiction--that is to say, the right to prosecute any individual wherever in the world a crime is committed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para58"></a>As regards defences, none can be allowed to be introduced to these crimes which are prohibited by international law, such as superior orders, duress or anything that weakens the principles of individual criminal responsibility. That is the principle to which I referred in the judgment of the Nuremberg tribunal.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para59"></a>As for the independent prosecutor, he is the only truly effective person who can ensure that all cases which should be brought before the court are in fact brought. An independent prosecutor should be able to initiate investigations of any crime within the court's jurisdiction on his or her own initiative, based on information from any source, and also to present search and arrest warrants and indictments to the court for approval without the interference of any state.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para60"></a>There is a precedent. The prosecutors of the international criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda have these powers. Referrals and state complaints should only be a supplement to other sources for the prosecutor. Both the Security Council and states are political bodies and they may, if they so choose, select situations for investigation on political rather than legal grounds.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para61"></a>So it follows that no political body, including the Security Council or the state, should have the power to stop or even delay an investigation or a prosecution under any circumstances whatsoever. There is no legitimate ground under international law or morality to obstruct justice by stopping or delaying investigations of crimes of genocide and so on. Any delays in an investigation permit the memories of witnesses to fade and facilitate the destruction of evidence and the <P>


<a name="column_956"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 956</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>intimidation of witnesses. No state should be allowed to introduce statutes of limitation for these crimes because that would mean that the international community could not investigate or prosecute persons who have successfully evaded justice for a prolonged period of time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para62"></a>There are other issues that need to be addressed such as victim protection and the question of a fair trial. Any trial before the international criminal court must be held in accordance with the highest international standards at all stages of the proceedings. As regards finance, the experience of the Yugoslavia and Rwanda ad hoc tribunals demonstrates that an international court must receive stable and adequate finance and human and technical resources to ensure that it functions effectively.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para63"></a>In the absence of a permanent international court, the perpetrators of atrocities may believe that they will go unpunished. The history of the 20th century shows that, by and large, they have been right. The will to set up ad hoc tribunals is lacking and, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, pointed out, the complaint arises with ad hoc tribunals that it is the victors who are punishing the vanquished with laws promulgated after the event. For heads of state, commanding officers and for the lowliest platoon Mai Lai commander and for the so-called freedom fighters, the likelihood of condemnation and punishment is the only deterrent against acts of violation and barbarism. Genocide, ethnic cleansing, rape and murder must earn condign punishment, swiftly and fairly administered. This is a step forward. One hopes that the Rome Conference will come to a final conclusion and put into the hands of the international community a potent weapon.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para64"></a>Yesterday I became a grandfather for the first time. I held my new grandson in my arms realising that he will have a life expectancy of some 80 years up to the year 2080. I thought to myself, as I was preparing this speech for your Lordships, let us hope that he does not have to face and deal with the sort of problems that have afflicted us and our generation at this time.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-20_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   My Lords, I should like to join those of your Lordships who have congratulated the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer of Sandwell, on introducing this debate at such an important moment in the development of an international court of criminal justice.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para65"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, quite rightly referred to Mr. Telford Taylor and the crucial contribution he made at the Nuremberg trial. I believe that it is also appropriate tonight that we should remind ourselves of the immense contribution that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Shawcross, has made to what I hope will happen in the middle of this month, not only as Attorney-General at the time of Nuremberg but also constantly since then in advocating the outcome that we all fervently hope will take place.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para66"></a>I suppose that there are at least three vital reasons why we ought to set up an effective international court of criminal justice. The first is quite simply to make sure <P>


<a name="column_957"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 957</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that the perpetrator of evil faces up to the consequences of what he has done; and, if convicted, spends the rest of his life behind bars.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para67"></a>The second reason is that the existence of an international criminal court will be a deterrent to people who contemplate committing crimes like genocide and crimes against humanity; although I should remind your Lordships that that will only be true if the court enjoys an effective system to bring the alleged offender before it. For example, if we look at the court which is dealing with the events that took place in Bosnia, we have to come to the sad conclusion that the real reason why that court is not effective is not its composition but the absence of any effective mechanism for getting the accused in front of it. Unless in two weeks' time the right decisions are taken in Rome about that, however elegantly the jurisprudence is defined in the draft documents and however well designed is the court itself, it will be a futile exercise.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para68"></a>The third reason why the court will be important is that unless the perpetrators of war crimes are brought to justice, the societies in which the atrocities happened will never come to terms with those events. Again, from what is happening in Bosnia it is clear that that is so. There will never be reconciliation to the events in Bosnia until the people who committed the crimes there are brought to justice.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para69"></a>I entirely agree with what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, said about the importance of getting the procedure right in the court. A remark attributed to Winston Churchill was that the strength of the protection of the criminal accused is the mark of a civilised society. That must apply equally to an international society just as to a national society. However, it is equally true that unless we get the mechanisms right for bringing the accused to the court, the procedures alone, however good, will not get us any further down the road to success.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para70"></a>I wonder how carefully the Government have thought this through. What happens if a nation state in which a crime has been committed refuses to yield the suspect? What remedies do the Government have in mind to recommend to the drafting convention? Would they, for example, consider giving powers to the Security Council to implement any request for the accused to be brought before the criminal court? Would a government, if necessary, use force to ensure that a suspect within their jurisdiction is brought before the court?
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para71"></a>What of the crimes themselves? Will the Government consider including the crime of aggression in the range of crimes that will be adjudicated upon? One of the most important reasons why the Nuremberg trial was able to bring individuals such as Generals Jodl and Keitel to justice was the existence of the war crime of aggression in the terms of reference at Nuremberg. One of the reasons why we have not been able to bring Mr. Milosevic to justice is that the war crime of aggression was not included in the list of crimes under the jurisdiction of the Yugoslav court.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para72"></a>What attitude will the Government take? There are those who think that, if aggression is included, there should be a veto by the Security Council on whether the <P>


<a name="column_958"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 958</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>court can go ahead with the prosecution. Others believe that even if the court ought to go ahead with a such a prosecution, at any particular moment, were it to become politically embarrassing, the Security Council ought to be able to call a halt to it. What is the Government's attitude to that? Indeed, what attitude will the Government take to political interference generally in the activities of the court? Several noble Lords have made that point. Will the Security Council have some sort of veto either ex ante or in the course of an investigation or prosecution? What role should a nation state be able to play in deciding whether a prosecution should start or whether to stop it in course?
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para73"></a>All of those matters are crucial to whether an international court of criminal justice will be a success. I entirely agree with what all noble Lords have said about the importance of the independence of the prosecutor. I wonder whether we have investigated sufficiently carefully whether the role of the investigator and the prosecutor should be under the same head. In this country investigations are conducted by the police but prosecutions are conducted by the Crown Prosecution Service. Should there be a distinction between the functions of investigation and of prosecution in the international criminal court? Have the Government considered that? If so, what is their approach?
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para74"></a>Ought the crimes to apply internally within states as well as between states? What of the case of Iraq and the initiative by my right honourable friend Mr. John Major in establishing safe areas? The Government have taken a bold initiative on the existing problems in Kosovo. Does that mean that they will support the jurisprudence and jurisdiction of the international criminal court with respect to war crimes committed by a leader in his own state?
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para75"></a>Even if we get all of those questions right, we should be under no illusions about the role that such an international court of criminal justice can play in international society. It would be a great mistake to use the existence of an international criminal court as an excuse for not doing anything else about wrong-doing. There is no substitute for collective security in the world in which we live at the moment. I am sad to say that even if there had been an international criminal court in the 1930s, I very much doubt whether it would have acted as a deterrent to Hitler.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para76"></a>So, when we are facing the present crisis over Kosovo, it is crucial that this time, as we failed so lamentably to do at the time of the siege of Vukovar, we recognise that the only response in the circumstances of today which can possibly stop what is happening there is force.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para77"></a>I trust that when the noble Lord replies, he will give me the answers that I wish to hear.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-20_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I too am grateful to my noble and learned friend Lord Archer of Sandwell for the opportunity to debate this important topic and for the deep personal knowledge and commitment that he brings to it. This is, indeed, a key time for us to be <P>


<a name="column_959"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 959</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>debating this issue. As noble Lords have said, the draft treaty will be discussed on Monday of next week in Rome. The United Kingdom will be there both in the guise of the EU presidency, represented by my honourable friend Mr. Tony Lloyd, and as the UK Government. It is important that that conference succeeds.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para78"></a>I have listened to all the points made and it is clear that all in the Chamber agree that the time is right for a permanent international court. Public opinion supports it. Sadly, the most appalling atrocities continue to be perpetrated around the world and, by and large, the world media bring them to our attention. The international community has responded in two of the worst cases by setting up the ad hoc tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda. However, as those tribunals demonstrate, there is clearly a need for an institution that is able to act quickly wherever such heinous crimes are committed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para79"></a>The Government are strongly in favour of the establishment of an effective international court, designed to try crimes of the most serious nature. We see the creation of an effective court as a key component of the Government's policies on human rights, the upholding of international humanitarian law and the prevention of conflict. The Government have played an active part in the negotiations on the establishment of the court. We have sought to give an early lead to others through the publication of a policy paper, which was laid before this House and another place in February.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para80"></a>We subsequently held a meeting of EU experts in February. We have contributed a substantial sum to the UN Trust Fund to assist representatives of the least developed countries to attend the conference in Rome. We have worked closely with the NGO community, which understandably has a close interest in the establishment of the court. I pay tribute to its efforts in this area.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para81"></a>We are not yet there. There is still much to resolve at Rome, as my noble friend Lord Grenfell indicated. The text contains many square brackets. The more sensitive topics still under discussion include which crimes should fall within the jurisdiction of the court; how investigations are initiated; whether prior consent is needed by state parties before an investigation can take place; the role of the Security Council; and the question of how the court should be funded. Most of those issues have been raised by noble Lords.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para82"></a>We recognise that most of the nations of the world operate within the rule of international law but we need a new instrument for three main reasons: first, to ensure that in those instances where international law is not observed justice is done effectively. If the principles of international humanitarian law are to be upheld, we must ensure that those who commit the most serious international crimes cannot do so with impunity. Secondly, there is the issue of deterrence. We hope that in future at least some of those who are tempted to commit atrocities will hesitate in the face of an effective instrument that punishes those who commit such crimes. The third issue is reconciliation in societies that very often are terribly war torn. The knowledge that those <P>


<a name="column_960"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 960</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>who have committed atrocities are to be brought to justice may help some who have suffered to put the past behind them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para83"></a>The United Kingdom Government want a court that is permanent and fully effective but have set in safeguards to ensure that it operates properly. It must have sensible limits to its jurisdiction. Those should be focused on crimes of greatest international concern. It must reinforce, not redefine, international agreements for peace and security under the UN Charter. If the court is to be properly effective, those who adhere should accept its jurisdiction over all the crimes listed in the statute establishing the court and should have a mandatory obligation to co-operate with requests from the court. The consent of state parties with an interest in a case should not be necessary before individual prosecutions or investigations can take place. Nor should it be possible for state parties acting in bad faith to resist requests from the court for disclosure of information on manifestly ill-founded national security grounds.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para84"></a>However, there must be safeguards. My noble and learned friend Lord Archer and my noble friend Lord Grenfell referred to complementarity with national legal systems. The court should not act when national legal systems are clearly able and willing to do so. But the court should have the authority, having heard the views of the state with jurisdiction, to determine whether that is truly the case. States acting in bad faith cannot use complementarity--or what might be termed negative outcome show trials--as an excuse to shield suspects from the international court. Conversely, states should not be able to use the court as the means of avoiding a politically embarrassing or financially costly trial at home.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para85"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas, and the noble Viscount, Lord Waverley, questioned the jurisdiction of the court but came to somewhat different conclusions. The view of the Government is that the court's jurisdiction should have a clear demarcation so that it concentrates on the crimes of greatest international concern. We believe that those should cover genocide, crimes against humanity and grave war crimes, whether committed within or between states--to deal with one point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. It should also include in particular crimes committed during internal conflicts since recent history has shown that that is where war crimes of this nature most often occur.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para86"></a>The crime of rape and other crimes of sexual violence committed in armed conflict should be properly defined and explicitly added to the court's statutory list of war crimes. We also support the inclusion in that list of the crime of recruitment of children into armed forces. Appropriate procedures will be required for other cases of abuse involving women and children.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para87"></a>To reply to one matter raised by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, the court should have jurisdiction over the crime of aggression, but that has to be defined and determined. The Government believe that it should be limited to those cases where the Security Council has <P>


<a name="column_961"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 961</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>determined that aggression has taken place. We believe that that would depoliticise or at least reduce the political pressures on the court itself.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para88"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Waverley, raised the question of extending jurisdiction beyond that. In our view the list of war crimes should include only those recognised in customary international law. The Rome conference will not be able to settle some disputed questions such as the use of nuclear weapons. The noble Viscount also raised the question of the extension of jurisdiction to drugs, child abuse generally, environmental crimes and corruption. I agree with him that increased judicial co-operation is required in all of these areas, but those areas are not envisaged as part of this court's remit. To extend its field outside armed conflict or serious international crime--crimes against humanity and genocide--runs the risk of diluting the effect of the court. There are already arrangements for dealing internationally with crimes related to terrorism and drug trafficking. To include those in the court's jurisdiction would divert it from its main task.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para89"></a>A number of difficult points have been raised and have not yet been settled. They will be subject to serious negotiation in Rome. In particular, we have referred to the independence of the prosecutor. The United Kingdom Government will strongly support the independence of the prosecutor and the authority of that office. We need to protect that office from political pressure. At the same time, there is a need for appropriate checks and balances to guard against capricious investigations by the court. This will be difficult. My noble friend Lord Grenfell will understand that we do not wish to set out in great detail tonight our negotiating position. Our delegation in Rome will be deeply involved in those negotiations and hopes to take a lead at the conference. I can assure my noble friend that the principles he has enunciated this evening are those of Her Majesty's Government. Coupled with that were queries about the role of the Security Council. The court should reinforce and not redefine existing arrangements. The Security Council must be able to refer cases to the court when acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter; otherwise, it is likely that more ad hoc tribunals will be required to carry out decisions of the Security Council.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-20_para90"></a>Queries were raised about the Singapore compromise. The view of Her Majesty's Government is that the Security Council should, when the court begins an investigation, have the power to request a time-limited suspension of cases when it determines that international peace and security may otherwise be damaged, for example when court action may derail sensitive peace negotiations under the jurisdiction of the Security Council. Similarly, in the first instance it will be for the Security Council, not the court, to decide when aggression has taken place. Part of the reason for giving the Security Council some initiative in this matter is to ensure that rogue states cannot get off the hook. They will include states who are not party to the treaty. The Security Council should be able to use its powers under Chapter VII, whether or not a state is party to the statute of the treaty setting up the court. None of this detracts <P>

<P>
<A NAME="80609-21_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </B>   This clause deals with the proposed arrangements for the Forestry Commission. I, for one, would certainly be grateful to the Government for an explanation of what is proposed. As I understand it, there is to be a tripartite division of the Forestry Commission. There are to be separate parts of the Forestry Commission, one responsible to the Scottish Parliament, the other responsible to the Welsh Assembly, and a section of the Forestry Commission which is responsible, I take it, to the United Kingdom Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-21_para23"></a>I should be grateful for a fuller explanation of what is proposed, for the obvious reason that a unified Forestry Commission has been generally very acceptable in this country in recent years. We have seen the benefits that have emerged from having a unified forestry authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-21_para24"></a>I should be grateful for an explanation in detail of what is proposed and how the responsibilities are to be divided, how the assembly, in particular, will take on responsibility for the commission in Wales and how such responsibility is to be reconciled with the responsibility for forestry in the rest of the United Kingdom.

<P>

<A NAME = "80609-21_para25"></a>Forestry policy is an integral part of land use, countryside, agriculture, tourism, recreation, sustainable development policy and many other things. The forestry industry has retained employment throughout rural Wales since 1919 when the Forestry Commission, as one of the oldest of our nationalised industries, was established.

<A NAME = "80609-21_para26"></a>The development of forestry was originally in order to maintain a supply of timber; now its further development in relation to both private forestry and public forestry in terms of the pulp and paper mill industry in Wales; the growth of saw mills in mid-Wales and also the importance of timber and brushwood as a secondary energy source, all point to the importance of planning forestry in a sustainable way.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-21_para27"></a>I am certain that the Minister can assure us that that is the intention, that we will carry with us the best of forestry practice throughout the UK and Europe but also integrate that effectively with land use within Wales. I am also certain that under the assembly we may look to the development of further forestry, particularly from sustainable woodland, broad-leaved and mixed woodlands and the replacement of forestry in an environmentally sensitive way, which is now taking place in many parts of Wales.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-21_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   Before the Minister intervenes, as a former forest Minister, perhaps I may say a few words about forestry.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-21_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Elis-Thomas: </B>   Some of us have only one Front Bench and, indeed, one Back Bench.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-21_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   This subject is important. The reason it is simply a clause stand part debate is that we would like to explore with the Government how they envisage the Forestry Commission operating after devolution.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-21_para28"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Farrington of Ribbleton, in a debate in your Lordships' House on 29th October 1997, a debate instigated by the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont of Whitley, from the Liberal Democrat Benches in answer to the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Gryfe, said at col. 1125:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The functions of the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales in relation to forestry will be transferred to the Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly respectively. The commission will however continue to be the government department with responsibility for forestry throughout Britain. The commission will report separately to the Scottish parliament and the Welsh assembly but will still be a national responsibility. I hope that provides some comfort and confidence to my noble friend". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-21_para29"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Gryfe, unfortunately is not here. I have to say that it did not provide me with much comfort and confidence. I am still puzzled. Schedule 6 is a long and complex schedule to achieve what I might sum up as the dismemberment of the Forestry Commission and then its coming together again. That seems to me to be surprising.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-21_para30"></a>Forestry is an important industry in this country. We are not heavily forested, as we heard this afternoon at Question Time: something like 10 per cent. in the United Kingdom. I am not sure of the Welsh figure but <P>


<a name="column_965"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 965</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I think that it is probably better than 10 per cent. Scotland is certainly better than 10 per cent. But in comparison to Germany at 30 per cent. and France at 26 per cent. we are pretty poorly off for forestry. But, despite that, it is an important and growing industry in the United Kingdom. The output from our forests is about &#163;800 million a year, and growing. Against that figure, which sounds large, we have about &#163;6 billion of imports.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-21_para31"></a>Some 40 per cent. of the forestry section is run by the Forestry Commission. The other 60 per cent. is run by the private sector. The Forestry Commission, which is now in two, has an involvement in the private sector in that the Forest Authority, as all sides of this place agreed this afternoon in an exchange with the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, has a major role to play in the private sector. After all, it gives the planting agreements and the felling agreements, and it is a pretty big and important player.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-21_para32"></a>Not only does that make for a large number of jobs in the countryside throughout the UK, and especially in Wales; it makes for a great many what I call downstream jobs. The noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, mentioned that point. Over the past 10 years about &#163;1 billion has been invested in the UK pulp and paper industry. In Wales, there is the Shotton papermill and other wood users. They are not just local sawmills but industries that manufacture hardboard and the like. They are serious and important manufacturing industries which do not just employ people but keep down the &#163;6 billion import bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-21_para33"></a>Forestry has been treated on a UK basis. Until now, the Secretary of State for Scotland has been the lead Minister. For a while I was the Minister in the Scottish Office responsible for forestry throughout the UK. That is a little while ago, but my interest in forestry has in no way waned.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-21_para34"></a>I am not sure whether the Ministers will be able to help me. I hope that they can. It may be easier to deal with this point when we come to the Scotland Bill, because the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, is currently the lead Minister for the UK on forestry. I am sure that the two Ministers have been well briefed and will accept my proposition that forestry is important for Wales. That does not relate merely to the growing of timber but to the Shottons and the downstream jobs.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-21_para35"></a>Places such as Shotton depend for their timber supplies not just on Wales but on other parts of the UK. I do not know what happens currently, but in the past forests in the south of Scotland have been supplying Shotton. I make that point to try to bring home to the Committee the fact that the UK forest industry is a unified one.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-21_para36"></a>My fear is that the splitting up of the UK forest industry will lead to the Scottish parliament looking at Scottish forestry and being much more concerned with the supply to the Scottish downstream industry, whereas the UK Government and the Forest Authority are interested in the supply of timber to all manufacturing plants in the UK. Currently, the Forestry Commission, albeit responsible to the lead department in Scotland, looks at the matter from a UK point of view. It works <P>


<a name="column_966"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 966</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>out how timber will go to Shotton. In another year--it is like that--it may be how Welsh timber goes over the border and into England and may be even comes to the pulp mill at Irvine in Scotland. There is a cycle in timber which means that there is a great deal of felling going on in one part of the country and that timber has to be dispersed about the market place.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-21_para37"></a>It is that united forest industry that I fear may be broken up. I can see the Government deciding what money to give the Forestry Commission in Wales. It might say, "We are not interested in supplying timber to Irvine or to England". Conversely, and perhaps more worryingly for Wales, an English Minister or a Scottish Minister may decide that they are not interested in supplying timber to Shotton. They may say that it is not their problem; it is the problem of the Welsh assembly. That is a difficult and dangerous position in which to land the Forestry Commission.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-21_para38"></a>In a minute I shall ask how we will divide up the expenditure, which is not currently divided. I want to carry on with planting. Governments can skew planting. The Government could decide that they were obsessed with the green lobby. I did not like what are called-- I believe erroneously--exotic species, which are sitka spruce and the like, which I agree are not native but which grow extraordinarily well in our climate and are in demand in the market place.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-21_para39"></a>We need planting to feed the mills. If we do not have planting to feed the mills, in 20 or 30 years' time we may not have the timber that they need to carry on. As I have tried to explain, that planting has to be done on a UK basis, so that one can look at the whole picture, and the total demand, whether it be Shotton, Irvine, the hardboard manufacturers, Caberboard in central Scotland or whatever it may be. The Forestry Commission has been able to look at the total demand and supply picture, and work out with the UK Government what type of grant machinery should be in place to deliver that timber.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-21_para40"></a>Noble Lords who have heard me speak about forestry before are aware that I should like to see more planting done in the UK. That inevitably means the necessary grant, because the tax advantages no longer exist. If the UK Government, who will be the Government of England so far as concerns forestry, decide that they want to be green and plant lots and lots of hardwood and skew the planting programme for hardwoods, that could, not next year or the following year but in 20 years' time, have an enormous consequence for Shotton because it may not be able to obtain enough wood. I am worried about that. My worry was in no way diminished when on 18th February the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, told me:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it would be perfectly possible for the grant system in Scotland to be different from that in Wales, and from that in England".--[Official Report, 18/2/98; col. 256.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-21_para41"></a>I am concerned that that could result in us not looking at forestry in the UK in a unified way. We might end up not with a problem, as I said, in the next decade, because all the timber that will go to the pulp mills in the next two or three decades is already growing. But in the decades after in the 2020s and the 2030s the problem could occur.
<P>


<a name="column_967"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 967</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-21_para42"></a>I am worried that one of the players--let us say England--may decide, "We are not interested in softwood any more". That could have serious consequences for Wales and Scotland. If the Scottish parliament decided that it was interested only in supplying timber to the timber industry in Scotland, that could have consequences for Shotton and other places in Wales. The point I am making is that one cannot turn on and off the supply. The planting is done for supply 30 years hence. One can obtain a great deal of timber out of one part of the country for a little while, as the woods come to maturity and they are all being clear felled. For another 20 or 30 years there may be very little timber from that part of the country.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-21_para43"></a>I am trying to emphasise what I believe is the need to look at forestry as a UK asset. Forestry should be based on a UK strategy. If the Forestry Commission is answering to the national assembly for Wales, the Scottish parliament and the UK Parliament for England, it could be looking at three different strategies which may not all be pointing in the same direction.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-21_para44"></a>My second concern relates to how one negotiates with three different local governments the money that the Forestry Commission needs. If the Forestry Commission has to split its accounts, it will have to spend time and trouble to do so. Its bureaucracy will cost more if it has to split its accounts. It is easy to decide that the forest officers in Wales are a call on the Welsh portion of the commission. I assume that the headquarters will remain in Edinburgh. How will those people who make the decisions in the forest authority in Edinburgh divide up their time? Will they have to keep a log sheet: "From 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. I dealt with forestry in Wales. From 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. I dealt with forestry in Scotland"?<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hooson: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. Is he not arguing against devolution of any control of forestry to the Welsh assembly or to the Scottish parliament? He simply makes a Second Reading speech.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I am sorry that the noble Lord is so disinterested in the forestry industry that he does not consider these detailed points deserve an answer. This speech is a good deal more detailed than a Second Reading speech. I suspect that I would be chided if I had such detail in a Second Reading speech and that the noble Lord would say that such speeches are broad brush. I seek to go into detail.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-22_para0"></a>The noble Lord's conclusion may be right. I am extremely concerned about the Forestry Commission being split up. I do not deny that. I am prepared now to sign up to devolution. However, I have a few continuing worries; the Forestry Commission is one. I am quite relaxed now about health, education or local authorities going to the devolved parliaments. But we must explore the problems on one or two issues. The very fact that the Forestry Commission has almost four pages and a whole schedule to itself in the Bill underlines the difficulty of splitting up the Forestry Commission.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-22_para1"></a>There is no point in the noble Lord, Lord Hooson, saying that somehow one does not need to ask these questions; I believe that one does. We shall have the <P>


<a name="column_968"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 968</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>difficulty of the Forestry Commission dividing itself up and having to argue about its budget with three different masters. The law of the Medes and Persians tells me that each master will try to screw the commission down, paying it the least amount. It will say, "No you should not have all these items in. That will go to the English chap, or the Scottish chap". The Scottish and English will try to do the same with the Welsh chap. It will be very difficult.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-22_para2"></a>I have a number of detailed amendments that could have been put down. However, I wish to explore how the Government will implement a devolved Forestry Commission. I do not say that I shall not come back to the subject. However, previously we have had assurances of the best in the best of all possible worlds. That may be so. But I know a little about government. Whether it is the UK Government for England, the Scottish government for Scotland or the Welsh assembly for Wales, they will not part with their bawbees too readily. They will try to part with as little money as possible. That could be bad for the administrative budget of the commission.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-22_para3"></a>The more important issue is the grant system. I understand that it will have to be paid by the Welsh assembly so far as concerns Wales. I do not worry so much for the Welsh growing industry; I suspect that a Welsh assembly will understand the importance of planting conifers. I am more concerned about an English Government, where the pressures--as I know from being a forestry Minister at one time--are on the hardwoods. The supply of sitka spruce may not be as readily available over the Border in 20 or 30 years as it is now. Places such as Shotton may be in severe trouble.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-22_para4"></a>I look forward to hearing what the Minister will say. It might have been better had the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, had this debate the first time round, as the current Minister responsible for forestry in the UK. However, I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, has been well briefed. He has been told the difference between hardwoods and softwoods, sitka and other species. I hope that he will give me some assurance that my fears about the division of the Forestry Commission are ill founded and that I can rest comfortably in my bed while the trees grow.

<A NAME="80609-22_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I hope that the Committee will forgive my addressing the Government of Wales Bill rather than a government of Scotland Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, says that it might have been appropriate for the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, to make the response. That would be so on the Scotland Bill.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-22_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I had better tell the noble Lord now that the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, is the Minister responsible for forestry in Wales as we speak; and England and Scotland.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-22_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   What I am pointing out, I hope reasonably politely, is that this is the Government of Wales Bill. The noble Lords, Lord Roberts of Conwy and Lord Elis-Thomas, rightly, I suggest, focused on <P>


<a name="column_969"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 969</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>what the amendment is about. There are two amendments. It is probably helpful, if the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, thinks it useful, to deal with Clause 107 and Schedule 6 at the same time. They are different aspects of the same point.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-22_para5"></a>It is important on these occasions not to be alarmist, not to worry people who live and work in Shotton. It is an area which historically has been deprived of heavy industry, with the run down of other alternatives. It is important not to raise alarmist fears. If there is a market for a product which is wanted for Shotton, it will be supplied either by Scotland, Wales or England. I do not believe--I am surprised that an advocate of the free market system suggests--that growers in England controlled by the Forestry Commission would be reluctant to try to sell their product to Shotton. That is not the world I recognise.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-22_para6"></a>Perhaps I may focus on the point. In the context of the Government of Wales Bill, should Clause 107 and Schedule 6 be deleted? Perhaps I may focus on Wales. I entirely agree with what the noble Lords, Lords Roberts and Lord Elis-Thomas, said. Forestry is important to Wales. Over 4,700 people are employed; 1,270 are employed by the Forestry Commission. So it is important. The forest area in Wales is not limited to the land owned by the commission. In March 1997 the forest area of Wales was 247,000 hectares. Of those, 120,000 hectares were owned by the commission at that date. As the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, said, forestry allows farmers to diversify in difficult times. They can plant woodlands instead of agricultural production. A well-planted forest is attractive to tourists and provides excellent habitat for wildlife. To answer the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, we are not proposing a separate forestry commission for Wales. I hope that is the categoric assurance of the kind the noble Lord wanted. There is no question of dismemberment. If one troubles to cast one's eye over Schedule 6, paragraph 1(1) states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State may by order make provision for securing--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(a) the separate exercise in relation to Wales of functions of the Forestry Commissioners". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-22_para7"></a>There is no question of dismemberment. We do not propose to create a separate commission for Wales.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-22_para8"></a>In the context of devolution--which, to echo the noble Lord, Lord Hooson, is one that I thought the Committee had accepted--it is right that the assembly should have responsibility for settling the commission's policies and funding activities in Wales. Following devolution--here, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish--there are bound to be matters that affect Great Britain generally. One would be looking for agreement between the Ministry of Agriculture, a representative of the Welsh assembly and the appropriate Minister in the Scottish executive.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-22_para9"></a>In view of some comments, I must say plainly that there is no prospect that under Clause 107 of and Schedule 6 to the Government of Wales Bill, employment of the present workforce in Wales will be prejudiced in the slightest way. It is very important that one does not say things that alarm people in an area <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>that is central to their lives--namely, their employment, home, social and local life. We think this is the proper way to deal with things. I stress that I am dealing with the Government of Wales Bill, not with what may or may not be said of the Scotland Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-22_para10"></a>In Wales, there will be no separate forestry commission. Not all planting is the same. Not all local conditions are the same. One wants decent flexibility in Wales, which will be subject to discussions between the Welsh assembly and the Forestry Commission officials who have to deal with Wales. That seems a step of practical utility, not the end of the world as we know it. It is an aspect of devolution that has been thought through. Bearing in mind my assurance to the Committee, I hope that the noble Lords, Lord Roberts of Conwy and Lord Elis-Thomas, will be content and that the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, will withdraw his resistance to Clause 107 and Schedule 6.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-22_para11"></a>I recognise and welcome the tone in which the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, put his arguments--as an inquiry about what will happen in Wales. I do not myself believe that a market in Wales will not be fulfilled by Scottish, English or Welsh producers. Similarly, if there is a market in Scotland, I do not think that producers in Wales will be chary of travelling over the border simply because there are new constitutional arrangements. That is not realistic. If the noble Lord has specific concerns, I will be perfectly happy to convey them to my noble friend Lord Sewel, who will deal with them in the appropriate context. Whether or not there are worries in filling up time sheets in Edinburgh does not strike me as enormously helpful in considering Clause 107 and Schedule 6.

<A NAME = "80609-22_para14"></a>That is only an indication but the fact that statement has to be made in the context of a schedule headed "Forestry Commissioners" shows that there is to be a change that must be carefully managed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-22_para15"></a>We have been accustomed to a unified Forestry Commission that pursues policy in England, Scotland and Wales that is complementary in the sense that such industry as uses forestry products in the UK draws them from different parts of the kingdom and abroad. The whole industry is run on a national basis and governmental control of forestry has been exercised for some considerable time through the Scottish Office. Therefore, it was natural for my noble friend, who had responsibility for forestry in the United Kingdom when a Minister at the Scottish Office, to express his concerns about the future and the way in which the forestry commissioners will operate in England, Scotland and <P>

Before Clause 108, insert the following new clause--
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80609-23_para0"></a>("Privilege of Assembly 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><center><B>Application of Bill of Rights and Claim of Right to Assembly proceedings </B></center><BR>
.--(1) For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of Article IX of the Bill of Rights 1689 and of that part of Article XXV of the Claim of Right Act 1689 which secures freedom of speech and debate to members of Parliament shall apply to the proceedings of the Assembly; and those Articles shall be construed accordingly.
<BR>
(2) For the purposes of subsection (1) above--
<BR>
(a) proceedings of the Assembly shall not be questioned on grounds of non-conformity with Assembly standing orders except where such non-conformity raises a devolution issue within the meaning of Schedule 7 to this Act, and
<BR>
(b) speeches made in the Assembly shall be treated as having the same status in law in relation to proceedings of the Assembly as speeches made in Parliament have in relation to proceedings in Parliament.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80609-23_para1"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: I begin by apologising for visiting yet another Lord Mackay into deliberations on the Bill, particularly when in the same breath I indicate that in speaking to this and subsequent amendments I shall make reference to the Scotland Bill. I believe that there are similar threads between them, a view which I suspect is shared by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate, who is in the Chamber and I suspect somewhat interested in what I have to say.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-23_para2"></a>The first amendment raises the issue of according to the assembly the privilege that attends to what is said in this Parliament when cases are raised in courts throughout the United Kingdom. It seeks to provide that the provisions of Article IX of the Bill of Rights 1689 and the Scottish equivalent of that--namely, Article XXV of the Claim of Right Act 1689, which secures freedom of speech and debate to Members of Parliament,--apply to the proceedings of the assembly. It seeks to elaborate on the practical effects of that in subsection (2).
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-23_para3"></a>It may be instructive to bear in mind what lies behind the privilege that is incorporated in Article IX of the Bill of Rights. It is the need to ensure that as far as possible Members of this Parliament and witnesses who appear before the committees of this Parliament are able to speak freely without fear that what they say will later be held against them in the courts. The important public interest protected by the privilege is to ensure that a Member of either House, or a witness appearing before a committee of either House, when he speaks, is not inhibited from speaking fully and freely.
<P>


<a name="column_972"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 972</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-23_para4"></a>That principle, coupled with the wider principle that the courts on the one hand and Parliament on the other are both astute to recognise their respective constitutional roles, means that the courts will not allow any challenge to be made to what has been said or done within the walls of Parliament in performance of Parliament's legislative function.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-23_para5"></a>In tabling the amendment, I wish to make it clear that it is not intended in any way to prevent the executive functions which will be discharged by the assembly or any committee of the assembly or any individual on behalf of the assembly being appealed to the courts or made the subject of judicial review proceedings to any lesser extent than can happen at present. Nor, indeed, is the amendment designed to exclude any reference in court proceedings to speeches made either in this House or in another place when on the authority of the case of Pepper v. Hart it is appropriate that such reference should be made.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-23_para6"></a>It is right that I should publicly acknowledge the assistance that I have had in framing the amendment from senior officials within the Public Bill Office. The amendment is designed to have several purposes. First, it is designed to encourage free speech in accordance with the principles as I have explained them, free speech not only by members of the assembly and in particular by the first secretary and the assembly secretary but also by those who will be called before the committees of the assembly to contribute to the discharge of its functions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-23_para7"></a>Secondly, it seeks to extend to the assembly and encourage it to recognise the principle which currently guides the relationship between this Parliament and the courts. Again, I have already made reference to it; namely, the recognition and respect that the one has for the other's constitutional role.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-23_para8"></a>Thirdly, the intention is to discourage the number of occasions on which legal proceedings are raised for political purposes. Those of us who have practised in the courts know that from time to time, whether to do with the affairs of local authorities, where it happens quite frequently, or to do with the conduct of referendums, where it happens less frequently, actions are raised for a political purpose; that is, to draw attention to particular political causes, to attract the media to the court proceedings and then, once the necessary publicity has been received and the political mileage has been made, the proceedings are abandoned in the event that they prove to be unsuccessful, which in most instances they do.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-23_para9"></a>As I construe this Bill and the provisions of the Scotland Bill, it would be possible for court action to be raised with a view to preventing the assembly proceeding to deal with a certain piece of business, interrupting the assembly during the course of proceedings or seeking to quash the assembly's decisions when they are concerned with the approval of subordinate legislation. Whether it be done by injunction proceedings in England and Wales or interdict proceedings in Scotland, technically speaking, it would be competent to do so. That is not the situation which applies to proceedings in this Parliament. Therefore, a third purpose is to discourage the number <P>


<a name="column_973"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 973</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of occasions on which disgruntled politicians, of whatever party, have recourse to the court to try to frustrate the will of the elected members.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-23_para10"></a>The fourth purpose is to exclude the possibility of parties and their respective lawyers trawling the speeches made by assembly members with a view to seeing whether anything said can support judicial review proceedings which may be proceeding on the grounds of error of law, failure to take account of a relevant consideration or whatever, or equally to prevent such attempts to be founded on irregularities of procedure. All those matters are commonplace when judicial review of the actions of local authorities takes place.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-23_para11"></a>I accept fully that in the setting up of a devolved assembly such as that proposed for Wales and the devolved parliament as is proposed for Scotland it is necessary to have in place judicial procedures to resolve constitutional disputes that arise in relation to the issue of vires. Equally, I believe firmly that it is not in the interests of the success of either the assembly of Wales or the parliament of Scotland to have recourse to the court unless it is strictly necessary, and even then such recourse should be on as limited grounds as possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-23_para12"></a>I believe that this is an important issue and I very much look forward to a constructive response from the Minister.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   We are discussing important issues, but in many ways it is a question of deja vu, although I am not sure what the Welsh equivalent of that phrase is and I cannot draw on the advice of the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, because he is not in the Chamber at present. However, we discussed these issues at some length on an earlier Committee day. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, was good enough to contribute his proposition; namely, that one needs full, fearless and frank debate in the assembly. We dealt with such matters by way of our amendments to Clause 78, which I believe were generally welcomed by Members on all sides of the Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-23_para13"></a>There are a number of propositions here, but I believe that they have been overtaken by our amendments to Clause 78. In any event, I do not think that some of them could properly apply to the Welsh assembly. The amendment starts with the words;
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"For the avoidance of doubt". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-23_para14"></a>Whenever I hear those words, I feel a little like Field Marshal Goering and reach for my revolver. There is no doubt here. On any legitimate construction of Article IX of the Bill of Rights, there is no possibility of it applying to the Welsh assembly because it relates to the Parliament at Westminster. There is no doubt about that. The Claim of Right Act 1689--an Act of the former Scottish Parliament--could not, with the utmost ingenuity, even of members of the Wales and Chester circuit, possibly apply to the Welsh assembly.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-23_para15"></a>I take note of the points behind the amendments. I hope that I am not being impolite, but I believe that they were designed for a situation that has been overtaken by events. We amended Clause 78 by drawing <P>


<a name="column_974"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 974</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>on provisions in the Defamation Act 1996. The real protection in respect of free, fearless and frank discussion, to use the noble Lord's phrase, is immunity from actions for defamation. Indeed, as I said, we discussed the matter on an earlier day of the Committee stage. We have already provided for that situation to general agreement from all sides of the Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-23_para16"></a>I should point out to the Committee that Members of Parliament cannot be criminally liable for statements made in proceedings in Parliament. That was considered in the case of Duncan Sandys in 1938. It was generally agreed there that the Member of Parliament in question could not have been convicted of a breach of the Official Secrets Act for information disclosed in the course of proceedings in Parliament. Therefore, there is the effective immunity of a Member of Parliament in Westminster from criminal prosecution, but of course the other place has internal sanctions for breach of its own rules, which can include imprisonment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-23_para17"></a>As far as concerns the assembly, we provided last week that standing orders made for preserving order in the assembly must include provision for preventing conduct which would constitute a criminal offence. That, of course, would include the power to restrain the making of statements which, if made, would constitute a criminal offence. If those standing orders were ignored and a criminal offence were then committed, we do not see why the offending member should be immune from prosecution. There is no power in the assembly for it to imprison its own member--a power which does obtain in another place.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-23_para18"></a>We are quite certain that the amendments we moved last week will give adequate and full protection to the freedom of speech of assembly members. Therefore, trying to apply Article IX of the Bill of Rights to the proceedings of the assembly is neither required nor appropriate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-23_para19"></a>I am most grateful to the noble and learned Lord because he dealt with a question which is encompassed in subsection (2)(a) of his amendment. As he explained, that seeks to apply to proceedings of the assembly the rule excluding review by any court of the observance by either House of its internal procedures and practices in the discharge of its business. That is subject to the exemption--namely, the "devolution issue"--which I believe the noble and learned Lord described as the vires question. I entirely agree with him.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-23_para20"></a>The noble and learned Lord's amendment seeks to apply to a body which is not a parliament principles which have been developed in the context of this Parliament. It is well known that no court will entertain a question which impugns the internal workings of another place. However, it will be very odd indeed if, having accepted the amendments which we discussed at some length last week, Members of the Committee were now in effect to provide that non-observance of standing orders--and I stress this point--even those specifically required by the Bill, could never allow a court to hold assembly action invalid. I respectfully suggest that that would be nonsense. The court would be entitled to examine the question of whether standing orders which had been introduced on a mandatory basis in the Bill <P>


<a name="column_975"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 975</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and which had been breached could in fact result in a finding of invalidity and the granting of a remedy. That is a discretion open to the court.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-23_para21"></a>The final matter which the noble and learned Lord again helpfully outlined relates to Pepper v. Hart. It is well known that in some circumstances the courts can look at the legislative history of a statute when construing its provisions. That was held not to be impeaching or questioning proceedings in Parliament which would have been contrary to the Bill of Rights. The rule in Pepper v. Hart will continue to apply to legislation going through Parliament which confers order-making powers on the assembly. Statements made in the course of those proceedings could be used in the Pepper v. Hart context.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-23_para22"></a>Whether statements made in the assembly in the course of its order-making procedures could be relied upon is a different question. As I said last week, the assembly's powers are to make subordinate legislation only. When your Lordships' House decided Pepper v. Hart it paid regard to its earlier decision in Pickstone v. Freemans, which concluded that it was permissible to construe subordinate legislation having regard to the legislative history. We believe it would be for the courts to decide whether the same approach could be taken in relation to proceedings in the National Assembly for Wales. The cases are there and the courts can address these issues.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-23_para23"></a>I summarise. Article IX of the Bill of Rights could not properly apply to the assembly. Article XXV of the Claim of Right Act 1689, which is a peculiarly Scottish Act, could not conceivably apply to the assembly. Freedom of speech in debate is already secured by the amendments we discussed and passed last week. I hope that the noble and learned Lord will withdraw his proposed new subsection (2)(a) on the basis of my explanation. As regards his proposed new subsection (2)(b), I hope I have given him the assurances that he sought in the context of Pepper v. Hart.

I understood that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, also suggested that action could be taken in the courts to seek an injunction to prevent the Welsh assembly from considering certain points. It had not occurred to me that that could be done. I do not think that the noble Lord dealt specifically with that point.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80609-24_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   I can conceive of such circumstances in the vires context. I believe that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, dealt specifically with the vires context. If there were a proposal by the Welsh assembly to deal with its devolved powers ultra vires, it seems to me as a matter of principle that any remedy would be capable of being sought by a disaffected party who had sufficient locus. That might well include the remedy of injunction. That <P>


<a name="column_976"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 976</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is a matter for the courts to develop. However, as a matter of principle, I believe that the noble and learned Lord is right in the vires context.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Prys-Davies: </B>   Will my noble friend on the Front Bench deal with an issue which was not raised by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon? I have followed the proceedings of the joint Parliamentary Privilege Committee which has discussed this question. It has also discussed the question of whether a Member of Parliament should be immune from being subpoenaed to attend and give evidence in criminal or civil proceedings. I fully accept the relevance of Clause 78, as amended, but there is nothing in the Bill that deals with the question of whether a member of the Welsh assembly will be immune from being subpoenaed to give evidence. Therefore I assume that he or she will not be immune from that. I hope that my noble friend can answer that question.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-24_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   That is an interesting question. I believe it would depend on the basis of the evidence that was sought to be the subject of the subpoena or the order to produce documents. Certainly if it related to transactions which were non-assembly transactions, the matter would be clear. I wish to consider that question because it divides itself into at least two parts. I think it is better if I write to the noble Lord and place a copy of my reply in the Library.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-24_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   In responding to the Minister, perhaps I should make it abundantly clear that I was fully aware of the terms of Clause 78 as amended. I was also fully aware of the amendments that were tabled to the standing orders for the reason that, when I went to put down the same amendments to incorporate the Scottish equivalent, I discovered that I had been beaten to the putting-down post, if I may use that term.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-24_para0"></a>I hasten to assure the Minister that the purpose that lay behind this amendment had nothing to do with preventing members being sued for defamation and libel, and nothing to do with the disciplining of people who might or might not misbehave in the assembly, whether they are members of the public or members of the assembly. The purpose was to raise issues which are to some extent focused in subsection (2)(a) and (b) of the amendment. I hoped I had touched on the general issue. If a provision along these lines does not apply to the deliberations of the assembly, I conceive--and I believe I am not alone in this--that it will be possible for people to seek to challenge the decisions of the assembly, whether they are made by the assembly itself or by secretaries to whom decisions are delegated, by relying on what was said in debate and seeking to demonstrate to the court that the whole proceedings were based on a misunderstanding as to what the current law is, or that they proceeded on a failure to take into account the relevant considerations. In other words, we should be able to use speeches made in the assembly in a way that it is inappropriate to use speeches made in this Parliament by government Ministers or any other Member of this House or another place.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-24_para1"></a>Therefore, I have to say frankly to the Minister that, while I fully accept that it has nothing to do with defamation of character or the issue of misbehaving, I find his answer not a complete answer to the questions I raised, which I consider to be of relevance to this assembly and also in relation to the Scotland Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-24_para2"></a>I am interested to have the Minister's acknowledgement that in certain circumstances injunction proceedings would be competent against the proceedings of the assembly. I intend to think very carefully about what he has said. I hope that he and his colleagues will reflect as to whether it is desirable if the courts on the one hand and the assembly on the other are to respect the constitutional position of each one who wishes to admit any responsibility at all of proceedings being taken to seek to interrupt the deliberations of the assembly, either because certain standing orders have not been complied with or there is an allegation that erroneous information is before the assembly as it moves to take an important decision in the exercise of its executive function.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-24_para3"></a>This was clearly a probing amendment. On that basis, I seek leave to withdraw it.

<P>

<A NAME = "80609-24_para7"></a>My noble friend Lord Williams of Mostyn indicated at Second Reading that it would be necessary to bring forward amendments to bring this Bill into line with the Human Rights Bill, which is now being considered in another place. That is the purpose of the amendments to which I speak.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-24_para8"></a>As the Government of Wales Bill presently stands, the assembly is forbidden by a provision in a single clause, Clause 108, to act incompatibly with Community law or with the convention rights. Government Amendments Nos. 213B and 213E unpack that clause, so that separate provision is made for Community law and separate provision for the convention rights.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-24_para9"></a>The important changes in respect of convention rights are made by Amendment No. 213D, which has several elements. First, as drafted, Clause 108 does not specify who could challenge the assembly for a breach of its human rights obligations under that clause. The answer provided by the proposed new subsections (2) and (3) is that a person will be able to bring proceedings under Clause 108 only if that person is or would be a "victim" under Clause 7 of the Human Rights Bill or is a law officer of the United Kingdom Government or is the assembly itself. In determining such proceedings, a <P>


<a name="column_978"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 978</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>court's powers to award damages would be limited in the same way as under Clause 8 of the Human Rights Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-24_para10"></a>Amendment No. 213G makes clear that, for the purposes of Clause 108, "action" by the assembly includes a failure to act. This brings Clause 108 into line with the Human Rights Bill, Clause 6(8) of which specifically includes failures to act save in certain limited circumstances. Amendment No. 213K makes a consequential amendment to the definition of devolution issues in paragraph 1 of Schedule 7 to ensure that a failure to act which is incompatible with the convention rights is a devolution issue for the purposes of the special judicial procedure involving the judicial committee of the Privy Council.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-24_para11"></a>Finally, as a consequence of the unpacking of Clause 108 to which I previously referred, Amendment No. 213F makes a consequential amendment to Clause 109 so as to include in a single clause the existing provision as to Community obligations of the assembly and the provision, previously in Clause 108, for the assembly not to act in a way that is incompatible with Community law.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-24_para12"></a>These are detailed amendments, but I hope that they will not prove controversial. I believe that they do not raise any new points of principle. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-24_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   I am grateful to the Solicitor-General for explaining these amendments, which seek to address an issue which I raised during the Human Rights Bill relating to the compatibility of the provisions of that Bill with the provisions of the Scotland Bill and the Government of Wales Bill, which became available during the passage of the Human Rights Bill through your Lordships' House. I regret that, because I was not present in your Lordships' House yesterday, I saw these amendments for the first time today. The amendments sent to me on Friday did not include these amendments and I have therefore not had as much time to look at them and consider their implications as I would have wished. I accept that they seek to address the concern I raised during the Human Rights Bill that there was possibly some incompatibility between the provisions of the two Bills which might be undesirable.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-24_para13"></a>I have a number of questions to pose, in particular in relation to Amendment No. 213D. First, why is it proposed that proceedings in relation to any acts under the Government of Wales Bill which breach convention rights should be limited to those proceedings which can be raised under the Human Rights Bill? I understand that to be the purpose of the new subsection (2).
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-24_para14"></a>As the noble and learned Lord will be aware, the Government have not yet indicated which courts and tribunals will be designated as the appropriate courts and tribunals for the purposes of proceedings under Clause 7 of the Human Rights Bill. For that reason, it is at the present time impossible to identify what role the lower civil courts and certain tribunals may have in this area. Unlike the case of the transfer of functions, where draft orders are available, no draft orders are available in relation to the designation of the appropriate courts under Clause 7.

<A NAME = "80609-24_para15"></a>In that state of uncertainty, why should we limit the proceedings in the way that subsection (2) does? If either the Secretary of State for Scotland or the Lord Chancellor of England was to exercise the rule-making power under the Human Rights Bill and to provide that actions could only be raised in the superior courts--the High Courts of England and Wales or the Court of Session in Scotland--it might lead to additional complexity of litigation and inevitably additional expense.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-24_para16"></a>Secondly, I raise a question in relation to Amendment No. 213D and the new subsection (3). Why should Law Officers be treated differently from any other party to the litigation? I merely pose the question. I have not had time to research it, but differentiating between the rights of one litigant--namely, the Law Officer--and the other litigants may raise an issue of Convention rights. One seems to be able to advance an argument which another party in the same litigation seeking to achieve the same result cannot. On a first reading that strikes me as an odd provision and I should welcome hearing further from the noble and learned Lord the Solicitor-General on that matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-24_para17"></a>The amendments meet concerns that I felt and I welcome them. However, until I receive answers to those and other questions that may arise, I am unable to give the Minister an assurance that I consider these amendments to be as non-controversial as he. In view of the fact that they come forward at this stage, I do not intend to press Amendment No. 213C, though it may be necessary to return with that or a similar amendment at Report stage.

<A NAME="80609-24_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, poses two questions in his intervention. First, he asked why we limit the rights to those set out in the proposed subsection (2). The answer is that Clause 7(1) of the Human Rights Bill--the subdivision of the Law Officers--permits only victims to bring proceedings under that Bill. It would be anomalous and wrong for the Government to allow people who were not victims to challenge the assembly for contravention of human rights. In effect, we would be giving a greater locus to people in respect of the activities of the assembly than in relation to any other public authority in the country. That seemed to be wrong. At Second Reading therefore we said that we would introduce measures to make the two consistent, which is the purpose of subsection (2).
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-24_para18"></a>I hope that that answers the noble and learned Lord's first question. He asked also why Law Officers are treated differently. The reason is that a Law Officer is not a victim for the purposes of the Human Rights Bill. The Law Officers represent the public interest and, without the provision that we included in subsection (3), there would be doubt that the Attorney-General or the other Law Officers could bring proceedings against the assembly for breaches of convention rights when it would be appropriate that they did so to clarify a situation. I hope that that answers the noble and learned Lord's second question.

<BR>
("( ) a question whether a failure to act by the Assembly is incompatible with any of the Convention rights or with Community law, or

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80609-25_para16"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: The first part of this amendment has clearly been overtaken by events, through Amendments Nos. 213H to 213K. I fully accept that, in the light of these amendments, which were tabled, as I understand it, subsequent to my amendment, the first part is inappropriate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-25_para17"></a>The second part of the amendment raises a distinct issue on which I should welcome a response from the noble and learned Lord the Solicitor-General. It arises in this way. If the assembly has failed to act in a manner which gives rise to an issue of vires based on an incompatibility with the convention rights of Community law, the fault may lie not with the assembly itself, but with the first secretary or one of the assembly secretaries who is responsible for presenting, for example, secondary legislation or proposals for action to it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-25_para18"></a>Therefore, I pose the question whether in those circumstances it may be appropriate to have as an additional devolution issue the matter which appears in the second part of the amendment. I readily accept that on one view it is an issue of construction as regards the constitutional position of the assembly that the first secretary and any of the assembly secretaries, will act <P>


<a name="column_982"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 982</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in accordance with powers delegated to them by the assembly. Nevertheless, particularly if we have the curious situation that we discussed earlier of the Secretary of State for Wales occupying the position of first secretary of the assembly, it might be appropriate for the avoidance of any doubt to have this identified as a separate devolution issue. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-25_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   The noble and learned Lord answers his own question. We take the view that the second subsection, relating to assembly secretaries, would be otiose since the assembly secretaries would be acting for the assembly rather than in their own right. Their failures to act would be failures of the assembly to act. Even if the amendment had been necessary, that point would have been covered by the first proposed subsection. In the light of that assurance, I invite the noble and learned Lord to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-25_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   I am happy to accept that assurance which will be available if the issue should ever arise. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="80609-25_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon </B>   moved Amendment No. 214: 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 90, leave out lines 41 and 42.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80609-25_para20"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: This is the first of a number of amendments raising the same issue; namely, whether in Schedule 7 references to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council should be replaced by the insertion of the words "House of Lords". Accordingly, in moving Amendment No. 214, with the leave of the Committee, I should like to speak also to all the other amendments grouped with it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-25_para21"></a>The purpose of this series of amendments is to probe and, I hope, to have answered questions about the Government's thinking on the issue of whether it should be the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, as the Bill proposes, restricted to those members who qualify under paragraph 33 of Schedule 7, or the House of Lords where, in accordance with the convention by which judicial business is handled in your Lordships' House, it would be determined by the Appellate Committee before reporting the matter to the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-25_para22"></a>Clearly, this is also of relevance to the Scotland Bill, where the devolution issues that will arise for determination by the courts may be more extensive than those arising under this Bill, including, as they will, the vires of primary legislation which it will be competent for the Scottish parliament to enact. I understand that a number of noble Lords are concerned about this issue and that they intend to raise it during the passage of the Scotland Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-25_para23"></a>A number of considerations arise. First, the Appellate Committee of your Lordships' House already serves as the supreme court in the United Kingdom for all proceedings with one major exception; namely, that of criminal appeals from the High Court of Justiciary in Scotland. The question that therefore arises is: why, if that is the case, is it appropriate to substitute a new supreme court for this tranche of judicial business even <P>


<a name="column_983"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 983</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>if as a matter of fact, if I might use these terms, the judicial cast in both bodies would have a certain similarity?
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-25_para24"></a>Secondly, I refer to the Human Rights Bill and to the judicial proceedings that will be competent under that legislation. As was mentioned earlier, Clause 7 of that Bill is relevant here. The ultimate court of appeal in civil proceedings will be the Appellate Committee of your Lordships' House. In many instances, the issues raised will be similar. Indeed, Amendment No. 213D, to which the Committee has recently given approval, may mean--indeed, it probably will mean--that the issues raised are virtually identical. Therefore, it is possible to imagine a situation where the same act, or failure to act, could be challenged by different types of proceedings. In one type of proceeding, it would be competent for the ultimate court of appeal to be the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, while in another type of proceeding it would be the Judicial Committee of your Lordships' House. The question arises whether that is entirely sensible.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-25_para25"></a>The third consideration is that if the ultimate court of appeal is the Appellate Committee, it may serve to reinforce the supremacy of this Parliament in a way that would be welcomed by those of us who are committed to devolution and who are determined that the devolved assemblies in Wales and Scotland will work but equally that those bodies operate as integral parts of a thriving United Kingdom. I am aware that that view is shared by a number of Members of your Lordships' House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-25_para26"></a>At this time of night I merely raise this as a probing amendment to seek guidance as to why the Government have selected this particular route. I hope that that will be explained to the Committee and that the issues that I have raised in this probing amendment will receive a response.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-25_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, has not put forward any particular case as to why the House of Lords should be the ultimate court of appeal. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council has both domestic and overseas jurisdiction. Customarily, it has dealt with constitutional issues arising out of written constitutions in the Commonwealth and overseas territories. Its present jurisdiction is reduced because all of the Hong Kong area and many of the overseas territories that customarily were dealt with by the Privy Council have gone. Procedurally, it is easier to deal with than the House of Lords and is more flexible.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-25_para27"></a>I do not understand the argument that the House of Lords in its judicial capacity should be the ultimate appellate court because of the supremacy of this Parliament. I understood that its supremacy was the Queen in Parliament. The Privy Council reports to Her Majesty who makes decisions on the advice of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. I do not believe that it can be much more "supreme" than that. I do not believe that that provides any particular reason why the matter should not remain with the Judicial <P>


<a name="column_984"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 984</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Committee of the Privy Council; that would appear to be a practical and appropriate body to be the ultimate appeal court on constitutional issues.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-25_para28"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 215 in my name and that of my noble friends Lord Hooson and Lord Geraint. At Second Reading I suggested that it would be far simpler, easier, quicker and less costly if constitutional issues arising out of the Welsh assembly were brought before a court in Cardiff as opposed to having to come to London. This amendment seeks to make what I believe to be the highly practical suggestion that the High Court, sitting in its capacity as a divisional court, and the Court of Appeal may sit in Wales. That power may already exist. If I hear that from the Benches opposite I shall be satisfied. However, I have no personal knowledge of any case where the court has sat as a divisional court in Wales. Certainly, the Court of Appeal does not do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-25_para29"></a>I was criticised on the basis that I sought to up the ante and make a greater constitutional innovation in Wales and give it greater power, by giving to Wales its own Lord Chief Justice. I do not believe that that was the burden of my remarks. However, even if that were the case, Northern Ireland with a population of 1 million has a Lord Chief Justice and Scotland has all kinds of judges. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, will be able to enumerate them. They are not very well known to us. I refer to the Lord Justice Clerk and so on. Scotland has a whole raft of judges who sit in Edinburgh and who no doubt will continue to do so. Why, therefore, should we not have in Wales a High Court judge who sits in the Divisional Court who customarily deals with constitutional issues and knows the whole set-up, has regular people in front of him who are accustomed to argue the constitutional issues, and from him to the Court of Appeal?
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-25_para30"></a>In Wales we are fortunate to have some eminent Lord Justices of Appeal, any one of whom, I am sure, would fulfil that function and give that expertise which the people of Wales will require on issues of that sort. If the present system is used, every time a constitutional issue arises in the Divisional Court or the Court of Appeal is approached in London, the whole background to the Government of Wales Bill will have to be gone into. The powers of secondary legislation and its division from primary legislation will have to be investigated as from the beginning with each new tribunal before which those issues are raised. That would seem in the end to be a highly expensive and inappropriate procedure.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-25_para31"></a>If, as I see from some nods from the Bench opposite, the power exists for the High Court and the Court of Appeal to sit in Wales, I would welcome an indication that that will be permissible.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80609-26_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Prys-Davies: </B>   In response to the speech of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, I would mention that there is, of course, another view. There is a perception among members of the public that the Appellate Committee of this House is a part of Parliament's own processes and it would therefore be a judge in its own cause. It might not be seen as reaching an impartial judgment.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-26_para0"></a>There is one question I should like to ask my noble and learned friend on the Front Bench. I note from paragraph 33 of the schedule that no member of the judicial committee shall sit and act as a member unless he holds certain offices. Going back to the question of public perception, if there are no Welsh judges on the Privy Council, can the Privy Council sit with lay assessors such as a Welsh academic with expertise in constitutional law?
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-26_para1"></a>If there is a constitutional issue, it is important that the public have confidence in the tribunal and its membership.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-26_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   I wonder whether, with permission, I might make one comment which I meant to make earlier about the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas. I fully support that amendment and see absolutely no reason why that should not be the practice.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-26_para2"></a>Perhaps I may raise as a related issue the question of where the court might sit? Whether it be the Appellate Committee of your Lordships' House or the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, what is the Government's position on whether it would be competent for either of those bodies to sit, whether in Cardiff on the one hand or in Edinburgh on the other hand, when dealing with devolution issues?
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-26_para3"></a>As I think is well known, the Privy Council is occasionally convened in Scotland at a certain time of the year if any emergency business requires to be transacted. Therefore, as far as I am aware, there is no constitutional objection to the judicial committee taking up its judicial bed and walking. I have to say that whether it is to overcome the concern expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, or for any other reason, if the ultimate Court of Appeal is able to sit in public, whether in Wales or in Scotland, and people who are interested are able to observe what is going on, that may well make the important role which judges have to play in the working out of devolution more readily understood. If they have to take controversial decisions, as I apprehend they may, they may make those decisions more acceptable.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-26_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour: </B>   Some of my amendments relate to Schedule 7. I shall start with page 91 and paragraph 7(2) which provides:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Sub-paragraph (1) does not apply
 (a) to a magistrates' court, the Court of Appeal or the House of Lords, or

<P>

<A NAME = "80609-26_para4"></a>I am no expert on the law, but that appears to leave only the county court. I am intrigued by that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-26_para5"></a>I turn now to page 92 and my Amendment No. 220 and page 94 and my Amendment No. 235. There is almost the same schedule in the Scotland Bill. I have equally no doubt that there will be a similar schedule within the Northern Ireland assembly Bill when it arrives.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-26_para6"></a>The Lord Advocate is an office that goes back many centuries. It is in the Scotland Bill. The Lord Advocate has not been included in almost the identical procedures within this Bill. That made me wonder. We have the advocate general, and that is fair enough. He is a new person. Those are the fundamental questions that I am raising on Schedule 7.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-26_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton.: </B>   I shall deal first with the amendments referred to by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, which would substitute this place for the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as the judicial mechanism for resolving disputes about the assembly's use of its powers. The Government have made it clear in relation to this Bill and the Scotland Bill that the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council will be the most appropriate body to act as the final arbiter over constitutional matters relating to the exercise of its functions by the assembly or the Scottish parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-26_para7"></a>There are a number of reasons for that. First, the Judicial Committee acts already as the final constitutional court of appeal for the colonies and various parts of the Commonwealth. It therefore has experience of handling cases raising constitutional issues.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-26_para8"></a>Secondly, it is important that there should be a flexible mechanism in place for disputes about the assembly's powers to be resolved promptly. The amendments, which seek to replace the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council with references to this place, would add to the judicial workload of this place. I am not sure that that would lead to prompt decisions on cases, bearing in mind the various provisions in Schedule 7 for cases to be referred on appeal.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-26_para9"></a>Next, I draw attention to paragraph 33 of Schedule 7, which gives greater flexibility about the membership of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council than exists for the judicial membership of this place. The Judicial Committee can draw its members from anyone who is, or has held the office of, a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary or certain high judicial offices. The latter includes Lord Chancellors and judges of the High Court or Court of Appeal in England and Wales or Northern Ireland or the Court of Session in Scotland but excludes senior judges from the colonies or the Commonwealth. I am afraid that it would also exclude the sorts of persons that my noble friend Lord Prys-Davies had in mind. It is a much larger pool than the pool for the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-26_para10"></a>For the reasons given, it is not possible for the Government to accept the amendments which seek to substitute this House for the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, nor to remove references to it. I respectfully say that I think the right conclusion has been reached in relation to which is the more appropriate body. I know of no reason why the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council cannot sit anywhere in the British Isles that it chooses. Those in the box equally know of no reason why it cannot sit anywhere in the British Isles. If anyone can think of a reason, will he write and let noble Lords know? One should proceed on the basis that it can. When it deals with judicial matters <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>at present, it sits in public. It is obviously critical whether it continues to do so in relation to such issues. I imagine that it is a matter constitutionally for it to decide whether it wishes to go on circuit, as it were, and sit elsewhere. One can see considerable merit in the points made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, in that respect.

<A NAME="80609-26_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I do not recall it personally, but I accept that it occurred. On that note, I turn to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, relating to the High Court and the Court of Appeal sitting in Wales, on which he spoke with some passion during Second Reading of the Bill. I am happy to tell him that the amendment is unnecessary. Under the provisions of the Supreme Court Act 1981, the High Court and the Court of Appeal can sit at any place in England or Wales provided they do so in accordance with the rules of court and directions of the Lord Chancellor. The power is there already. Whether they wish to do so is a matter for them rather than this House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-26_para11"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Balfour, referred to paragraph 7 of the schedule, asking in effect whether only the county court can refer matters to the Court of Appeal. The provisions in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the schedule are designed to have the following effect. Paragraph 6 provides that the magistrates' court cannot refer direct to the Court of Appeal. It can only refer to the High Court. Paragraph 7 is designed to ensure that the High Court or the county court can refer direct to the Court of Appeal a devolution issue, but the paragraphs exclude the Court of Appeal referring the matter to itself or the House of Lords referring a matter down to the Court of Appeal. I hope that that explains the provisions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-26_para12"></a>Amendments Nos. 220 and 235 moved by the noble Earl, Lord Balfour, are inappropriate because the purpose of paragraphs 13 and 30 in Schedule 7 is to give power to institute proceedings to a Law Officer of the UK Government, not a Scottish parliament. Under the Scotland Bill, the Lord Advocate will become a Law Officer of the Scottish Executive and the post of Advocate General for Scotland is being created so that the UK Government continue to have a Law Officer dealing with Scottish affairs. I would not envisage that someone exclusively a member of the Scottish Executive should have the right to which the noble Earl refers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-26_para13"></a>In the light of those explanations, I invite the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, the noble Earl, Lord Balfour, and the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-26_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour: </B>   I am most grateful for that reply. I am beginning to understand matters a little better in that respect. I was intrigued to find subtle differences in the schedules dealing with all four countries of the <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-26_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   I too am grateful to the Solicitor-General for clearly explaining government thinking. As to public perception, I am not entirely convinced by the argument that the Judicial Committee's experience of dealing with the colonies cuts much ice with those people who favour devolution or, to take it one stage further, independence. The Scottish National Party in another place was most vexed at the thought that any body, such as a Judicial Committee, that might be tainted with colonial experience should have a role to play in devolution. The issue interests many noble Lords, and I am sure that the Solicitor-General's remarks will be taken into account when they raise the matter during the passage of the Scotland Bill. I welcome also the Solicitor-General's comments on where the Judicial Committee can sit. I thought that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, was going to tell the Committee that he had appeared before the Judicial Committee. Perhaps I am getting him mixed up with another learned Peer who frequents the Liberal Democrat Benches. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=2>costs or expenses of any parties that subsequently take part in any proceedings in the House of Lords for the determination of the devolution issue involved.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80609-27_para6"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: This amendment and Amendment No. 238 raise the question of the additional expense that may occur when the relevant Law Officer intervenes in proceedings before a court or tribunal and requests that the court or tribunal makes a reference. As my amendment has it, that reference would relate to the House of Lords, but I accept that reference should be to the Judicial Committee, for the determination of a devolution issue. In a similar vein, Amendment No. 238 deals with the situation where the Attorney-General or the assembly itself may be involved.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-27_para7"></a>There is a concern that parties who are caught up in cases involving devolution issues, whether they are raised by the parties bringing the civil proceedings or whether they are pled as a form of defence by the defendant or defender to such proceedings, may end up having to pay a great deal more by way of legal costs and expenses than might be the case if the Law Officers did not intervene.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-27_para8"></a>Any litigant who raises proceedings runs the risk of bearing some expense. However, in the early stages of devolution when certain issues fall to be resolved the proceedings are more complicated than otherwise might be the case and that motivates Law Officers to intervene. There is then an argument that as the issue will be resolved for all the citizens, whether of Wales, as in this Bill, or of Scotland, as under the Scotland Bill, the costs should be borne not by the parties originally involved in the case. That is why I tabled Amendments Nos. 236 and 238. I shall be interested to hear the Government's thinking on this important practical issue. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-27_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   Amendments Nos. 236 and 238 relate to the question of costs. The Government's attitude is that the amendments are inappropriate since the principle they are seeking to achieve is contrary to the usual principle on which costs in court proceedings are determined; that is, it is in the discretion of the court. Section 15 of the Judicial Committee Act 1833 makes provision for the costs to be in the discretion of the Judicial Committee. The Law Officer can refer the matter to the Judicial Committee in one of two circumstances; either where there are already proceedings in existence, which is paragraph 30, or where there are not, which is paragraph 31. Where a devolution issue is referred to the Judicial Committee under paragraph 31, it is difficult to envisage how any party, other than the assembly or the UK Government in the guise of the Attorney-General, would be involved. I recognise that it might be possible and that other people might want to be joined.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-27_para9"></a>As regards matters referred to the Judicial Committee from another court under paragraph 30, it would be for the Judicial Committee to decide how the costs of all participants should be dealt with. I can envisage the kind of points which the noble and learned Lord made about people getting caught up in complex litigation where the purpose was to resolve the point for others rather than <P>


<a name="column_990"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 990</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>for themselves. Such points might carry some weight in a costs issue in front of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. But, equally, there are circumstances in which the conduct of the party makes it appropriate for the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to make awards of costs against them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-27_para10"></a>Surely, the right course in relation to all these matters is to leave it to the Judicial Committee to determine where the justice of the case lies in relation to the costs issue. That is what underlies the Government's thinking. It is the normal approach taken in relation to costs. That is why it is as it is. I hope that that explanation assists the noble and learned Lord and that he will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-27_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   It certainly assists in understanding the Government's position. The problem is that normal litigation does not allow a Law Officer to intervene and, with the approval of the court, to take the case out of the lower court and march it off to the Judicial Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-27_para11"></a>Furthermore, I find the reasoning slightly difficult to reconcile with Amendment No. 214C, to which the Committee will turn shortly. It appears to give the court, the tribunal, somewhat of a steer to depart from the normal practice where an order under Clause 112 falls to be made. However, the purpose of the amendment was to ascertain the Government's thinking on the matter. That I have received and I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 56, line 28, leave out subsection (2) and insert--
<BR>
("( ) In criminal proceedings, the court shall take account of and act upon any decision made under subsection (1), whether by the court itself or by a superior court, in the conduct of the criminal proceedings in which the decision has been made.

( ) In civil proceedings, the court or tribunal may, if it considers that it is in the public interest to do so, suspend the effect of the decision for such fixed period, not exceeding six months, and on such conditions, as to allow the Assembly to make any further provision of subordinate legislation as it deems appropriate.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80609-27_para17"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: This amendment seeks to explore, with reference to the provisions of Clause 112, what will happen in practical terms when proceedings are raised, whether they be criminal or civil proceedings, and the court or tribunal reaches a view <P>


<a name="column_991"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 991</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that the assembly did not have the power to make a provision of subordinate legislation which figures in the case before the court or tribunal.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-27_para18"></a>As the clause stands, it would authorise the court or tribunal, having reached the view that the provision of subordinate legislation is outwith the competence of the assembly, to make an order. The court would have a discretion to do so. In the first place, that order could remove a limit on any retrospective effect of the decision it had reached as to vires or, alternatively, suspend the effect of that decision for any period and on any conditions to allow the defect in the provision of subordinate legislation to be corrected by the assembly. As we were discussing earlier, the defect in the subordinate legislation could relate, for example, to a failure to follow mandatory standing orders.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-27_para19"></a>The clause directs the court or tribunal that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In determining whether to make an order under this section, the court or tribunal shall (among other things) have regard to the extent to which persons who are not parties to the proceedings would otherwise be adversely affected by the decision", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-27_para20"></a>that is, the decision it had previously reached. Subsection (4) allows the Attorney-General to intervene in such proceedings if he considers it in the public interest to do so. Of course, the very nature of the devolution settlement is, as Schedule 7 makes clear, that such an issue could arise not only in courts or tribunals in England and Wales but also those in Northern Ireland or in Scotland. Therefore, in passing, one must draw attention to the fact that that would give the Attorney-General the right to intervene in proceedings in Scotland and in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-27_para21"></a>I should like to look briefly at the two types of proceedings; first, criminal proceedings. If the criminal court reaches a view that a provision of subordinate legislation is ultra vires, it seems to me that that may arise in one of two contexts. One is where there is some incompetency in subordinate legislation which is involved in the criminal charge that the defendant or accused faces. Another situation might be in relation to the admissibility of some evidence on which the prosecutor sought to rely in seeking to establish guilt.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-27_para22"></a>As a very recent case decided by the Appellate Committee of your Lordships' House decided--the case of Boddington v. British Transport Police--such a public law offence requires to be or can be raised as a preliminary issue, whether before the trial itself commences or possibly, if it related to the admissibility of evidence, during the conduct of the trial itself.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-27_para23"></a>I have some difficulty in understanding how, in any circumstances, a criminal court could pronounce an order removing or limiting the effect of a decision it had reached; that whether the subordinate legislation underpinned the charge or related to admissibility of evidence, it would be proper to remove or limit any retrospective effect of that decision. Perhaps more important, I have some difficulty in understanding how it would be proper to suspend the proceedings for any period and on any condition to allow the defect to be corrected. I would welcome guidance from the noble and learned Lord the Solicitor-General as to how the Government envisage such a provision ever being appropriate in criminal proceedings.
<P>


<a name="column_992"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 992</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-27_para24"></a>I turn now to the question of civil proceedings. What guides my thinking on the matter is the desire to limit, as far as possible, the role of the courts after the devolution Bills--for example, the Government of Wales Bill--come into force. I have a concern, which I believe will be shared by others; namely, that if the court is given this discretionary power of whether to remove or limit any retrospective effect of the decision, or, alternatively, whether to suspend the effect of the decision for a period of time, that may serve to draw the courts into political controversy from which they would do well to steer clear.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-27_para25"></a>The issue which remained unresolved by the Boddington case also lies behind my concern; namely, what will be the effect in civil proceedings of a court reaching the view that a particular piece of subordinate legislation was ultra vires? Should it proceed on the basis that it ought to be treated as having been null and void from the day that it was enacted and as having no legal consequences at all, or should it subscribe to another view? The speeches in the Boddington case made it clear that that is an issue which, in so far as it currently arises, remains to be resolved. I suggest that setting devolution on the road--whether in Wales or Scotland--with that issue remaining unresolved, at least as far as concerns vires issues under these two Bills, would be transferring to the courts an issue upon which the Government ought to form a view and which they ought to bring before both this Committee and this Chamber for approval. Therefore, for those reasons, and without seeking to elaborate in any detail on the fundamental legal issue which lies behind my concern as to what may happen in civil proceedings, I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-28_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   As the noble and learned Lord said, Clause 112 provides for the power of a court or tribunal to vary the retrospective effect of its decision that subordinate legislation made by the assembly was ultra vires.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-28_para0"></a>Subsection (2) of the clause empowers the court or tribunal to remove or limit any retrospective effect of such a decision or to suspend it. We believe that that is a sensible, important and practical power to give to the court. It gives the court or the tribunal a discretion as to varying the retrospective effect of its decision. We believe that the courts can exercise that discretion with responsibility.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-28_para1"></a>The effect of the noble and learned Lord's amendments would be to limit the effect of the discretion that we give to the court. Both in relation to criminal and civil cases, the noble and learned Lord referred to the underlying uncertainty as a matter of law as to what the effect would be of a piece of subordinate legislation being declared invalid. I believe that the noble and learned Lord is correct to say that the law is in a state of uncertainty. The Boddington case was not required to resolve that dispute. There are cases in the Court of Appeal in England that identify the differing views in relation to what the law is, in particular as to whether or not such pieces of subordinate legislation, ultimately declared invalid, have any effect in relation <P>


<a name="column_993"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column 993</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to people who may have relied upon them or conducted their affairs on the basis of them, perhaps for many years.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-28_para2"></a>I do not think it is right or necessary for the Government to seek to come to some unrealistic resolution of what is an unresolved point in the law. Rather it must be much more sensible for the Government to seek with clarity to give the courts powers to deal with the often unfair effects of a late and perhaps surprising declaration of the invalidity of certain provisions. With the greatest of respect to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, surely the uncertainty of the law provides the appropriate justification for Clause 112. The courts know precisely what powers they have by looking at Clause 112(2). They do not have to resolve the Boddington issue, if I may call it that. They can simply approach the issue on the basis of where the justice of the case lies, not only in relation to the people before the court but also having regard to the extent to which persons who are not parties to the proceedings would otherwise be adversely affected by the decision to strike down particular regulations.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-28_para3"></a>I think the Government have made a sensible choice here. We have provided clarity about the powers of the court and we have given the court power to do justice where there are problems about the effect of subordinate legislation. It seems to us to be a realistic and sensible approach and it is hard to criticise it. I hope that the noble and learned Lord will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-28_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   I am grateful for the frank manner in which the Solicitor-General described the uncertainty in the law. However, he has not addressed the issue I raised about criminal proceedings as to whether, notwithstanding the uncertainty of the law, it is appropriate to give any criminal court powers of the nature set out in Clause 112(2)(a) and (b). This is an important issue--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-28_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I apologise for interrupting the noble and learned Lord. I did not address that issue and he is right to draw my attention to it. One can quite see that in relation to an individual criminal case it might be extremely unusual for the courts to declare that certain legislation has never been passed and then not strike it down in respect of the case before it. However, we must remember that other criminal cases will have gone before which are not before the court at that stage. One can envisage circumstances in which the court may say the measure in question does not apply to a particular defendant but it would be wrong to unscramble a whole series of cases that have been conducted in previous years. I am not saying that will apply in every case, but the court may reach that decision considering all the people who may have relied on the provision over the years.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609-28_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   I am grateful for that further explanation, although I remain seriously concerned about the issue. I intend to return to this matter later and I hope that when I do so the Benches of <P>

<A NAME = "80609-28_para5"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: At present the Bill provides for the Attorney-General to be involved in proceedings in which an order under Clause 112 might be made. However, it is possible that a case may proceed without either the Attorney or the assembly being parties, and as drafted, Clause 112 does not explain how the Attorney might be able to become involved in such a case. The new subsection proposed by Amendment No. 241C provides for that and also makes provision in relation to any additional expenses which a party might incur as a result of any intervention by the Attorney-General or the assembly. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="80609-28_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   I have no objection to the purpose of this amendment.

<P>

<A NAME = "80609-28_para6"></a>Clause 112 as drafted would admit the possibility of the Attorney-General taking part in proceedings in Scotland or proceedings in Northern Ireland. In parts of Schedule 7 reference is already made to the relevant Law Officer. It seems appropriate to follow the same practice in relation to Clause 112 as applies in other parts of the judicial scheme that is laid down, to the effect that if the proceedings are in England and Wales it should be the Attorney-General, in Scotland the Advocate General, and in Northern Ireland the Attorney-General for Northern Ireland. I merely raise <P>


<a name="column_995"></a>

While proceedings to which Clause 112 will apply are likely to arise only in England and Wales, I accept in principle that they could arise also in Scotland and in Northern Ireland. Consequently, I see the sense in the points made by the noble and learned Lord in applying this power to take part in such proceedings to each of the relevant Law Officers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609-28_para7"></a>However, for technical reasons we cannot accept the amendment as drafted. It does not tie in with Amendment No. 241C which we propose in relation to subsection (4). We shall need to consult counsel as to the precise drafting of any amendment. I shall also need to consult colleagues, and in particular with the Scottish Office, as it may have implications for the corresponding provision in its Bill; namely, Clause 93.

<P>
<UL>Whether, in view of the proposal in some health boards in Scotland to exclude the supply of incontinence pads from the service provided to incontinent patients by community pharmacies, they will ensure that such pads continue to be supplied in all health board areas; and whether the discontinuance of that service would increase the costs of community pharmacies.[HL2078]<P></UL>

<A NAME="80609w01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   Three health boards are considering pilot schemes for integrating all aspects of the continence services provided to patients in their area.

<A NAME = "80609w01_para1"></a>From October 1999, service providers will have to take reasonable steps to change practices, policies or procedures which make it impossible or unreasonably difficult for disabled people to use a service; provide auxiliary aids or services which would enable disabled people to use a service; and overcome physical barriers by providing a service by a reasonable alternative method.

<A NAME = "80609w01_para3"></a>In reaching our decision on the timetable for implementation, we have taken full account of advice from the National Disability Council, from organisations of and for disabled people and from business. We have also considered the responses to the 1996 consultation exercise. My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Employment and Equal Opportunities has today written to the National Disability Council asking them to review the code of practice in order to take account of the new duties on service providers. I anticipate that public consultation on the council's revised code of practice and the Government's proposals for a small number of regulations under the Act will begin no later than the beginning of August 1998 and last for three months.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609w01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   The average size of primary classes in maintained schools taught by one teacher was 27.7 pupils in January 1998 (provisional), compared with 27.5 in January 1997. This reflects budget decisions taken by the previous government. Average infant class sizes will fall this September as we have allocated &#163;22 million in specific grants to local education authorities to reduce infant class sizes and
&#163;40 million for capital to build additional classrooms. This will enable schools to employ around 1,500 teachers and build an extra 600 classrooms, to the benefit of over 100,000 pupils who will be kept out of large classes.

The Government are also currently consulting on the future framework of regulatory standards for early education and daycare. The structure of the new regulatory framework will be informed by the outcome of the consultation on the law. In advance of the outcome of these consultations, the Government have no plans to withdraw the Department of Health's Circular LAC (94)23, responsibility for which has now been assumed by the Department for Education and Employment.

<A NAME = "80609w01_para5"></a>We also announced that the Government intend to introduce statutory procedures for authorising the extraction of minerals by marine dredging by March 1999.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609w02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   They have not. We inherited a record number of patients on National Health Service waiting lists and a rising trend in the size of the list. In our first year in office we made sure that the NHS averted a winter crisis. NHS waiting lists have increased despite delivering record amounts of hospital care in 1997-98. In March, we announced an extra &#163;500 million to tackle waiting lists this year--which means a total of &#163;2 billion extra for the NHS since coming into office. In the coming year we will use these extra resources to reverse the upward trend in waiting lists and deliver a record reduction so that by next April they are below the level we inherited. This will be the first step in delivering our pledge to bring waiting lists down by 100,000 over the life of the Parliament.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80609w02_spmin2"></A><B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food   (Lord Donoughue): </B>  The Government have been very concerned about the activities of certain agricultural gangmasters who exploit workers, defraud the government and undermine the businesses of those gangmasters who work fairly within the law providing an essential service to the agriculture industry and ultimately the consumer. We therefore set up an interdepartmental working party to investigate the issue. Its report has now been placed in the Library of the House.
<P>


<a name="column_WA83"></a>

<B>9 Jun 1998 : Column WA83</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80609w02_para3"></a>In light of the findings and recommendations of the interdepartmental working party and discussions with the industry, we are putting in place a set of measures to tackle the abuses by a significant minority of gangmasters of workers' rights and of non-compliance and fraud against taxation, National Insurance, benefit and immigration systems.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609w02_para4"></a>The Government are launching "Operation Gangmaster". This cross-departmental initiative will bring together the work of up to eight different enforcement agencies. The core of this pilot operation will be joint visits concentrating initially on illegal practices in Lincolnshire and East Anglia. Such visits have already occurred this season and one is in train today. This will be supported by general co-operation between enforcement officers alerting other departments to possible illegal activities. Departments will also co-operate in in-depth investigations into illegal gangmaster activities.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609w02_para5"></a>In addition enforcement officers in all relevant government departments throughout the country are being briefed on the legislative framework applicable to gangmasters; this will greatly assist strong enforcement and further cement co-operation between departments.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609w02_para6"></a>Additional support to Operation Gangmaster will
be provided through the Government's Business Anti-Fraud Hot Line. Here the drive to identify fraudulent employers will be helpful in identifying those gangmasters who knowingly employ benefit claimants. Other measures being taken by the Government, including implementing the Working Time Directive and the National Minimum Wage, will contribute to improving the position of casual workers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609w02_para7"></a>Importantly, for the first time, gangmasters, farmers and workers will all be informed of their rights and obligations through leaflets which are being issued widely today. These provide a comprehensive picture of all the relevant aspects of law relevant to gangmasters and the people they employ, covering responsibilities
of several different government departments. No one should be in doubt as to their rights or obligations under the law, or be able to claim ignorance of the law, if caught abusing their workers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609w02_para8"></a>I am delighted also that the agricultural and horticultural industries are taking their responsibilities seriously too. The code of practice being launched by the National Farmers' Union and the Fresh Produce Consortium today is an important step. It will be of great assistance to all farmers, growers and pack house operators in understanding the relevant law and best practice to be adopted. I very much welcome that the retail sector have given their support to this code as an initial stage towards controlling gangmasters.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609w02_para9"></a>For the longer term, the Government are continuing to examine the scope for registration of agricultural gangmasters and ways to assist the unemployed to take up seasonal agricultural employment more easily, reducing the temptation to work while on benefit and laying individuals open to exploitation by gangmasters.

<A NAME = "80609w03_para3"></a>It is with these objectives in mind that we are participating in consideration of ideas put forward by Ireland at the IWC's last annual meeting in Monaco last October. These ideas are intended to provide the basis for a compromise solution acceptable to both countries opposed to, and those in favour of, whaling. There was only limited further discussion of the Irish proposals in Oman. The UK delegation made it clear once again that while we were prepared to discuss these proposals, and all other possible ways of improving the conservation of whales, we continued to have serious reservations about some aspects of them, in particular those concerning coastal whaling. We and a number of other countries also stressed that further progress on them was unlikely unless the two whaling countries, Norway and Japan, indicated a readiness to end pelagic, and in particular so-called "scientific", whaling and to accept a ban on international trade in whalemeat: this they declined to do. Nevertheless, the Irish Commissioner, who is the current chairman of the IWC, said that the proposals would remain on the table and that he would continue to try to advance them.

<A NAME = "80609w03_para4"></a>Throughout the meeting, the UK delegation stressed our strong support for the current moratorium on commercial whaling. We opposed a request by Japan for a quota of 50 minke whales, which I am pleased to say was again defeated, and we supported resolutions criticising Norway and Japan's continued whaling activities; although these do not conflict with the letter of the IWC's rules, we and many others believe that <P>

<A NAME = "80609w03_para5"></a>In recent years the UK has been arguing that environmental pollution and climate change may pose significant long term threats to whales and other cetaceans, and urging the IWC to devote more effort towards assessing these threats. At this meeting, two significant resolutions were adopted. The first confirms that environmental issues are central to the IWC and directs the IWC's scientific committee to continue its work on the development of long term research programmes on the effects of pollution and climate change on cetaceans. The second deals with the financing of these programmes; it records an agreement in principle to find the necessary funds, drawing if need be on the IWC's financial reserves, and to consider establishing a dedicated Environment Research Fund. We very much welcome the increased emphasis that the IWC is now placing on this important area.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609w03_para6"></a>The UK delegation again expressed our concern about the cruelty involved in killing whales. It was agreed that a workshop comprising scientific and veterinary experts would meet next year, immediately before the next annual meeting, to consider ways of improving the humaneness of whale killing methods. The UK will be playing a full role in the workshop.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609w03_para7"></a>Small cetaceans continue to be threatened by human activities in many parts of the world. We took the lead in putting forward a resolution which drew attention to the number of beluga whales killed in subsistence hunts in West Greenland and to doubts among scientists that the current level of exploitation may not be sustainable. The IWC Scientific Committee will be examining this issue at its meeting next year. We also drew attention to the numbers of Dall's porpoise killed in directed takes in Japan.
<P>

<A NAME = "80609w03_para8"></a>Other important issues were discussed at this meeting. We and a number of other delegations expressed concern at evidence presented to the IWC's Scientific Committee suggesting that illicit trade in whalemeat may be taking place, and a resolution was adopted reaffirming the need for close co-operation between the IWC and CITES on trade issues and calling on all IWC members to respect previous resolutions on illegal trade in whalemeat. There was a positive debate on whalewatching. The UK highlighted the continuing expansion of this popular tourist activity and underlined the importance of the IWC's role in preparing guidelines and overseeing development in this area. Finally, Japan's proposal to amend the IWC's rules of procedure to allow secret voting on policy issues was heavily defeated
<P>

<A NAME = "80609w03_para9"></a>Overall, we believe that this was a successful meeting for the UK. We achieved the majority of our objectives: in particular the moratorium on commercial whaling has not been weakened and there was further recognition of the increasing importance to the IWC of environmental issues. We will now be working with the environmental organisations and government departments represented on the Consultative Forum on Whaling to formulate our objectives for the IWC's next annual meeting, which will take place in Grenada in June 1999.
