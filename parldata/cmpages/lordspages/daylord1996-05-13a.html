<H4><center>The House met at half-past two of the clock: The LORD CHANCELLOR on the Woolsack.</center></H4>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-01_spopq0"></A><B> The Countess of Mar </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>To what extent the organophosphate pesticide Demeton-S-Methyl is currently used in the United Kingdom; how use of this chemical compares with other organophosphate pesticides; and how many reports of incidents attributable to this chemical have been recorded by the Health and Safety Executive.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, Demeton-S-Methyl is approved for professional use in agriculture only. It is used on a wide range of agricultural and horticultural crops and is of particular importance to growers of brassicas. Demeton-S-Methyl accounts for about 10 per cent. of the crop area treated with organophosphate pesticides and about 5 per cent. of the total weight of such pesticides applied to crops. In the five-year period to 31st March 1995, 44 incidents involving pesticides containing Demeton-S-Methyl were reported to the Health and Safety Executive. Twenty-three incidents were investigated in which adverse health effects were claimed, but in only nine cases did HSE find it confirmed or likely that ill-health had been caused by exposure to a pesticide.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-01_spnew1"></A><B> The Countess of Mar: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for his very full reply to my Question. Is he aware that in the United States of America manufacturers have withdrawn this product from the market and that it is no longer licensed there because of concern about its teratogenetic effects; that is, the birth defects that it may cause? It is also a known mutagen. As it is a class 1 hazard organophosphate, is any consideration being given to the cessation of production in this country?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I am aware that the product is currently under review. I am not aware of the problems in the United States and I shall draw them to the attention of my colleagues.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that the Transport and General Workers' Union, many of whose members work on farms, is concerned about the effects of this chemical and believes that it should be banned? Will he inform the House of the present situation in regard to the new pesticides forum, which was referred to at col. 193 of Hansard in the debate on 6th February?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I do not have with me information on the pesticides forum, but I shall certainly write to the noble Baroness. In regard to the concerns <P>


<a name="column_318"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 318</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the Transport and General Workers' Union, this is an old and well established pesticide. We do not believe, looking at its history, that there is any evidence that it is wildly more dangerous than any other organophosphate pesticide, but all these chemicals have to be treated with the greatest care.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-01_spnew5"></A><B> The Countess of Mar: </B>   Is the noble Lord aware that when this matter was last reviewed in 1993 only six pages of information were provided? Most of those pages said that there was no information on the effects of this pesticide. That is to be compared with OP dichlorvos, where the information amounts to 136 pages. Does the noble Lord appreciate that we do not know what this stuff does and therefore we should not be using it?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, "not knowing what this stuff does", as the noble Baroness puts it, is a characteristic shared by many older pesticides because they were introduced at a time when that information was not required. All such pesticides are in the course of being reviewed. But we draw comfort from the fact that it has been in use for 30 years without the appearance of any known major or unusual problems.

<P>
<A NAME="60513-01_spopq1"></A><B> Lord Rea </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government: 
<P>
<UL>Further to their recently declared support for a worldwide ban on the use or export of anti-personnel mines, whether they will now state that no such weapons will be used by the British Armed Forces.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence   (Earl Howe): </B>  My Lords, our Armed Forces will not use our stock of non self-destructing anti-personnel mines operationally unless, in exceptional circumstances, Ministers are satisfied that their use is essential.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Rea: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Earl for his reply, which I believe restates the Government's position. Is he aware that six countries--Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, Canada and the Philippines--have voted not only to ban the production and export of all types of anti-personnel mine but also to stop supplying their armed forces with these weapons? Is the Minister further aware that a group of American generals, including General Schwarzkopf--Stormin' Norman--recently wrote an open letter to President Clinton which questioned the need for the retention of such weapons by that country?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-01_spnew8"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, we took account of the position of our allies in deciding our new policy. Those views vary considerably--from support of a total ban to countries which firmly believe they still need anti-personnel landmines for national defence. Clearly, it is for other countries to justify their own policies. Our decision reflects a balance between humanitarian goals and the needs of our Armed Forces. I am aware of the <P>


<a name="column_319"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 319</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>ongoing review in the United States. We remain in close touch with the Americans, and we shall study carefully any decisions they make.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-01_spnew9"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Oxford: </B>   My Lords, given that the recent review conference achieved only limited success, what specific steps will the Minister take to expedite an international ban on the production, stockpiling, transfer and use of anti-personnel mines? What is the earliest realistic date by which that goal can be achieved?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-01_spnew10"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, if we want to achieve a total ban, as indeed we do, there is no alternative to international agreement. Any effective measures to reduce the dangers to civilians can be achieved only through broad international agreement involving those countries which produce, export and use anti-personnel landmines. We shall pursue that aim in a number of ways and through a number of fora. I believe that the good outcome of the UN weaponry convention review conference is a step in the right direction. There is scope to build on that by persuading those countries which give rise to the greatest concern. I cannot be of much assistance to the right reverend Prelate as to timing. I assure him that we shall do our best to achieve the outcome that we all want to see.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister be good enough to place in the Library of the House a copy of any of the decisions made at the review conference? Does the agreement criminalise the use of landmines in internal conflicts? If so, are such offences subject to universal jurisdiction? Will the UK introduce legislation to give effect to the decisions of the conference?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-01_spnew12"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, I am happy to give the noble Lord the assurance that a copy will be placed in the Library if that has not already been done. He is right that one of the positive results of the UN weaponry convention review conference was to extend the scope of the convention to civil wars, where, after all, most misuse has occurred. We regard that as a welcome step forward. As regards international sanctions against countries which break that condition, I shall write to the noble Lord.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Molloy: </B>   My Lords, bearing in mind that the anti-personnel mine is probably the only weapon that can harm and kill after an armistice and cessation of hostilities, should not our Government concentrate, with Commonwealth countries, the US, and the countries of the former Soviet Union, on quickly achieving a complete ban on the use of such weapons? I appreciate that we cannot do it on our own, but I believe that we could obtain the support of the countries that I mentioned to see that this detestable weapon is abolished.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-01_spnew14"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, I am in great sympathy with much of what the noble Lord said. We want to achieve a halt to the appalling catalogue of human suffering around the world caused by the irresponsible use of landmines. We shall, as I said, do all we can to introduce <P>


<a name="column_320"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 320</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a global ban. That will require international agreement. As the noble Lord acknowledged, it is not the British Armed Forces which use anti-personnel mines irresponsibly. Only an international ban will reduce civilian casualties.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Jenkins of Putney: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that in his first Answer he referred to circumstances that might justify the use of such weapons. Can he name one such circumstance?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-01_spnew16"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, that must remain an operational matter. What we have said--it represents a strengthening of the rules to which we have adhered up to now--is that when our military commanders recommend the use of landmines our troops will not be allowed to use those landmines without ministerial consent, and that consent will not be given unless Ministers are satisfied that there is no alternative to the use of landmines. That is a positive step forward.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Nicol: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister assure the House that we will not sell abroad any of our remaining stocks of these objects?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-02_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, there has been a de facto ban on exports for many years now. No landmines have been exported from this country for some considerable time. We have said that that moratorium will now be extended indefinitely.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-02_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Waverley: </B>   My Lords, what has been done to help with the clearance of mines?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-02_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, we have extended considerable assistance around the world. We have contributed some &#163;18.2 million to de-mining activities since 1991. We shall maintain our position as one of the world's leading contributors to such programmes.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Redesdale: </B>   My Lords, by exempting self-destructing mines are not the Government committing themselves to using such devices in the future? Will they not have to develop a whole new range of self-destructing mines?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-02_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, we are looking for alternatives to mines. I do not believe that the first part of the noble Lord's question was to the point. We intend to destroy almost half of our current stockpile of anti-personnel mines as soon as possible, without replacement. That should reassure the noble Lord.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Mason of Barnsley: </B>   My Lords, have we yet cleared all the landmines from the minefields in the Falkland Islands?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-02_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, no, some mines still remain in the Falkland Islands, although work there is continuing.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, bearing in mind that anti-personnel mines are a feature of runway-denial ordnance and the Government's answer to an earlier question, will the Government confirm that such ordnance is not allowed to be exported from this country?
<P>


<a name="column_321"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 321</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-02_spnew9"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord refers to the runway-denial weapon. That is classified as a mine, but it is not an anti-personnel mine. Its primary purpose is to deter, and, if necessary, to take out runway repair vehicles. We are reviewing at the moment the implications of the convention for all our mines. That weapon will come under the scope of the review we are undertaking.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-02_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I find it a little difficult to understand how the Government can support a world-wide ban on the use of landmines yet refuse to implement it themselves. Will the Minister give the House a categorical assurance that we shall not be importing any landmines to replace the stock that the Government are now destroying? If he cannot give that assurance, surely the Government's position is utterly hypocritical.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-02_spnew11"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, we intend to destroy almost half our current stockpile, and we have said that our Armed Forces will not be using anti-personnel mines in the future unless Ministers are satisfied that such use is essential. However, we need to retain the right to use anti-personnel mines in exceptional circumstances where there is no alternative in order to ensure the safety of our troops. That must remain a paramount consideration. I would not wish to rule out the import of anti-personnel mines in the future, any more than I would wish to rule out the purchase of such mines from British manufacturers.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that there is nothing hypocritical nor anything difficult about the issue, as suggested by the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone? Does he agree that the Government's attitude is entirely well founded? Is it right that we support an international convention but reserve the right to use such weapons if needs be in order to protect our troops until we get a ban?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-02_spnew13"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend. Without doubt, our decision is a sacrifice in military terms. We have undertaken not to use such weapons other than in exceptional circumstances. In many respects, the undertakings we have given go beyond the international conference decisions of a few days ago. The UK Armed Forces are not currently using these mines anywhere in the world; if they do so, that use will be severely circumscribed and responsible.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Mayhew: </B>   My Lords, the Government are right to show concern for the needs of the Armed Forces. Nevertheless, to claim as part of their policy that they are backing a worldwide ban on such mines is a little disingenuous. Are we really going to wait until the last, most recalcitrant nation signs the convention before adopting any change?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-02_spnew15"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, no, not at all. There are various ways and fora through which we can press for an international ban. One of the conclusions of the UN weaponry conference was that annual reviews should provide a forum for the international community <P>


<a name="column_322"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 322</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to monitor compliance with the convention. There are many other avenues we can pursue; for instance, resolutions at the UN General Assembly. This week the European Union is reviewing its joint action on landmines. Therefore, we can maintain pressure in an effective way.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Craig of Radley:  </B>   My Lords, can the Minister reassure the House that the Chief of the Defence Staff and the other chiefs of staff accept entirely the arrangements he has outlined to the House today; that is, insisting on ministerial control on the tactical and other use of mines?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-02_spnew17"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, yes. Ministers will take decisions based on expert advice. I believe it is right that Ministers should take the final decision.

<A NAME="60513-02_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What options they have been considering on the future of the Civil Service College.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-02_spnew18"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, the recent review of the Civil Service College was designed to ensure that the college achieves its full potential for developing the best traditions and international reputation of the Civil Service. A wide range of options has been considered, including continuing in the public sector and partial or full transfer of ownership to the private sector. The Government have concluded that the college should proceed within the public sector to develop new activities in partnership with the private sector; and will ensure that the essential link between the Civil Service and the Civil Service College is preserved.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-02_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to my noble friend for that Answer, which marks a considerable step forward from the answers which my noble friend Lady Miller was allowed to give on a previous occasion. Will he be good enough to communicate to others the suggestion that talk of partnership with the private sector in such a context and of considering various options is the kind of vagueness which provokes curiosity and suspicion rather than understanding?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-02_spnew20"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, we aim to please and we aim in particular to please my noble friend. He mentioned partnerships. I cannot go into too much detail at the moment but I can outline the ideas that we are considering. Clearly the college must be run commercially in order to cover its costs. The use of the college by departments and agencies tends to be somewhat seasonal and therefore it makes sense to explore the scope for better utilisation. The college already has partnership arrangements with Cranfield <P>


<a name="column_323"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 323</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>University and Manchester Business School. We wish to give that idea a boost in terms of both training and conference facilities.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-02_spnew21"></A><B> Lord Bruce of Donington: </B>   My Lords, are we to congratulate Her Majesty's Government on obeying one of the basic principles of management; that when something is functioning quite well leave it alone?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-02_spnew22"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, I believe that that principle could equally be applied to your Lordships' House. The Government wish to ensure that senior managers in the Civil Service receive the best possible training consistent with the interests of the taxpayers. In achieving that aim, we also wish to develop the full potential of the college and to enhance its reputation both at home and overseas. I believe that our plans will enable us to do that.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-02_spnew23"></A><B> Lord Bancroft: </B>   My Lords, may I echo the congratulations that have been bestowed on the Government for their decision in this case, as the Civil Service College is one of the main custodians and disseminators of professional public service values and should therefore self-evidently remain in the public service? Will the Minister comment on the hypothesis that this particular swallow might make a summer?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-02_spnew24"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, I do not need too much of a qualification to know to what the noble Lord is referring. I cannot give him further news about the subject of RAS, but I can say that the high reputation of the Civil Service College as a centre of excellence--and it is well regarded by its customers--will continue. It has full-time and contracted tutorial staff drawn from both the Civil Service and the private sector. The reputation that those people generate for the college speaks for itself.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-02_spnew25"></A><B> Lord Taylor of Blackburn: </B>   My Lords, did the Minister say that it all depended on the college being commercially viable? Do the Government believe that every training establishment and college must be commercially viable in order to exist? Surely we cannot always look at such colleges commercially.<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199596/ldhansrd/vo960513/text/60513-03.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-03_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, if the college does not cover its costs through charges to its customers, the taxpayers will not only bear the full costs but subsidise the college in competition with other providers of training. That cannot be right--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Of course it is.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-03_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, no, that cannot be right when one of the key policies of government is to improve the competitiveness and efficiency of both the public and private sectors. In the end, the college will succeed or fail on how many customers it attracts. It is succeeding by attracting customers not only from this country but from overseas. We want to see that continue.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry but I am getting a little lost and I wonder whether the Minister can help me. Is he saying that the college must make a profit in <P>


<a name="column_324"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 324</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>order to stay in the public sector; and is he saying that it will remain in the public sector but that it will try to find people to occupy the bedrooms when classes are down and on holiday; or is he saying something slightly different from those two statements? Looking at the situation from this side of the House, with more than 300 Conservative hereditary peers taking the Conservative Whip, may I venture to express the hope that the Civil Service College will continue to function with perhaps a greater degree of fairness, equity, efficiency and speed than does your Lordships' House?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-03_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, the key aim of our policy will be to construct a range of partnerships which will bring demonstrable benefits to both the college and potential private sector partners and at the same time bring in private sector expertise and finance as well as risk-sharing. Therefore, I believe that the second part of the noble Lord's first question reflects more accurately what we intend to do.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </B>   My Lords, will my noble friend show a little sympathy for the noble Lord, Lord Richard, who seems to have become rather lost in matters which are not in any way related to this Question?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, Horticulture Research International is currently the subject of a prior options review which the Government are still considering.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Chapple: </B>   My Lords, I hope that the Government will give some further thought to this matter because it is widely understood in the industry that the decision has been taken. That is causing great consternation in an organisation which is a flagship organisation of the industry and which has a worldwide reputation. The fear is that, if the Government act with undue haste, the organisation will be sold off piecemeal and the best of it will be lost.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I echo entirely the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Chapple, about the quality of HRI. It is an excellent organisation which is very well regarded by its customers and by the Government. We have taken no decision. I know that the noble Lord has a wide knowledge of this matter, not least because I believe that his daughter-in-law works for the organisation. I hope that he will feel able to reassure her that we have not yet taken a decision and we intend to do so in the interests of HRI to ensure that it has the best possible future.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Lord explain why the Government are doing any of this? We have a very important horticulture industry which is subject to intense international competition and which needs first-class research and development to back it. Although I am not an expert in the field, I believe that Horticulture Research International is a body of international standing. I could give the Government a list a mile long of useful things to do. Why are they spending their time on this matter? Why do they not let this body get on with what it is doing; let the horticulture industry get on with what it is doing; and find something else for themselves to do?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that at the end of the day, Horticulture Research International will feel that it has benefited from this process.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-03_spnew21"></A><B> Lord Sewel </B>   moved Amendment No. 1:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 1, line 19, at end insert (", from amongst persons nominated by, or by bodies appearing to the Secretary of State to represent the interests of, the Universities of Scotland, education authorities, colleges of further education, institutions of further education, central institutions, educational advisers, teachers employed in educational establishments and grant aided and independent schools").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60513-03_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I take this opportunity to welcome the Minister back from his recent visit to Aberdeen where he was no doubt doing his best to help to preserve an endangered species--and I hope not too successfully.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-03_para9"></a>Your Lordships will realise that Amendment No. 1 is of historic and, indeed, perhaps pre-historic importance as it makes reference to central institutions which, unfortunately perhaps, now no longer exist. There may be some who think that it would be better that they should continue to exist, but they do not.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-03_para10"></a>The part of the Bill dealing with the establishment of the Scottish qualifications authority is non-controversial. Indeed, I believe that it is welcomed broadly throughout Scotland and the education sector in Scotland. But there <P>


<a name="column_327"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 327</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is one difficulty with it which the amendment seeks to correct; that is, that the Bill as presently drafted leaves completely undefined the composition of the authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-03_para11"></a>That is important because it is of vital interest that the Scottish qualifications authority enjoys the confidence of all those involved in the examination process in Scotland and that there is confidence in the integrity and robustness of its deliberations and outcomes. Indeed, when this issue was put to the Minister, Mr. Robertson, when we were collecting evidence in Glasgow, he made the observation:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I think the reassurance that you are seeking there would be given in Debates in the Committee stage both in your House and in my own". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
When we discussed the clause in Committee, the Minister was only able to go so far as to say that the Secretary of State intended to appoint to the authority those people who would bring:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a breadth of experience covering a broad range of interests".--[Official Report, 23/4/96; col. CWH5.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That falls somewhat short of the need to ensure that those involved with education authorities, universities, further education, local authorities and all those who have a direct interest in the robustness and integrity of the examination system are incorporated into the Scottish qualifications authority so that they will have confidence that its deliberations are purposeful and effective.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-03_para12"></a>I hope that the Minister will be able to go further today and give some indication that the authority will have a degree of structure and will not be as unstructured and open as the Bill presently indicates. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, the amendment is one of a type that we have all seen before and has been put forward for the simple reason that what it proposes is generally necessary. We are trying to get some support for the new body and that means that it must be respected by those people whom it is supposed to be representing; namely, the educational establishment in Scotland. It is to be hoped that something similar to the amendment in the Bill would give greater authority and weight to the new examination authority so that those concerned will be able to give more authority to the relevant qualifications, which is something that everyone needs. All we are saying is that those people who actually know what is going on in education should be consulted. That is all that lies behind the amendment. I hope that the Minister will be able to accept the proposal or, indeed, something very like it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-04_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour: </B>   My Lords, I am rather intrigued by the amendment. Although I have never managed to take part in the proceedings on the Bill up to now, I am surprised that, in specifying the persons who should be included, the noble Lords who have tabled the amendment have not considered the appointment of someone from industry. I believe that in future there needs to be a slightly closer connection between industry and education than has been the case in the past. The other aspect which rather surprises me about <P>


<a name="column_328"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 328</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the amendment is the fact that the noble Lords concerned have included "the Universities of Scotland" in the text. However, to the best of my knowledge, the Bill has nothing to do with the university side of education in Scotland.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-04_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, the matter has already been well discussed on three occasions. It was discussed on Second Reading, when the Scottish Select Committee took evidence in Glasgow, as the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, mentioned, and, indeed, in Committee. The advantage of this new House of Lords procedure, which adds an extra stage to the consideration of Scottish legislation--a stage which takes place in Scotland--is that noble Lords will have an even better opportunity than before to hear what groups and individuals in Scotland want. Moreover, evidence can be placed on the record. In my view, in the case of this amendment, that has been extremely helpful.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-04_para0"></a>The amendment is in fact the same as one discussed in Committee. However, it is no worse for that because there was no opportunity to vote on that occasion. Therefore, I do not in any way chide noble Lords for tabling it again. If passed, the amendment would still allow the Secretary of State to choose and appoint most of the members of the body. I should tell my noble friend who has just spoken that the nominees would not be those appointed; they would be a number of people from whom the Secretary of State would make appointments. In that case, it is perhaps one degree better than my noble friend supposed.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-04_para1"></a>If the amendment were passed, it would still mean that the choice of the Secretary of State would be limited to people nominated by bodies listed on the face of the Bill. As my noble friend said, the list proposed still does not include--as was the case with the amendment tabled in Committee--anyone with experience as an employer or indeed in industry; nor, for that matter, does it include the Scottish Trades Union Congress, which I should have thought would, just like employers, have an interest in how young people are qualified for work in Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-04_para2"></a>Moreover, if even the principle of the amendment were adopted, members of the new authority, having been nominated by a certain body, would tend to see themselves as representatives. As Mr. Miller, who has experience as a chairman of the existing bodies which will come together under the new authority--namely, the Scottish Examination Board and SCOTVEC--told us in evidence, that tends to make for less good and balanced discussion than does a group of individuals appointed because of their wide background of experience. That is a better way than forming a body from nominees.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-04_para3"></a>In evidence, various groups made plain to the Select Committee the importance that they placed on the membership of the body. That was extremely understandable and was something that was very much emphasised. Indeed, great emphasis was placed on the need for the Secretary of State to consult on the matter. Clearly it is crucial that the membership should be <P>


<a name="column_329"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 329</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>properly balanced and that the views of those with an interest should be taken fully into account in deciding the membership.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-04_para4"></a>As a result of discussion of the amendment in Committee on 23rd April, my noble friend the Minister put on record (at col. CWH 6 and 7 of Hansard) the fact that there will be significant consultation. My noble friend also said--and here we read between the lines--that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"local authorities have an interest that will require to be properly represented".--[Official Report, 23/4/96; col. CWH 6.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-04_para5"></a>I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, will not press the amendment. However, if he decides to do so, I hope that the House will not accept it. When he replies, I wonder whether the noble Lord can tell us--he may think that this is a naughty question, but it is one that I believe to be relevant--whether, should his party be elected to government at the general election, it would return to the system that was used before 1979, when important bodies like the new SQA were put in the hands of the nominees of interested bodies rather than those chosen by the Secretary of State of the day? I have been a member of many such bodies and I know how that system worked. I trust that we shall not see a return to it. That is one reason why I hope that the House will reject the amendment.

<A NAME="60513-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Lyell: </B>   My Lords, I should like to follow my noble friend and neighbour so that the voice of Angus can perhaps be heard in the House this afternoon. I listened to the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, and what he said made me think about many such amendments which are installed or, although I do not believe the noble Lord used the word, put on the face of the Bill. The proposed amendment has one particular danger, in that any group or organisation might feel deprived or left out if it were not included. Indeed, such a group or organisation might be upset if the amendment were accepted. I take the point made by my noble friend Lord Balfour, but I wonder whether both he and the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, would consider glancing at Clause 5 of the Bill. It seems to me that subsections (1) and (2) of that clause will certainly cover the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, without necessarily ring-fencing those persons who might or might not be fitted to give advice.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-04_para6"></a>My noble friend Lord Balfour made some excellent remarks. I did follow the previous proceedings on the Bill, but I have one query regarding Scottish qualifications. Are such qualifications applicable only to young people under 16? Alternatively, are they applicable to someone like myself? I am happy to declare an interest as I am a member of the chartered accountants of Scotland. Considering those among us who have taken qualifications of that nature, I certainly think that Clauses 2 and 5 would cover all the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Sewel. However, if I am totally wrong in that respect, perhaps my noble friend the Minister can put me right.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   My Lords, my concern about the amendment is probably the same as that <P>


<a name="column_330"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 330</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Lyell. I say that because in legislation, where, as here, there is a list of people who may nominate persons to be considered by the Secretary of State, is it not the case that any organisation not included is thereby excluded? Therefore, such a provision could be rather restrictive.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-04_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Scottish Office   (The Earl of Lindsay): </B>  My Lords, I am grateful for the clear explanation given by the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, when moving the amendment. I am also grateful to him for the welcome that he extended to me on my return from Aberdeen. However, I should point out to the noble Lord--although I am sure he realises it--that we are not an endangered species; indeed, we are in good heart and our numbers are strong.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-04_para7"></a>In the Moses Room I assured the Committee of the intention to consult widely before making appointments to the SQA. I am happy to confirm that assurance today to the House. It may be helpful if I repeat the words that my noble friend Lady Carnegy recalled. Local authorities have an interest in this matter that will require to be properly represented on the SQA. I hope that it is obvious to all noble Lords that there are certain organisations which would probably be consulted by the Secretary of State before appointments were made to the SQA. CoSLA would probably be one of the principal consultees, as would the Association of Directors of Education in Scotland, the Association of Scottish Colleges, the Committee of Scottish Higher Education Principals, the Confederation of British Industry in Scotland, and the STUC, which is also an important source of advice. My noble friend Lady Carnegy referred to its omission from the list. The Association of Scottish Chambers of Commerce also springs to mind. We have given an assurance as regards consultation and a number of bodies will probably be included. The noble Lady, Lady Saltoun of Abernethy, made the vital point that in specifying a list one automatically excludes others. I hope that I have reassured those who have been worried about this matter since the Committee stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-04_para8"></a>The SQA will be an important new public body and it is vital that individuals of the right calibre and mix of skills and experience are appointed to its board of management. In order to achieve that, we shall consult widely and take full account of the recommendations of the Nolan Committee and the code of practice issued by the Commissioner for Public Appointments. The range of bodies will certainly include the interests currently recognised within the existing membership of the SEB and SCOTVEC, as I indicated.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-04_para9"></a>This goes beyond the list suggested in the amendment and embraces also employer interests which we consider equally important. My noble friend Lord Balfour pointed out the importance of industry. Noble Lords cannot seriously suggest that employers do not have an interest in a qualified workforce. I am sure noble Lords will agree that employers have a vital and particular interest in the SQA's role in work-related and work-based qualifications. We also see merit in going beyond those currently represented; for instance, to consider the interests of parents.
<P>


<a name="column_331"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 331</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-04_para10"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ewing, expressed concern at an earlier stage that a requirement for names suggested in consultation to be scrutinised by a selection panel would make the consultation meaningless. I do not believe that to be so. The purpose of the consultation is to provide a field of names from which members can be selected. The involvement of a selection panel, including independent members, as required by the Commissioner for Public Appointments will, on the contrary, add value to the process. I am also happy to repeat my assurance, made in Committee, that the consultation process will be significant in the final composition of the SQA.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-04_para11"></a>I recognise, however, that representation on the authority for particular groups is behind much of what the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, put to the House today. As I explained in Committee, echoed by my noble friend Lady Carnegy, we do not believe that an approach based on guaranteed constituencies is appropriate or indeed necessary. We remain firmly of that view. I cannot therefore give assurances that specific organisations will supply one or more members. However, I have given categoric assurances that it is our intention that the members of the authority will have the breadth of experience and knowledge necessary to cover a broad range of interests. In this context, I recognise the helpful contribution made by the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, at Committee stage, and indeed today. In bringing to bear his experience as Vice Principal of the University of Aberdeen he pointed out that the authority needed to carry the confidence of its customers. We entirely agree. We endorse that view and would expect the composition of the authority to reflect the interests of its main customer groups. This of course would include further and higher education, schools, local authorities and employers.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-04_para12"></a>However, that does not mean that we can accept the amendment. It is too narrow, and it excludes the interests of industry, employers and parents. As the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, pointed out, it also includes "central institutions", a term which no longer has statutory significance. I do not believe therefore that the interests of those who will use the services of SQA would be best served by restricting the scope of the Secretary of State to appoint its members. Rather I feel that by allowing flexibility a broader range of relevant interests will be covered and indeed represented on the authority. As my noble friend Lady Carnegy said, we want balance and consultation, and we want to reflect the views of those who have an interest in the matter. I wish to reassure my noble friend Lord Lyell that as regards age the SQA is totally flexible. One cannot be too old as regards the SQA. In the light of the reassurances and the clarification I have given, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, will be happy to withdraw his amendment.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="column_333"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 333</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>who support the party opposite--and not even all of them--believe that the voucher scheme is a wise or good way of improving the provision of education for under-fives. Local authorities will be at a great disadvantage if they assume that they will have the same number of children in the nursery schools. They make arrangements for staff and accommodation on the basis of the &#163;1,100 that will be given as a voucher for the children going to the school.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-05_para10"></a>We have still not had an answer from the Minister to the important point put by my noble friend Lord Ewing of Kirkford. It is a simple point, and I believe that it encompasses the whole argument. For example, two children go to a local authority nursery school. One lady decides that she is able to top up the &#163;1,100 and transfer the child to an approved, private nursery school. Having spent a great deal of money organising staff, accommodation, the apparatus for the morning milk break, and so on, for the children, the local authority will be left with those costs still to pay off, although it will not have the same number of children going to the school.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-05_para11"></a>We believe that the provision will be extremely divisive. My noble friend spoke about two children going together daily to a nursery school who are suddenly split up, one going home at lunch-time, the other attending a private nursery school all day until three or four o'clock in the afternoon. Therefore, at a very early age those children would be separated and feel that there was a difference between them; and that is obviously not good.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-05_para12"></a>I do not wish to spend time on the issue. We went into it in great detail at Committee stage. We have had representations from almost every educational body and involved parent group in Scotland. I can only repeat to the Minister that no one wants the scheme. I can say quite positively that even if the scheme were in full operation by the time that the Government change, it will certainly not be implemented or continued by this side of the House.

The scheme does not have great support. It was called bureaucratic, wasteful and divisive. There was no support for the measure in the evidence. Those who run private nursery schools managed indifference. With that degree of support from those who will use such a scheme, I suggest that there is a strong case for getting rid of the provision.

It would take the guts out of Part II of the Bill and would remove the proposed new parental involvement in children's nursery education.

<A NAME = "60513-05_para14"></a>I was surprised that the amendment was accepted on the Marshalled List at Committee stage. I am even more surprised at Report stage when noble Lords have the ability to divide the House. It seems to me a highly unsuitable proposal in this unelected House, in particular since the Bill has not yet been through the House of Commons.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-05_para15"></a>The objections of the two parties opposite to the proposed voucher scheme have been well and fully argued at each stage of the Bill. It is true that when various bodies gave evidence in Glasgow, few supported the principle. They seemed fearful of the change that the scheme might bring. I was far more fearful before discussion on the Bill began than I am now, having seen the detail. The scheme seems highly workable.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-05_para16"></a>I believe that those on the Front Benches opposite have a prejudice against giving influence to parents in the education of their children. They have a prejudice against allowing parents a direct effect where new or extended nursery provision is established. They are clearly prejudiced against allowing parents to affect the quality of what is provided through their own choice; and prejudiced, too, against extending what public money can provide by bringing private money into partnership with public money.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-05_para17"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, was worried. He gave an example of where a parent might top up the voucher to a value which would enable the child to go to a private nursery. He asked what that would do to the local authority's planning. Does it not occur to him that there may be private nurseries about which parents are not satisfied? They may wish their children to attend local authority nursery education. The movement can be both ways. That is what choice is about.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-05_para18"></a>The room for manoeuvre for local authorities in their funding of nurseries is great because a large amount of the money spent at present on nurseries will remain with the local authorities. The local authorities will have flexibility. Only a proportion of their expenditure will be passed by the voucher to the parent to choose where he or she spends that money. It does not seem to me to be a problem, although I understand that it is a fear enunciated by councillors because at present local authorities plan with considerable certainty. Virtually all nursery provision in its area is in the hands of the local authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-05_para19"></a>I believe that if this House is to remain a scrutinising Chamber (if it is allowed to remain at all) its duty is not to remove the guts of a Bill--not to remove the main purpose of a large part of the Bill. Whatever the lack of information about the voucher scheme and satisfaction as regards whether it is designed to work well, I hope that under no circumstances will noble Lords agree that this clause does not stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-05_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Sempill: </B>   My Lords, having been present at the Scottish Select Committee in Glasgow, I believe that the oral evidence, especially in relation to the voucher scheme, has to be accorded the respect of this House. The scheme is unpopular and, more importantly, is deemed unworkable. However, that view may change depending on the outcome of the four pilot tests.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-05_para20"></a>Strong reservations were voiced about the length of time allocated to these tests, especially in view of the Government's intention to launch the system a year after the tests have started. Representations showed that almost all local authorities are opposed to the scheme in one way or another. Concern was expressed regarding the quality and standards of the education which might be supplied by new providers. The system was criticised for being too bureaucratic. The amount of &#163;1,100 was considered insufficient, especially in regard to children with special needs.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-05_para21"></a>There is also an absence of a clear curricular framework and, as has already been mentioned, the scheme has been seen as socially divisive. A survey of 377 primary schools carried out by the Scottish Parent Teacher Council showed that 55 per cent. had used local authority nursery schools. That compared favourably with the 55.9 per cent. of all four year-olds in local authority nurseries, as measured by the Scottish Office Statistical Bulletin. The survey showed that 77 per cent. would have opted for local authority nurseries as their ideal choice, the problem being availability of the local facility, not lack of choice.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-05_para22"></a>Both Lothian and Fife have adequate provision and consequently have a high percentage of four year-olds at their schools. The scheme does not cater for that lack of facility in other areas of Scotland. I grant that it gives parental choice--which I assume is the Government's intention--which will help to stimulate private investment in the provision of new pre-school facilities. Unfortunately, I do not believe that the numbers stack up. Less densely populated areas will not attract new providers, and that is where the lack of pre-school facility is most evident. If 55 per cent. of all children receive pre-school education, I should have thought that the proposed extra investment of &#163;30 million should be used to address the needs of the not-so-fortunate 45 per cent.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-05_para23"></a>Finally, I do not believe that the scheme will increase nursery places, nor that sufficient time has been allocated to test it properly.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="60513-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lyell: </B>   My Lords, I did not attend the session described by the noble Lord, Lord Sempill. He made one or two points towards the end of his remarks about rural areas, and I can think of places like Sutherland, Argyll and Inverness where there are enormous open spaces. My noble friend and neighbour Lady Carnegy and I live in Tayside, an area which was not mentioned by the noble Lord but which is broadly similar to Grampian, which is well known to the noble Lords, Lord Sewel and Lord Ewing of Kirkford. In Kirriemuir and Northmuir--my neck of the woods--there is adequate provision for children, but Clause 23 could give assistance to parents where I live. It is helpful to have the facility of the option provided by Clause 23.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-06_para0"></a>I was interested in the opening remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Sempill. When the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, winds up he may be able to enlighten me about the questions of divisiveness and, above all, timing. He described two children going to school side-by-side, with one leaving at the end of the morning <P>


<a name="column_336"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 336</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and the other at the end of the afternoon. Many people on these Benches think that I am going back to my youth; that is not necessarily so, but I know the span of children's attention at the age of four. I have to tell the noble Lord, Lord Sempill, that it is interesting that, as noble Lords are aware, in Scotland, at the start of the school year in August, at lunchtime--12 o'clock--one cannot get near schools. For the first six or 10 weeks of a child's school career it is considered reasonable for the child to attend only in the morning. If that is the pattern in primary and infant schools, I wonder whether the arguments of the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, about divisiveness and one child leaving in the morning and another staying on in the afternoon are relevant. Perhaps he will be able to enlighten me when he winds up.

<P>
<A NAME="60513-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Goold: </B>   My Lords, as I said at Committee stage, I am surprised at the pessimism of noble Lords on the Front Benches opposite. At present in Scotland only a minority of children enjoy pre-school education. For every child who, according to the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, may leave and go to the private sector with a topping up fee, I believe that, if the local authority nursery education is good, several will go to the local authority nursery schools. Parents will be given a voucher; they may never previously have had any encouragement to send their children to a pre-school nursery. They will want to use the vouchers. If the schools are good, I believe that the local authorities will gain far more. Yes, new private schools may well be set up, but I believe that more people will want to send their children to established local authority schools if those schools are good.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-06_para1"></a>I too attended the meeting in Glasgow and had the honour of chairing the splendid Select Committee. I heard the opposition that came from local authorities, but we must realise that there is always opposition to anything new or radical. Many of the best ideas that have come from the Government over the past 15 years have been fiercely opposed by the Opposition. Yet they are now accepted by New Labour as policies which it would wish to follow. The voucher system for nursery education is the same. It should receive a fair trial, and I believe that the outcome will be beneficial to all pre-school children in the country.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   My Lords, I did not sit on the Select Committee in Glasgow, any more than the noble Lord, Lord Lyell. However, I have read the evidence and noted that one argument was that the sum of &#163;1,100 a year was inadequate to fund a nursery school place for a child. Therefore, either the local authority would be out of pocket or private suppliers would not be able to afford to start up. Alternatively, parents would have to top up the voucher and therefore it would be nursery education for the well off and no education for the poor.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-06_para2"></a>I have a grandson aged four who lives in Edinburgh. He goes to nursery school for three hours a day, five days a week. For that, the fees are approximately &#163;520 per term. According to my arithmetic, that works <P>


<a name="column_337"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 337</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>out at &#163;1,560 a year and, also according to my arithmetic, at that fee &#163;1,100 a year would provide either 2.5 hours a day--which is as long as some children are able to concentrate--for four days a week or 3.5 hours a day for three days a week. As I understand it, the scheme was not intended to provide full-time education. At the outset it was only intended to provide part-time nursery education. Apart from the problem of disabled children who have learning difficulties, it is possible that &#163;1,100 may be perfectly adequate.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   My Lords, I have slipped unobtrusively from my seat on the Front Bench to where many noble Lords consider I should be, a seat on the Back Bench. I am not sure that the leader of my own party does not consider that to be my place. It is important that I should make my position clear at this stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-06_para3"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, is right: Clause 23 is the crucial, central feature of the Bill. Throughout our debates I have argued strongly from the Front Bench against the proposal to introduce a voucher scheme for nursery education.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-06_para4"></a>The noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, said that the &#163;1,100 is meant to purchase approximately two hours of nursery education. In her words, that is all that a child can stand in any case.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   My Lords, perhaps the noble Lord will give way. I said two-and-a-half hours a day four days a week, or three-and-a-half hours a day three days a week. Children vary as to their concentration span.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-06_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   My Lords, as I understood her, the noble Lady was arguing that, by and large, that was what a four year-old child could accept. If that is the case, why on earth is there a provision in the Bill to allow parents to send their children to private rather than local authority nurseries? That is a noteworthy point. A provision in the Bill allows people sending their children to private nurseries to top up the &#163;1,100. They can therefore choose to send their child to a private nursery not for two-and-a-half hours a day four or five days a week or three hours a day for four days a week, but for five or six hours a day for five days a week.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-06_para5"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, will say that that is a matter for parental choice. I suggest a simple solution to the whole question. If we want to give parents real choice, let us leave it to them to decide whether they want the voucher. Let us leave it to parents to apply for the voucher. But of course that is not part of the scheme; parents do not have to apply.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-06_para6"></a>In advertisements throughout the national press for a company to run the scheme, the scheme is quite clearly defined. Parents of every four year-old in this country will have a voucher sent to them whether or not they want it. That is not parental choice. This suggestion was laughed off in the beginning, but I challenge the Government. If we want to give parents a genuine choice let us leave it to them to decide whether they want the voucher. Let them decide whether they turn to the local authority in areas where, as the noble Lord, <P>


<a name="column_338"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 338</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord Sempill, said there is adequate provision. For example, in Fife and Lothian, where there is over 96 per cent. provision, parents could decide whether to go to Fife central headquarters or Lothian council headquarters or their outfield offices to ask for a voucher. The Government will not do that of course. It would be a negation of the very principle they seek to introduce.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-06_para7"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Goold, said, a number of areas throughout Scotland have inadequate provision. The Islands are a very good example. Anybody who believes that a voucher scheme will cure the problem of inadequate provision in those areas completely fails to understand, first, the culture and, secondly, their rural nature. By and large, because of the widespread nature of communities, children have to travel very long distances between home and school even for primary and secondary education, let alone nursery education. A &#163;1,100 voucher will not persuade a mother or father in the Western Isles, the Outer Hebrides or the Orkneys and Shetland to send a four year-old child between 20 and 50 miles to a nursery class. The suggestion is ludicrous. Yet that is what the Government pretend.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-06_para8"></a>I do not believe the Government themselves think the scheme will be implemented. I do not believe for a minute that sensible people such as the noble Earl the Minister, who has the unfortunate task of trying to pilot this Bill through the House, think that that is a sensible proposition. The problem in the rural areas of Scotland is not linked to the councils. It is not that councils do not want to supply nursery education. It is simply a matter of the distance children have to travel to reach the facilities provided.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-06_para9"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, made a constitutional point; namely, that the Opposition's suggestion that Part II of the Bill should not stand part would "take the guts" out of the Bill; it is a wrecking amendment when the Bill has not been before another place. Of course it has not been before another place--it started its passage here in this Chamber. It is not a defence for a government supporter to say that if a Bill begins its passage in this place we should not make any fundamental changes to it because it has not been to the other place. If the Bill is so fundamental, it should have started its passage in the other place.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-06_para10"></a>I believe with all my heart and say in all sincerity that the voucher scheme is destined to failure even before the four pilot areas are tested. There is no guarantee whatsoever from the Government that if the experiment in those four areas should fail, they would then withdraw the scheme. I do not believe that they would, and for one simple reason. They have ignored all the evidence given to the Select Committee of this House which met in Glasgow (of which I was not a member) and have gone ahead, head down, determined to implement the scheme. There is little hope that if the pilot project is a failure, the Government will withdraw the scheme. They will not.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-06_para11"></a>To the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, I say with great respect that there is a fundamental difference between those who sit on these Benches and the Government's supporters. This whole question has <P>


<a name="column_339"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 339</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>absolutely nothing to do with the provision of nursery education. It has everything to do with dogma. No professional educationist the length and breadth of the country--some of whom must be Conservative supporters--supports the measure. It may well be that such people are very reluctant to come out and declare their support for the Conservative Party. I have a great deal of sympathy and full understanding for them in their very difficult position. However, not one has supported the proposal. Had there been any support, the Government would have trumpeted it from the rooftops.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-06_para12"></a>As I have told the noble Earl the Minister, he can make a name for himself. All right, he will be sacked; but we will look after him! He can stand up, accept this amendment and get rid of this absolutely madcap idea. In that way he would write himself into the educational history books of Scotland as having done something for our four year-olds. This proposal is an absolute disaster. I urge my noble friends to test the opinion of the House on this issue. It is crucial to the future of nursery education in Scotland.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

Does he believe, whether a Bill begins in this House or in another place--I am glad that the Bill began in this House because we have examined it with great care so far--that an unelected Chamber should remove the guts of the most important part of a Bill?

<A NAME = "60513-07_para0"></a>It seems to me that he is misleading the House on this matter, as when he joined in a number of misleading arguments that we have heard before--for example, that parents have to use their voucher. They do not; they have their piece of paper but do not have to use it. He made a number of misleading comments to which perhaps at this stage I should not respond. But does he believe that this House should remove the guts of a Bill whether or not it has been before the House of Commons?

<A NAME="60513-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, I feel that the noble Baroness is getting a little over-excited. I am not guilty of misleading your Lordships or anyone else. I explained before that during my term as a Scottish Office Minister there were six or seven press officers. There are now something like 44 in the Scottish Office. There are four press officers for every Scottish Tory MP. The noble Baroness complained that I am misleading the people of Scotland, when in the Scottish Office there are four press officers for every Tory MP in Scotland. I plead not guilty to what I regard as a very grave charge of misleading your Lordships.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-07_para1"></a>With regard to the constitutional question, I take a rather simple but profound view. If your Lordships' House is asked to examine legislation, we have every right to amend it. Otherwise, why are we asked to examine the legislation? That we have no right to amend <P>

<A NAME="60513-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, history is catching up with many of us today. The noble Lord, Lord Lyell, referred to Grampian and Tayside and I have to tell him that he helped to abolish those authorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-07_para2"></a>It is difficult to overestimate the importance of this part of the Bill. For the first time a Bill seeks to ensure that the provision of a major service is achieved through a voucher scheme. Nothing at all like that has been done in the area not only of education policy but of social policy generally. It is a major change in the approach of the Government to the provision of major services. Therefore, it requires very close and detailed scrutiny.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-07_para3"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ewing, made a principled objection to the voucher approach. By introducing vouchers, we move into uncharted waters and there are dangerous rocks ahead. Let me mention just a few. One that concerns me is the whole area of fraud. The Audit Commission has already drawn attention to the need to have in place extremely robust and powerful procedures to guard against fraud. I find it extremely difficult to see how we can have a scheme which minimises to acceptable levels the opportunity for fraud.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-07_para4"></a>If there are unscrupulous providers, what is to prevent some deal being done whereby the person holding the voucher (which cannot be cashed for &#163;1,100) can obtain fewer sessions than the face value of the voucher would secure and have a cash settlement as well from the provider? It is difficult to see the kind of procedures that would prevent such fraud taking place. We need a clear statement from the Government, with the support of the Comptroller and Auditor General, about how that major kind of abuse is likely to be prevented.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-07_para5"></a>The Government also argue that the voucher scheme will increase provision and bring new players into the market. I do not believe that is likely to be the case. The voucher scheme is pitched at the level of &#163;1,100, which, as we have been told on a number of occasions, covers basically the recurrent revenue costs of a half-time provision. It does not cover the capital costs. So it is unlikely that new players will enter the market when the price of the voucher does not enable them to cover their capital expenditure in setting up the new nurseries. There will certainly be some slack. There may well be a marginal increase but not a significant increase.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-07_para6"></a>The perversity of the scheme is that, by introducing the &#163;1,100 voucher, far from increasing the provision, it may have the effect, if provision remains roughly constant, of allowing the price level to rise. So in the private sector, the price level of private provision may increase. I think that is not what the Government want but, clearly, it is one of the dangers that beset a voucher approach.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-07_para7"></a>There is also the danger that in some areas there may be a reduction in provision from the present levels. The noble Lord, Lord Sempill, made reference to the difficulties of rural areas. Let me repeat the example that I gave in Committee. In a rural area, a local authority may just be able economically to make provision for one <P>


<a name="column_341"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 341</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>nursery class, say of 25 children. Quite understandably, perhaps because of the area in which the father travels to work, it may be more convenient for two or three of those children to be taken to a private nursery school and the voucher used to gain access. I do not criticise the parents for doing that. But by taking those children out of the local authority nursery school and taking money with them, there is a danger that the local authority nursery school will no longer be economically viable. So there is the bizarre situation whereby the choice exercised by the few denies provision for the many. That is the situation that can stem from this ill conceived and ill begotten idea of nursery provision.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-07_para8"></a>We have seen in Scotland the model for effective nursery provision. The noble Lords, Lord Sempill and Lord Ewing, have already drawn attention to it. Basically, it builds upon the strengths and example of local authority provision, certainly complemented and in partnership with the private sector. It is not done through a madcap voucher scheme.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-07_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Ewing, offered me a place in the history books should I decide to abandon this part of the Bill, which I have no intention of doing. I should tell him that in an area of Scotland that he knows well, I am already in the local education history books. I shall soon have 25 per cent. of an entire primary school because five of my children will all be attending the same school at the same time. I intend to keep that very good local authority primary school going by maintaining that sort of proportion.
<P>

<A NAME="60513-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   My Lords, has the noble Earl advised his wife of that?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-07_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, I believe in partnership.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-07_para9"></a>I was interested in the exchange between the noble Lord, Lord Ewing, and my noble friend Lady Carnegy on the constitutional point. I do not disagree with the noble Lord's riposte. However, in defence of my noble friend, I point out that the other place passed the English Bill which deals with nursery voucher provision and therefore backed the principle of nursery voucher provision. For those who, like my noble friend, see a constitutional problem, that may be of relevance.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-07_para10"></a>I point out to the noble Lords, Lord Carmichael, Lord Addington, Lord Sempill and others, including the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, that there are people in Scotland who are looking forward to the provision of nursery vouchers. Many parents are seeking the provision. The pilot scheme launched in East Renfrewshire illustrates an interesting reaction. When the scheme was announced, the telephone system could not cope with the calls coming in from interested parents. When my honourable friend the Member for Aberdeen, South, the Scottish Education Minister, recently visited on the helpline, it was swamped with calls from outside the pilot project area asking why they could not be included in the scheme.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-07_para11"></a>Parents want the voucher system. It may be that there are elements of the existing educational structure which do not want to contemplate such change. But the <P>


<a name="column_342"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 342</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>beneficiaries--the parents and the children themselves--have a much more positive approach. Other organisations also support the idea. The Gaelic playgroup movement in particular expressed a keen interest in the voucher system. The noble Lord, Lord Ewing, referred to the Western Isles as being a place where it would have little relevance. We know that it will have great relevance, not only for journeys of 40 miles or more but also to generate playgroups serving specific communities such as the Gaelic community.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-07_para12"></a>I draw attention also to the Scottish Consumer Council, which paid tribute to the opportunities of wider involvement which the voucher initiative will offer. There are people in Scotland who want the voucher system to be installed. The four pilot project areas--I address this point especially to the noble Lord, Lord Sempill, because he had anxieties about certain rural areas and the practicality of the voucher system--are deliberately located across a range of different types of community and geography. We want to find the rocks in the water, if they exist, to which the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, referred; we want to iron out the problems and ensure that the benefits the scheme can bring are delivered.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-07_para13"></a>My noble friend Lord Goold put his finger on the point when he said that radical ideas are always treated with suspicion. I hasten to add that they are not always treated with wisdom. The witnesses who gave the so-called "evidence" to the Select Committee in Glasgow were speculating about a scheme that did not exist. To categorise it as "evidence" may be misleading. They were seeking to speculate as to what their response would be to something which did not yet exist.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-07_para14"></a>Fifteen years ago noble Lords on the Benches opposite would have made the same speeches about the sale of council houses to sitting tenants as we have heard today. They resisted those reforms to the last ditch, yet in Scotland the system has produced 315,000 home-owners and increased home ownership from 35 per cent. to 57 per cent. Similarly, noble Lords opposite would have spoken against the system of school placing requests which since 1981 has enabled over 240,000 parents--90 per cent. of all the parents who applied--to exercise choice in selecting the school that they want their child to attend. They would have spoken against school boards and even report cards. The dogma which the noble Lord, Lord Ewing, accuses us of having is one that they hold in terms of opposing parental choice wherever it occurs.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<FONT SIZE=3>conscientious parents, even though they are not consistent as politicians. It comes down to choice. Many parents will opt for local authority nursery provision, just as many council tenants choose not to buy houses. All three elements of education provision, whether in the public, voluntary or private sectors, will benefit from the scheme. They will be winners and not losers. Competition will improve provision and excellence. The new provision will come into being in response to market demands.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-08_para1"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Sempill, mentioned the Scottish Parent Teacher Council study that suggested that 77 per cent. of parents wanted local authority provision. That is fine. We want the excellent reputation of local authorities to continue to attract children to their education systems. We expect the voucher scheme not only to increase the number of children who attend local authority schools but also to increase the provision for those children. However, a recent survey by the Scottish Independent Nursery Association suggested that 65 per cent. of parents want independent nurseries. I have no view on that. It is entirely up to parents whether they go to the public, the private or the voluntary sector, which is a vital sector, for the pre-school education of their children. It is parental choice that matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-08_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ewing, for the second time, made great play of the fact that we are hardly offering parents choice if we are sending them vouchers. First, I doubt the logic of that argument. Secondly, we are not sending parents vouchers; we are sending them application forms for vouchers. Should any parents not want to be involved in the nursery voucher scheme, they simply need not fill in the application form. I believe that answers the noble Lord's concerns absolutely.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-08_para3"></a>Many research studies have shown that early years education brings significant benefits to children in terms of both social development and learning capability. Pre-school education gives children a head start, and the Government's pre-school voucher initiative aims to make that head start available to every child. It need not be socio-divisive. Indeed, we wonder why noble Lords opposite are convinced that it must be socio-divisive.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-08_para4"></a> Both the noble Lords, Lord Carmichael and Lord Sewel, imagined hypothetical situations where, because of the nursery voucher system, a number of parents opted for a different type of provision. If we relate that hypothesis to the facts, we can assume that five children in an area attend a local authority school. I remind the House that 55 per cent. of four year-olds at the moment receive local authority pre-school education. With the advent of vouchers, if two of those five children are taken to another source of provision by the parents because they have that choice, there are probably an additional four children in the area who will opt for provision from that local authority for the first time. For every two children that may leave the school, there is a huge pool of four year-old children in Scotland at present who are not receiving pre-school education but who will be given access to pre-school education for the first time by the voucher system.
<P>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 344</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-08_para5"></a>I stress that it is not as though the private sector is the only sector which charges parents for the education of their children. I will not recount an article that appeared in the Scottish section of The Times Educational Supplement on Friday. It dealt with the upset felt by parents and others because Glasgow, Inverclyde and West Dumbarton are proposing to charge up to &#163;70 a week for their local authority provision of pre-school education where, for instance, children come in from outside the local authority area. The public sector is also indulging in charging parents, which in some instances will prevent those parents from continuing to have access to that local authority education. Vouchers will enable those parents to continue to enjoy that provision.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-08_para6"></a>I would also remind the House that the voucher initiative can be implemented using existing powers contained within Section 73 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. Part II of the Bill does not introduce the ability to provide nursery vouchers for the parents of four year-old children. What it does is to introduce precisely tailored powers with associated provisions that will bring quality, public accountability and efficiency to how provision is made. It will bring protection for parents, for the children and indeed for those where information about their status as being parents of four year-olds is taken from social security records. It is therefore essential that we add to the existing provision, which enables the Secretary of State to grant vouchers to providers of pre-school education, the vital parts of Part II which will ensure quality and other necessary measures.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-08_para7"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Sewel, continues to be concerned about the dangers of fraud. I explained in great length in Committee that we are adamant that fraud will be fought with all the most sophisticated and modern measures. The voucher system cannot be susceptible either to significant fraud or to significant bureaucracy. I stress to the noble Lord, Lord Sempill, that a management company will administer the scheme at very low cost. We are confident that the cost of issuing and redeeming the vouchers will not exceed 2 per cent. of the total voucher programme. The scheme will be a remarkably cost-effective provision. As regards fraud, we have to, and will, employ robust procedures to ensure that no taxpayers' money is wasted. We in the Scottish Office and in government have to account for those procedures and will take on board any comments or suggestions made by the public accounts watchdogs which scrutinise the disbursement of public money.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-08_para8"></a>Clause 23 has a key part to play here. It empowers the Secretary of State to pay grants and with the other provisions of Part II of the Bill to provide the quality we are looking for. In addition, it provides that the Secretary of State may by regulation prescribe the children in respect of whom such grants can be made. It is a very simple and central clause; it is a very simple and central part of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-08_para9"></a>I was grateful to the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, for explaining from, as she said, her first-hand experience as a grandmother the costs that arise and the kind of provision that is offered to parents of young children. I can remind the House and indeed my noble friend <P>


<a name="column_345"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 345</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord Lyell that there is a whole variety of educational provision for four year-olds. Some parents will choose fairly long sessions for their children which are of a fairly low input in terms of educational material. One thinks of playgroups. We are not talking about child care; we are talking about structured activities. There are other parents who will go for the half day or part-time option which has greater emphasis on actual education.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-08_para10"></a>As various noble Lords have pointed out, with the average education span of a child, if education rather than the less formal playgroup is the main purpose, it is quite right that the part-time approach is pursued. However, we are confident that the &#163;1,100, voucher will broadly cover the costs of the average provision of this kind of education for children. Recent Audit Commission studies in England and Wales, which I quoted in Committee, confirm our confidence that &#163;1,100 vouchers will cover substantially the costs of either of those routes. I also dealt in Committee with a query raised by the noble Lord, Lord Sewel. The providers, be they in the voluntary sector, the private sector or the public sector, will be able to use the vouchers to help off-set the cost of loans and other sources of capital investment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-08_para11"></a>It is very important that we understand the basic facts underlying Part II. The Government are determined that we provide all parents of four year-olds with the means to supply their own children with pre-school education if that is their wish. We are determined that the vouchers initiative should support diversity of provision across the different sectors of providers. Our initiative will give parents choice because that will lead to more responsive services and a strengthening of the mixed economy of pre-school education. I am disappointed to find noble Lords opposite in both main opposition parties so opposed to parental choice.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-08_para12"></a>The Government are confident that the voucher system represents the best means of ensuring the expansion we all desire. There are some 27,000 four year-olds in Scotland who are currently not going through local authority nursery schools. We want all those children to be stimulated into schooling. By allowing the Secretary of State to make grants for pre-school education, Clause 23 would allow the creation of a broad and quality oriented range of providers.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-08_para13"></a>No political chamber in the world attaches more importance to or spends more time on discussing matters concerning the family than does this House. The crucial means of supporting the family is to give decision-making powers to parents from the very beginning of children's education. Parental involvement is the best way of enhancing contact between parents, teachers and children. It will help discipline in the home. Children must be our primary consideration--not the status quo as regards local authority education provision. Unless overall nursery provision is stimulated in all three sectors, some children will be left to watch "Power Rangers" on television in their pre-school year while others learn social skills at a nursery school.
<P>


<a name="column_346"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 346</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-08_para14"></a>This is no attack on local authority nursery schools. They have a tremendous reputation in Scotland. They will be great winners from the additional provision that will be required by those voucher-holding parents. Local authorities will benefit from this initiative, as indeed will all other parts of the educational sector, and as indeed will parents and their children. That is why we are putting so much new money into the initiative.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-08_para15"></a>On this amendment Labour and the Liberal Democrats would appear to want to bar parental choice from this whole issue. They appear to want to bar parents from being involved in schooling. We welcome parental involvement in this. Parents who have made decisions about their children's nursery education are more likely to participate throughout the rest of their children's educational lives. They are more likely, for instance, to be involved in school boards. The whole cycle of co-operation will create a greater sense of community. Only the children of Scotland will suffer if this House rejects the valuable provisions in Clause 23 and in the rest of Part II. I therefore urge noble Lords to allow Clause 23 to remain a part of the Bill.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="60513-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove: </B>   My Lords, one of the difficulties about opposing the noble Earl is that I believe that he believes everything he says and I believe that he is looking for the best of all possible worlds. If the whole process was left to him I might well be persuaded that the ideas were good. What makes me think again is that in Glasgow we spent nearly two days in the Select Committee with experts on education from all walks of life. None of them believed that this was a good scheme. We had our own experiences and we listened to experts on education who came to speak to us. That is the basis on which we have opposed the scheme so vigorously.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-09_para0"></a>Perhaps I may say a few words about the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy. She tried to suggest that this is a wrecking amendment. If we disagree violently with a Bill, I do not see why we should not seek to wreck it. I suggest to the noble Baroness that she studies the period when there was a Labour government instead of looking into a crystal ball. She should examine the record; she will see our scars as regards the number of Bills wrecked in this place by the party opposite. Anyone who was here at the time will remember that many Bills were destroyed or emasculated. That is why we feel strongly about the matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-09_para1"></a>The Minister gave one example which almost perfectly illustrates part of the problem. He spoke of about 65 per cent. of those in East Renfrewshire who are keen to have the voucher system. That is exactly what we are talking about. It is one of the few areas, which includes Newton Mearns, where there is still a Tory representative. I do not believe that there are any councillors there. I wonder whether noble Lords saw the cartoon in one of the weekend magazines showing a rather imperious lady saying to a gentleman, "Oh, a Tory councillor in Scotland--how quaint!" That is exactly the position in East Renfrewshire.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-09_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, it is not only in East Renfrewshire where there are pilot projects or where <P>


<a name="column_347"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>the hotlines have been swamped by parents who want this provision. We are also talking about Argyll and Bute, North Ayrshire and parts of the Highlands and Islands. The parents across these areas want this system and that is why they show such energetic interest in what is going on.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove: </B>   My Lords, I was intending to mention the islands because I agree they are a very special case. They are desperate for any movement at all. If the Minister gives the matter a few minutes thought, I believe he will realise that East Renfrewshire does not represent a very good cross-section. I know the area very well. It does not represent a cross-section of the west of Scotland because it is only a small part of that area. Despite liking the Minister and conceding that he believes what he is saying, we are so strongly opposed to this measure that we must take the view of the House.

<A NAME="60513-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Addington </B>   moved Amendment No. 6:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
After Clause 23, insert the following new clause--
<center><B>Evaluation of pilot schemes </B></center><BR>
(". No grants shall be made under section 23 of this Act until the Secretary of State has laid before both Houses of Parliament an evaluation of any pilot or experimental schemes and of their implications.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60513-09_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the premise of the amendment is that if there is a pilot scheme, regard should be had to what is said. After the scheme has been run--there is dispute as to whether the period is long enough to be effective--Parliament should pay attention to the results of it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-09_para6"></a>This amendment was tabled slightly late on Thursday, for which I apologise, but it has already been flagged up. In Glasgow the Minister assured the Select Committee that in a pilot scheme everything would be taken into account. When we pushed him a little further he repeated that. At the end I asked whether, if the scheme ultimately failed, the whole voucher system would be withdrawn. The Minister replied that he could not conceive of any situation in which the scheme would fail. He was probably the only person who gave evidence who could not foresee anything that could be deemed a failure of the scheme.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-09_para7"></a>The amendment provides that the results of the scheme should be laid before Parliament. All of the matters referred to in the last debate--the degree of parental choice, the fact that many who knew anything about the Bill were not keen on it and so on--could be taken into account. At that time we will see what has gone wrong and what has gone right. If this scheme seems to be appropriate for the Islands of Scotland or the outlying regions, perhaps it could be retained or something else tried later on. We must remember that the voucher scheme is not in the Bill itself, which is merely concerned with a grant-making power.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-09_para8"></a>On the basis of this amendment or a consideration along these lines, Parliament would be given time to think again with knowledge. I suggest that this can be easily done. If not, I suggest that dogma is taking over on all sides and the idea of providing better education has been ignored. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="60513-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lyell: </B>   My Lords, I listened carefully to what the noble Lord said. Perhaps at a later stage he or my noble friend the Minister may be able to enlighten me as to the evaluation of the pilot scheme. What is the process of the catch-all system of evaluation? What will be the parameters for the evaluation of the success or otherwise of the scheme? If the noble Lord can spell that out for me at the end, I await his comments with interest, as I believe that that will clarify the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   My Lords, I should have thought that it would be for the noble Earl to explain the evaluation of the pilot scheme. To take the argument back one stage, what is the purpose of the pilot scheme? If the purpose is not to find out the strengths and weaknesses of any aspect of policy that is being introduced, basically there is no point in having a pilot <P>


<a name="column_350"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 350</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>scheme in the first place. If the Government are to introduce a pilot scheme that is not to be evaluated, it seems to me that there is little purpose in introducing it. If it is being suggested that in introducing the pilot scheme all that the Scottish Office is doing, with its massed army of civil servants, is trying something out to see what form the application should take and to test various administrative aspects of the voucher system, that can be done without the expense of a pilot scheme in these four areas of Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-10_para0"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Addington, is absolutely right. I hope that the Minister will tell your Lordships whether the Scottish Office is to evaluate the scheme. If so, no doubt the noble Earl can answer his noble friend's question and the questions that are in the minds of us all. I am quite happy to state what I believe should be examined.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-10_para1"></a>One of the matters is the quality of nursery education to be provided. I believe that that is essential in the pilot project. It was noticeable that the Minister did not mention it in summing up the last debate when he spoke of the desires of parents. Some parents would be happy with a high educational content; others would be happy with a "play scheme" content, to quote his words. That is not part of nursery education. The Scottish Office has advertised for an inspector for the private nurseries which are to be set up to check that they provide an acceptable standard of nursery education. It does not say anything about "play scheme" content. I believe that the noble Earl should look closely at the advertisement placed in the national press some months ago. The Scottish Office advertised for an inspector to inspect the private nurseries which are to be established. Already one has two aspects of the pilot scheme that ought to be evaluated.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-10_para2"></a>There are other aspects of the pilot scheme that should be evaluated; for example, the take up. The pilot scheme should find out how many parents are presently paying for nursery education for their children and take the &#163;1,100 voucher as a contribution to what they have been paying over the past given number of years, depending upon how many children there are in the family. The pilot scheme might show that it is subsidising those who are already paying and who can afford to pay for their children's private education.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-10_para3"></a>I always remember Michael Forsyth, the Scottish Secretary, saying during an education debate in the Scottish Grand Committee that his parental choice was made through his cheque book. That quote can be checked easily. It was a Scottish Grand Committee meeting in Edinburgh. Michael Forsyth was not then Scottish Secretary but Minister of State or one of the Under-Secretaries in the Scottish Office. He made it clear that he made his parental choice through his cheque book. That is a privilege people are entitled to have. I do not act in that way but if people wish to, who am I to criticise? Where I do criticise is if those parents cash in on the scheme and claw back some of their cheque book parental choice.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-10_para4"></a>There is no shortage of aspects of the pilot scheme that should be evaluated. I am surprised that the question was put. I look forward to hearing from the Minister, <P>


<a name="column_351"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 351</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>first, whether the Scottish Office will evaluate the scheme; secondly, what tests it will apply to the pilot project in the four areas of Scotland; and, thirdly, whether, as the noble Lord, Lord Addington, said, the scheme will be withdrawn in the event that the pilot projects are shown by the evaluation test to have failed.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-10_para5"></a>This is an important aspect of the discussions of Part II of the Bill. Like my noble friend Lord Carmichael, I have great respect and liking for the Minister. I know that he is keen to give as much information as possible and to be as helpful as he can when these questions are raised. It is in that spirit that I join the noble Lord, Lord Addington, in speaking to the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   My Lords, I wonder whether the Minister can clarify a matter. It seems to me that a year will be a very short time in which to evaluate the pilot schemes. If I were planning to set up a nursery school, it would take me at least a year to obtain suitable premises and carry out any necessary conversions, equip them and engage staff before I could even start taking in pupils. It seems to me that if we are to get a real picture of how well the whole thing works, a period of at least two years will be necessary.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-10_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, I was unable to be present to hear the evidence given in Glasgow. I support the amendment. I have read and listened carefully to the points made. The first and most important issue to make clear is that there are two aspects to parental choice. There is the aspect of whether public finance is available to provide a voucher for parents who at present cannot, because of lack of availability, or do not choose to, use LEA provision, and whether giving a voucher to parents in that group is a valid position to take.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-10_para6"></a>There is then the question regarding the nursery provision which is able, and available to, meet parental choice where the parents want their child or children to go to the local authority nursery. We could have a long debate as to how many parents--it would be a bit like how many angels can dance on the head of a pin--will choose to send their child, full or part-time, to a local authority nursery and avoid the use of vouchers. The Government could then argue that there is complete choice.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-10_para7"></a>However, the financial arrangements of the scheme the Government have put forward appear to carry a marked danger, under the guise of offering increased choice to some parents who do not now receive what they want, of eroding or worsening the choice that is currently available to other parents. Among them may be parents of children who are deemed to be most in need of access to the maximum time available for pre-statutory school age education.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-10_para8"></a>I am thinking not just of children who are physically handicapped but of those who are emotionally and behaviourally disturbed or who come from families with multiple problems. There is often provision made to ensure that special needs children--not just the most severe 2 or 2.5 per cent. but the 18 per cent. about whom <P>


<a name="column_352"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 352</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Members of your Lordships' House on all sides are deeply concerned and to whom we want to see high quality nursery education made available--are catered for.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-10_para9"></a>There is also the question of whether any particular means of looking at the financial arrangements for implementing the scheme will have expected or unexpected financial repercussions on local authorities' ability to continue the existing level of provision, and whether interfering with the complex nature of local government funding will have a damaging impact.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-10_para10"></a>I listened with interest to the Minister when he alleged that Members on this side of the House condemned the Government's proposals as being ill thought out. I waited for him to refer to the community charge or "poll tax". He omitted to do so. Interfering in the complicated nature of local authority funding, and thereby, perhaps unwittingly--I give the Minister the benefit of the doubt--affecting financial arrangements may disrupt a local authority's capacity to continue to provide for children with the greatest need. That may be a factor that can be identified in an evaluation of the pilot scheme.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-10_para11"></a>There is also a need to study the whole issue of monitoring and the avoidance of fraud. There can be no doubt about the potential for fraud. Regardless of one's views of the desirability of the scheme, there will obviously be unanimity in your Lordships' House about the need to evaluate the scheme to ensure that, were it to be implemented universally, there was no avoidable scope for fraud.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-10_para12"></a>There is also the issue of physical and mental safety and the quality of the monitoring of those who make such provision, which is funded from the public sector. I hope that the Government consider that to be an inevitable and valuable aspect of evaluating the pilot scheme. There is a whole range of reasons why that applies in the interests of the most vulnerable children and those who may be at risk of having their current level of provision cut. I refer in particular to those with special needs and to those at greatest risk.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-10_para13"></a>From my experience in local government and from contacts with colleagues in Scotland I know that there are many unique cases. The noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, said that it may be sufficient for children to have two to two-and-a-half hours of nursery education perhaps three days a week. That may apply as a generality. As chair of an education committee I have come across cases in which the mother is suffering from a terminal illness. All too frequently those in local government are involved in cases in which there is a query about a non-accidental injury or there is a problem in the home. There must be flexibility and the ability for a child to be taken into nursery education for a longer period, in particular to an environment where the adults and the child know each other. Such times are extremely stressful.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-10_para14"></a>All those aspects must be monitored and evaluated. The Government appear to be confident that the scheme will be a total success. The Minister says that there will be only gainers and no losers in the government scheme. Surely, therefore, it would be reasonable for the <P>


<a name="column_353"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 353</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government to accept a full evaluation in order to ensure that that confidence is fully borne out by experience.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Goold: </B>   My Lords, as regards the timing of the pilot scheme, we must remember that there will be continuous assessment, as is the case in relation to all education issues in Scotland. I fear that as a result of political dogma there will be those who will deliberately try to obstruct the pilot schemes. Certainly there will be lack of co-operation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-10_para15"></a>I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Gryfe, is not in his place today. He felt considerable frustration at the opposition that was expressed during the committee meeting in Glasgow. He referred to the condemnatory tone of the proposals. During the Select Committee he addressed representatives of CoSLA, the EIS and other teaching organisations. He said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"This is an opportunity surely presented to you to improve the situation by a proper assessment and monitoring of the pilot scheme. Can I have some assurance from you that you are looking forward to the pilot scheme, not as an exercise in self-justification for your criticism and condemnation but with a view to trying to arrive at some kind of objective agreement on the operation of the scheme and its success or failure?". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
The noble Lord received no such assurance from any of the organisations.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-11_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, is a leading and distinguished figure in the Association of County Councils. She knows what she is talking about and noble Lords will always listen to her on this subject with great respect. However, apart from the problems mentioned by my noble friend Lord Goold, it will not be possible for the pilot scheme to assess all the broad issues which will take time to develop as the voucher scheme expands. Surely the pilots are designed to discover the wrinkles in the detail of the scheme and iron them out. The pilots will be important in that respect and account will be taken rapidly. However, some of the broad issues which the noble Baroness mentioned cannot be taken into account in the pilot schemes.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-11_para0"></a>One of those issues must be children with special educational needs. I do not know whether the noble Baroness has been able to read the evidence and the replies that the Minister gave to the Select Committee and in Committee. Those replies and the printed information that we have received suggest that local authorities will have a large measure of flexibility in the funding of their nursery provision. Only &#163;1,100 multiplied by the number of children currently in local authority education will be topsliced from a local authority's budget. That will be returned to the authority while the parents send their children to its nursery schools. The rest of what the authority spends will still be available, including extra provision for children with special educational needs.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-11_para1"></a>That is how the situation appears at present but whether it works out properly will emerge only as time goes on. I believe that it will, and it is important that it <P>


<a name="column_354"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 354</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>does. I do not believe that it is a proper subject for a limited pilot scheme in a limited area where there are few such children.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-11_para2"></a>Likewise, it will be difficult to ascertain from four pilots the extent to which parents who now pay 100 per cent. of the fees for private nursery school education will avail themselves of the voucher scheme. It seems likely that they will. If they do so that will, on balance, be of enormous benefit to rural areas because nursery schools which at present are only potentially viable, or barely viable, because insufficient children can attend are handicapped. If every child of four, where the parents so wished, was able to attend a nursery school, more schools would be viable in rural areas. That is most important in Scotland, in particular in Angus where I live and in the Highlands and the Borders. I do not know how important it is in the areas where the pilots are being conducted.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-11_para3"></a>The amendment is not entirely about the importance of the pilot schemes, although they are important. Noble Lords opposite who do not want the voucher scheme and who are too fearful of it have tabled the amendment as a way of stopping the scheme in due course. The amendment would not be necessary if the Labour Party or the Liberal Democrat Party were certain that they will win the next election because they have said that they will scrap the scheme. They indicated that by the way in which they voted in their attempt to wreck this part of the Bill. They do not know that they will be elected and they might have a change of heart if they were. Therefore, they have tabled the amendment as a failsafe mechanism so that they can, if necessary, stop the Bill by arguing that various aspects of the pilot schemes, which are in fact details, are major issues. The amendment probably has two purposes, one of which is at a rather deeper level than the other. I hope that your Lordships will not accept the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, given the untried nature of the voucher scheme, it is appropriate and necessary that it should be subject to evaluation and that the pilot authority should be evaluated. I give credit to the Government for setting up that evaluation. Indeed, the Government have put great store by the evaluation process. As the noble Lord, Lord Addington, indicated, in Glasgow the Minister, Mr. Robertson, went out of his way to indicate that lessons would be learnt from the evaluation of the scheme. He said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Everything is up for review. The research and evaluation will be independently done". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
He went on to say:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The research that we have commissioned would be independent, the evaluation would be independent, and in light of that we will look at the entire workings of the scheme". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
It is quite right that that is how matters should proceed.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-11_para4"></a>But let us turn to the timetable for implementation. The pilot scheme will run in the year 1996-97 with the full scheme starting in August 1997. The Minister has been very helpful in providing us with a copy of the specification of the evaluation and there is much in that which is to the credit of the Government.
<P>


<a name="column_355"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 355</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-11_para5"></a>However, when we look through to the end of that specification, we come to a paragraph entitled "Timetable and Resources". It says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The project", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
that is, the evaluation project,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"should start shortly thereafter--April, May--and should run for just over a year", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
and this is the important part:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"with final reporting in August 1997". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
It goes on to say:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There will be need to have firm arrangements for interim reports at the end of each term of the system's operation". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
But the final report on which a considered judgment can be made is dated August 1997. By then, the new school year will have begun.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-11_para6"></a>How is it possible to learn from any of the mistakes; to sort out any of the glitches to which the Minister referred? How is it possible to carry out a proper assessment and review in the Scottish Office on the basis of the findings of the evaluation when that evaluation report will be due only in August, the very same month that the scheme is to be implemented nationwide? I am afraid that it is necessary for the Minister to make it clear how that process is to take place and how any changes and modifications which may be necessary can be implemented within, at best, two weeks if the report is published at the beginning of August and the schools return in the middle of August. Or is it perhaps that the cat is already out of the bag?
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-11_time0"></A><H5>5.15 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-11_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, enjoyed that manufactured anger. He knows perfectly well that interim reports lead to a final report.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-11_para7"></a>First, perhaps I may deal with the generality of the amendment. I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Addington, and others who support the amendment genuinely wish to see a rigorous evaluation and there is very little between us on that. My noble friend Lady Carnegy suggested that other motives may be involved; that is, somehow to delay or to put an obstacle in the way of the application of the scheme. If that is true, then there is quite a lot between us. But I believe that the Government share many of the concerns and objectives of those who spoke to the amendment in that we all want a first-class evaluation scheme.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-11_para8"></a> Before I turn to the amendment specifically, perhaps I may deal with two general issues which were raised by noble Lords. The first point was made by the noble Lord, Lord Ewing. He referred to quality. I believe that I addressed the quality issue in replying to the previous amendment. But I remind the noble Lord that quality really is at the centre of our efforts behind the Bill and behind the nursery voucher scheme. The delivery of education can come in different forms. We recognise that there can be quality in the playschool situation and also in a more formal nursery school situation. It is for <P>


<a name="column_356"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 356</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>parents to choose whether they wish to have the less formal playgroup or the more formal nursery school setting as a means of education for their children.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-11_para9"></a>HMI will be responsible for quality. There will be no possibility of providers being approved under this scheme unless they have fulfilled the quality criteria, and we shall insist upon that. The evaluation will not concern itself greatly with that aspect. That is an aspect which will be pursued rigidly by the inspectors.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-11_para10"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, brought all her experience to bear and raised a number of wide-ranging issues. I remind the noble Baroness--and, indeed, the House because I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Sempill, raised this issue and I did not reply to it specifically on the last amendment--of what happens to those children who require special services or who have special needs. The moneys which authorities already spend on full-time places for younger children with special educational needs will remain untouched by the calculations which surround the voucher system. Therefore, we recognise that certain categories of children remain priority categories in terms of continued local authority provision. We have no intention of disrupting that in any way. That will be something which the evaluators will seek to identify. They will seek to assure themselves that children with special needs are in no way disadvantaged by the scheme.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-11_para11"></a>Secondly, I shall supply the noble Baroness with a copy of the letter about the complex local authority finances and how they mesh with the financing of the nursery voucher scheme which I sent to other noble Lords who spoke in Committee. It may be of interest to her to read the explanation which is given in that letter.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-11_para12"></a>In essence, we believe that where local authority provision remains the same as it was before, then local authorities will be no worse off after the introduction of a voucher scheme. However, it is our considered view and the view of some of the local authority watchers with whom we liaise that most if not all local authorities will benefit from the extra &#163;30 million worth of purchasing power which is being introduced into the pre-school education market. Local authorities, especially in Scotland but across the UK, have a tremendous reputation for providing that education. In many instances, they are the main providers. Therefore, they will be the major recipients and beneficiaries. Nevertheless, I shall send the noble Baroness a copy of the letter which has been distributed to other noble Lords.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-11_para13"></a>From an early stage, the Government have pledged to share the results of the evaluation of the voucher system's pilot year as openly and fully as possible. I should perhaps explain to the House that the evaluation of the pilot year is essentially being conducted at two levels. There will be a national evaluation conducted by an independent contractor appointed by the Scottish Office. The contractor for the evaluation will be appointed shortly and its work will be monitored by a research committee, including representatives from all three sectors of providers; namely, the public, private and voluntary sectors.
<P>


<a name="column_357"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 357</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-11_para14"></a>Throughout the course of the evaluation, we hope to arrange a number of conferences which will bring together providers, parents and other interested parties. In other words, we want to be totally open about the information which arises from the evaluation during the pilot year.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-11_para15"></a>Those sessions will serve a dual function of informing the evaluation--that is, gaining responses from those who have an interest--and allowing an early dissemination of results. The proposal for conferences represents another demonstration of the Government's commitment to a thorough and open evaluation of all the workings of the voucher system. We are at one across the House as to the need for a thorough evaluation. We shall make available in the Libraries of both Houses any written reports of the evaluation, whether for these conferences or otherwise published, as and when they come forward. I hope that that addresses the central point of the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-11_para16"></a>The work of the national evaluation will be informed and supplemented by local evaluations conducted in each of the four pilot authority areas. Indeed, one of the prerequisites that the Government set for councils' participation in the pilot year was a commitment on their behalf to a thorough local evaluation. While the pilot authorities will take the lead in their respective evaluations, we have encouraged them to involve other providers and interested parties in a manner similar to that proposed in the national evaluation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-11_para17"></a>So far as concerns the national evaluation, we made it very clear in the specification, as many noble Lords will have seen--especially the noble Lord, Lord Sewel--that we require the results to be brought forward by the researchers as they arise and not left until the end of the study. Indeed, my noble friend Lord Goold pointed that out to the House in remarkably succinct language which I can hardly rival.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-11_para18"></a>My noble friend Lady Carnegy referred to the objective of ironing out the wrinkles as the scheme progresses. That is an extremely important part of the exercise--that is, the continuous assessment of the scheme--as is the fact that the interim reports will bring to light and predict some of the major conclusions both on the generality of the scheme and, indeed, on all the minute details regarding the workings of the scheme. Therefore, although there is but a short time between the end of one school year in the early summer and the mid-August start of the next school year, I hope that I can reassure the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, and the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, that the fact that one has received interim reports throughout that school year will mean that one is moving a long way towards one's final evaluation at the end of that school year.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-11_para19"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Sewel, has been in both academia and local government for long enough to know the value of continuous assessment and interim reports. I do not believe that is as doubting and cynical as he suggests. The early dissemination and availability of findings will enable us--and, indeed, everyone else--to reflect any conclusions of the evaluation in the system's national implementation from August of next year.
<P>


<a name="column_358"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 358</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-11_para20"></a>Finally, more specific questions were asked about the exact agenda of those who will be carrying out the evaluation. I can tell noble Lords that those concerned will be looking at the impact of vouchers on the provider market. They will also be looking at the volume, the type and the distribution of places which are prompted by the voucher scheme. Further, they will be looking at parental views, the views of those who have been providing and also the views of those who will be tempted to provide for the first time because of the increase in demand. We shall gain a very clear idea of the enthusiasm which comes through parental choice.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-11_para21"></a>In essence, we shall be looking at the entire workings of the scheme, except for the quality aspect. I should like to reassure the noble Lord, Lord Ewing, that we believe that the assessment of quality is best done by those who are experts in quality assessment--Her Majesty's Inspectorate. I hope that my response will be reassuring to those who have tabled the amendment. We want to achieve exactly the same objectives as they do. We want the information to be available in the Library of this House and we want the assessment to be continuous. On that basis, I believe that the amendment is not strictly necessary.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, I have heard a great deal in this debate. However, what it really comes down to is that the Government are saying that such a requirement is not needed because they intend to work terribly hard to try to get it right, as best they can. I do not doubt that. I suspect that no one wants such a scheme to go wrong, least of all the Government. The idea of laying the scheme before Parliament is a rod for any government's back, no matter what their colour, if something goes wrong. In that sense it is not party political.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-12_para0"></a>If a government of a different colour--or, indeed, a combination of colours--happened to be sitting on the Benches opposite when the scheme was working well and such a requirement came through, they would have to support it. Indeed, how could they possibly risk that level of public humiliation? However, if those Benches were occupied by the present occupants, then in the event of it going wrong they would have to answer.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-12_para1"></a>As regards quality assessment, what fails and what passes, one presumes, having heard the great list of the activities that the Government propose to carry out, that they will have a rough idea of what constitutes failure and what constitutes success. Therefore, that aspect of the matter does not count. The fundamental point is that we are discussing a new scheme: it is new, it is different and it is going down a new path. By indulging in such pilot schemes, the Government have accepted the fact that nothing is certain. For example, with a pilot scheme you are testing the ground and experimenting. However, the important point about experimentation and tests is that they go wrong occasionally. Indeed, sometimes you fail and experiments go wrong. All the amendment proposes is that a report of the scheme should be debated before Parliament. Surely there is nothing wrong with that suggestion.

<BR>
("(cc) after paragraph 5 there shall be inserted the following paragraph--
<BR>
"Conflict of interest 
<BR>
5A.--(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (2) below, where, whether before or during any meeting of the appointment committee, any member of the appointment committee becomes aware that he or any person connected with him has (whether directly or indirectly) <P>

<BR>
(4) The validity of any proceedings of the appointment committee shall not be affected by any failure to comply with this paragraph."").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60513-12_para15"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, during Committee stage an amendment was moved by the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove, and by the noble Lord, Lord Ewing of Kirkford, to extend the conflict of interest provisions set out in new Section 5A as inserted by Clause 30 to include an appointment committee set up under Schedule 2 to the School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988. I commend both noble Lords for their wisdom in bringing this matter to the attention of the House. I indicated that we were sympathetic to the intention behind the amendment and I undertook to bring forward a Government amendment to that effect at this stage. I reiterate my gratitude to the noble Lords for noting the importance of this issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-12_para16"></a>Under Clause 30, board members and members of committees constituted by the board must declare any material interest they, or a person connected with them, have in relation to any matter being considered; they must withdraw from meetings where such a matter is under consideration; and they must not vote on any question relating to such a matter. These requirements also apply to any person entitled to attend and speak at board meetings by virtue of Section 5 of the 1988 Act. The only exception from the requirement to declare a material interest is an interest which arises solely from membership of the board as a parent or a staff member.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-12_para17"></a>Where an education authority intends to appoint a head-teacher, a deputy head-teacher or an assistant head-teacher to a school, Schedule 2 requires the authority to set up an appointment committee comprising nominees of the education authority and the school board, where there is one. For posts below head-teacher, the appointment committee also includes the head-teacher.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-12_para18"></a>An appointment committee is not constituted by the school board and as such is not caught by the provisions of new Section 5A(1), with the result that the conflict of interest provisions do not at present extend to appointment committees. This amendment would extend those provisions. It relates to Schedule 2 to the 1988 Act because that schedule contains the legislative provisions relating to appointment committees. The only exception <P>


<a name="column_362"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 362</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>from the requirement to declare a material interest is where such interest exists by reason only of being a head-teacher of the school or a parent of a pupil in attendance at the school. It is only necessary here to mention the head-teacher as other staff of the school cannot serve on an appointment committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-12_para19"></a>At Committee stage an amendment to extend the new conflict of interest provisions to appointment committees was described as both important and sensible, both by myself and, I think, by the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael. I therefore commend this amendment to the House and hope that, with the interest that the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, has shown in this matter, it will be welcomed by all sides of the House. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-13_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, I have a question about this amendment. The amendment is extremely welcome and is necessary. I have not been able to give my noble friend notice of the question and I hope it is not too difficult to answer. New Section 5A(4) states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The validity of any proceedings of the appointment committee shall not be affected by any failure to comply with this paragraph". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
What does that mean? Does it mean that if someone fails to declare an interest and fails to withdraw he carries on regardless? I do not quite understand the provision.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove: </B>   My Lords, I was aware that the noble Baroness had been involved in discussion in Committee. She made some very good points.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-13_para0"></a>I am very grateful to the Minister for taking up the point that I and, I believe, my noble friend Lord Ewing of Kirkford raised. I do not recollect giving the Minister a chance to clarify further the point raised by the noble Baroness. I understand the point that the noble Baroness makes. What would be the reprimand for someone who did not declare an interest? Is that included in the Minister's amendment?
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-13_para1"></a>I am perfectly happy with the response to the points I raised in Committee. I have given my interpretation of what I believe the noble Baroness sought. I may be wrong in that, but she may be able to clear the matter up and give the Minister a chance to reply more fully.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-13_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, that was my concern. If the validity of the proceedings is not affected if someone does not declare an interest, that is slightly strange. It means that someone votes not having declared an interest. I am not happy about that. Is that what the provision means?
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-13_para2"></a>There is another point. If the people who declare an interest suddenly withdraw, reducing the committee numbers to fewer than a quorum, the appointments committee cannot proceed. My noble friend will probably tell me that this insertion follows other clauses in other legislation. If so, there must be a good explanation of these points.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-13_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the welcome that has been extended to the amendment by both my noble friend Lady Carnegy and the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael. I shall give my noble friend a short answer now, and promise to follow it up with a longer <P>


<a name="column_363"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 363</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>answer in writing between now and Third Reading but with sufficient speed so that should any adjustment need to be made there will be time to make it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-13_para3"></a>The intention of subsection (4) is that the appointment is valid even if it is discovered that an interest which should have been declared was not declared.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-13_para4"></a>With that answer, and the promise that I shall write to my noble friend on the matter and follow it up between now and Third Reading should a revision need to be made, I hope that the House will accept the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-13_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, I suggest that my noble friend considers the issue. It is possible to rig a committee. I hate to say that, but having spent some time in local government and having been instrumental in setting up arrangements for appointments committees which avoid such a thing, I do not think that one should be too innocent about the matter.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-13_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, I said that I would do exactly that. I shall look at the issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-13_para5"></a>On Question, amendment agreed to.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60513-13_para7"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, this amendment simply replaces a reference to SCOTVEC in finance legislation with a reference to the SQA.

<FONT SIZE=2><BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<FONT SIZE=2>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60513-13_para14"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment was one that I heralded in my speech on Second Reading.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-13_para15"></a>Clause 1 of the Bill deals with an issue that has been a subject of recent argument in the courts. It will be considered in the Court of Appeal later this year. The courts reduce awards made to victims, to compensate them for their future loss of earnings and the cost of care, to take account of the fact that they receive compensation in the form of an immediate lump sum which can be invested. To make an accurate reduction for this accelerated payment (as it is known) the courts must apply the best possible estimate of the rate of return that victims will earn on their investment. If the assumed rate is too high then the victim will have been undercompensated. If it is too low a rate he will have been overcompensated.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-13_para16"></a>For a number of years there has been a general assumption by the courts that they should use an investment rate of 4 per cent. to 5 per cent. so as to make the appropriate discount. However, there is gathering concern that the appropriate rate of return on investments is lower than 4 per cent. to 5 per cent. so that victims are being significantly undercompensated.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-13_para17"></a>The percentage figure of 4 per cent. to 5 per cent. is taken to have been laid down by a 1979 decision of your Lordships' House in its judicial capacity, and by a 1970 decision before that. The figure may have been right for its time though that is questionable, but obviously should not be regarded by the courts as an invariable prescription for all time. When this issue comes before the Court of Appeal later this year it is to be hoped that a more realistic rate will be set.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-13_para18"></a>Clause 1 of the Bill confers a power on the Lord Chancellor of the day to set by statutory instrument a prescribed rate of return that the courts will be required to take into account in future cases. That is sensible. It will provide for a fixed rate, but with the flexibility to change the rate as and when necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-13_para19"></a>It is important to have a fixed rate on which parties to personal injuries litigation can rely. This saves costs and court time. Without a fixed rate both sides have to advance expert evidence in favour of their preferred rate. Practitioners in this field are very conscious of that. In a recent personal injury case, the combined cost to both sides of presenting expert financial evidence to establish the appropriate investment rate was about &#163;15,000. We must be ever mindful to frame our laws in a way that does not encourage unnecessary cost in litigation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-13_para20"></a>However, I recognise that there may be exceptional cases where it is appropriate for the court to apply another rate. But those cases are exceptional and the legislation should recognise that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-13_para21"></a>As currently drafted, Clause 1(2) provides that, notwithstanding the existence of a prescribed rate, the court may apply a different rate of return,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"if any party to the proceedings shows that it is more appropriate in the case in question". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
We consider this provision to be too wide. It is likely to have the effect in practice of undermining the benefits that flow from the certainty of having a prescribed rate.
<P>


<a name="column_365"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 365</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-13_para22"></a>The amendment is simple. It provides that the scope for departure from the prescribed rate should be limited to "exceptional circumstances". This formula is commonly used in legislation and the courts understand the restrictive intent underlying its use. It would operate as a disincentive to unnecessary and costly expert evidence and argument why the prescribed rate is said not to be appropriate in a particular case. The point of the amendment is that the prescribed rate will generally be appropriate. A party should be able to invite the court to depart from the prescribed rate only if the circumstances of the party's case are truly exceptional. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-13_spnew8"></A><B> Viscount Chelmsford: </B>   I have no interest to declare in the amendment, but I should advise the Committee that my background is in the insurance industry and I am currently briefed by the Association of British Insurers.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-13_para23"></a>I do not believe that the noble Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, is correct in suggesting that in the great bulk of cases the current rate is wrong. Because of the mix of portfolios arranged at the time the lump sum is used, simply to use the current rate for gilts would in the opinion of the insurance industry overcompensate.

<A NAME="60513-13_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  To some extent, my noble friend is heralding a later amendment on the matter which we shall come to. The question underlying a good deal of the discussion is what is the precise philosophy. As I said in response to the Second Reading debate, I would in any event be anxious to see what the Court of Appeal decides before exercising the powers conferred under the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-13_para24"></a>There is a good deal of agreement about the desirable result of the legislation: it is to try to simplify so far as possible the assessment of damages. I understand the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Irvine. Our aim is to avoid any unnecessary expert evidence and we have already introduced Section 10 of the Civil Evidence Act 1995 for that purpose. However, we should pause to consider what purpose a party might see for bringing in an expert or other evidence when the courts have, with or without legislative assistance, arrived at a discount rate which is accepted as reflecting the real rate of return on a plaintiff's investment of his lump sum in the generality of cases. Once such matters are established and accepted, I cannot see that it would be in the interests of either party to seek to introduce evidence that such a rate is not, after all, generally appropriate.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-13_para25"></a>Clause 1 is designed to provide the courts with such guidance as may be necessary from time to time to take account of current changes and developments in the current economic climate and market conditions to achieve the element of certainty. It is obviously essential that the Lord Chancellor, exercising the power conferred by this section, should have the benefit of the widest possible consultation with those best able to advise. But even when that has been done, one achieves a degree of certainty, but there is a difference between a certainty as to what is generally appropriate and a rigidity which might oblige the court to apply what is acknowledged to be generally appropriate in a particular case where it was manifestly inappropriate and would lead to an unjust result.

<P>

<A NAME = "60513-13_para26"></a>It must be right to allow either party to draw to the court's attention some feature or features of the case before it which suggest that a different rate ought to be used in that case in order to arrive at a figure which would provide a more accurate reflection of the actual loss in that case. Where the case includes some feature which makes it appear wrong to apply what would otherwise be regarded as a routine calculation, that feature may or may not be regarded as an "exceptional circumstance". It would not be easy to define what was meant by an "exceptional circumstance" in such cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-13_para27"></a>I agree that the phrase is common in the statute book. However, it may be that one such feature happened to appear in a significant proportion of the cases heard in one particular year. The factor that makes the statutory rate inappropriate may happen in many cases at one time and therefore, strictly speaking, the circumstances would not be exceptional but it would be perfectly apparent that the routine calculation was not appropriate. The court will have no difficulty in identifying those cases as they arise and there will be no encouragement for parties to digress by leading extraneous expert or other evidence in other cases. Clearly we could not in legislation identify and specify all the categories of case feature and which would influence the court in considering the application of subsection (2).
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-13_para28"></a>To take one example, the courts might consider the circumstances of plaintiffs to be affected by their own situation in regard to their assets. Someone with a large portfolio already might be willing to invest their damages less cautiously so as to produce a return larger than a plaintiff of more modest means could afford to contemplate.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-13_para29"></a>The phrase that we used in the Bill refers to another rate being more appropriate. We are operating in a new area and I cannot foresee all the possibilities. Therefore, I prefer to adhere to what we have in the Bill. If a rate is fixed well--as I hope it will be--one would not expect a more appropriate rate to be fixed often. But, on the other hand, what must really be judged is the appropriateness of the rate rather than the circumstances which might be looked upon as exceptional. Circumstances which could suggest a different rate might occur in a run of cases where it could be hard to say in all of them that the circumstances were exceptional.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-13_para30"></a>Obviously there is room for a difference of opinion on the matter, but I submit that the phrase in the Bill is the wisest at this juncture. As time proceeds, if that structure is used then a more precise formula might be advisable.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="60513-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Irvine of Lairg: </B>   If I may say so with respect, in his remarks the noble Viscount was anticipating Amendment No. 3, which I shall move, rather than this one.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-14_para0"></a>I assure the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor that I accept that this is a matter of fine judgment. I am not an enemy of flexibility for the courts. However, the criterion in the Bill in its present form--which is why I propose the amendment--is to my mind an invitation to any party to proceedings to try to persuade the court that a rate other than the prescribed rate is more appropriate in the circumstances of that party's case. That test can <P>


<a name="column_367"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 367</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>therefore lead to very fine arguments and expert evidence. A criterion of "exceptional circumstances" is, by contrast, a much stiffer test. It would require a highly unusual departure in a particular case from the generality of cases. Therefore, it would operate as a disincentive to unnecessary and costly legal argument backed by expert evidence.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-14_para1"></a>Nevertheless, I appreciate that the arguments are finely balanced. The noble and learned Lord prefers the Bill in its present form and therefore he is ready to run the risk to which I have called attention. In those circumstances, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="60513-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Ackner </B>   moved Amendment No. 2:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 1, line 15, leave out ("and the Treasury").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60513-14_para3"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: In the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum to the Bill, under the heading,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Financial and manpower effects of the Bill", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
it is provided as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Bill's only likely effects on public expenditure are that any exercise of the power in clause 1 could affect the size of awards of personal injury damages against government departments, and that, under clause 6, ministers may accept secondary liability to support the primary obligations of public sector bodies". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
In my respectful submission it is quite wrong that one should involve the Treasury as it is involved in Clause 1(3).
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-14_para4"></a>Clause 1 deals with the determination of,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the return to be expected from the investment of a sum awarded as general damages for future pecuniary loss in an action for personal injury". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Subsection (3) provides that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Before making an order under subsection (1) above the Lord Chancellor shall consult the Government Actuary and the Treasury; and any order under that subsection shall be made by statutory instrument subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Allowing a potential defendant to advise on a factor that affects the amount of damages he must pay is a startling and strange provision. If it stands, quite clearly justice will not be seen to be done. The Lord Chancellor is empowered to seek to fix the rate of return on investments to be used in the calculation after consultation with the Government Actuary; and the Government Actuary is well able to undertake without assistance from the Treasury his actuarial task, which is somewhat similar to that undertaken by actuaries in insurance companies which issue life and pension policies.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-14_para5"></a>I suspect that the Treasury has been included in the clause because it is usual, as I understand it, to do so if expenditure of public money is involved. But damages payable by a government department is not public expenditure in the usually understood sense.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-14_para6"></a>At Second Reading I asked my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor a question on this matter of which I gave him advance notice. I therefore had the <P>


<a name="column_368"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 368</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>benefit of his reasoned reply. Among other things he said that the Treasury had, among other expertise, expertise,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in relation to ... forecasting ... which is essentially what lies behind the power in Clause 1".--[Official Report, 29/4/96; col. 1410.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
But we are not involved in forecasting. We are not looking into the future. The actual rate of return at the moment of the calculation is what is required. That is what is done, day in, day out, when there is a purchase, for instance, of an annuity.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-14_para7"></a>It looks wrong, and is wrong, for the Treasury to feature in the way that it does in Clause 1(3). I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Meston: </B>   I contribute only this observation. At Second Reading the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor explained that the reference to the Treasury came from the draft Bill annexed to the Law Commission report. So it does. But having reread the Law Commission report, I could not find anywhere any justification for the inclusion of the reference to the Treasury in the draft Bill. It may be that the Law Commission thought it self-evident, but it was not evident to me.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Irvine of Lairg: </B>   I, too, look forward to the noble and learned Lord's explanation as to why the Treasury is included. It occurs to me that it is possible that the Treasury could have market-sensitive information which it might be relevant for a Lord Chancellor to know: why, for example, a return on a particular security might not be a useful guide for a particular rate to be prescribed. I am not sure about that. However, I certainly welcome the opportunity by way of this amendment in the name of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, for the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor to explain the thinking behind the inclusion of the Treasury.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   The words "with the consent of the Treasury" or "after consultation with the Treasury" appear in measure after measure. They are practically always unnecessary. They are unnecessary here. The internal machinery of government takes care in every case that the Treasury is consulted about any matter that may involve expenditure.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-14_para8"></a>The Treasury has a number of officials, some of whom are specifically earmarked to departments and are in close daily touch with departments. They are invariably consulted during the drafting of any measure, including regulation, and will rapidly intervene if there is any Treasury interest. In this case, it appears that the words are not only unnecessary but have given rise to considerable disquiet as expressed in this debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-14_para9"></a>On many, many occasions all governments have been pressed to omit from statute these and other unnecessary words. Their only valid, and valuable, purpose is to provide employment for parliamentary draftsmen, their secretaries and typists and the printers of parliamentary proceedings and in due course the statute. No doubt in the end that is a substantial body of employment, but it is utterly wasted and unnecessary and is a waste of money. The Treasury should itself get rid of the <P>


<a name="column_369"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 369</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>provision. It clings to these words because it believes they are an extra safeguard against departments rushing wildly ahead and incurring expenditure without consent or consultation with the Treasury. The words are quite unnecessary. I am very glad that this matter has again been pinpointed by means of the amendment tabled by my noble and learned friend Lord Ackner.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-14_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  If my noble and learned friend Lord Simon of Glaisdale is right, it will not matter whether this amendment is given effect to from the point of view of the ultimate result. It is that aspect of the matter that my noble and learned friend Lord Ackner--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-14_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   Perhaps my noble and learned friend will allow me to intervene. He is quite right. It makes no difference in the actual result. But justice should not only be done but be seen to be done.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-14_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  Precisely. If it is right that the Treasury should be consulted, it is right that that particular aspect of the matter should be public rather than swept under the table, as it were, because the provision is withdrawn from the Bill. If accepted, the argument of my noble and learned friend Lord Simon of Glaisdale would lead to the view that the Treasury would be consulted in any event, even though that did not appear in the statutory provision.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-14_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   Perhaps my noble and learned friend would be kind enough to give way. I do not accept that it would be right for the Lord Chancellor to consult the Treasury when the Treasury is a defendant and likely to gain in accordance with the advice he gives. I should have thought that the Lord Chancellor would be the first person to recognise that one does not seek the advice of someone who is parti pris.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-14_para10"></a>My point is much more fundamental than purely a drafting point. It is wrong that it is in the Bill, and it would be wrong if it is taken out of the Bill, to consult a potential defendant as to what he thinks is the interest he should pay on the damages that sooner or later he will be ordered to pay.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-14_spmin2"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  That is precisely what I had in mind in suggesting that the point made by my noble and learned friend Lord Ackner would not at all be met by the point made by my noble and learned friend Lord Simon of Glaisdale because the view of my noble and learned friend Lord Ackner is that it would not be right for the Treasury to be consulted.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-14_para11"></a>I do not accept that point. But I certainly suggest that the matter is not one that is dealt with on the usual argument that my noble and learned friend Lord Simon of Glaisdale has put in a number of Bills with which I have been concerned and, I am sure, a great number of Bills with which I have not been concerned; namely, that whether the words are in or out, it does not make any difference because that is what in fact happens.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-14_para12"></a>It is true that the Treasury would be responsible for securing the implementation of an award against a government department. As my noble and learned friend <P>


<a name="column_370"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 370</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>pointed out, there is also the possibility of the Treasury being involved when Ministers accept secondary liability to support the primary obligations of public sector bodies in the sense that public expenditure might be involved in that connection.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-14_para13"></a>In my submission, it would be perfectly right for the Lord Chancellor to consult with potential defendants. I should certainly expect to consult the insurance industry in any attempt to settle such matters and also to consult, as I do from time to time in connection with these matters, those who would be representing plaintiffs: trade unions representing plaintiffs and gatherings of professional bodies who represent plaintiffs from time to time. It would be for the Lord Chancellor to make the proper use of whatever advice or estimate he received. Obviously, in relation to this Bill a good deal of consultation has taken place. I have no doubt that my noble friend Lord Chelmsford will raise this issue later in a little more detail.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-14_para14"></a> The Treasury has an expertise which is important to have in mind. As I said at Second Reading--I was obliged for the notice of the question and when I answered my noble and learned friend I did so on the basis of the notice that the question would be put to me--the reasons that I gave are perfectly good ones. The Government Actuary and his department is one repository of expertise but within the Government it is certainly not the sole repository of expertise on the subject of investment and money markets generally.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-14_para15"></a>My noble and learned friend said that we were not concerned with the future but only with the present and determining a figure for the present. But we determine a figure which will rule so long as it is fixed under the Act until a new figure is put in. But the purpose of the figure is to help to determine the return to be expected from the investment of a sum awarded as general damages for future pecuniary loss. As I understand it, the theory of the law--my noble and learned friend will correct me if I am wrong--is that what the lump sum tries to do under the "pecuniary loss" head is to provide a sum which, coupled with the return which is obtained on it from investment, will compensate for the future loss which the plaintiff has. Therefore, there is a considerable element of judgment in relation to the future involved in this exercise.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-14_para16"></a>It is true that one way of doing that is to accept the judgments of those who are in the market for index-linked government securities at any one moment of time. But the exercise is the exercise that I have indicated. That is what one is trying to do: obtain the best figure one can which will convert the pecuniary loss which has been determined as likely to accrue to the plaintiff into a capital sum, which with its interest and the capital itself will compensate the plaintiff over the years--it may be quite a long time--for that particular loss.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-14_para17"></a>In my submission, the Treasury has an expertise in forecasting--there are differences of view about how great that expertise is, but undoubtedly it has the function of seeking to make such estimates--and it would be right for the Lord Chancellor to take account of it. I submit that the Lord Chancellor would be one <P>


<a name="column_371"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 371</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>who would take into proper account those observations and representations from the Treasury. I have no doubt, as I said, that in fixing the rates a very wide consultation would be expected.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-14_para18"></a>The complexity involved in the selection of rates should not be underestimated. One has only to look in the relevant section of the Financial Times to see the range of possible figures. As is explained in the explanatory notes to the actuarial tables published by the Government Actuary's Department, the published rates make no allowance for the incidence of tax on the income from a compensation award. Assumptions must also be made about the rates of inflation. Also, although swings may not be vast, there are fluctuations which can add to the complexity. Thus, I should certainly believe it right to look to the Treasury, among others, to advise me, and would consider whether it would be helpful here to specify other expert consultees.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-14_para19"></a>I believe that it is perfectly right in the circumstances of this case for the Treasury to be consulted. The Committee will notice that the formula here is not the one to which my noble and learned friend Lord Simon of Glaisdale referred in the first instance as the "agreement" of the Treasury. This is a consultation with the Treasury. It is true that it appears in the Law Commission Bill, probably on the view that it is self-evident. There is no detail at all supporting why the Treasury is mentioned but I feel that the reasons which I gave underlie that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-14_para20"></a>So I submit that it is perfectly right that the Treasury should be consulted, the rule-making authority having the duty of using the representations in the proper way and not simply on the basis that because one party to a potential action wants one thing, that is what should happen. In the light of that explanation, I invite my noble and learned friend to withdraw the amendment.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   The observation of my noble and learned friend Lord Simon of Glaisdale that this provision has given rise to disquiet has in no way been negated. I ask myself why it gives rise to disquiet. The Explanatory Memorandum makes it perfectly clear that the Treasury is likely to have a stake in the way in which the specific prescribed limit is eventually worked out. If that disquiet is justified, then the disquiet concerns consulting the Treasury at all and it will not be removed by it being publicised, "We have taken it out because it looks better, but we propose to do exactly what we would have done if it had been left in." The disquiet would continue and justifiably so.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-15_para0"></a>I should like an opportunity to consider in more detail the observations made by my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor with a view to considering whether or not to return to this matter at Report stage. On that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=2>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60513-15_para2"></a>The noble Lord said: This is the second of the two amendments which I heralded on Second Reading. I regard Amendment No. 3 as a probing amendment to clarify the approach that it is intended that the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Scotland should take when setting the prescribed rate which courts will have to take into account when discounting a lump sum because of the "accelerated payment" element in compensation for future pecuniary loss.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-15_para3"></a>On Second Reading, the noble and learned Lord said that he would consider what the Court of Appeal had to say on this issue later this year before setting the prescribed rate. That, I accept, is sensible. He also said that he would consult widely before setting the rate. That too is sensible. However, the Law Commission has already considered this issue and consulted widely on it. In its report, Structured Settlements and Interim and Provisional Damages, the Law Commission concluded that the appropriate rate was the net return on an index-linked government security. Paragraph 2.28 of the report states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We share the views of the majority of those who responded to us, that a practice of discounting by reference to returns on index-linked government securities would be preferable to the present arbitrary presumption. A 4-5% discount which emerged from the case law was established at a time when index-linked government securities did not exist. Index-linked government securities now constitute the best evidence of the real return on any investment where the risk element is minimal, because they take account of inflation, rather than attempt to predict it as conventional investments do". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-15_para4"></a>We on this side of the Chamber--I have said this before--are anxious to ensure that any under-compensation of victims should not continue. We would therefore like to hear from the noble and learned Lord the Government's current view on the specific Law Commission recommendation that the prescribed rate should be based on the net return on index-linked government securities. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-15_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Chelmsford: </B>   I regret that the insurance community does not agree with the Law Commission on this point. I hope that the Committee will agree with me that the most appropriate discount rate is the one that most accurately matches the investment return available in the commercial markets for prudent and wisely-managed investments.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-15_para5"></a>The courts to date have consistently held that a rate of between 4 per cent. and 5 per cent. is appropriate and that rate is derived from considering the rate of return available on a balanced portfolio of investments, including equities--a "balanced" portfolio. The insurance industry believes that it is unrealistic to use such a low discount rate as the 2.5 per cent. which is the index-linked rate of today. It has three basic reasons for suggesting that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-15_para6"></a>First, there is the analysis carried out by the stockbrokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd in January this year. It shows that the real return available on index-linked gilts is less than half that available on equities. Index-linked gilts have under-performed both cash and conventional gilts. They also do not feature in an optimised portfolio run for UK assets over the period 1983 to 1995.
<P>


<a name="column_373"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 373</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-15_para7"></a>Secondly, independent financial advisers indicated that they would not recommend investment of a large lump sum--that is to say, several hundred thousand pounds--only in index-linked gilts. That is simply because, with a prudent investment strategy and with minimal risk, a much greater rate of return can be achieved on the investment. Typical advice would be to select a spread of equities, gilts and with-profit investments.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-15_para8"></a>Finally, there is the Court of Protection. That is a body which exists to approve investments made on behalf of persons under a disability--for example, minors or mentally incapable persons. Advisers to the Court of Protection indicated that they generally invest in a balanced portfolio of assets. As much as 70 per cent. of that might be in equities. Of the remainder only a small fraction is generally placed in index-linked gilts.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-15_para9"></a>In summary, therefore, the proposed amendment fails to take account of the higher rates of investment which can be achieved with a minimal risk to the investor; that is, the accident victim. And using the lower rate will also lead to higher lump sum awards which the insurance industry believes amount to over-compensation. Incidentally, any such increase will be passed on in increased premiums to all policyholders, especially to motorists and employers.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Meston: </B>   I cannot help feeling that the exchange of views which the Committee has just heard--with the noble Lord, Lord Irvine, on one side and the noble Viscount, Lord Chelmsford, on the other--will encapsulate the debate which will be the subject of pending appeals. The plaintiff will be arguing that he must be properly compensated and protected; the defendant will argue that prudence is not the same as excessive caution.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-15_para10"></a>My only contribution is to point out that the Bar Council, in its response to the Law Commission's consultation paper, favoured the reference to index-linked government securities, which undoubtedly provide good, fresh economic evidence. The Bar Council concluded that in most cases no better guide existed. It said that a discount rate should be based on the ILGS return.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-15_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, for what he said at the outset of his speech on the amendment. The purpose of setting a rate to be applied generally is to obviate the need for evidence in as many cases as possible, as we discussed in relation to Amendment No. 1. On the other hand the courts are fixing damages in relation to rights of action which accrued some time before and usually are covered by contracts of insurance which operated at that time.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-15_para11"></a>When the court makes a change in the law, if it ever does, it will have retrospective effect because the court is dealing with something that happened in the past and is seeking to compensate. There is no doubt about the principle of law involved; that is, that the court is seeking to award a sum which will compensate the plaintiff for, in this case, the pecuniary loss which is the subject of general damages. The law therefore is clear <P>


<a name="column_374"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 374</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>enough in its general principle. As usual, the application of that general principle to the circumstances of a specific case may involve difficult questions.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-15_para12"></a>The difficulty in relation to an Act of Parliament is that it can only properly operate retrospectively in exceptional circumstances. The normal rule of statutory enactment that I have been accustomed to seeing followed is that one does not make retrospective alterations. Therefore, it is extremely important for this power to await the decision of the Court of Appeal on the basis of the present law in the light of the investigations that have been done by the Law Commission over the past year or two to which I referred at Second Reading. I would aim to try to get out of that ultimate decision taken in relation to these cases a principle which would guide one as to the rate that one would take.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-15_para13"></a>There is no doubt that other rates should be considered. It is not just one. The amendment says,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"and in particular shall take into account the net return on any existing index-linked government security". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
The exact return depends a little on the other terms of the security. That is not unique. Therefore, there is more than one. The amendment seeks to take into account the net return. I certainly would be intending that we take that into account but I should also like to know what else is regarded as important. For example, it may well be that a balanced portfolio would have only a portion of such securities in it and that a wise adviser would think that, if a substantial sum was being invested for the purpose of giving a return and in total, along with the return, compensating the plaintiff for future pecuniary loss, that investment would include things other than index-linked government securities. So the estimate would have to try to take account of that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-15_para14"></a>This is a quite complicated exercise. My approach is that it would be right to take into account what the Court of Appeal says is the correct approach to this matter, put into it such information as we have from time to time as to what these various elements would produce in the way of a return and then try to average it over the total of a typical portfolio. I hope that in the light of that explanation the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment, on the basis that I would wish to take account of all the information available to me--I am sure that this would be true of the Lord Chancellor of the time, as this is to be done from time to time--and also consult widely the interests of plaintiffs and of defendants. I am sure that the Bar Council would figure among those properly consulted probably on both sides of that boundary.

<P>

<A NAME = "60513-15_para15"></a>This is a modest amendment because its effect, as I think the noble and learned Lord acknowledged, would be no more than that a mandatory relevant consideration for him to take into account in prescribing the rate would be the net return on index-linked government securities, which for my part I am sure is the best evidence of the real return on any investment where it is intended that the risk element in the investment should be minimal. The noble and learned Lord would not be governed by that consideration. I think it would give much confidence if there were written into the Bill an acceptance that the noble and learned Lord should have regard to that which the Law Commission advises him is the best guide but which he would have a discretion not to apply if he thought that there were other overriding considerations indicating a different rate. Nonetheless, for the present, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60513-16_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: I nearly needed a structured settlement myself as I walked very casually into your Lordships' House some five or 10 minutes ago believing, as I was led to believe, that the business of the Committee stage of this Bill would not be taken before seven o'clock. I have partially recovered and therefore propose to move this amendment but with the courtesy of apologies to those who moved previous amendments and to the noble and learned Lord that I was not present at the very beginning of the Committee stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-16_para6"></a>This is a worthwhile amendment. Your Lordships will well know that the costs of investigating potentially structured settlements or of advising an accident victim <P>


<a name="column_376"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 376</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>on the investment of a lump sum by way of damages can be a very significant sum, particularly in the case of a young severely injured victim who receives an award of perhaps &#163;500,000 or &#163;1 million, which will need very careful husbanding over many years to ensure it produces sufficient income for the victim's ongoing needs and does not run out in the lifetime of the person concerned.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-16_para7"></a>I understand that conventionally it has been accepted that any fees payable to the Court of Protection which invests damages awards for patients are recoverable from the defendant as part of a claim, but there is no similar convention or statutory provision which applies to the cost of investment and financial advice incurred or likely to be incurred by a plaintiff in other circumstances. Indeed I understand that there have been conflicting decisions of the courts in this respect. Given that these costs are incurred by a plaintiff accident victim only because of his or her injuries, it would be entirely logical to make statutory provision that the reasonable costs of investment advice should be recoverable from the defendant tortfeasor. The Bill could provide an opportunity to tidy up this anomaly. That is why I move the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-16_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  I believe that our dinner hour must have started early this evening because the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, noticed that it was expected that this particular matter would be dealt with at that time. However, the Scots are so expeditious that the Education(Scotland) Bill was dealt with extremely quickly. I hope that the Scots involved in this matter will show the same expedition.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-16_para8"></a>I do not completely understand why the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, wishes to put in a matter as regards the relationship of investment advice to structured settlements because it is primarily to avoid the need for a capital investment in respect of the periodical payment element that this particular arrangement is made. I suspect that the amendment may have been intended to have a somewhat wider scope than this particular situation. Where it appears in the Bill means that it has very limited scope. I am not aware of any reason why a structured settlement under which the periodical payments are adjustable to take into account the cost of subsequent financial advice taken by a plaintiff should not in fact attract the same protection as settlements without that feature. Neither can I see any reason why a settlement should contain such a feature because one of the major benefits of structured settlements for a plaintiff is that he is not to be concerned with investment matters and that aspect of his award. He will not be investing an award because the settlement is tailored to provide the income and the capital needed to meet his particular requirement.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-16_para9"></a>Indeed, the Committee may consider that this amendment anticipates that the negotiations for a structured settlement may have gone somewhat wrong if this provision were to be required. The noble Lord may be glad to know that the position as regards the cost of financial advice in relation to the settlement of damages as a whole, and not structured settlements, is one of the matters now under consideration by the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Law Commission in its examination of the law of damages. It will be covered in a forthcoming consultation paper. As the Committee knows, the work that we are dealing with in this Bill is only part of the total, and the Law Commission is looking at quite a number of heads that ought to be considered in this regard. I fully anticipate that this particular subject matter, not in relation to structured settlements, but generally, will be the subject of its consideration. I hope that, with the encouragement that the matter will be looked into thoroughly and will be the subject of a Law Commission recommendation, the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, may feel able not to press the amendment at this juncture.

I was of the opinion, and the noble and learned Lord has confirmed it, that had I tried to deal with this matter under the general head of damages I would have been ruled out of order and very properly so, because this Bill deals with structured settlements and not with the general issue of damages.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-16_para10"></a>I have had the opportunity of raising the matter. With his usual courtesy, the noble and learned Lord has told me that it will be considered by the Law Commission under the general head of damages.

<A NAME="60513-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Meston </B>   moved Amendment No. 6:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 4, line 3, at end insert--
<BR>
("( ) Without prejudice to the other provisions of this section, the funds held by an authorised insurance company to provide payments from an annuity purchased from that authorised insurance company pursuant to a structured settlement may be held by that authorised insurance company as part of a pension annuity fund.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60513-16_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: The encouragement in this Bill of structured settlements has been widely welcomed. The Government had already taken steps to reduce the tax burden so that the flow of income received by a plaintiff from annuity-based arrangements is not subject to income tax, nor any other taxation, in the hands of the recipient. That has the benefit of reducing the gross cost to the defendant. This amendment seeks to deal with one aspect of structured settlements where tax still impinges and where, although it is not widely appreciated, there is still a burden on defendants.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-16_para13"></a>The majority of structured settlements are provided by one or more annuities purchased by the defendant's insurer from a life office to provide regular income for the plaintiff, tax free. However, the income from which those payments are made is liable to tax before it reaches the plaintiff because life offices must maintain annuities for structured settlements as part of their life annuity fund, which annuities are taxed at 20 per cent. That tax burden has therefore to be incorporated into the overall lump sum required to fund a structured settlement. That imposes a higher burden on the defendant and may be a disincentive to an otherwise desirable solution to a particular case.
<P>


<a name="column_378"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 378</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-16_para14"></a>If annuities can be maintained by life offices as part of their pension annuity fund, the 20 per cent. tax on income would not arise. I understand that life offices would have no problem in segregating such an annuity within the pension annuity fund and I suspect that there would be a fairly minimal difference to the revenue. Having said that, I am conscious that this amendment may be thought to trespass on the financial privilege of another place and, therefore, I emphasise that at this stage it is only a probing amendment. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-16_spmin2"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  I am grateful to the noble Lord for explaining the purpose of this amendment. I had not been able to recognise precisely the term he had in mind. I have consulted with the Association of British Insurers on the matter. I understand that it is normal practice for insurance annuities to be covered by an insurance company's pension fund, although in some circumstances it may be covered by the long-term fund. However, as far as I am aware companies do not operate, nor have they asked to operate, special pension annuity funds. In any case, this differentiation is immaterial because in the event of a failure liabilities arising from both the long-term and pension funds would be covered by the Policyholders Protection Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-16_para15"></a>However, having listened to the noble Lord this evening, I anticipate that he is asking for the treatment given to funds which arise under pension arrangements which enjoy special tax privileges on investment. That is clearly a Finance Act-type provision. Therefore, I will not be in a position to deal with that aspect of the matter if some special tax relief is wanted, not only in the hands of a recipient, but also in the basic funds which are used to provide it. That is a different matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-16_para16"></a>The obligation of the annuity provider is to provide it out of whatever fund is considered appropriate. There would not be a need for an allocation. The tax treatment of pension funds which are derived from, for example, the self-employed arrangement, leads to a fund derived from the original taxpayer. The taxpayer is allowed to put in money which is earmarked from that stage and it enjoys certain benefits. The annuity which has to be provided is not of that character exactly. As I say, my consultations so far have not produced any real basis for this measure, but I understand what the noble Lord says. He would like some further tax privilege for some fund as yet not completely identified.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="60513-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Meston: </B>   I had thought that the amendment was proposed as the logical way of taking forward the overall immunity from tax of structured settlements--in other words, that the impact of tax should not have to be a consideration either in the mind of the plaintiff or his advisers or in that of the defendant and his advisers and insurers. I understand the reasoning behind the answer that has been given by the noble and learned Lord. The objective of the amendment was to find some way, artificial though it might be, to reduce the overall cost of structured settlements. I am conscious that this trespasses into the area of taxation, but it is a matter on which I wish to consult further. For that reason, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-17_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mishcon </B>   moved Amendment No. 7:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 4, line 27, leave out from ("designated") to end of line 29 and insert ("by regulations made by the Minister and subject to approval by resolution of both Houses of Parliament.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60513-17_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: The Committee will be aware that Clause 6 deals with guarantees of public sector settlements. In subsection (3) it is provided:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The bodies in relation to which a Minister may give such a guarantee shall, subject to subsection (4) below, be such bodies as are designated in relation to the relevant government department by guidelines agreed upon between that department and the Treasury". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
The purpose of this amendment is not to leave it simply to guidelines but to ensure that the relevant Minister has power to designate and Parliament has publicly the right to deal with it by a resolution that comes before both Houses. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-17_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  The purpose of Clause 6 is to facilitate the use of structured settlements. Ministers are given this new power so that there will be no technical difficulties preventing them from guaranteeing self-funded structured settlements offered by public sector bodies for which their departments have responsibility. It is given only to allay the concern of some plaintiffs' advisers that unless such backing can be put in place they will be failing in their duties to their clients to ensure the absolute security of the arrangements being made for the clients' future needs. That is a conscientious attitude and very proper, although I believe that it is unnecessarily cautious. The Committee will be aware of the reasons why such a guarantee would never in practice be called upon. It could be called upon only in the highly improbable event of the public body for which the department had responsibility not having the funds to meet its legal obligations or ceasing to exist without provision being made for its legal liabilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-17_para4"></a>While it is true that such settlements are most likely to be relevant in the health sector where it is not difficult to identify those bodies likely to be offering settlements, the Government fully accepted the Law Commission's advice that this provision should have the potential to cover other sectors where public bodies might face personal injury claims which could to the benefit of the claimant sensibly be settled in this way, provided that his advisers could recommend the settlement as being fully secure. There are very many public bodies where this might be the case, albeit perhaps only very occasionally, and certainly not on the scale seen in the health sector. We considered very carefully how those bodies should be identified and reached the firm conclusion that the best way of doing this was by administrative arrangements between those departments which might be concerned and the Treasury. Once the Minister gives a guarantee, that is the security. It would be clear that the involvement of the Treasury as watchdog of the public purse would ensure that there could be no inappropriate use of the power. We regarded that as a sensible safeguard.
<P>


<a name="column_380"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 380</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-17_para5"></a>We also considered that it would be right to make provision for scrutiny by Parliament on a regular basis of the potential liabilities under and any payments which might have been made pursuant to guarantees by each department which had used the power. We concluded that, with these safeguards in place, it was unnecessary and undesirable to adopt any more cumbersome procedure. The Select Committee on the Scrutiny of Delegated Powers looked closely at this provision and was satisfied that it was a purely administrative procedure.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-17_para6"></a>For these reasons, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, will agree that his proposal adds unnecessarily to the arrangements that have been put in place. Subsection (7) is the provision which requires public scrutiny. The only important matter from the point of view of the plaintiff is that the Minister should give the necessary guarantee. Parliament will be kept informed as to what guarantees have been given by subsection (7). Of course, Ministers are accountable to Parliament at all times for their actions in the public arena. In effect, it is the same as agreeing to a settlement. That is not subject to regulation. If a Minister agrees to settle an action, he or she can do so. This is part of the settlement of an action to which the Minister has agreed to give his or her guarantee in the circumstances required. We have provided these additional administrative safeguards to cover the situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-17_para7"></a>While I am very glad to consider any proposals that may be an improvement, strictly speaking this is probably an additional administrative or regulatory burden which is not necessary in the circumstances of this case to secure adequately the plaintiff's interests, on the one hand, and the interests of the public as taxpayers, on the other. I hope that in the light of that explanation the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mishcon: </B>   I am deeply grateful to the noble and learned Lord. I owe it in respect to him to consider what he has said when I read it in Hansard tomorrow. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 5, line 24, at end insert--
<BR>
("( ) This Act does not apply where the cause of action arose before this Act came into force.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60513-17_para12"></a>The noble Viscount said: Amendment No. 8 assumes that the Bill as currently drafted is passed and that my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor instructs the courts to use a rate of return equal to the current index-linked gilt edged rates. A larger sum will be needed initially to achieve a lifetime award than is currently necessary by discounting at the rate of 4 per cent. or 5 per cent. Put another way, a lower discount rate means a smaller adjustment for the <P>


<a name="column_381"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 381</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>investment return and therefore increased compensation. This increase can and will be taken into account when setting premiums for future policies.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-17_para13"></a>However, insurance companies have many thousands of claims in the pipeline awaiting settlement. These claims will arise under policies issued in the past. If the compensation due in these cases were to be increased by this legislation the industry could not charge any further premium to reflect that increase. That would be inequitable. That is the effect of the Bill as currently drafted. Under Clause 8(3) the legislation comes into force two months after it has been passed. Pipeline claims will then be assessed under the new rules. This is legislation with a retrospective impact.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-17_para14"></a>Insurers believe that the impact can be eliminated largely by ensuring that the new rules apply only to accidents and claims which occur after the Bill comes into force. This will provide certainty for all concerned: plaintiffs, defendants, insurers and their advisers. My amendment offers this solution.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-17_para15"></a>Initial consultation within the insurance industry shows that the retrospective cost is at least &#163;200 million for motor insurers alone, although a figure of between &#163;500 million and &#163;1 billion is probably the truer cost to the insurance industry as a whole. Even if the amendment is passed, the industry will still pay larger amounts on current policies which produce claims after the Act incepts without any chance of further amendments. Although they accept that, they ask that there should not be retrospective legislation in respect of claims which have already occurred or still await judgment. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Meston: </B>   My only observation is that it could work the other way: in pending appeals the court could decide that a low rate of, say, 3 per cent. was appropriate and the Lord Chancellor in formulating a prescribed rate under the Bill, if enacted, could decide upon a higher rate.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513-17_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  It must be correct that, as the noble Lord, Lord Meston, said, this could operate either way, depending upon how the power was exercised. That is the problem to which I referred earlier which troubles me about how precisely to go about this and why I wish to wait until the Court of Appeal, which is not in any way affected by the statute on this aspect, has decided what is the right way to go about it. When I said the Court of Appeal, I was intending to include the remote possibility that someone might think that it was not final on this matter and that a final judgment should come from the House of Lords. Assuming that the decision were appealed, I should think it right to wait for that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-17_para16"></a>The amendment would affect the whole of the Bill. I do not believe that it would be necessary for the purposes that my noble friend has explained to do more than apply it to Clause 1. I believe that the industry would be in favour of structured settlements coming in as soon as possible. They are of course in already, but there is a slight doubt about competency and that is settled by the Bill. So this applies to Clause 1 only.
<P>


<a name="column_382"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column 382</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-17_para17"></a>However, in relation to Clause 1 it poses a difficult question which I sought to address somewhat tangentially earlier. If the settling of the rate were to cause a general increase or general decrease--either way--it would be in the nature of a retrospective interference with the ordinary course of development of these claims.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-17_para18"></a>It may well be that the court--the court has been asked to do this from time to time--could decide that the previous rate of 4 per cent. to 5 per cent. is these days unrealistic, notwithstanding Lord Diplock's commendation of it, and that a new rate should be taken as being more realistic to achieve the aim which I understand to be the aim of the law; namely, to compensate the plaintiff for the loss which he or she has suffered. If the courts did that, it would raise the total of damages which insurers might thereafter have to pay. That would not be Parliament doing it; it would be the court doing it. That is the difficulty. I believe that the aim of the power should be to try to arrive at the figure that the courts would think the right figure at the present time. Therefore, it should apply not only to causes of action accruing after this date.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-17_para19"></a>This is the most difficult aspect of the matter. It applies whether or not there is a fixed rate. Even the original Law Commission proposals had this problem attached to them. I have put forward the best solution; namely, by this power I would be seeking to approximate as closely as possible with what the court says is the proper level for the purpose of not altering the level but of merely making it easier for the future to reach that level without the necessity for detailed actuarial calculations.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513-17_para20"></a>The other possibility of course is to apply the amendment to Clause 1 only and then to leave it, as it were, to the Lord Chancellor to set a rate which might not reflect the existing rate but some rate which he thought was better--either up or down--than the existing rate. As I said, that is not what I believe to be the right aim in this matter, which raises a difficult question. I hope that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw the amendment and consider what I have said about it to see what is the best way forward.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="60513-18_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  Similar considerations apply in respect of that provision as apply in respect of this. It may not be perhaps so clear, but obviously a similar problem arises. I am anxious not to involve myself, or anyone else for that matter, in Parliament retrospectively altering the basis upon which damages are assessed in respect of causes of action that have already accrued. On the other hand, Parliament is entitled, as I see it, to make procedural improvements in current cases where the substantive rights are not affected. In so far as it is <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>just an improvement in the procedure, that is all well and good, but there is an underlying feeling in some quarters that both Clause 1 and Section 10 of the Civil Evidence Act, which the noble Lord suggested on an earlier occasion should be put in place--it came out of this but we put it in a little in advance--could affect basic substantive changes in the level of damages, and I need to try to avoid that.

<A NAME="60513-18_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Chelmsford: </B>   We have had an interesting reply from my noble and learned friend. I should like to think about all that he has said. I distinctly heard him say that he did not wish to damage the insurance industry through retrospective legislation, and that is the point about which the insurance industry is concerned.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513w01_wqn2"></A><B> Lord Wade of Chorlton </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What proposals they have to improve forestry consultation procedures.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513w01_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   In our response to the Environment Select Committee's report on Forestry and the Environment, we said that we would ask the Forestry Commission to review its procedures for consulting on planting and felling proposals. The Forestry Commission has now completed this review, following consultation with the relevant statutory bodies and a wide range of environmental, land use and forestry organisations.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513w01_para0"></a>The review revealed that the Forestry Commission consults on the vast majority of schemes but that consultation results in no substantive comment in most <P>


<a name="column_WA30"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column WA30</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>cases. Woodland owners and landowners said that the present procedures are time consuming and expensive and that the application of the procedures to small and non-contentious cases results in unnecessary delays; they said that the Forestry Commission should be able to determine applications in a wider range of circumstances than at present. On the other hand, local authorities, statutory nature conservation, countryside and environment protection bodies and environmental organisations were concerned that any changes to the procedures should not preclude consultation on sensitive cases and that the Forestry Commission should agree the circumstances in which consultation will take place. They were also concerned that the procedures should apply to all types of woodland planting, including short rotation coppice and planting on set aside land.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513w01_para1"></a>Since the present arrangements were introduced in 1984 the background against which grant and felling applications are considered has changed considerably. We now have a grant scheme designed to deliver multiple purpose forestry and a series of detailed environmental guidelines. We operate a general presumption against the felling and conversion of woodland to other land uses. Large or very sensitive new planting proposals are subject to statutory environmental assessment. In addition, indicative forestry strategies give local authorities the opportunity to indicate in broad terms those areas which they regard as environmentally sensitive and those where they would like to see forestry positively encouraged. We have also introduced a public register of new planting proposals which enables interested parties to know what is proposed and to submit comments. As we announced in the 1996 Sustainable Development White Paper (This Common Inheritance: 1996 UK Annual Report, Cm 3188), the Forestry Commission is preparing a set of forestry standards that we will use as a basis for monitoring and reporting on environmental standards in managed woodland.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513w01_para2"></a>Against this background and in the light of the review we have decided to make a number of changes to the procedures.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513w01_para3"></a>We believe that the public should be given a greater opportunity to comment on new planting and felling and restocking proposals. We have therefore decided to include felling proposals in the Forestry Commission's public register of applications and to make the register more readily accessible. As well as making the register available for inspection by the public in local authority planning offices, the Commission will, in due course, arrange for the register to be accessed via the Internet. The Commission will also send copies of the register to the relevant statutory bodies. Anyone with an interest in a woodland planting or felling and restocking proposal will be able to comment to the Forestry Commission, which will take account of all the comments it receives in determining an application.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513w01_para4"></a>In addition, the Forestry Commission will consult with relevant statutory bodies before deciding on new planting proposals in the following circumstances:

<P>

<A NAME = "60513w01_para12"></a>Whereas new planting involves a change of land use, felling is part of the ongoing business of woodland management and we believe it should be handled with a lighter touch. The Forestry Commission will consult local authorities and the relevant statutory bodies on felling proposals in the following circumstances:

<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "60513w01_para16"></a>Environmental sensitivity does not depend on size and location alone and there may be circumstances in addition to those I have set out when it will be appropriate for the Forestry Commission to consult with local authorities or statutory bodies before determining applications for new planting or felling. The Forestry Commission may therefore agree other, special circumstances when it will consult local authorities or relevant statutory bodies where a local authority or statutory body identifies clear and objective grounds for doing so.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513w01_para17"></a>In all those cases where the Forestry Commission consults a local authority or statutory body on a new planting or felling proposal, the present arrangements
<P>


<a name="column_WA32"></a>

<B>13 May 1996 : Column WA32</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>for resolving objections will continue to be applied. In all other cases, the Forestry Commission will determine applications in the light of any comments it receives, including any views it may decide to solicit from any organisation or individual.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513w01_para18"></a>Concern was expressed during the review that the 1984 Ministerial Direction does not give the Forestry Commission sufficient powers to require new planting and felling proposals to comply with its environmental guidelines prior to consultation. This has resulted in the Forestry Commission consulting on proposals that do not meet the necessary standard. This wastes time and reduces confidence in the procedures. We have therefore decided that the Commission should be able to reject an application at any stage if it does not meet the environmental guidelines or if in the opinion of the Commission it would be likely to cause significant harm to the environment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513w01_para19"></a>The arrangements that we have announced today will remove unnecessary and unproductive consultation which is wasteful of everyone's time and off-putting to those wishing to plant or manage woodlands. The greater openness we are introducing, together with the Forestry Commission's existing environmental guidelines, statutory environmental assessment for large or very sensitive woodland planting proposals and the forestry standards which the Commission is currently preparing, will allow consultation to be focused on genuinely sensitive cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513w01_para20"></a>I am confident that the new arrangements will eliminate much of the unnecessary bureaucracy inherent in the present system while, at the same time, maintaining the present high standards of environmental protection. The arrangements will come into effect on 1st August 1996.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60513w02_para31"></a>At regional and local level, the main action has been the establishment of 105 Drug Action Teams across England, and their local community networks (Drug Reference Groups). All teams were established by 30th September 1995, and we agreed all their action plans for 1996-97 and 1997-98 by the beginning of April. Every team comprises senior professionals from the relevant health and local authorities, and police probation, and (where appropriate) prison services. Some teams also include voluntary sector, business and Customs representatives. All are seeking to encourage these and other groups to engage in practical work to tackle drug misuse on the ground. A digest of examples, drawn from the first action plans, has been published to help on this.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513w02_para32"></a>To assist in assessing the effectiveness of the strategy as it develops, baseline information on the key performance indicators set out in Tackling Drugs Together is now being collected. The significance of these indicators--and others locally--will be their trends over time. But the immense commitment to tackling drug misuse which has been shown across the country--especially amongst Drug Action Teams--is already very encouraging. The Government will continue to support this work as a high priority, both through the Central Drugs Co-ordination Unit and in other ways.

<A NAME="60513w03_wqn0"></A><B> Lord Hylton </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they will issue guidance designed to prevent the remanding in custody of women charged with offences which do not involve violence.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513w03_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   The decision as to whether an accused person in criminal proceedings should be remanded in custody or released on bail is a matter for the court in the exercise of its judicial discretion, in accordance with the Bail Act 1976. The 1976 Act contains a general presumption in favour of bail, subject to certain exceptions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513w03_wqn1"></A><B> Lord Hylton </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What will be the impact of imposed cuts in
repairs and maintenance at the following prisons: Bristol, Brixton, Dartmoor, Exeter, Leeds, Liverpool, North Sea Camp (Lincolnshire), Pentonville, Preston, Swansea, Wakefield, Wandsworth, Wetherby and Wormwood Scrubs; whether any cells will have to be closed, and if so, how many; and whether remand prisoners will once again be lodged in police cells.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513w03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Responsibility for this matter has been delegated to the Director General of the Prison Service, who has been asked to arrange a reply to be given.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513w03_para0"></a>Letter to Lord Hylton from the Director General of the Prison Service, Mr. Richard Tilt, dated 13th May 1996.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513w03_para1"></a>Lady Blatch has asked me to reply to your recent Question about the impact of cuts in repairs and maintenance at 14 prisons (Bristol, Brixton, Dartmoor, Exeter, Leeds, Liverpool, North Sea Camp (Lincolnshire), Pentonville, Preston, Swansea, Wakefield, Wandsworth, Wetherby and Wormwood Scrubs); whether any cells will have to be closed; and whether remand prisoners will once again be lodged in police cells.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513w03_para2"></a>The reduction in the centrally-funded Prison Service repairs and maintenance budget in 1996-97, which is classified as work not affecting the continued operation of prison wings, means that some 50 per cent. (around &#163;16 million) of projects have been deferred until later years. However, schemes which have been identified as vital are proceedings in 1996-97. Because of the nature of maintenance work, it is possible that other schemes might have a higher priority during the year and the Prison Service strategy is to monitor and review the situation on a regular basis.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513w03_para3"></a>The repairs and maintenance budget is separate from the much larger budget for refurbishment and modernisation. The reduction in this expenditure during the current financial year will mean that our plans to modernise and/or install sanitation at the 14 prisons will be changed. The general effect is that some schemes which were due to start in 1996-7 will be deferred until later years.

<A NAME = "60513w03_para4"></a>An assessment of the effect on the possibility of police cell use of the reduction in capital expenditure was made in December 1995. This work concluded that there was no significant increase in the risk of using police cells in the 1996-97 financial year.
<P>

<A NAME = "60513w03_para5"></a>The Prison Service has not been using police cells since June 1995. Apart from a major unplanned loss of accommodation or an unexpected rise in the population above current projections, we do not plan to use police cells.

<A NAME="60513w03_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Non-governmental organisations do not give formal evidence to the United Nations Human Rights Committee, but may send material to the committee at any time. It is not the practice of the committee to draw this material to the attention of the state concerned to assist in preparation of periodic reports to the committee or in preparation for the examination of such reports.

<A NAME = "60513w03_para9"></a>Her Majesty's Government received copies of documents prepared by a number of organisations, including Liberty, the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties, Amnesty International, Justice and the Howard League for Penal Reform, which had been sent to the United Nations Human Rights Committee in advance of the United Kingdom's oral examination on its Fourth Periodic Report under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

<P>

<A NAME = "60513w03_para10"></a>When a licensed company does not agree to a proposal for a licence modification by the regulator, the matter may be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. There is no specific right of appeal for licensees against determinations made by the directors general under existing licence conditions although there are avenues of appeal elsewhere--e.g., by judicial review.

<P>
<UL>In relation to the contracts placed with Electronic Data Services (EDS) for the facilities management of computer systems within government departments and agencies, whether those contracts cover the cost of modifying these systems to address the year 2000 problem.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60513w03_spnew8"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   Full information on contracts placed with EDS is not held centrally, and can only be provided at disproportionate cost. However some of the contracts with EDS were placed before the year 2000 issues had been identified and any costs of dealing with problems will have to be examined against the terms of individual contracts. The Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency is developing contract conditions and warranties to include in any new contracts and is preparing advice and guidance on the practical steps to be taken by government departments and agencies in respect of existing contracts to minimise the costs of dealing with this problem.

The United Kingdom's contribution to the Community budget for this will be around 14 per cent. The Fontainebleau abatement does not apply to expenditure going to third countries.
