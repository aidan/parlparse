<a name="60327-01_star0"></a><h3 align=center>National Patient Safety Agency</h3>

<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="60327-01_spopq0"></a><b> Baroness Elles </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>What progress has been made on the collection of data by the National Patient Safety Agency.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="60327-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Department of Health  (Lord Warner): </b>  My Lords, the vast majority of NHS patients receive safe and effective care but, in any healthcare system, mistakes can happen. To enable the NHS to learn from mistakes, the Government established the National Patient Safety Agency, which set up a reporting and learning system to which all NHS organisations in England and Wales are now reporting patient safety incidents. Drawing on this information, the NPSA has produced one report and will shortly produce a second focusing on mental health. The agency will be moving to quarterly reports.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="60327-01_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Elles: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. How many patient incidents and near misses were reported in 2005? The Comptroller and Auditor General&#039;s report of October 2005 referred to about 30 different outlets by which trusts could report to the patient safety organisation. Because of the consequential overlap, many doubt the value of reporting to the agency. Has the NPSA made any improvements in reporting back, at regular intervals, on safety measures that should be undertaken on a national level, with reports to be sent to local trusts?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="60327-01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, the answer to the first question is that the NPSA had just over 85,000 incidents reported in 2005. From November 2003 to March 2005, nearly 70 per cent of reported incidents caused no harm to patients. On the number of sources of information, I understand that the majority of NHS staff will need to report a patient safety incident only once: to their local risk management system, which will notify the agency.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="60327-01_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Neuberger: </b>   My Lords, following questions asked by the Public Accounts Committee in January, what data on adverse events are being collected from the independent sector before the NHS commissions interventions and operations from it? When will the NPSA cover all healthcare settings, including nursing homes, so that the data are not purely NHS premises-related but about all the UK&#039;s patients, especially the older patients, the importance of which, I think, today&#039;s news makes abundantly clear?
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="60327-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, the registration of the independent sector is done through the Healthcare <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_536"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 536</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Commission, which receives information from the sector on that. We are working with the independent sector to develop the reporting of these incidents in independent sector treatment centres.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="60327-01_spnew4"></a><b> Earl Howe: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that it is only by putting the data into the public domain regularly that a culture of safety will be embedded in the NHS, something that we all want to see? Are the Government willing to envisage greater transparency in the whole area?
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="60327-01_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, we are making sure that there is good feedback to the NHS. A key principle of the reporting system is to ensure that there is confidentiality in relation to what comes up to the national level so that there is anonymity and so that, at the local level, people&#039;s names are protected but the organisation itself can learn from mistakes.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="60327-01_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Marsh: </b>   My Lords, let us take the specific case of cross-infection and its effect on patients. To what extent do the Government think that contracting out cleaning services should be continued without some sort of control?
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="60327-01_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, this is slightly wide of the Question, but I can tell the noble Lord that there is good evidence, as I know from my previous job, that there is not much difference between the cross-infection rates in hospitals that have contracted out their cleaning services and those that have such services in-house.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="60327-01_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Morgan of Drefelin: </b>   My Lords, it is vital that the information coming from the National Patient Safety Agency is made available to patient organisations, so will my noble friend confirm that it is possible for patients to make reports to the agency with anonymity?
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="60327-01_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, it is possible to report incidents to the agency, but probably the best source is to report them to the local trust, so that they can be fed into its risk management system and onwards to the agency. We are concerned that the NPSA should continue to put information into the public arena so that everybody knows where they stand on such incidents.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="60327-01_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Cumberlege: </b>   My Lords, in the light of the reorganisations that are going on the National Health Service, will the noble Lord assure us that the NPSA will continue at least for the life of this Parliament?
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="60327-01_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, we have actually given the NPSA more functions, as I recall, and we have no plans to do other than continue to support its important work.
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="60327-01_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Elles: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister tell the House whether the NPSA now makes regular reports back to local trusts, which it had failed to do until last year?
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="60327-01_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I understand that there is good feedback to the NHS. There is a website that is accessible to NHS trusts, so that they can see, on an anonymised basis, what is going on in other trusts as well.

<a name="time_0"></a>
<a name="60327-01_time0"></a><h5>2.43 pm</h5>
<p><a name="qn_1"></a>
<a name="60327-01_spopq1"></a><b> Baroness Wilkins </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>Whether they will commission research into how many disabled people who are without speech have an unmet need for a communication aid.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="60327-01_spmin1"></a><b>The Minister of State, Department of Health  (Lord Warner): </b>  My Lords, my department has commissioned research on communication therapy and aids. Responsibility for assessing people&#039;s individual communication aids needs rests with local health and social care agencies. They are in the best position to determine local service priorities, using the increasing resources that the Government have made available. We will continue with stakeholders to consider this area as we take forward the implementation of the White Paper, <i>Our health, our care, our say</i>.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="60327-01_spnew14"></a><b> Baroness Wilkins: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that Answer. Does he agree that being deprived of speech is probably the most disabling condition and that our ignorance of the extent of the need for communication aids makes it unlikely that sufficient provision will be made at local level amid all the other competing needs? The Minister will be aware that the only ring-fenced funding for the aids&#151;the communication aids project&#151;ends this week. What assurance can he give the House that reliable arrangements will be put in place to ensure statutory funding for this extremely vulnerable group of children and adults, so that they do not remain largely dependent on charitable sources to have their needs met?
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="60327-01_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, on the general point, we believe that, despite the difficulties, it is right that people at the local level should assess the needs required and use the resources available to them to meet the priorities that are established. The communication aids project was always intended to be a time-limited project that would cease on 31 March. Important lessons have been learnt by those in other parts of the country from that project.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="60327-01_spnew16"></a><b> Baroness Darcy de Knayth: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that communication is a fundamental human right? It is essential in education and employment and for social inclusion. I know that the Government are to undertake research but, if the project is to cease, can the Minister ensure that such a basic human right will be met?
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="60327-01_spnew17"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I certainly agree that this is an important issue in enabling people to participate fully in our society. That is why it is important that local health and social care agencies address the issues raised by this set of needs and, in the light of local priorities, respond to them.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="60327-01_spnew18"></a><b> Lord Addington: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that the idea of reasonableness is something to which <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_538"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 538</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the Government agreed in the Disability Discrimination Act and in the follow-up legislation last year? How could it be reasonable to deny someone the support that allows them to talk?
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60327-02.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="60327-02_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I am not sure in how many more ways I can say this: we accept that it is an important issue. It is important that people have assistance with communication where they need it, so that they can participate in society. I repeat the point that I was making: it is down to people at the local level to assess those needs and to meet them when they need to do so. In relation to children, if there are special educational needs and an assessment is made, there is then an obligation on a local authority to respond to that assessment appropriately.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="60327-02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that people without speech and communication, especially children, suffer horrendous difficulties, compounded by loneliness? The Government gave &#163;21 million in the past five years to help such people. That was regarded as a vital supplement. What is the difference between the past five years and the next five years? Why has the supplement now become not so vital?
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="60327-02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, it was always intended that the programme would be time-limited. We now know from the experience of that programme that a lot of work has been done with local authorities to enable them to learn lessons from it. There is a good stock of CAP case studies showing how agencies have worked together in support of children with significant communication difficulties. All local authorities can learn from that experience.
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="60327-02_spnew3"></a><b> Earl Howe: </b>   My Lords, the Minister has made it clear that, so far as the Government are concerned, ensuring that those in need receive the help that they require is down to decision-making at a local level. Am I right in thinking that there are no nationally agreed criteria or systems for providing communication aids and that even now there is considerable variation in provision between different sectors, which results in major problems? Will the end of the communication aids project not mean a postcode lottery appearing in this area?
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="60327-02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, guidance has been given in <i>The National Service Framework for Long-term Conditions</i>. The function on communication is central to themes in our document <i>Improving the life chances of disabled people</i>. We take the issue very seriously. We have allocated increasingly large resources to local authorities for social services and to the NHS in relation to health needs. We expect people to use the national service frameworks and guidance to meet the needs in their local communities.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="60327-02_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Morris of Manchester: </b>   My Lords, can the Minister tell the House what assessments the Government have made of the number of people on <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 539</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

incapacity benefit who could undertake work if they were provided with adequate communication equipment?
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="60327-02_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I do not have that information immediately to hand, but I shall look into the matter and write to my noble friend.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="60327-02_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Laming: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that this would be a good topic on which to invite the health inspectorate and the social care inspectorate to do a joint inspection to see how well the systems are working at local level? As the noble Lord indicated, it is a matter for local services, and it would be helpful if the inspectorate could assess how well they were working.
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="60327-02_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I am certainly willing to look into the issue with my colleagues. I remind the noble Lord that in our White Paper, <i>Our health, our care, our say, </i>the new director of adult social services and the directors of public health were identified as key in advising on how local authorities and PCTs would promote the health and well-being of their local communities. This is one of the issues that we would expect them to pay attention to.
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="60327-02_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that, according to research conducted by the Chief Inspector of Prisons, a significant proportion of young people coming into the criminal justice system has significant communication difficulties but that the sample work conducted in a particular institution has not been rolled out throughout the prison system? Does he think that it is important to measure the communication difficulties of people in the criminal justice system and to do something about it?
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="60327-02_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I am aware of the general problem, and I will certainly draw the points that the noble Lord has made to my colleagues&#039; attention.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="60327-02_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   My Lords, I accept that the Minister is absolutely right to say that this is a problem with a local solution, but the Government have none the less taken on board the need for numbers of doctors, nurses and therapists&#151;in this case, speech therapists. What assessment have the Government made of the need for speech therapists, and are they up to strength?
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="60327-02_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I am delighted to tell the House that between December 1997 and 2004, the number of speech and language therapists employed in the NHS increased by 1,684, or 35 per cent.
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="60327-02_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Ramsbotham: </b>   My Lords, I draw the Minister&#039;s attention to the fact that for two years, until last July, a trial pilot of speech and language therapists, funded by the Helen Hamlyn Trust, was run in two young offender establishments with the plea that the Government should pick up that bill because of the enormous good work that they would do. Since then, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_540"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 540</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

there has been nothing but silence because neither the Home Office nor the National Health Service has been able to agree who might pay for the vital people to do that vital work.

<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="60327-02_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Chesterton </b>  My Lords, I beg to leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper. In doing so, I declare an interest as a recent technical witness.
</p>

<a name="60327-02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>The Question was as follows:
</p>

<a name="60327-02_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>To ask Her Majesty&#039;s Government what steps they are taking to ensure fairness and cost-effectiveness in scientific investigations in criminal trials in light of the cost and outcome of recent trials.
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="60327-02_spmin0"></a><b>The Attorney-General  (Lord Goldsmith): </b>  My Lords, the Government are committed to fairness and cost-effectiveness in cases involving forensic science and expert witnesses. Lessons learnt from recent trials, particularly those involving infant deaths, have resulted in a number of initiatives, including the publication of guidance to experts, which I announced to the House on 14 February this year. That guidance sets standards for the use of experts in criminal trials across the justice system.
</p>




<p><a name="st_38"></a>
<a name="60327-02_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Chesterton: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply. Are Her Majesty&#039;s Government aware of the bias in current procedures, as costly scientific investigations by the prosecution are not open to inspection and comment by the defence experts at their planning stage? Because the results are disclosed only on completion of experiments, the defence, with limited public funds, needs to do its own studies and experiments. Therefore, will the Government encourage trial judges to follow the practice of some civil trials and insist on more openness in scientific investigations in order to reduce costs and ensure greater fairness to both parties?
</p>




<p><a name="st_39"></a>
<a name="60327-02_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   My Lords, I do not agree with my noble friend about bias in the system. At the end of the day, the issue is always going to be whether the prosecution has proved a case beyond reasonable doubt. I am aware of the case in which my noble friend appeared. I know that in that high-profile case some of the investigations that the police carried out resulted in invitations to the defence to participate and observe those experiments. Others took place at an earlier stage while the original investigation was taking place. Obviously, I agree with my noble friend that it is important that when the case comes to trial there is as <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_541"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 541</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

much agreement between the experts as possible; and openness between the experts is one of the ways to achieve that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="60327-02_spnew17"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   My Lords, in the new protocol in complex criminal cases, the exchange of expert scientific reports is required at a preliminary case management hearing. Experts must meet and identify points in agreement and points in dispute. Does the noble and learned Lord not think it desirable, where expert evidence is in dispute, to require the judge to test at a preliminary case management hearing the methodology behind the conclusions of both sides&#151;its theoretical and experimental basis; whether it is subject to peer review; its known error rate; and the degree of acceptance of a particular theory in the scientific community? Would that not give experts on both sides time for reflection, for further investigation with all the material available and for review? That would be far better than having it all thrashed out at trial in front of the jury.
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60327-03.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_41"></a>
<a name="60327-03_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Goldsmith: </b>   My Lords, I agree with the noble Lord thus far. It will be highly desirable in the case management hearings that will increasingly take place for the trial judge to play an active role in trying to identify the issues. That goes for non-scientific and scientific issues. I agree with him that one way of doing that will be for the judge on the scientific side to invite defence and prosecution to answer the sort of questions that he has identified. At the end of the day, it will have to be for the jury and not the judge to decide whether the scientific evidence is valid.

Can the Minister deny reports that the MoD is considering the Rafale, especially given the problems that the French are experiencing with it? Can he give a guarantee that there is no intention to share JSF technology with European countries? The US are concerned that this could result in some technology leakage to the Chinese.

Can he assure us that this is being dealt with as a matter of urgency to restore confidence in a project which should be enormously worth while to the United Kingdom?

We have had three meetings in the past 10 days with the Administration on this subject. It is not a problem related to a lack of will on either part. My noble friend is absolutely right; it is a complex process. None the less, the pace at which the threats change these days requires us to have a more fluid process. That is what we aim to achieve.

That means that all practical options need to be looked at, which must include an upgrade to the Harrier, the possibility of a Rafale M or a new variant to the Eurofighter.

<a name="60327-03_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Drayson: </b>   My Lords, I am happy to assure the House that all options have been looked at throughout the JSF programme and that, as we take forward our contingency plans, we continue to take into account value for money, cost-effectiveness and in-service date.

<p><a name="st_52"></a>
<a name="60327-03_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Drayson: </b>   Yes, my Lords, I absolutely agree. It is very important that we have the capability to fight with this aircraft, to maintain it and to upgrade it through its life. It will be a central plank of our strategic defence posture as part of carrier strike. It is essential that we have this technology transfer. We will not be able to buy the aircraft if we do not have it.

<a name="60327-03_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Drayson: </b>   My Lords, I can assure the House that we have the necessary protection for our fleet today and that we will ensure that it has the protection that it needs in future.

<a name="60327-03_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Lyell: </b>   My Lords, can the Minister confirm what I think I heard him say to the noble Lord, Lord Garden, referring to the Harrier? I understand that the GR 7/9 variety is being developed for marine and other such mixed operations.

</p>




<p><a name="st_56"></a>
<a name="60327-03_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Drayson: </b>   My Lords, I am sure that the House will understand that it is not in the British interest for us to go into detail about the specifics of our contingency plans.

</p>




<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="60327-04_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith </b>   moved Amendment No. 1:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>Page 2, line 7, after &quot;managed&quot; insert &quot;, having regard to the need to contain global warming,&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_545"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 545</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60327-04_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the Prime Minister himself said that the problem of global warming is probably the most important subject that any Government face. Indeed, it is probably even more significant than international terrorism. I make no apologies for tabling a redesigned amendment to try to persuade the Government that it is worth mentioning the subject in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60327-04_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>I have said before in this House that the news on global warming is consistently bad. I paid some tribute to the Government over the weekend because they made an announcement in the press about micro-generation. That is one of the first optimistic signs I have seen in this country for a very long time, although one has an instinctive reservation. We await the details when the Government make a proper announcement to Parliament so that we can see what that one is all about.
</p>

<a name="60327-04_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>That announcement was, in effect, counter-balanced by research carried out by the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, working with a colleague at the University of Arizona, which was announced at the end of the week and reported in <i>The Times</i> on Friday. It is remarkable that the Americans, who are supposed to be a very negative force on the subject of global warming, host a great deal of extremely helpful and useful research into the matter. This research was predicated on the possibility that existing models that take account of the effect of global warming on the melting of Arctic and Antarctic ice are inadequate and that sea levels may rise at a rate vastly greater than anything suggested at present. Of course, this is yet more research in a very wide field, and its findings may not be realised. If it were to happen, however, the work of Natural England would be dramatically affected, because the research was postulating the possibility in the coming century of a sea rise of 20 feet rather than perhaps a foot or two.
</p>

<a name="60327-04_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>It is worth noting that a study was done by, I believe, the Environment Agency on the impact of a tidal surge on top of a major spring tide in 2030. It is one thing if that takes into account the expected sea rise of a foot or two, but it is entirely another if it has to take into account a sea rise of several feet. More importantly, a number of other policies will be dramatically affected if&#151;I stress the &quot;if&quot;&#151;that research is at all valid, because the whole management of our coastlines will be dramatically affected. If such a sea rise does not dramatically affect the way in which Natural England works in those areas, I am not standing here addressing this House this afternoon. But I am addressing the House this afternoon because the effect will be dramatic.
</p>

<a name="60327-04_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>When I tabled my amendment on Report, the Minister said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;As a key element of the broader sustainable development agenda, climate change would be an important part in the context in which Natural England operates. There is no doubt that relevant action to mitigate climate change could fall within Natural England&#039;s general purpose&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report,</i> 15/3/06; col. 1273.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_546"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 546</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60327-04_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>Instead of making the containment of global warming a specific function of Natural England, the amendment would make it part of its general functions. It would provide the context in which the functions mentioned in the Bill would have to be carried out. In my view, the amendment is consistent with the words of the Minister on Report. He will not be surprised therefore if I suggest that he could accept it. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="60327-04_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   My Lords, I have added my name to the noble Lord&#039;s amendment. For the reasons he has stated, climate change is important. Natural England will be in the forefront, together with the Environment Agency, of facing what that means. It will have to face adaptation and mitigation for land management and best advice on biodiversity and wildlife and the whole swathe of issues with which it will be subsequently tasked under the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60327-04_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>Therefore, reference to climate change is essential. I was disappointed on Report when the Minister indicated that he was not minded to include it in the Bill. When the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, put down his amendment, I held out some hope that, if the Government did not like the exact wording, they might choose to amend it in such a way as to make them happy with it. I believe that we will have to task particular agencies and bodies to think about climate change at the forefront of what they do. After all, it is the most important issue of our time. This Bill is the place to start that. We support the noble Lord&#039;s amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="60327-04_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   My Lords, I, too, support my noble friend&#039;s amendment. I was as disappointed as my noble friend when on Report the Minister referred to the key element of sustainable development. In fact, I would refer to the previous sentence of the Minister&#039;s speech. The Minister said that climate change has a,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;wide-ranging agenda and one in which, frankly, Natural England would not be the lead player&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 15/3/06; col. 1273.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-04_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>So who is the lead player? Many departments are covered. With Natural England established, clearly Defra should be not just a key player, but the leading player. If it is not, perhaps the noble Lord will tell us who is. What discussions or arrangements have been made with other government departments? We do not want climate change to be manhandled between one department and another when, clearly, Natural England, with its new responsibilities, will be at the forefront of this.
</p>

<a name="60327-04_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>I obviously support my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith. He referred to the management of coastline. Even now, Southwold, in East Anglia, which I know quite well, is spending millions of pounds on improving its coastal defence plan. That is the situation now. With estimates of additional hazards of climate change, surely the Government cannot take&#151;I wanted to say &quot;lackadaisical&quot;, but that is not quite <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_547"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 547</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the right word&#151;such a negative attitude to the very important crisis that is facing us and will continue to face us.
</p>




<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="60327-04_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Chorley: </b>   My Lords, for once I find myself not in agreement with the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, partly because I do not really understand his amendment, which reads,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;having regard to the need to contain global warming&quot;.,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-04_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>in the context of the &quot;General purpose&quot; of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60327-04_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>I will give the noble Lord an example. Last year, there was a major wind farm inquiry near Tebay, between the Yorkshire Dales National Park and the English Lake District National Park. The Countryside Agency put in evidence, extremely strongly and extremely effectively, that on landscape grounds there was no case for this wind farm. That was a good, renewable project. I am glad to say that the Minister accepted evidence from others, in particular the Countryside Agency, and the wind farm was rejected. There will be wind farms up and down the country where the landscape question will be extremely important. There will be other questions. A moment ago, the noble Baroness mentioned Southwold and just down the coast there is Sizewell. I am fully behind the noble Lord on global warming; it is the most serious issue the world has to face in the next hundred years; and I believe nuclear power will be one of the main ways of dealing with it. But the siting of nuclear power stations will be a problem and Natural England has to keep its hands free so that it can participate in the wider national debate. For that reason, much though I respect the philosophy of the noble Lord regarding global warming, I cannot support his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="60327-04_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Lord Bach): </b>  My Lords, the noble Lord&#039;s amendment would make it clear that in taking action to conserve, enhance or manage the natural environment, Natural England has regard to the need to contain global warming. I appreciate the noble Lord&#039;s desire to find a form of words on this important, even crucial, topic that we could accept. However, I have to disappoint him.
</p>

<a name="60327-04_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>As I said at Report, the Government expect Natural England, in common with all other public bodies, to play an active role in combating the effects of global warming, which is a huge issue for our time. Given the serious effects that global warming will have on the natural environment of England, I am absolutely confident that Natural England will have regard to this need, so far as it is able, in the exercise of its functions&#151;the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Chorley&#151;for conserving, enhancing and managing the natural environment. So why can we not accept the amendment?
</p>

<a name="60327-04_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>It comes back to the role of Clause 2(1), where this amendment is now&#151;for the first time, I believe&#151;laid, in defining Natural England&#039;s purpose. Clause 2(1) is the general purpose&#151;the core purpose&#151;of Natural <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_548"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 548</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

England. Far from being a preamble to paragraphs (a) to (e) of Clause (2)(2), it is the touchstone against which all Natural England&#039;s actions must be judged. The paragraphs are merely examples of things that are contained within the general purpose.
</p>

<a name="60327-04_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>Clause 2(1) also plays a crucial role in communicating Natural England&#039;s job to a wide range of its customers and other interested parties. It will certainly be the most quoted clause of the Bill. It will probably appear inside the front cover of every Natural England publication, in exhibitions, videos and university text books, among other places. I understand that that is precisely why the noble Lord wants to get a reference to global warming here. But there are a very large number of things which Natural England must or may have regard to. While the need to contain global warming would be high up anybody&#039;s list, we cannot accept that it should be the sole factor that is elevated to a position at the heart of Natural England&#039;s core purpose. If this amendment was carried, that would be the result.
</p>

<a name="60327-04_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>Our reservations are heightened by the wording used. &quot;Containing&quot; global warming is the key international challenge&#151;the Kyoto protocol territory. Natural England will be able to make a more than useful contribution through the way it runs its operations, its comments on development plans and so on&#151;the sort of decisions that the noble Lord, Lord Chorley, was talking about&#151;but it will not be a large player in international development and energy policy. Natural England&#039;s contribution will lie more in drawing attention to the impact of global warming on the natural environment and facilitating its adaptation.
</p>

<a name="60327-04_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>I was asked who the lead player is. Defra agencies, such as the Environment Agency and Natural England, of course have an important role. Because this topic is so wide-ranging, however, a government department leads. That department is, of course, Defra.
</p>

<a name="60327-04_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>I hope that my brief remarks about the Government&#039;s expectations of Natural England&#151;in having regard to the need to contain global warming&#151;offer some reassurance to the noble Lord. He will be, as all of us will, a key monitor of Natural England&#039;s performance in this area. I am sure he will take us to task if he feels it falls short of its potential. On that basis I invite the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.

<a name="60327-05_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend and to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, for their support. If the noble Lord, Lord Chorley, will forgive me for putting it this way, he could perfectly well support me. There is absolutely no problem in my mind for Natural England to have to make a judgment on the siting of a wind farm in an area of outstanding natural beauty and on the risk of global warming. It is a perfectly proper judgment to make. If Natural England does not feel that it is up to the task, and if the Minister were to deny that it was up to that task, then frankly we have all failed. So I hear what the noble Lord, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_549"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 549</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Lord Chorley, says, but, with the greatest deference, it would be perfectly reasonable for that sort of judgment to be made. Somebody will have to make it. If Natural England is properly to care for the countryside, in its widest context, then it seems to me that it is a proper judgment that it has to make.
</p>

<a name="60327-05_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>The Minister made all sorts of statements about the importance of this subject in the work of Natural England. Of course, I entirely accept that Natural England will not be an international player in this matter, but it will be a serious player in all countryside affairs. There will not be one bit of the countryside in the whole of our United Kingdom that will not be affected in some way&#151;maybe sometimes beneficially, but in other cases adversely&#151;by this subject. The Minister has said so. Curiously enough, I understand his reluctance to see this subject mentioned in this clause, but I do not accept his judgment. I think his judgment is wrong. The amendment should be in. The subject is significantly important that we ought to put it there. Therefore we should test the opinion of the House.

&quot;(   )   The purpose in subsection (2)(e) may, in particular, be carried out by working with local communities.&quot;

<p><a name="st_68"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment is our response to the debate on Report on an amendment which would have made rural communities a focus of Natural England&#039;s efforts to promote social and economic well-being through the management of the natural environment. We made it clear on Report that we could not accept sole reference to rural communities because Natural England has an important role in bringing the benefits of a healthy, well managed and accessible natural environment to urban communities as well. However, we agreed to look into it and, if we could find acceptable wording, bring back a government amendment at Third Reading. This is it and I am grateful to the noble Baroness for having raised this issue on previous occasions. The amendment makes it clear that Natural England may work with local communities&#151;both urban and rural&#151;to secure social and economic benefits through management of the natural environment. I beg to move.

<a name="60327-05_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister. We have had quite a few discussions on this issue both within and outside the Chamber and I am glad that the Minister and the Government have managed to find a form of words. While obviously the amendment does not refer specifically to rural areas, we appreciate that the Bill also covers urban areas. We welcome the amendment.

&quot;(   )   In the event of any significant, irreconcilable conflict in the delivery of Natural England&#039;s objectives, greater weight shall be given to those relating to the conservation of the natural environment.&quot;

<p><a name="st_71"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, here we return to the issue of conflict, which has been very fully debated at various stages of the Bill. However, it still needs to be considered further, which is why I have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_552"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 552</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

tabled an amendment. On Report, there was some confusion about the Government&#039;s position in response to the amendment that we had tabled. As a result, I reserved the right to take further advice and, if necessary, to return to the subject at Third Reading. As more and more rules, regulations, codes and strictures wind around our lives, it becomes ever more likely that irreconcilable positions will be assumed for the best of motives and in response to genuine interpretations of the law.
</p>

<a name="60327-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>We talk of Natural England as though it were a single entity such as a sculpture, but in fact it will be a body comprised of people each of whom will have a slightly different slant on any matter under discussion. They will be paid remuneration and allowances as the Secretary of State may determine, but they will not be employees. They will not be appointed because of their willingness to toe a line&#151;at least I sincerely hope not. It is to be hoped that they will take a very independent stance. I believe that they will be people of independent mind with knowledge and expertise for the positions that they hold, but they will bring to those positions very different experiences and opinions. The purposes assigned to them will be the mainspring of their collective actions.
</p>

<a name="60327-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>The Secretary of State will issue directions or guidance that will tend to be fairly non-specific and couched in terms such as &quot;the board may&quot;, if it is guidance, or &quot;the board must have regard to&quot;, if they are directions. In those circumstances, a conflict resolution provision would give a firmer steer to Natural England. The issue could be viewed in the light, for example, of conserving and enhancing the natural landscape, or securing the provision of facilities for enjoyment of the natural environment. I have deliberately left out the words &quot;study&quot; and &quot;understanding&quot; because Clause 2(2)(c) does not make it clear whether all three requirements&#151;&quot;study, understanding and enjoyment&quot;&#151;have to be present at the same time. But that is a minor issue and presumably the Secretary of State will sort it out in her directions.
</p>

<a name="60327-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>I know that I am not alone in being concerned about the danger of conflict arising from these proposals. The EFRA Select Committee, speakers from all parties in another place and several noble Lords in Committee have all spoken in favour of some form of conflict resolution mechanism. None of us has sought to suggest that the process of decision making would be at fault, hence there would be no recourse to judicial review for anyone wishing to challenge a Natural England decision; nor has it been suggested that there should be an automatic prioritisation of the natural environment at all times.
</p>

<a name="60327-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> defines ideas that are &quot;irreconcilable&quot; as,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&quot;unable to be brought into harmony or made consistent&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>We consider that neither the Countryside Commission nor the Nature Conservancy Council was given a brief which allowed for such opinion. English Nature and the Countryside Agency were not troubled by internal inconsistencies; they made recommendations which <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_553"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 553</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

were either agreed to or ignored. To be a trenchant champion of the natural environment with a duty to contribute to social and economic well-being may nevertheless leave Natural England in a cleft stick, but our amendment would ensure that it could not happen.
</p>

<a name="60327-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>I emphasise that we do not anticipate this provision being used very much. We are concerned, however, as &quot;Farming Today&quot; stated this morning, that in instances of major conflict between government departments the argument should be brought clearly into the open. We support that: Natural England should not be called on to arbitrate in such circumstances. The Government should not be able to devolve their own responsibilities to it. We believe that, to be a champion of the natural environment, Natural England must be seen to be so. The most damaging event for its reputation will be an occasion where the board is unreconciled, the press is in hot pursuit, the Government are disclaiming responsibility and the various lobby groups are given tongue.
</p>

<a name="60327-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>I am sure that none of us wishes to see this solution being used at all, but I refer noble Lords to our debate on Report, when the Minister said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;it would not be appropriate to cover conflict resolution in the statutory guidance&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 15/3/06; col. 1275.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>If your Lordships remember, the Government did a U-turn; we were told one thing on Monday and something else on Thursday with no satisfactory explanation. I hope that the Minister will give us at least some form of explanation, because if it was not possible to do it through guidance then, I wonder what has changed or whether the thinking has changed. I seek clarity from the Minister. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_72"></a>
<a name="60327-06_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Chorley: </b>   My Lords, I have been a rather wobbly supporter of the Sandford principle in the Bill&#039;s context, mainly because the issue is more complex than it is in the case of national parks, where I am firmly behind Sandford. In Committee, the principle was going to apply only to Natural England&#039;s first purpose, in the sense that it had precedence over the second purpose. That was a little odd, as at times it would be difficult to apply in such a situation. Under the noble Baroness&#039;s amendment, it would apply to both purposes; at least, that is my reading of it.
</p>

<a name="60327-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>On Report, the noble Baroness referred to a letter in which the countryside Minister, Mr Jim Knight, had made a proposal. I received a copy of the letter, as did others, and I thought the proposal a sensible solution and a better way of dealing with the matter, because it took a more flexible approach. It turned out to be a red herring, because the Minister withdrew it, as we have just heard. I do not know what the problem was, but it was a pity that that happened. I would prefer to go back to that proposal. However, here we are back to square one, although not quite, because the amendment that we have before us is different from the one in Committee in a significant respect: it is wider.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_554"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 554</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60327-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>The amendment has three key features. First, it applies to the first two purposes as against the remaining three, to which I indirectly referred. It therefore deals with my original worry on how in practice we can deal with differences between purpose 1 and purpose 2&#151;or (a) and (b), as it is in the Bill&#151;or whether we would want to or even should. Secondly, the issue has to be significant; that is important. Thirdly, the conflict has to be irreconcilable; whatever is proposed must be incompatible with one of the last three purposes, as I have said before. That is a demanding test. The occasions when such a conflict occurs will be rare or at least fairly infrequent.
</p>

<a name="60327-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a> The most likely cause will, I guess, be cases of unlimited access across an important SSSI, where irredeemable damage would be done. In most such cases, the issue would be resolved by limiting access&#151;for example, by time of year, time of day or locationally. In other words, most such issues can be resolved by limiting access rather than by instituting a complete ban. The other area of conflict might have to do with economic development masquerading under the banner of the fifth purpose.
</p>

<a name="60327-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>I am left with one niggling worry: will it open the flank to the threat of judicial review? I am prepared to put up with that risk, so on balance I will go for the amendment if the noble Baroness divides the House. The guidance of Sandford is useful. Unlike the Minister, I do not think that it will unduly cramp the style of the new board.
<a name="time_7"></a>

</p>




<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="60327-06_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Young of Old Scone: </b>   My Lords, noble Lords have already recognised the muddle that we seemed to get into at a previous stage of the Bill with the guidance that existed and then did not exist&#151;it came and went. The matter was perhaps inadequately debated at the previous stage and therefore I shall speak for slightly longer than is appropriate at this stage of the proceedings.
</p>

<a name="60327-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>In supporting the amendment, I want to hark back to what some noble Lords may regard as ancient history, but which I think is a valid comparison&#151;the position that English Nature found itself in on its establishment in the early 1990s. Noble Lords who recall the axing apart of the Nature Conservancy Council, which had covered the four countries of the UK until then, may recall that that act purported to be about devolution but was actually an act of neat revenge on the NCC, which had been a fairly trenchant champion of nature conservation until then. Indeed, it had &quot;got in the way&quot; of economic development on occasion and was reviled by some sectors of politics at that point. As a result, it suffered the penalty of being divided into four bits.
</p>

<a name="60327-06_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>The NCC was also penalised in a different way, in that it was given a strong political signal at that time that that was the sort of thing which happened to bodies that stood up for nature conservation&#151;they got hacked into pieces and told to sit in a hole and not be particularly championing in their approach. Indeed, for the first five or six years of its existence, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_555"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 555</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

English Nature did behave like that. It was frightened of its own shadow and it was not particularly robust in supporting nature conservation. Its staff were, at best, confused about their role and, at worst, demoralised. They were not explicitly told that if they put their head out of the hole it would be shot off, but that was certainly how they perceived the lie of the land. Basically, we had a nature conservation body which, due to an implicit political signal, would not even say &quot;Boo&quot; to a goose, far less to anybody who wanted to damage nature conservation interests. I am not saying that that will be the position as regards Natural England on its establishment, but those events show the power of gentle political signals in one direction or another. They were very much the result of an implicit rather than an explicit signal from the government of the time.
</p>

<a name="60327-06_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>Successive leaderships of English Nature have changed that. They have made it clear that standing up for nature conservation is an okay thing to do. Indeed, we have seen some excellent work on the promotion of sustainable development through the conservation of nature done by English Nature since then. I believe that we run a double risk in not seeing either guidance to Natural England, or something in the Bill if guidance is not forthcoming. Without the right signal from government on the predominance of nature conservation, we run the risk that in some of the very rare, but nevertheless real, moments when there is considerable pressure from socio-economic development interests, harm will be done to nature conservation or the landscape. That is a problem. The double whammy is that, having argued consistently all the way through the Bill that such a signal should not be given, the Government almost send the implicit signal that impacted on English Nature at its birth&#151;that balance at all times is the order of the day and that, even in the rare circumstances where there is significant and irreconcilable conflict, that balance should be maintained. The risk is that during the passage of the Bill we are giving the wrong signal to Natural England at its birth.
</p>

<a name="60327-06_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>On Report, the Minister talked about the risks of guidance. I declare an interest as chief executive of the Environment Agency. The Environment Agency is subject to 57 pages of guidance, which is renewed and reviewed every five years. At the agency&#039;s inception, the guidance contained some provisions that I was pretty sure we would be judicially reviewed on. I hesitated long and hard before I raised this issue on the Floor of the House today, because you can bet your bottom dollar that someone out there will read <i>Hansard</i> and come to the conclusion that we should be judicially reviewed on our sustainable development principle, but nevertheless we have not yet in our 10 years&#151;it is our birthday this year&#151;been so reviewed. To worry about guidance leaving an organisation wide open to frequent judicial review is probably not necessary.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_556"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 556</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60327-06_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>I am conscious that it is unlikely that the Minister will have a change of heart at this stage in the proceedings. A gentle signal given through guidance to the new body that biodiversity and landscape must, when push comes to shove and significant and irreconcilable conflict takes place between the purposes, take precedence is not a huge thing to ask for and does not expose the new organisation to risk. I hope that the Minister might delight us all by saying that he has changed his mind.

<p><a name="st_74"></a>
<a name="60327-07_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Cameron of Dillington: </b>   My Lords, I spoke against this clause on Report, having been an agnostic in Committee. The whole point of Clause 2 is that it creates an equilibrium whereby Natural England must decide by itself where the right balance lies. Sustainable development is key here. I do not believe that Natural England will be cowed, as the noble Baroness, Lady Young, said about English Nature in its early days, by the economic case. I very firmly do not believe that Parliament should be taking decisions for Natural England in advance of hypothetical cases yet to come up before its board. That is all wrong. To quote my noble friend Lord Chorley, as he stated on the previous amendment, Natural England should be allowed to keep its hands free.
</p>




<p><a name="st_75"></a>
<a name="60327-07_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Greenway: </b>   My Lords, I have consistently opposed the inclusion of the Sandford principle in the general purposes of the Bill. At Second Reading the Minister said that the Government had considered this clause very carefully and they thought that they had come up with the right balance. I agree on that; we have the right balance. The Sandford principle, commendable though it is in relation to national parks, is not appropriate to this Bill, because Natural England will have a remit far wider than that of national parks, including urban areas. It is correct that the recreational and socio-economic interests should be balanced with conservation interests. It is not beyond the wit of the board of Natural England to come up with solutions when it comes up against conflict.
</p>




<p><a name="st_76"></a>
<a name="60327-07_spmin0"></a><b>The Earl of Erroll:</b>  My Lords, I support my noble friend Lord Greenway. I am cynical enough to believe that someone could dig their toes in enough to make something irreconcilable and therefore always push it into an environmental decision. I have seen that sort of behaviour before elsewhere. It would be very dangerous to accept the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_77"></a>
<a name="60327-07_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   My Lords, on Report I said that we on these Benches were of the opinion that it was impossible to legislate for every single sort of case that Natural England would have to look at. When noble Lords are considering the amendment, it is important to remember that the board will be looking at dozens of cases that will be reconcilable. They will sometimes be extremely <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_557"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 557</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

difficult to balance and yet they will be able to come to some form of opinion on them. It is not that the board will not have enough experience. In moving the amendment the noble Baroness said that it will be a body of people with different slants&#151;independent people with knowledge and expertise. We will have to trust the board to be able to make judgments. It is possible that once every decade or so it will get that judgment wrong. We will probably be sad about that. However, it will get its judgments right most of the time. In the rare instance that it gets the judgment wrong, this clause would not necessarily get it right either, for all the reasons that other noble Lords have given.
</p>

<a name="60327-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>The Bill has also strengthened&#151;for example, in Clause 40, with the duty to conserve biodiversity&#151;the position of wildlife, which is quite different from what it was at the time the noble Baroness, Lady Young, referred to. That was back in the days when you had only Swampy to defend the great crested newts against the roads. Time has moved on, which is part of the point of the CROW Act and, I hope, will be part of the point of this Act. I hope that it is one reason why we do not need this amendment&#151;I believe that it is.
</p>




<p><a name="st_78"></a>
<a name="60327-07_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, we return to conflict resolution. Whatever view we take of this, I am grateful that we have had debates on four occasions, including Second Reading, on this important topic. I am grateful, too, for the spirit in which those debates have been conducted. It will not surprise noble Lords to know that the Government remain opposed to including a clause of this type in the Bill.

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>Natural England&#039;s purpose, and the powers it has to research, experiment, advise and fund, have been drafted to be broad and enabling and, in particular, to give it the flexibility and, above all, the independence to be an effective and, indeed, trenchant&#151;a word heard often in this House&#151;champion of the natural environment, taking action on a wide front. However, Natural England will, of course, make its decisions in the context of sustainable development. It will contribute to sustainable development by proactively seeking solutions which, while achieving environmental benefits, also provide long-term economic and social benefits, and avoid untoward economic and social impacts.
</p>

<a name="60327-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>With that remit at the forefront of our minds, I invite noble Lords to imagine that they are board members of Natural England. What sort of issues will come up for discussion and decision? I offer a few examples: first, deciding whether to fund a new initiative to improve the quality and accessibility of urban open space; secondly, advising government on their climate change action plan; thirdly, deciding how to target agri-environment funds to get the best value for money; fourthly, advising government on the management of a wild species whose population is out of control; and lastly, deciding whether or not to enter a statutory objection to a road scheme.

<a name="60327-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>Noble Lords will remember the lively debate on Report about the pros and cons of tourist development in the Cairngorms. It is of course unlikely that Natural England will comment on a development in Scotland, but it is not a bad example of the type of complex issue which will come before the board.
</p>

<a name="60327-07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>Would the clause help members of the board to decide Natural England&#039;s position on the breadth of issues I have just listed? In each case, they would need to consider which of their objectives were in conflict. For example, is there a conflict between both social and economic well-being and environmental conservation, or just one of these? Perhaps there is a conflict between the study of the natural environment and conservation, or between the enhancement of the natural environment and its conservation. How might they resolve a conflict between the conservation of landscape and the protection of biodiversity, both of which are aspects of the natural environment? Having identified their conflicts, they must consider whether each one is &quot;significant&quot; and &quot;irreconcilable&quot;. Thus, having reached a short list, they must decide exactly how to give &quot;greater weight&quot; to conservation and ensure that their decision is fully documented to show that it has taken into account all relevant considerations to resist challenge&#151;possibly through judicial review. The effect of imposing such a statutory duty within Natural England&#039;s general purpose, far from being helpful to their deliberations as board members, would, in practice, be closer to a nightmare. The board would certainly need extremely good and attentive expert and legal advice to help to decide when a matter falls within the category of significant, irreconcilable conflict&quot;.

</p>

<a name="60327-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>It is not just the board of Natural England that must jump through those hoops. Every officer making a grant, issuing a licence or offering advice is likely to come under pressure from either the public or the affected customer to decide whether the situation at hand does or does not come within the parameters of this duty. That is likely to result in very detailed reasoning having to be recorded for all decisions that are made, which could add significantly to the workload of the new body.
</p>

<a name="60327-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>Perhaps we should ask why no other equivalent body has a conflict resolution clause&#151;not English Nature; not the Countryside Agency; not the Countryside Council for Wales; not Scottish Natural Heritage; not even the Environment Agency itself. None has such a duty. It may not be a surprise but the technical briefing to your Lordships of those bodies that will make up Natural England states that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&quot;the Bill aims to set up <i>Natural England</i> with a clear purpose but an integrated and measured overview of the natural environment. An independent NDPB should have the freedom to engage in debate with all parties and decide how it achieves its purpose, within a sustainable development context. The agency aims to be a robust champion for the natural environment and to exercise its judgement accordingly&#151;it should not be told how to resolve any particular conflict&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>That is the Government&#039;s view, too.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_559"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 559</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60327-07_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>The case against a conflict resolution clause seems to be powerful. However, even if we are proved wrong, there remains the option of statutory guidance. As your Lordships know, and I make it abundantly clear again, we do not think that there is a case at the outset to issue guidance on the subject to Natural England. If, in time, it becomes clear, which we do not expect, that Natural England&#039;s decisions, or perhaps one subset of decisions, would benefit from such statutory guidance on how to resolve conflicts, we have the option of issuing such guidance, following consultation, as set out in Clause 15(3) of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60327-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>We believe that Clause 2, when read together with the Explanatory Notes, will provide the right framework for the board of Natural England to decide how to address the diverse range of complex issues that fall within its remit. It will be one of the Government&#039;s key advisers on managing the natural environment. Our argument is that it would not be right to constrain the judgment of the board in the Bill in the way proposed in the amendment, or to expose it to the threat&#151;however unlikely&#151;of judicial review on this ground for every difficult decision that it and its officers take. It is for those reasons that I invite the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.

<p><a name="st_79"></a>
<a name="60327-08_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who have spoken, and I also thank those who do not agree with me. The joy of this House is that we have to make judgments at times. Obviously there are times when we disagree, and this is a very important clause.
</p>

<a name="60327-08_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>I understand where the noble Lords, Lord Chorley, Lord Cameron and Lord Greenway, the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, and the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, are coming from. I do not agree with their position but I respect their views. I think that some form of inclusion in the Bill, such as we are suggesting, would be of benefit.
</p>

<a name="60327-08_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, for her honest reflection of what happened when English Nature came into being. Although it was some years ago, and I accept that the noble Baroness said that times have moved on, it is clear that there may be times when the sort of amendment that we are proposing today would benefit the new board when it is set up.
</p>

<a name="60327-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>It is a difficult issue. In my opening remarks I asked the Minister about how the Government would come back with guidance if it were necessary. They considered the issue originally on that Monday, and then changed their minds three days later and decided that guidance was not relevant or that they could not do it. How, even if it were in a delayed period of time&#151;I should like the Minister to clarify that for me&#151;would the Government be able to come forward with some form of guidance?
</p>

<a name="60327-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>If it is not possible now, I do not understand how it could be possible in the future. Whatever reasons the Government had thought about at the time must be as <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_560"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 560</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

relevant in the future. In his response to the amendment, the Minister said that if at some time in the future it were considered necessary, it would be possible to give statutory guidance, but he gave no indication how soon that might be or how it might be achieved. Only a week ago, we were told that it was not possible.
</p>

<a name="60327-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>This is Third Reading, so I am in the very difficult position of having to put the amendment to a vote, as the Minister is unable to give me answers to the legitimate questions that I have raised. In the normal course of events, I would have thanked the Minister for his guidance and accepted the fact that it could be reviewed. However, he is unable to tell me how he would achieve that or what the time limit would be. It is not being reviewed in a three-year or a five-year period. We have been given no indication whatever on that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_80"></a>
<a name="60327-08_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   My Lords, I am put in a very difficult position. Questions should be put to the Minister while he is on its feet and before he sits down. With the leave of the House, if I correctly sense the good will of the House, the Minister could reply. Questions at Third Reading must be put to the Minister while he or she is speaking.
</p>




<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="60327-08_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   My Lords, I am very grateful. I was a little too slow to do that. I apologise.
</p>




<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="60327-08_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, I shall do my best. If I repeat myself, I apologise. At the moment, we are strongly against a clause to the effect of that put forward by the noble Baroness. We do not believe it is necessary; we think we should leave the matter to the independent judgment of Natural England. As I said, if, in the course of time, it becomes clear that the decisions of Natural England, or perhaps one subset of decisions, would benefit from statutory guidance on how to resolve the conflicts, we have the option, at any time, of adding to guidance that is already in place&#151;of course, if Parliament were to agree&#151;and issuing such guidance, following consultation. Our power to do that is set out in Clause 15(3). I make it clear that we do not feel there is any need for guidance at this stage. We think the matter should be left to the independent judgment of this important new body. But if we are wrong about that and if, in the future, that view is taken, we can issue statutory guidance.
</p>




<p><a name="st_83"></a>
<a name="60327-08_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister and I thank the House for allowing the Minister to respond. However, he has not answered any of the questions that I asked him. The first was on how to achieve statutory guidance. Earlier we had been told what the situation was in a letter that we received from Alun Michael on the Monday, but by Thursday we were told that it was not possible to have guidance. Secondly, the Minister has given no indication that that may be reviewed at some time in the future. I do not want to get on the wrong side of things, but I am forced to test the opinion of the House.

<a name="60327-09_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bach </b>   moved Amendment No. 5:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>Page 7, line 29, leave out from &quot;which&quot; to &quot;and&quot; in line 30 and insert &quot;relevant persons&#039; policies are developed, adopted and implemented (by rural proofing or otherwise)&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Amendment No. 5 revisits the role of the Commission for Rural Communities with respect to rural-proofing. The noble Lord, Lord Cameron, spoke very convincingly to an amendment on this subject at Report. I responded that I was minded to accept the principles of his amendment, but that he and I should agree a slightly different form of words for the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60327-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>The noble Lord and I had what I think we would both describe as a very interesting and, I hope, very positive discussion on this issue, and the form of words set out in the amendment is one with which we are, I hope, both content.
</p>

<a name="60327-09_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>Amendment No. 5 makes a revision to Clause 19(c) that further clarifies the role of the Commission for Rural Communities with respect to rural proofing. It will widen the CRC&#039;s monitoring role to include looking at how bodies develop policy as well as implement it. That will enable it to make better judgments about how the rural-proofing process is undertaken by organisations&#151;for example councils or RDAs&#151;as they develop their strategies. It will also enable the CRC to provide government departments and other bodies with an impartial, expert view not only of the way in which their policies are meeting rural needs, but of whether their processes of policy development are taking proper account of the rural angle.

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>Clarifying the role of the CRC in the way set out by this amendment will help both Defra and the CRC to work together to help to ensure that polices which affect rural areas are adequately rural-proofed and that the needs of people and business in rural areas are properly considered by policy makers.

I would like to think that our debate rural-proofed&#151;if that is the right word&#151;the Government&#039;s housing policy in the shared ownership sector. As we know, the Government have decided not to change the policy as they had intended, for which we are extremely grateful. The words are just right if you read them in the context of a practical example of the sort that I have just given of rural housing. That would certainly fit into this and all the other areas. This is good wording, and I shall certainly accept it.

Lady Byford, on Report. It strengthens new subsection (2)(a) of Clause 67, which will exempt from extinguishment any route where it can be shown that, for five years before commencement, public use had been mainly by motor vehicles. It does that by ensuring that, in determining the balance of use prior to commencement, only lawful use by mechanically propelled vehicles is taken into account.
</p>

<a name="60327-09_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>On Report, I undertook to consider four other amendments. We have looked at them carefully, but have concluded that we cannot table amendments such as these. I will briefly explain why. Amendments Nos. 146 and 150 sought to amend what is now Clause 67(5) and new subsection (7B) of the Highways Act 1980&#151;inserted by Clause 69(1)&#151;so that, to be made &quot;correctly&quot;, applications for definitive map modification orders must comply with paragraphs 1 and 2 of Schedule 14 to the 1981 Act.
</p>

<a name="60327-09_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>On a practical level, that sort of amendment would open up uncertainty because it could easily be a matter of dispute whether paragraph 2 had been complied with. More significantly, it would not work because paragraph 2 is not about making an application; it is about whether an application has been made. Nevertheless, as these two provisions stand, for an application to be valid it has to be submitted in the prescribed form with the correct supporting documentary evidence.
</p>

<a name="60327-09_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>We are grateful to the noble Baroness for her assistance in tabling Amendments Nos. 154ZA and 154ZB on Report, but having now had an opportunity to consider those amendments further, we have concluded that the exemption works properly without the amendments. We are satisfied that the government amendment which is now incorporated into Clause 70 closed any potential loophole and that no further amendments to this clause are necessary.
</p>

<a name="60327-09_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>I understand that there are residual concerns about whether it will be possible for people to argue that they are lawful visitors to a RUPP. Under new subsection (2A) of the Road Traffic Act 1988, introduced by Clause 70, the exemption covers only those who have an interest in the land, or, after commencement, are visitors to any land. People using former RUPPs for recreational purposes will not be lawful visitors to land after commencement. RUPPs will be reclassified as restricted byways immediately before commencement, and restricted byways do not carry rights for mechanically propelled vehicles. I beg to move.

In thanking the Minister for taking on the thoughts behind the amendment, I have a question for him&#151;I think it is a simple one, so I hope he will be able to answer it now. If the land in question were to be sold, how would the seller confirm that a right of way for vehicles was already there and if the lawful use in the five years prior to commencement was not by the public but by a person with an interest in the land, would this clause still apply?

<a name="column_568"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 568</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

We had lengthy and useful discussions in Committee and on Report on this aspect of the Bill and there is a great deal of interest in it inside and outside this House. I set out at length&#151;maybe at too much length on one occasion&#151;the sound reasons why we could not accept the earlier amendments setting a cut-off date of 9 December 2003. Having said that, and without wanting to repeat those arguments, the Government recognise the cross-party strength of feeling on this issue. A huge amount of correspondence about this has been received not only by Members of Parliament but also by Members of this House. That correspondence has been reflected in the strength of feeling expressed here and in the other place. In recognition of that strength of feeling that the Government are prepared&#151;reluctantly&#151;to accept a cut-off date of 20 January 2003, which, as my noble friend said, represents the end of the consultation period. We feel that this date could be justified. I am sorry, I am wrong&#151;

<a name="60327-10_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   My Lords, I speak to my amendment, which is linked to these two amendments. I believe we are finally coming to the end of the road&#151;although that is perhaps a bad pun&#151;on this highly contentious issue. My original amendment would have set the exemption date back to 9 December 2003. I will not have a go at the Minister for that slight slip a minute ago. All noble Lords are aware of the substance of that debate and the motives behind it. We on these Benches are still of the opinion that our original date of December 2003 is the preferable option. The issue of figures has been quite confusing. Across the board, the number is widely agreed to be very high. Taking into account multiple applications, I have estimated that    there have been 1,000 applications since December 2003.
</p>

<a name="60327-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>The issue, however, is not necessarily the number of applications affected. We all heard on Report&#151;because I spoke on it&#151;about the story of Dr Karen Hinckley and the damage done to the green lanes of her parish by motorised vehicles. There are now no protected green lanes left in her parish. There have been applications to convert every green lane in the <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="60327-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>That is the state of affairs in many parts of the country. Our belief is that the more applications that fall under the cut-off provision, the better it is for conservation and for those who use green lanes in the countryside. Many people whose hobby is horse riding have told me that where they may have used those lanes in the past, they now cannot. The lanes are so damaged that they fear they will damage and break the legs of their horses.
</p>

<a name="60327-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>We are grateful to the Minister, however, for adding his name to the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Carter, which would take the date back from 19 May 2005, to January 2005. The GLPG has estimated that that will save another 500 pending applications&#151;that is, of applications that we know about. The other 500 or so applications made between December 2003 and January 2005 will still stand and will have to be processed.
</p>

<a name="60327-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>We recognise, however, that this is a very positive move from the Government. In spite of the amendment that we had tabled prior to hearing of this concession, we on these Benches support it.

I believe that the police have the powers to deal with anyone who uses a right of way for which a claim has been made but which is not recorded on the definitive map, and any feebleness by the police to prosecute those is something on which we should press very hard. There is no doubt at all that the use of many of the rights of way&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, said&#151;is quite contrary to the use of the rights of way for horse-riders, walkers and those who wish&#151;and this is what most people want&#151;to enjoy the peace and quiet of the countryside.

I apologise to the House that I was not here to speak on Report. It all seemed to me absurd that the precedent of the passage of a horse and cart should be used to allow motorised traffic to tear up our green lanes. I still cannot understand why we cannot apply the principles involved now. It seems to me to be rather like the Chancellor of the Exchequer introducing capital gains tax and saying that it will not apply to anyone who has notified that they are going to transfer an asset; in other words, it was not going to bite for several years.
</p>

<a name="60327-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>Perhaps I may give a local example of the effect of the legislation. In my home county of Somerset, since December 2003 we have gone from an applications backlog of 24 to over 200 in respect of byways open to all traffic. The new cut-off date&#151;and I realise that a deal has been done&#151;of 20 January 2005 means that there will still be a backlog of nearly 100 claims. In other words, the speed of progress is about 16 or 17 claims a year, because of the judicial processes and such, and the new rules will not apply for five or six years in Somerset. I do not think that that is right. So I still believe that 9 December would have been the best cut-off date. That way we could have ensured we had the maximum number of paths, where the pleasures of walking on them remained as they are. So I am rather disappointed and would have preferred the original amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford.

Although the Minister is coming well out of today&#039;s debate, he is coming well out of a bad situation and one that would have been improved&#151;it is not his fault, as he was not the Minister at the time&#151;if the Government had acted earlier. If they had done, we would not have as much of a backlog as we have. Secondly, the Minister will recall that I asked him on Report whether it was true that there had been a heavy concentration on Cheshire and Wiltshire. He was unable to answer on that occasion and I quite understand why, but I wonder whether he has the information now.

<a name="60327-11_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful for what the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, and the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, have said. Of course, this compromise does not suit everybody. There will be those who are not entirely satisfied with it; very few people will be entirely satisfied with it. I appreciate the point that the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, made, but it is our view that this is a sensible and suitable compromise and that the Government have listened to the representations that have been made so powerfully&#151;in this House, in the other place and in postbags. Of course the postbags have gone both ways, but in particular in one way.
</p>

<a name="60327-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>I turn immediately to the last point made by the noble Lord, Lord Brooke. The number of claims in Wiltshire is certainly high&#151;there are 85 outstanding BOAT claims. This does not make it the worst, but the figure is high. That does not seem to be the experience in Cheshire, although I do not have the figures for that county.
</p>

<a name="60327-11_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>I shall deal now with the detailed questions, including one that was raised in our last debate and the query put by the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw. This may take me a little time but I will be as quick as I can. The exemption from prosecution under new Section 34(2A) of the Road Traffic Act 1988, inserted by Clause 70 of the Bill, moves to the purchaser of the property, provided that the way was in use at the time that the RUPP became a restricted byway. The &quot;private right&quot; in Clause 67(4) is also attached to the land.
</p>

<a name="60327-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, asked whether, if a person has submitted a claim that is still outstanding and would be preserved by Clause 67(3), that person can continue to use that right of way with a motor vehicle until that claim has been determined and whether the police would be able to prosecute that person. Whether it would be illegal to drive on that right of way would ultimately depend on whether the claim is justified&#151;in other words, where the public motor vehicular rights can be proved to exist. Schedule 7 to the CROW Act strengthens Section 34 of the Road Traffic Act, so that a right of way is taken to carry only those rights that are shown on the definitive map and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_572"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 572</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

statement unless the contrary can be proved. In other words, the burden of proof has now been placed squarely on a defendant to prove that public motor vehicular rights exist in order to avoid conviction. So, for example, where a right of way on the definitive map is a presumption, that is correct until proved otherwise.
</p>

<a name="60327-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>It has become apparent to us that Schedule 7 to the CROW Act has been widely misunderstood and that many enforcement agencies and rights of way professionals do not appreciate that the strength in Section 34 is already in force and has been since shortly after the CROW Act received Royal Assent. It is for that reason that we have recently published the guidance entitled <i>Regulating the use of motor vehicles on public rights of way and off road: A guide for Local Authorities, Police and Community Safety Partnerships</i>. It provides information to encourage enforcement authorities to make better use of existing legislation.
</p>

<a name="60327-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>After commencement of Part 6 of this Bill, where claims are not preserved by Clause 67(3) or where there are no outstanding claims, which is of course the vast majority of cases, those who drive motor vehicles on rights of way that are not already recorded as byways open to all traffic will no longer be able to rely on unrecorded public motor vehicular rights as a defence because those rights will, subject to the exemption in Clause 67(3), have been extinguished by subsection (1). This is a complex area of law and we intend to issue guidance to the police, local authorities and others about the rights of way provisions in this Bill. It will include guidance to assist with enforcement of the law over rights of way which are the subject of outstanding applications for BOATs at the time this part becomes law. When a claim has been submitted but not determined, the prosecuting authorities of course have a discretion whether to prosecute in each case, and the existence of a pending application may be a factor relevant to the exercise of that discretion.
</p>

<a name="60327-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>I hope that I have answered all the points raised both in the last debate and today. If not, I shall write to all noble Lords concerned and make available copies of that reply. But so far as the dates are concerned, I am grateful for the attitude taken by noble Lords on the Front Benches and in other parts of the House.

<p><a name="st_117"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this is a minor matter but I seek clarification from the Minister. We debated the issue at length on Report. The amendment would ensure that safeguards are included in the legislation to prevent the making of traffic regulation orders over access to private land for those who make use of that land primarily for business purposes. If I reflect him correctly, on Report the Minister stated that he simply did not share my fears on this. I may be misrepresenting him, which I certainly do not wish to do, but at a subsequent meeting the possibility arose that regulations might be made to prevent restrictions of access where access was needed for longer than the eight-hour allowance provided under national park traffic regulation orders.

<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>I said at the previous stage that I was not satisfied with the Minister&#039;s response to a very real concern for the well-being of businesses in national parks and I would be grateful if he could enlighten me on the presence of those regulations, which I do not believe have yet been clarified sufficiently.

<p><a name="st_118"></a>
<a name="60327-12_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, as the noble Baroness said, Amendment No. 12 is similar to an amendment that she tabled on Report, which sought to place limitations on the new traffic regulation order-making powers given to national park authorities by Clause 72. The aim is to ensure that that these powers could not be used to unreasonably restrict access to land by persons with an interest in that land.
</p>

<a name="60327-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>I have explained that we have given the matter careful consideration, but we have not changed our view. I recognise that there is concern that the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_574"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 574</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

statutory purposes of national park authorities might at some point lead to those authorities paying less regard to the needs of landowners than local highway authorities would. I do not share that view. National park authorities have a duty when pursuing their statutory purposes to seek to foster the social and economic well-being of local communities. They are used to doing so across the range of their responsibilities, which&#151;after all&#151;include carrying out the functions of the local planning authority.
</p>

<a name="60327-12_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>In any case, local highway authorities, when making decisions about any matter that might affect a national park, are also required to have regard to the national park statutory purposes. Therefore, if we consider it correct to give the national park authorities powers to make traffic regulation orders, we should do so under the same terms as they are applied by local highway authorities, and the existing safeguards will apply. That is the approach that we usually adopt when entrusting powers to the national park authorities and so far it has proved well founded.
</p>

<a name="60327-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>I want to reassure the noble Baroness and the House that Clause 72 provides for the modification of the national park authorities&#039; TRO-making power, through regulations under subsection (3) of the new section of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. But I do not envisage that such regulations will be needed to protect access to land by those with an interest in that land. I hope that that is a slightly fuller explanation than was given last time, and I invite the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.

<p><a name="st_125"></a>
<a name="60327-13_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   My Lords, the debates on this Bill have been marked by consensus and common sense and by the positive, constructive and patient approach of the Minister and her team. I am also grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, for his very positive approach.
</p>

<a name="60327-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>The Bill leaves this House looking outwardly much as it did at the outset, but some important changes have been made. As the Minister knows, although we have broadly supported the retention of Clause 1, we do have certain doubts.
</p>

<a name="60327-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>The courts will have to build up case law relating to this new concept of &quot;desirable activity&quot; and we cannot be sure precisely where that will lead. There is also a danger that it may be applied unevenly.
</p>

<a name="60327-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>However, a half-full cup seems preferable to an empty one, and I am very grateful to the Minister for amending Clause 1 by explicitly extending its terms to include breaches of statutory duty. I am particularly grateful for her comments on the new Clause 2. It was designed to clarify the law, not to change it. The intention, which I share with the Minister, is to change perceptions, behaviours and outcomes. In the new Clause 2 we are reasserting in statute that to apologise, to say sorry, is something separate and wholly different&#151;legally as well as socially&#151;from an admission of liability. I am particularly pleased that the Minister conceded that point.
</p>

<a name="60327-13_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>There are three distinct provisions: an apology shall not of itself amount to an admission of negligence or breach of statutory duty; an offer of treatment shall not of itself amount to such an admission; and an offer of other redress shall not of itself amount to such an admission. If this clause is accepted in another place, as I hope it will be, the effect on people&#039;s behaviour could be dramatic. So we have done our bit to restore some civility to society. I sincerely hope that the new Clause 2 will give a great boost to rehabilitation. I know that the Minister shares that view.
</p>

<a name="60327-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>The principle of mending the person must lie right at the heart of the civil justice system. I look forward to hearing from the ministerial working group, which the Minister chairs, on a whole range of measures on rehabilitation to put it at the forefront of government policy. We must stop it being a Cinderella service and we must ensure that it is joined up. There is often a postcode lottery, and rehabilitation gets caught up in the crossfire between opposing lawyers. Over 80 per cent of injuries suffered in road traffic accidents are soft tissue injuries that would benefit from immediate, swift and targeted treatment. Sadly, there is all too infrequently the opportunity of delivering that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_577"></a>

treatment to victims. I hope now, with the Government&#039;s announcement today, that a clear signal is sent to everyone that rehabilitation is a good thing, no &quot;ifs&quot; and no &quot;buts&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60327-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>I make no further comment about Part 2 except that I hope that the Government&#039;s wish to see regulation in place by October will be fulfilled. We need a system of effective regulation and a regulator that possesses impartiality, independence and integrity. I know that the Minister shares that view. She is aware of my enthusiasm for the FSA model of regulation, and I know that she is still considering that aspect. In closing, I re-emphasise my hope&#151;not just my hope&#151;that this Bill is just part of a great interlocking jigsaw of measures that will kick the so-called compensation culture into touch for good. What an achievement that would be.
</p>




<p><a name="st_126"></a>
<a name="60327-13_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   My Lords, I add my thanks to those of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral. When this Bill came to your Lordships&#039; House, it certainly appeared to me and, I believe, to the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, that Part 2 contained a number of fairly serious defects. They were not defects of principle&#151;we have always supported the principle that claims management firms should be brought under regulation&#151;but defects of detail. That being so, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, and I put forward a number of what I believe were constructive amendments and we are both&#151;I am speaking for myself in saying that I am&#151;extremely grateful to the noble Baroness for having listened and for having brought about changes in the Bill. Part 2 has now been both changed and improved to an unusual degree, and it is now a very much better Bill than it was when it was brought forward. The objections raised by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee have also been met to a large extent.
</p>

<a name="60327-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>As for Part 1, I remain dubious as to whether Clause 1 will do more good than harm. It presents a real risk of causing serious problems. However, I am pleased that the Government have accepted Clause 2, and I hope that one consequence will be that insurance companies will drop their current practice of insisting that, in the case of road accidents, people who they insure should never apologise.
</p>

<a name="60327-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>Overall, I welcome the fact that this Bill will now go on to the other place. We do not expect to see it back again unless the Government come up, during the course of its proceedings elsewhere, with amendments that they feel it is necessary to include.

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 578</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

repeat a Statement made in another place by the Foreign Secretary, the right honourable Jack Straw. The Statement is as follows:


</p>

<a name="60327-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_3"></a>&quot;With permission, Mr Speaker, I should like to make a Statement about the European Council which took place in Brussels last Thursday and Friday. As the House is aware, my right honourable friend the Prime Minister normally makes the post-Council Statement to the House. I have been asked to convey his apologies. He is on an official visit to Australia and New Zealand.


</p>

<a name="60327-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_4"></a>&quot;The Hampton Court informal summit in October, during our presidency, set the framework for this spring Council in Brussels. The economic challenges for many, though not all, member states of the Union are severe. Despite significant progress since the Lisbon Agenda was launched, there are still around 20 million out of work. In some states, in contrast to the United Kingdom, unemployment is around 10 per cent, and almost one in five young people is without a job.


</p>

<a name="60327-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_5"></a>&quot;The British Government know that there is only one way to get Europe back to work and to deliver social justice in a global economy. We base this not on theory, but on solid evidence. As my right honourable friend the Chancellor pointed out in his Budget speech, in 1996 we had the lowest income per head of all G7 countries. Today, we are second only to the United States. We have grown more quickly, created more jobs and provided more social benefits than most other member states. We have done so by liberalising markets, by increasing our competitiveness and by investing in the future, including in our public services. The European response to globalisation must emphatically not be a return to old-fashioned protectionism by another name.


</p>

<a name="60327-13_para12"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_6"></a>&quot;Specific elements of the Hampton Court agenda were energy, research and development, and universities. First, energy: the case for a more liberal energy market is overwhelming. Gas and electricity prices in the period 1996 to 2004 here in the United Kingdom fell much faster than they had done in EU states which have kept their energy markets closed. So consumers in those countries will gain from a functioning internal market, and so will consumers in this country. We currently do not have access to the gas we would have in a more sensitised market. So one of the first achievements of the Lisbon Agenda back in 2003 was the decision to liberalise energy markets by 2007. Last week, the European Council reaffirmed that timetable.

<p><a name="qnpa_7"></a>&quot;Completion of the internal market is one of four elements in a new approach to European energy policy. At the summit we agreed the programme relating to the other three areas, too: to intensify diversification of supply; to promote environmental sustainability; and, by the next European Council, to develop a strategy for dealing with countries outside the EU. The Council asked the Commission to present a strategic energy review on a regular basis, starting in 2007.

<a name="60327-13_para14"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_8"></a>&quot;Next, research and development: rising economies, such as China and India, are investing heavily in science and technology. The way for Europe to compete is to be ahead of them, and to lead the knowledge economy rather than protecting old and uncompetitive industries. So the summit agreed the establishment of a European research council. This body will be run by scientists and its purpose will be to promote excellence in European research. We would expect universities and research communities in Britain to benefit.


</p>

<a name="60327-13_para15"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_9"></a>&quot;And linked to that is the third area: increased investment in universities, where currently only two of the top 20 universities in the world are European&#151;both, I should say, in the United Kingdom. The European Union has to produce enough graduates of the right calibre, and to improve links between business and universities, if we are going to open up and prosper in new global markets.


</p>

<a name="60327-13_para16"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_10"></a>&quot;In addition to the Hampton Court agenda, the British presidency had taken forward valuable work on better regulation and on the services directive. There was further progress on both these areas at the Council.


</p>

<a name="60327-13_para17"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_11"></a>&quot;The summit tasked the Commission to report by the end of 2006 on measurable EU targets for removing administrative burdens on business, and particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as to press ahead with the reforms undertaken during our presidency: more simplification of existing EU legislation, further withdrawal of unnecessary or outdated legislation, and more effective use of impact assessments.


</p>

<a name="60327-13_para18"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_12"></a>&quot;The summit also agreed a way forward on the services directive. This directive will be of great assistance to British service companies and to opening up Europe properly to a single market in services. Let me be plain. It is not everything we wanted, but a year ago some European leaders were declaring the directive dead and buried. It is not. It will represent a significant advance in the process of making Europe globally competitive.


</p>

<a name="60327-13_para19"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_13"></a>&quot;It is customary that the spring European Council concentrates largely on the economic agenda of the European Union. However, all member states shared a deep concern about the recent elections in Belarus. We agreed a statement which condemned the actions of the Belarus authorities in arresting peaceful demonstrators early on the morning of Friday 24 March. We also restated our view, based on the assessment by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, that the elections were fundamentally flawed.


</p>

<a name="60327-13_para20"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_14"></a>&quot;The European Union is now deciding on restrictive measures that it will take with respect to the Belarus authorities. President Lukashenko did not escape responsibility. The European Union applauds those who stood up for democracy against the odds and is determined to support civil society and the Belarussian people.

<a name="60327-13_para21"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_15"></a>&quot;The situation in Belarus stands in stark contrast to the situation in neighbouring Ukraine. The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe said that yesterday&#039;s elections there,


</p>
<ul>

</p>

<a name="60327-13_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>and that they therefore,

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>      &#039;further consolidated the breakthrough in the conduct of a democratic election process&#039;.</p>
</ul>

</p>

<a name="60327-13_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>This is a testament to the remarkable progress made in Ukraine since the orange revolution of 2004.


</p>

<a name="60327-13_para24"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_16"></a>&quot;Finally, as I am on my feet on European Business, the House will wish to be aware that earlier today I issued a Written Ministerial Statement in respect of the successful conclusion of the Gibraltar constitutional reform negotiations on 17 March. The new constitution, which will be put before the people of Gibraltar in a referendum, strengthens the links between Gibraltar and the United Kingdom, and thoroughly modernises the relationship between us, which I hope will be as welcome to the people of Gibraltar as it will to the United Kingdom.


</p>

<a name="60327-13_para25"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_17"></a>&quot;Last week&#039;s summit was a further step towards a more outward-looking European Union that delivers concrete benefits to its citizens. There is still a long way to go. The Government are in no doubt that Britain&#039;s best interests lie in a European Union that is open to the world, competitive and confident. We will continue to pursue that agenda vigorously. I commend this Statement to the House&quot;.

<p><a name="st_128"></a>
<a name="60327-14_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for repeating this fairly detailed Statement. After the rumpus at the summit about language, perhaps I should make it clear that I shall respond in English and not in French&#151;I say that without apology. We welcome the comment at the end of the Statement about Gibraltar. That is very good news, and certainly shows progress.
</p>

<a name="60327-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>As to the main body of the summit, the presidential conclusions asserted that the Lisbon strategy is being relaunched again&#151;and again and again. Looking at the language in the conclusions of the presidency, one cannot help feeling that the lesson has not really been learnt by all governments&#151;maybe not by any EU government&#151;that planning for growth top down by more and more hopeful strategies of this kind is a hopeless cause. Economic growth and a &quot;dynamic environment&quot;&#151;to take another phrase from the presidency conclusions&#151;come from deregulation, more competition and light taxation. Those are the sort of things that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is now in the habit of pointing out once a week. He is absolutely right to do so.
</p>

<a name="60327-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>Of course, we are totally in favour of increased competition throughout Europe, but is it not now, sadly, clear that some governments are very near the limits of the powers that they are prepared to surrender to higher pan-European or EU-wide authority? One <br>&nbsp;<br>

points to the example of the Spanish resistance to the takeover of Endesa, the French resistance&#151;to the fury of Mr Berlusconi and the Italians&#151;to the takeover of Suez by Enel, the Luxembourg and French resistance to the merging of Arcelor, their global steel giant, and, in effect, the block&#151;it is very nearly a block&#151;on further progress with the services directive.
</p>

<a name="60327-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>The tendency for a return to some degree of economic nationalism seems to be expressed no more vividly than when it comes to the attempts by the European Union to develop a common energy policy. Of course, that has been a virtual fiasco. All that has emerged from the summit, as we have heard from the Statement, is a strategic energy review, which is a poor outcome for such high-flown hopes. Is not practical co-operation in Europe, which is necessary in our region on energy matters, all covered very thoroughly already by the International Energy Agency? Everything to do with the stockholding of oil, the storage facilities for gas, the common approaches to safety and the regulation of nuclear facilities is covered by the IEA and has been for many years. I once had the honour of chairing that organisation, so I can confirm that.
</p>

<a name="60327-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>Secondly, governments are reluctant to cede strategic power in areas as sensitive politically as daily supplies of gas, electricity, light, warmth, transport, gasoline, petrol supplies and so on for the very simple reason that failure or interruption in any of those areas can involve an instant thumbs-down from the voters, who naturally want people close by their own governments to be held to account rather than to be told that it is all the fault of some more remote authority.
</p>

<a name="60327-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>I would like to have heard in the Statement much more about the United Kingdom. Should the UK not be very careful and steer clear of the Jos&#233; Manuel Barroso plan for closer EU-Russian co-operation on energy links and gas supplies? The other day, we learnt from bitter experience that when the going gets tight, particularly in gas markets, the continental monopolies&#151;which we hope will be replaced by competition, but that is only a hope&#151;with a certain amount of political pushing and shoving, make their markets the priority for Russian gas, rather than ours. Besides, in the longer term all the energy planning, including the Government&#039;s own planning, forecasts that in a few decades the UK will not rely on Russian gas&#151;we will have other sources&#151;whereas, by 2030, France will rely on Russian gas to the extent of 30 per cent, Germany by about 80 per cent and Austria by 95 per cent.
</p>

<a name="60327-14_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>In short, do we not have a totally different pattern of energy needs evolving in the future compared with large parts of continental Europe? We must maintain the freedom to make our own arrangements and to maintain our own patterns of diversity; we must not be locked into some new bloc ambitions for a Europe-wide energy policy.

<a name="60327-14_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>As for the services directive, which I have already mentioned, what progress was made? The Statement talks about a way forward, but what is the way forward? The conclusions of the presidency say that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>&quot;the internal market of services has to be fully operational while preserving the European social model&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-14_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>Those two things are incompatible, as we have all discovered. So what is going to give if there is to be progress&#151;as there should be and as undertakings have been given that there should be&#151;on the realisation and fulfilment of the services directive?
</p>

<a name="60327-14_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>We are bound to be disappointed that there is no further word on the constitution, whether it is dead or about to be replaced, or whether Ministers, including British Ministers, are putting forward alternatives. Have they put forward any alternatives? I do not know. Certainly other countries are busy proposing all kinds of arrangements to replace the old ones or to carry forward the governance of Europe by different means. We would very much have liked to have seen signs of more vigorous proposals by our own Ministers and the Foreign Office about how we see the governance of Europe in the future and how we want it to be shaped in a more fruitful direction than it is going at present.
</p>

<a name="60327-14_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>I would also have liked to hear a little more&#151;although I realise that this was mostly an economics-focused summit&#151;about the failed Iran diplomacy and where we go next in that frightening scenario. It would have been useful to hear more how the EU is going to handle Hamas, which is about to take government, and the funding dilemma there. How and to what point do we support it if it continues with its present propositions and stance?
</p>

<a name="60327-14_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>One cannot avoid the conclusion that much of this summit is sadly out of touch with the great issues that the European people and the world now face. It would have been good to see our Ministers take a more forward, creative and imaginative position on how Europe should now move. There is an overwhelming sense that in Europe we are allowing things to drift away from us, while the Prime Minister says that they are going our way&#151;they are not. We would like to have seen Ministers being more vigorous and we feel that once again they have failed on this front.

<a name="60327-14_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </b>   My Lords, we on these Benches recognise that this was an informal summit with, primarily, an economic agenda; therefore, we will focus primarily on the economic agenda. On energy policy, I certainly defer to the noble Lord, Lord Howell, as he is a much greater expert than I am. However, I would say that the essence of any European energy policy must be a more coherent approach towards Russia. Sadly, there does not appear to be any strong reference in the communiqu&#233;, so far as I can see, about a more coherent policy towards Russia. That is also highly relevant to our reaction to what is happening in Belarus. Russian influence is clearly part of the key to what happens in that poor benighted country.

<a name="60327-14_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>We welcome the progress that has been made with the European research council, so long as the council manages to avoid getting into <i>juste retour</i> questions and being caught up in a new administrative empire in which state-centred university systems reimpose their priorities. The British Government have not been fully engaged in the Bologna process all the way through. It is very important that the Bologna process of increasing co-operation among European universities ends up with a more open system. We hope that the British Government are now fully engaged in that.
</p>

<a name="60327-14_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>We note the rather puzzling and cool reference in paragraph 25 of the communiqu&#233;, in which the European Council notes the significance of the Commission&#039;s communication on the European institute of technology. I presume that that means, &quot;We didn&#039;t like it very much and we don&#039;t agree&quot;. We, from these Benches, note that the proposal for the European institute of technology carries within it a number of large potential elephant traps, including the suggestion by British Labour Members of the European Parliament that the proposal should be adapted to fit the building of the European Parliament in Strasbourg so that the European Parliament could continue only to meet in Brussels. I also note the view of my European colleague, Andrew Duff, that the European institute of technology is an excellent idea, provided that it is built in Cambridge. We, on these Benches, think that we need to avoid new institutions and ensure that this is part of the European research council.
</p>

<a name="60327-14_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>On better regulation, we welcome what is said in the communiqu&#233;, but we wish that the British Government would admit that we have also contributed our fair share to over-regulation in the European Union. I recall that in the Dutch referendum much fun was made by the antis of the new European zoo regulation, pushed by the British Government on to our colleagues because the British animal welfare lobby wished us to have it. I hope that, as the services directive moves through to implementation, we will maintain pressure to pursue our goals.
</p>

<a name="60327-14_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>Let me also ask about the odd declaration on the European pact for gender equality, with its reference to an annual report on equality between women and men. What does that imply? How do the British Government see that as contributing to further European integration? Does it also imply a new agency for gender equality? Are the British Government entirely happy with what is moving forward in that direction?
</p>

<a name="60327-14_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>Gibraltar and the Crown territories are also included in the directive. The Minister will be aware that many of us on these Benches have large questions to ask about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the Crown territories in Europe. We notice again that relations with Gibraltar have been defined in a different way from relations with the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey. We are not entirely sure that it is possible to sustain the degree of ambiguity which the United Kingdom now has in relations with these different European Crown territories&#151;in relation to the geographical extent of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_584"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 584</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

British legislation as it applies to them on some issues and not on others, and the different relations that each of them now has with the European Union.
</p>

<a name="60327-14_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>I have two specific questions here. First, can we be assured that there will be proper parliamentary scrutiny and debate of the new Gibraltar constitutional treaty? Secondly, may we press for a sessional committee to examine the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Crown territories? Every time I have asked about this, I am referred back to the Kilbrandon commission of 1974, which produced a short and deeply ambiguous paper on the relationship. That is not enough.
</p>

<a name="60327-14_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>Lastly, I simply chide the Government about the style of the opening paragraphs of this announcement. I wish Ministers could avoid a little bit of the Thatcherite triumphalism which has entered into British speeches towards the European continent. Yes, of course we are very glad that the British economy has grown more rapidly than the continental economy&#151;although some of us wish that our public transport system was as good as that of the French, the Germans or the Dutch. Not everything in Britain is necessarily always better than things on the Continent. If we wish to sustain British leadership in the European Union and to contribute towards a more constructive debate across Europe about the future of Europe, it would be better if we preached a little less. We are, after all, halfway through the period of reflection agreed to after the failure of the French and Dutch referenda. Perhaps British Ministers might like to talk rather more about the future of Europe and a little less about how much better Britain is than our EU colleagues.

<a name="60327-15_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, a significant number of issues have been raised and there is only a brief moment to reply to them as best I can. I will also do so in English, which I note is the lingua franca of the European Community.
</p>

<a name="60327-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>The Lisbon process, as the noble Lord, Lord Howell, said, has been subject to a number of rebirths. Some of the ideas involved in liberalising the economies of Europe do not take root instantly&#151;the arguments have to be repeated and people have to be brought to it by a process of persuasion. I have no doubt that we will have to continue with that, although I think that this meeting has helped us a little further along the route.
</p>

<a name="60327-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>Perhaps I may say to both noble Lords that regulation is an area in which I think we have a reasonable story to tell&#151;one that is not triumphalist. It is certainly true that we have tried to ensure that we have more intelligent regulation. We have urged on the spring Council that by the end of 2006 there should be measurable targets for removing administrative burdens on business. We want to look closely at the scope for doing still more. We want a rolling plan, with simplification, withdrawals and impact assessments. We must be &quot;thinking small first&quot;, to use the terminology, because we are concerned about the <br>&nbsp;<br>

smaller and medium-sized enterprises starting up. I would just say to noble Lords, if they expect everybody to immediately warm to those themes, that I suspect that those themes, too, will need a good deal of gentle&#151;and sometimes forceful&#151;reiteration before they take full hold.
</p>

<a name="60327-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howell, talked about economic protectionism. We have seen something of a resurgence of it, which I think is unhelpful. Open, independently regulated markets are more competitive markets. They are the best recipe for sustained economic growth anywhere in the world and for ensuring that the United Kingdom takes its role and benefits from that growth. It will not be a fortress Europe. The reality is that if the walls are kept up, jobs are kept out. We have argued strongly that that cannot happen.
</p>

<a name="60327-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>On energy, it is bound to be the case that there is a good deal of co-operation at present with the Russian Federation as a major source of energy supplies. Energy security and energy supplies will be the central theme of the next G8 conference. It has to be a thoughtful discussion in which the whole of the European Union is involved.
</p>

<a name="60327-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>Both noble Lords posed questions on the services directive. In the short time available, I can respond only in a sentence. There has been some movement, although by no means all the movement that we would have desired. But we expect a draft to come out of the next process, which will be a start for further discussions to carry forward the liberalisation of the services area.
</p>

<a name="60327-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>I am a little relieved that there has been little discussion of the constitutional alternatives. Some may say that that is a limitation. A summit directed towards economics was perhaps inevitable. But these economic issues require very concerted attention. I suspect that another round of what would or would not work in a constitution would not have done the job that was necessary.
</p>

<a name="60327-15_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>I have little comment to make on Iran or the Middle East peace process. I know that those issues were discussed in the fringes. However, the focus of the main conference has been the economy, as noble Lords said.
</p>

<a name="60327-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, raised the issues of the European research council and the European institute of technology. I do not think that we have been disengaged from the Bologna process. As regards the research council, we want to see a European equivalent of the American National Science Foundation. A scientifically led governing council was established last July and is independent of the Commission so that it gains real credibility, adding value by providing scientists with much-needed extra funds for research. On the European institute of technology, when the word &quot;university&quot; arises, the temptation is always to gravitate to the question of where the bricks and mortar will be. This will not be about bricks and mortar. It will be about a concerted effort and about building and co-ordinating networks <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>I thank both noble Lords for what they said about Gibraltar. A longer reply is needed than I have time to give now. I undertake to provide it.

<a name="60327-15_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>Finally, I am not hot on triumphalism. However, if some things are going well&#151;and compared with many others our economy is going well; those are the raw facts based on the real data&#151;I do not think that it is bad for us in the UK occasionally to claim a little bit of success where that is entitled.

<a name="60327-15_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Brittan of Spennithorne: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the progress that has been made with regard to the services directive is the broad emergence at the European Council of support for the compromise reached in the European Parliament? While far from perfect, and not going nearly as far as one would wish, it enables a directive to be agreed which achieves considerable liberalisation in this vital sector. The right course is to make sure that the European Parliament and Ministers reach a final agreement which goes no step backwards and a little further forward in that direction.
</p>

<a name="60327-15_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>With regard to the protectionist tendencies which have come to the fore in countries such as France, Spain, Italy and Poland, although the subject was not dwelt on at the European Council, does the Minister agree that the right approach is for all Ministers to give the strongest support and encouragement to the European Commission to use to the full its considerable powers in support of competition policy and the single market to defeat such measures, most of which are plainly in contradiction of legal obligations that the countries have entered into?
</p>




<p><a name="st_132"></a>
<a name="60327-15_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I agree strongly with both underlying propositions the noble Lord, Lord Brittan, has introduced. The services directive proposed by Commissioner Bolkestein in January 2004 requires the co-decision of both the European Parliament and the Council. In February, the European Parliament voted through a package of amendments. The Commission will present a revised proposal on these areas at the Graz informal meeting on 20 and 21 April. Subject to further discussions, the Austrian presidency will consider whether to press that. We have the foundations of a discussion. It should not slip backwards. That is the point with which I agree most strongly. There are provisions which will make it easier for firms to set up businesses in another state. Barriers are still left, covering such aspects as the minimum distance between opticians and other finer detailed and not particularly intelligent formulations that have existed in the past. Those can all potentially be changed by the proposals.
</p>

<a name="60327-15_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>I also agree strongly on the points about protectionism. The reality is that we are a fairly open society. We share many of our major companies and <br>&nbsp;<br>

supplies with other Europeans and, indeed, with countries from further afield. Our open markets have delivered better prices. I believe that a better market in a general sense will deliver still better markets for everyone across Europe. In turn, we own a great deal overseas. I do not think that that has ever been to the disbenefit of those countries in which our companies trade and do so very effectively. There are legal barriers to this protectionism. I believe that they will have to be considered if the protectionism becomes a still more dominant theme in some people&#039;s thinking.

However, is my noble friend confident that last week&#039;s European Council will rescue the so-called Lisbon strategy from failure? That is the issue so far. Can he assure the House that an open and robust system of national comparisons which highlights the successes and failures of national economies will be put into place? Does he think that member states will acquire the good sense to learn from one another&#039;s best practice in competitiveness, openness and deregulation, rather than indulging in self-defeating protectionism, as they have in the recent past?
</p>




<p><a name="st_134"></a>
<a name="60327-15_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I agree that protectionism is plainly self-defeating. It distorts and will destroy markets if it is allowed to take root. The Commission relaunch of the Lisbon strategy in 2005 started with a renewed focus on jobs and growth, as noble Lords will know. Member states were required to provide national reform programmes identifying key areas for reform at national level. Some have done so with some vigour and some have not. It is plain that if we are to improve labour market performance, to move more rapidly in research and development and in competition, including in services and energy, and to reduce the burden of EU regulation, the successful creation of national reform programmes is a vital building block. If I am asked whether I think that everyone will step up and do that as rapidly, vigorously or successfully as necessary, the answer is similar to the response that I gave to the first two interventions: some will do so more successfully than others. We should urge everyone to do so successfully, but we should make sure that we do so successfully. That is why those forms of liberalisation must remain absolutely at the centre of the policies for which we argue for the economy of the new Europe.

<a name="60327-16_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Dahrendorf: </b>   My Lords, perhaps I may press the Minister even further on the question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Brittan. Some of us are sceptical about Lisbon for two reasons. One is that many of the proposals in the Lisbon agenda are outside the powers of the European Union as it stands today, so the agenda was to some extent bound to remain paper rather than fact. It is very different from the single market proposals. The other is that policies and policy cultures in different European countries differ. Lisbon has never taken sufficient account of those rather fundamental differences.

<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>Having said that, the problem now seems to be the truly serious issue of protectionism. I wonder whether it is good enough to rely on friendly intergovernmental talks when it comes to extremely serious developments. I shall not return to the services directive, but the directive that will emerge will at any rate not do the crucial thing: recognise the conditions obtaining in the country from which services or those who deliver services come. On energy policy, quite a few participants in last week&#039;s meeting declared ahead of time that they do not intend to give any further powers to Europe in that field.

<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>I find what happens in the Polish banking system extremely serious. It is extremely serious not only because of economic nationalism but because of the extraordinary position in which the governor of the Bank of Poland, who is one of the most distinguished and, I believe, important figures in post-communist Poland, is placed.

Should not that be brought out into the open? In so far as solutions are possible, is not the noble Lord, Lord Brittan, entirely right when he points to the powers that the Commission has in many of those areas? Should it not be encouraged to use those powers?
</p>




<p><a name="st_136"></a>
<a name="60327-16_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I am sorry if I did not answer the point clearly enough the first time. I am quite sure that the Commission should use those powers. The reality is that two major steps are required. One is the use of all the powers to ensure that there is a proper, open and reformed market. The second is that there should be serious attempts to evaluate and produce effective evaluation methodology of the general progress of the Lisbon criteria, so that we can check in a serious way whether they are being met.

<a name="60327-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>I do not know there is a great deal that I can add to the general points that I have already made about energy policy. European leaders have agreed that we must focus on security of supply in completing the single market, improving competitiveness and diversifying sources of energy, so that there is more energy efficiency and a more coherent external strategy. That will be a very difficult discussion. The G8 discussion this year will be a vital part of that, under the Russian presidency. What is certain is that we cannot leave matters as they are without pressing that discussion to a more effective conclusion. The matter will not stay in a neutral state, if I may put it that way, without being moved to a better resolution.

<a name="60327-16_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I fear that I do not share the hypothesis that lies behind that question. We have a considerable variety of higher education institutions, which cater for very different markets. There is no evidence that the key factors that produce world-leading higher education institutions draw off resource from the very best and distribute them around some of the other institutions that are doing a different kind of job. The concentration of research funding on its own demonstrates the degree to which some of our leading institutions are absolutely in the forefront of what can be achieved. We have a real task in Europe to ensure that we have more institutions in those areas. The critical thing will be attracting and retaining staff who are right at the leading edges of the disciplines in which we want to progress.

If the Commission is to go into battle on behalf of the single market&#151;as it should, if any member state transgresses&#151;it needs people to speak up on its behalf, not to be left to take the sort of flak that will inevitably be thrown at it by the country or countries that it argues have transgressed European law. I hope that he will take that point and that the Government will speak up.

<a name="60327-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>On energy policy, the argument about whether we in Britain should depend more or less on Russia is rather short-sighted. Frankly, if the Russians are to be unreliable suppliers to our main export markets in continental Europe, that will be extremely bad news for us. It will also be bad news for us in so far as we depend from time to time&#151;in recent months, quite a bit&#151;on supplies of gas that come through continental Europe. Will future dialogue with Russia be based very firmly on pressing the Russians to ratify the Energy Charter, which they signed with the European Union some years ago but which they have never ratified and which, if ratified by them and implemented&#151;two quite big &quot;ifs&quot;, I suspect&#151;would provide many of the conditions that are most important if Russia is to be regarded as a useful and reliable supplier?

<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>It will be of the greatest importance that the Energy Charter is ratified by Russia&#151;I agree with the point made by the noble Lord. Although we have seen the Russian Federation denying gas supplies to one of its neighbours, generally speaking, the supply through the rest of Europe has been very reliable. That is a matter of fact. The response to the one occasion on which the Russian Federation interrupted the gas supply from everyone else in the gas market suggested that that was not a wise step to have taken. It created a considerable storm. That itself is now due to be a feature of the G8 conference this year.

<a name="60327-16_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Harrison: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister say a little more about the discussion on small businesses? I understood that the purpose of the summit was to discuss small businesses further. Will he confirm that the discussion was not confined to the sort of generalisations that are commonly made about the business of small businesses and that there was forensic examination of some of the existing legislation? I have in mind the late payments directive. Was that discussed, and was it considered to be successful? Were there discussions about the general approach to the establishment of the single market, which, for many of us, has too often been concerned with creating a market for big businesses when it should of course also have policies to help small businesses participate in an ever-growing single European market?
</p>




<p><a name="st_142"></a>
<a name="60327-16_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, a great deal of the discussion on the interests of small businesses centred on regulation and the number of directives that have been enacted. Plainly, regulation is more burdensome for smaller businesses than it is for larger ones; it takes up a larger proportion of the resources available to them which they would usually put into their entrepreneurship.
</p>

<a name="60327-16_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>The focus has moved&#151;I believe as a result of the Hampton Court discussions&#151;to ensuring that there are agreements on eliminating some of the barriers or additional costs on small businesses and that the regulations are subject to proper impact assessments so that small businesses are not inadvertently caught by the extent of regulation. The focus is now on the delivery of that agenda. I remind noble Lords that that agenda was agreed at Hampton Court and developed with some effect in the most recent discussion. As we have learnt, however&#151;indeed, this has come up in your Lordships&#039; House throughout this brief discussion&#151;we will have to continue to press it.

Lord Howell of Guildford about whether the Council made any progress on the future of the European constitution? I refer to the fact that the Statement makes so bold as to criticise the lack of democratic authority of the new regime in Belarus. Will the Minister say something about the creeping EU constitution, which also lacks democratic support? He admitted himself in a Written Answer on 11 January that the Fundamental Rights Agency and the European Charter of Fundamental Rights are proceeding in a legal vacuum. I do not know whether the Government noticed Commission President Barroso&#039;s answer to Mr Daniel Hannan MEP a week ago&#151;reply no. E-0429/06&#151;in which Mr Barroso brazenly stated that the legal basis for the European External Action Service is article III-296(3) of the Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe, which does not exist. Mr Barroso gave similarly implausible justifications for the European Defence Agency and the European space programme, both of which are also proceeding full steam ahead.

<a name="60327-17_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Baroness Andrews): </b> 
<a name="60327-17_state0"></a> My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall now repeat a Statement, made earlier today in another place by the Minister for Local Government. The Statement is as follows:


</p>

<a name="60327-17_para0"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_18"></a>&quot;With permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to make a Statement on council tax for 2006&#150;07 and the action that the Government propose to take with regard to those local authorities that have set excessive budgets.


</p>

<a name="60327-17_para1"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_19"></a>&quot;Figures released today show that, excluding the council tax element of the funding package for the 2012 Olympic Games, the average council tax increase in England for 2006&#150;07 is 4.2 per cent. With the council tax element of the Olympics, it is 4.5 per cent. We have a mature working relationship with the Local Government Association. We have worked with it to examine the pressures that councils will face in the next two years, and how central and local government can manage those pressures. Under the settlement for 2006&#150;07, which the House approved on 6 February, total support for local government, including specific grants, will rise by 4.5 per cent compared with 2005-06. This included an extra &#163;305 million above previous plans.


</p>

<a name="60327-17_para2"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_20"></a>&quot;The provisional settlement for 2007&#150;08 will provide an increase of a further 5 per cent, with &#163;508 million above that previously planned. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_592"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 592</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Through introducing multi-year settlements, we are enabling authorities to plan ahead more effectively in budgeting for service delivery. We have now provided a framework for authorities to deliver effective local services over the next two years which takes account of the pressures that authorities face. By 2007&#150;08, government grant for local services will have increased by more than the rate of inflation for 10 years in succession. This represents an increase of 39 per cent in real terms since 1997. It can be compared very favourably with a real-term reduction of 7 per cent in the four years up to 1997. I also remind the House of the council tax support that the Government provide to those on low incomes. Fourteen per cent of total council tax is paid through council tax benefit. Nobody who is unable to pay is made to pay, and we are working to ensure that all who are eligible do claim the benefit. Given our significant extra investment of grant and the continuing scope for efficiency savings, we made it very clear again this year that we expected authorities to budget prudently. It was only with the greatest reluctance, following the 12.9 per cent rise in council tax in 2003&#150;04, that we first made use of our reserve capping powers. However, as we said in our 2005 election manifesto, we will use capping to protect council tax payers from excessive increases. There can be no doubt that the recent more modest increases in council tax could not have occurred without the Government making judicious use of those powers.


</p>

<a name="60327-17_para3"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_21"></a>&quot;When we announced the provisional settlement in December, we said that we expected the average increase in council tax in England to be less than 5 per cent for each of the two years 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08. I set that out in a letter to all authorities. Ministers later wrote to those authorities reported to be considering setting increases of above 5 per cent. I also wrote jointly with my right honourable friend the Member for Salford to all police authorities reaffirming the Government&#039;s expectations. I am pleased to report that the overwhelming majority of authorities have responded positively to our messages. Most authorities fully recognise the need to minimise the demands that they place on council tax payers. Regrettably, however, there remain a very small number that have set excessive budget and council tax increases. It is for this reason that I am making a Statement to the House today about the action that we propose to take.


</p>

<a name="60327-17_para4"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_22"></a>&quot;I should like to remind honourable Members of the provisions of the capping legislation set out in the Local Government Finance Act 1992, as amended by the Local Government Act 1999. In order to determine whether each authority&#039;s budgeted expenditure, as defined in the legislation, is excessive, we must consider a comparison of the authority&#039;s budget requirement for 2006&#150;07 with that of the previous year. The legislation also allows us to determine other principles such as the level of increases in council tax. This year, the increase in budget requirement for authorities providing education, police and fire services is measured using the alternative notional amounts given in the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_593"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 593</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<i>Limitation of Council Tax and Precepts (Alternative Notional Amounts) Report (England) 2006/07</i>, approved by the House on 6 February. Alternative notional amounts are notional figures used for capping purposes to help give a like-for-like comparison of budget requirements between years. Our view is that authorities&#039; 2006&#150;07 budgets are excessive if they show, first, an increase of more than 6 per cent in their budget requirement compared with 2005-06 and, secondly, if their council tax has increased by more than 5 per cent in the same period.


</p>

<a name="60327-17_para5"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_23"></a>&quot;As was the case in 2005&#150;06, a single set of principles has been applied to all authorities. Despite the principles being more stringent than in 2005&#150;06 when authorities&#039; budgets were judged excessive if they showed an increase of more than 6 per cent in budget requirement compared with 2004&#150;05 and if council tax had increased by more than 5.5 per cent, we are proposing to take action against only two unitary authorities this year. That is to be compared with 2004&#150;05 when we took capping action against 14 authorities, and 2005-06, when we took action against nine authorities.


</p>

<a name="60327-17_para6"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_24"></a>&quot;The two authorities are Medway Borough Council and York City Council, which have both set excessive budgets according to the principles that I have described. We are writing to these authorities today, informing them of our decision to designate them with a view to capping them in-year and notifying them of the maximum budget that we propose to set for them.


</p>

<a name="60327-17_para7"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_25"></a>&quot;The authorities have a statutory right to challenge the proposed caps. They have 21 days in which to do so. If they wish to challenge, we will carefully consider the information that we have required them to send us, along with any other representations that they make, before we take the final decisions.


</p>

<a name="60327-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_26"></a>&quot;We will then either make an order, to be approved by this House, designating the authorities at the level of the proposed maximum budget, or another level; or withdraw the designation and nominate them instead. Nomination would allow us either to set them notional budgets for 2006&#150;07 for future capping comparisons, or to cap them in advance for 2007&#150;08.


</p>

<a name="60327-17_para9"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_27"></a>&quot;Two shire districts&#151;Aylesbury Vale District Council and Wellingborough Borough Council&#151;have also breached the limits. However, as they have done so by very small amounts&#151;only 12p and 9p respectively in terms of band D council tax&#151;we are not proposing to take action against them.


</p>

<a name="60327-17_para10"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_28"></a>&quot;We have always made clear our reluctance to take capping action. These are powers of last resort and we would prefer not to have to use them. But the public have a right to be protected from excessive council tax increases.

</p>

<a name="60327-17_para12"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_30"></a>&quot;The vast majority of authorities&#151;99 per cent&#151;have responded well to our clear message for council tax in 2006&#150;07. No one would have been happier than me if it had been 100 per cent. However, we remain committed to taking action against those increases which we believe to be excessive&quot;.

<p><a name="st_146"></a>
<a name="60327-18_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for repeating the Statement. I declare an interest as an elected member of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. In 1997, when this Government came to power, council tax, as introduced by the Conservative administration, had been widely seen as being fair and reasonable and was set at an affordable level across the bands. That can hardly be said now.
</p>

<a name="60327-18_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>Since that time, the Government have presided over an increase in council tax of nearly 90 per cent, while raising the level of grant towards it by just 39 per cent, which has been made clear in the Statement. There has been a significant shift between the amount which is now borne by the tax payers and the grant provided by the Government, which is not made up of government revenues alone, but includes a major contribution from the non-domestic rate payers.
</p>

<a name="60327-18_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>It is ironic that one of the Government&#039;s own number&#151;Sedgefield&#151;which has a Labour district and county council and a fairly well known Labour MP, now has the dubious honour of having the highest council tax in the country&#151;&#163;1,490 at band D. Wandsworth, which is a good Conservative council and is consistently well managed, despite the insatiable demand of the Mayor for London, has, at &#163;648, the lowest charge, which is less than half that of Sedgefield.
</p>

<a name="60327-18_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>The levy for the Mayor amounts to &#163;289 of Wandsworth&#039;s charge, which is within a hair&#039;s breadth of being half of the total amount. Most Londoners would say that the Mayor is proving to be very bad value for that sort of money. He has insatiable ambitions for the future, some of which are shared by the Government. I must ask the Minister whether there will be any limit on the amount of precept that he will be allowed to levy.
</p>

<a name="60327-18_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>Others who will be concerned by the 4 to 5 per cent rises this year are pensioners. On average, they are worse off by &#163;250, and that is without the cushion of the Chancellor&#039;s &#163;200 election bung of last year. Could it be that these gifts get handed out only in election years? After that, those who are demonstrably the poorest off under his regime are made worse off. The Chancellor&#039;s contempt for pensioners, whether on state or private pensions, is becoming only too apparent. This omission this year is just one more example of that. It seems that the older one gets, the <br>&nbsp;<br>

less the Chancellor thinks one needs to have security of income. Perhaps the Minister could tell us why this &quot;one year only&quot; contribution has been dropped.
</p>

<a name="60327-18_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>The Minister in the other place also reminded us that there is a council tax element of the funding package for the 2012 Olympic Games, which adds about 0.3 per cent to the council tax average increase of 4.2 per cent. Will the Minister explain what the totality of the Olympic Games&#039; burden is to the council tax payer, whether it is capped, and for how long it is envisaged that it will last? Will it last beyond 2012?
</p>

<a name="60327-18_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>While speaking about averages, the Government insist on issuing figures for average council tax per dwelling. Does the Minister accept that independent commentators, which include the House of Commons Library notes, have denounced that terminology as being inaccurate and unsuitable? They point out that the only fair way to compare council tax, like for like, is to contrast a band D tax with a band D tax. By doing that, it becomes clear that, on average, Conservative councils charge&#151;excluding precepts from fire, police and, where appropriate, the GLA&#151;&#163;81 less a year than Labour councils and &#163;88 less than Liberal Democrat councils. Will the Minister explain why it is that the Government should insist on making comparisons on this dubious basis? Does she not accept that in different local authority areas the mix of dwellings by value may be significantly different, one from another?
</p>

<a name="60327-18_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>It is remarkable that 50 per cent of the Statement has been on capping just two hapless councils which have fallen under the Government&#039;s capping procedures. By how much have they breached the limit? How much is that in monetary terms? It seems clear that with the Government&#039;s withdrawal of the revaluation process this year, their commitment to increasing the number of council tax bands and the reviews that are now being undertaken by Sir Michael Lyons and the Miliband team, any lessening of the burden of council tax is improbable. Sadly, property is becoming the milch cow of this Government.
</p>

<a name="60327-18_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>It is time that the Government looked to decrease the burden on council tax payers, stopped redistributing grant from one area of the country to the other, lessened the burden on income-restricted pensioners, abandoned their excessive folly of regionalisation and started to put the council tax payer first.

<a name="60327-18_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </b>   My Lords, the one fact on which I have seen general agreement today is that council tax is set this year to rise by twice the level of inflation to 4.5 per cent, with average council tax now more than &#163;1,056 per year. All afternoon I have watched e-mail traffic as press releases fly around. Each of the political parties interprets the figures in a slightly different way and uses a different way of measuring in order to make its case.
</p>

<a name="60327-18_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>I thought that perhaps I would engage in a non-party political point. This year, if you take all local authorities which are in single-party control and look <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_596"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 596</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

at this year&#039;s increase, you will see a difference of 0.3 per cent in the increases proposed by the three parties. The higher increases are in coalitions where there are large numbers of independent councillors. That is an interesting argument in view of the claims that everyone is making for their political party. There are two fundamental problems. We have a system of local government finance which is now virtually impossible to understand, is subject to the worse kind of government micromanagement and interference, and is unresponsive to local needs and situations.
</p>

<a name="60327-18_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>Today, I spoke to people involved in local government in York. By all the external verification and assessment available, York is a highly efficient council. Last year, it saved &#163;4.7 million in efficiencies. It has the lowest council tax level outside the south-east and the lowest expenditure per head of any council. In the new grant formula, created by the Government this year, it was agreed that York city should receive an extra &#163;1.4 million. There was agreement from the Government that it needed that money. However, because of the technical damping mechanism, York has not received that money, and because it has not received it, it is now over the Government&#039;s capping limit. This Government were opposed to crude capping of this sort, and then they brought it back. Will the Minister tell the House today that if the Lyons review states that this mechanism must be scrapped, the Government will do as he says and return to a more sensible and equitable system?
</p>

<a name="60327-18_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>The second problem is that council tax is unfair and unrelated to ability to pay. The poorest 10 per cent of pensioners are now paying one-tenth of their income in council tax. All people on low and fixed incomes are facing the same problem. It is all right for the Government to talk about benefits, but we all know that the take-up rate on benefits is poor, particularly with pensioners, and benefits are unnecessarily bureaucratic. Would it not make sense to have a tax related to ability to pay in the first place? Fiddling around with capping on small percentage increases will do nothing to help pensioners in this position. Also, this year they will not be getting the &#163;200 pre-election bribe&#151;or rebate, as it was called.
</p>

<a name="60327-18_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>Once again, we are seeing government intervention in areas where the percentage may be large, but the amounts are small. I am pleased that the Government have learnt the lesson of last year and have decided not to cap the tiny increases in Aylesbury Vale and Wellingborough. However, can the Minister say by how much council tax bills will be reduced in other areas after the enormous cost of rebilling is taken into account? I also ask the same question as the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, about costs.
</p>

<a name="60327-18_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>Five out of the seven candidates for capping this year are emergency services. It is extraordinary to us that this Government believe that it is right to spend millions of pounds on ID cards and that emergency services on the ground should be restricted in this way. I am sorry that this year we are once again in this position. This is a rotten tax. We should scrap it, not cap it.

<a name="60327-18_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, it was interesting to have those responses from the noble Baronesses. They gave clear accounts of how they feel we have managed this year&#039;s council tax increases. I am sorry that they were not more welcoming considering that a negotiation has been successfully worked through in a mature fashion with the Local Government Association, with which we work closely, not least to understand, analyse and respond to the inevitable demographic pressures that local councils are facing. We understand that there are serious pressures. We arrived at what has been regarded as a successful settlement. The 39 per cent increase over funding is after inflation since 1997, and we are proud that we have been able to do that.
</p>

<a name="60327-18_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>I turn to the specific questions raised. I shall take the issue of pensioners first. That is one of the most important points raised this afternoon. I take very seriously the points that the noble Baronesses made. Nothing would give us more pleasure than if there were a 100 per cent take-up of council tax benefit. Fourteen per cent of council tax is funded through council tax benefit. We are conscious that the take-up is not good enough and that we need to do everything that we can to simplify access and the system. We are doing that with the Pension Service. It is going to great lengths to ring people who, it thinks, are not claiming benefits to which they are entitled and is inviting them to come forward so that it can help them access that benefit. We can go further than that, and I think we must. However, I dispute the idea that we have shown contempt for pensioners. That is very strong language. We offered &#163;200 last year, for good reasons. We did not make any claim that we would be able to repeat that. It has to be put into the context of what else we have done for pensioners. I tell the noble Baronesses that the average pensioner household will be around &#163;1,350 per year better off&#151;&#163;26 per week&#151;in 2006&#150;07 because of the tax and benefit changes than they would have been in 1997. I shall not list all the things that we have done&#151;from fuel payments to free television licences and free eye tests&#151;but the Budget Statement prefigured what more we will do; that is, free transport from 2008. It has been a serious commitment and it will continue to be so.
</p>

<a name="60327-18_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>Another question raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, concerned London, the precept and the bill for the Olympics. The precept was 13.3 per cent, but the point about the GLA is that it did not breach the principle of having a budget requirement of more than 6 per cent, which is why it has not been capped. The noble Baroness will know that that works out at about &#163;20 per year in London for the Olympics. Her questions were about where the boundaries for council tax payers will be, whether the costs will overrun and how much more taxpayers will have to pay. The total estimated funding already includes a contingency of about &#163;500 million. We are determined <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_598"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 598</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to ensure that the calls on public funding remain within the overall agreed funding package. We have set &#163;625 million as the figure for the London council tax payer to contribute, and it could be less. Any further call on the council would need to be agreed between the Government and the Mayor of London at the time and, in turn, by the London Assembly. We have sent a firm message that we will take action against excessive increases in council tax on that point.

<p><a name="st_149"></a>
<a name="60327-19_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   My Lords, as I understood her, the Minister responded that the precept for the Olympic Games is on London ratepayers. However, from the Statement made by Mr Woolas, it seems that there is a general impost across the whole of the country. We ought to make it clear that it is just London council tax payers who are paying for the Olympic Games. I think there is a mistake in his Statement.
</p>




<p><a name="st_150"></a>
<a name="60327-19_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, it is true that it is just London taxpayers, because the benefits will go to London. The figure of 4.5 per cent is spread out across the country to illustrate that.
</p>

<a name="60327-19_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, asked about capping of what she described as &quot;two hapless councils&quot;. We are pleased that there are only two and no more. Having set principles within a capping regime, as we are required to do, we have to apply them. It is unfortunate that the two councils have fallen into that category. They will be able to challenge the decision. They have that right. Indeed, they may choose to challenge the billing cost. They are free to do that. Nevertheless, they have fallen outwith the regulations.
</p>

<a name="60327-19_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>Both noble Baronesses ask me what budget reductions would be required. In Medway, it would be &#163;382,000 and in York, it would be &#163;285,000. Those are the figures that we are talking about. The noble Baroness, Lady Scott, asked me about Lyons and, in particular, whether we could look forward to the scrapping of the capping system after Sir Michael&#039;s report. Would that I could anticipate what the gentleman will come up with. We shall have to wait and see. It is one of many aspects of the funding regime and the form and functions of local government that he will be looking at, and I am afraid we will have to be patient.
</p>

<a name="60327-19_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>I believe that I have dealt with the other questions on the Lyons report that were put to me. I take the point on which the noble Baroness concluded. We are obviously keen to keep council tax down, but we believe, and this Statement demonstrates, that this year we have a settlement that is fair and negotiated and that will fully fund the services that are needed. With the LGA, we are looking at many other hard issues about new burdens; for example, adult social services, and so on. We look forward to working with the LGA as we approach CSR07 to make sure that we have as rational, fair and efficient a system as possible.

<a name="60327-19_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Lord Bach): </b> 
<a name="60327-19_state0"></a> My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall now repeat in the form of a Statement the Answer given by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State to a Question asked in another place earlier this afternoon. The Statement is as follows:


</p>

<a name="60327-19_para4"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_31"></a>&quot;In my Written Statement on 16 March, I told the House that the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) had advised me for the first time on 14 March that it would no longer be possible to make the bulk of single payment scheme (SPS) payments by 31 March and that, in the light of this unacceptable situation, a new chief executive would be appointed.


</p>

<a name="60327-19_para5"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_32"></a>&quot;I fully understand and share anxieties that these events will cause to the farming community and deeply regret that this unacceptable situation has arisen.


</p>

<a name="60327-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_33"></a>&quot;I received an initial report from the acting chief executive (Mark Addison) into the situation at the RPA on 21 March.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_600"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 600</b><br>&nbsp;<br>



</p>

<a name="60327-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_34"></a>&quot;There are substantial problems facing the RPA in getting SPS payments out to farmers, much greater than had previously been reported to Ministers. As I know the House and the farming community would expect, speeding up those payments remains the overwhelming priority of Defra Ministers and the RPA itself. However, it also remains essential that actions taken now in response to these problems are very carefully considered, but are also sure-footed to avoid making them still worse in the future.


</p>

<a name="60327-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_35"></a>&quot;Mr Addison&#039;s report identified some initial steps, which should enable us to speed up payments, without losing sight of the need to properly manage the disbursement of a large sum of public money.


</p>

<a name="60327-19_para9"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_36"></a>&quot;The initial steps which I have sanctioned are: focusing resources in the RPA on making the 2005 payments as fast as is legally possible; removing disproportionate checks from the payment authorisation system to speed up the flow of payments once claims have been validated; prioritising work on validation of claims to release the maximum value of payments as quickly as possible, as opposed to the maximum number of individual claims, an action which will mainly benefit historic customers; centralising key mapping work at the most productive office (Reading); reviewing what further steps can be taken to simplify the process so that decisions can be made later this week; strengthening the RPA&#039;s capacity in key areas and changing the RPA&#039;s structure to streamline command and control.


</p>

<a name="60327-19_para10"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_37"></a>&quot;The Minister for Sustainable Farming and Food (Lord Bach) and the RPA acting chief executive have invited senior representatives of the industry to weekly meetings, the first of which took place on 22 March, so that close contact can be maintained with them, and will also be engaging urgently with the banks and other key stakeholders.


</p>

<a name="60327-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_38"></a>&quot;Central to the success of these steps is the team at RPA. I am confident that with Mark Addison at the helm, we have in place the right people for the job in this next stage. Their work and commitment remain key to delivery. They have worked with absolute dedication throughout often in the face of considerable difficulties. I am sure they will continue to do so&quot;.

<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>I find the Statement disappointing. It indicates where there are problems, but my reading of it does not actually give any answers to those problems. I will put some questions directly to the Minister, which I hope he will be able to answer. The Statement refers to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>&quot;focusing resources in the RPA&quot;.</p>

<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-19_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>What resources are those and how will that be done? It refers to &quot;removing disproportionate checks&quot;. Which checks are disproportionate and how will that be done? It refers to &quot;reviewing . . . further steps&quot; to simplify the process and so that,

<ul>

<a name="60327-19_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>Can that decision be made in time for our debate on Thursday, when we shall at least have a chance to look at the issues more fully? The Statement also refers to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>&quot;engaging urgently with the banks and other key stakeholders&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-19_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>The banking part is key, because so many farmers are finding themselves unable to pay their bills.
</p>

<a name="60327-19_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>This Statement is long on problems, but short on facts and information. The Secretary of State accepts that there has been total failure and that the situation within the RPA is unacceptable. There are no reassurances, however, as to how this might be resolved, and no timetable is given. Is it just the mapping end that is not completed? How many farms have had their maps agreed and how many are still outstanding? Is it just that the RPA payment system is unable to cope? Is it that the IT system is not up to the job that it has to take on? Or is it that the new mapping exercise does not fit in with the previous maps that were held by many farmers who received historic claims? Considering the delay, will the department consider delaying the date&#151;16 May 2006&#151;by which the new applications for single farm payments are usually made?
</p>

<a name="60327-19_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>I referred to engaging with banks. I understand that many farmers are at their wits&#039; end and I have referred one case to the Minister. I am very grateful to him for taking it up. We should not, however, be in the position of having to take up individual cases because an agency has totally failed to do what it should do. In engaging with banks, will the Government consider providing an emergency fund where perhaps the banks are not willing or able to extend credit any further? As one tenant farmer said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a>&quot;I am close to my overdraft limit, with the rent to pay on 5 April, and with no single farm payments money to hand&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-19_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>I have also contacted the Farm Crisis Network, which records that farmers have been calling it regularly over the past three weeks, very distressed that late payment of their subsidies is causing cash-flow problems. It has a knock-on effect not only on them but on their suppliers and the banks. Many callers are saying that fuel suppliers, feed merchants and others are refusing to allow farmers any more supplies or credit and that some banks are refusing to increase their overdraft facility. I ask the Minister what the Government will do about that and whether the Government will pay interest on the money that is outstanding.

</p>

<a name="60327-19_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>I understand that the helpline has taken 50-plus cases in the south-west alone. In each of those cases the problems have been exaggerated because of the late payment under the single farm scheme. These cases affect not only the farmers but their families. Not all of the calls in the south-west were received by the helpline itself; many were received directly at the volunteers&#039; homes. They are even looking into a case where a farmer has committed suicide, partly caused, they believe, by the anxiety of this terrible state of late payments.
</p>

<a name="60327-19_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>I know that in another place some Members have called for the Minister&#039;s resignation. No doubt he will consider his own position. He may feel it unfair that he should be the one to be singled out and in the firing line when the responsibility clearly lies with the Secretary of State herself. I have asked some very real questions. I expect answers to those questions. If they are not forthcoming, we will certainly expect them when we debate the matter further on Thursday.

<a name="60327-20_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   My Lords, when this subject was debated in a Starred Question on, I think, 24 January, it was believed that some of the questioning was actually questioning the very substance of CAP reform. I say now on the record that we have always supported CAP reform. We have been very clear about that. I think that we really need to separate the two issues. Any criticisms which I may now level are certainly not about reform, which is welcome, but about its implementation.
</p>

<a name="60327-20_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>I too have found no answers in the Statement, but perhaps I did not expect to find any at this stage. If there had been anything more positive to say, the Government would have come forward with their own Statement rather than respond to a Question. However, a number of questions arise now. The first question for farmers who are in really desperate circumstances must continue to be whether the Minister has a more definite timetable in mind. In particular, in answer to a Written Question, it was said that claims would be processed randomly according to the order in which they came in. Has the position changed, and will they be processed in a more orderly way?
</p>

<a name="60327-20_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>Secondly, the RPA is responsible for nearly &#163;3 billion of payments&#151;&#163;2.9 billion, I think&#151;and it costs &#163;249 million a year to run. Defra has an RPA ownership board and an RPA executive review group, both of which I believe are chaired by a senior Defra official and both of which I presume report regularly to Ministers. How was it that these groups did not spot the problem earlier? I have gone back through all the Written Questions and Answers and the problem clearly arose well before it became apparent to farmers that they were really going to suffer.
</p>

<a name="60327-20_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>I presume that the Government are maintaining their position on not paying interest because they do not feel that it is appropriate. I note their reason for saying that, which is that the payment window runs until 30 June.

<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>According to an Answer given to my honourable friend Dr Cable in another place, the number of people employed by the RPA decreased by almost 500 between March 2005 and February 2006. If the RPA was to undertake such enormous changes and it could have foreseen the amount of work that would result, why did it choose that time to cut staff, just when it was so busy? Did the number of RPA vacancies increase substantially during the period of the problem? In other words, how many vacancies is the RPA suffering from?
</p>

<a name="60327-20_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>Farmers are, of course, in the front line and are having enormous difficulties. Nevertheless, as we learnt from foot and mouth, what critically affects farmers also affects the whole of the wider rural economy. I think we will want to return to that in the debate on Thursday.

One of the initial steps that the new RPA chief executive suggested to us last week, and which we have taken up, was that we should focus more resources in the RPA on making the 2005 payments as fast as is legally possible. The RPA is a large organisation, as we have heard; it has centres all over the country. A lot of resources have already been applied to payment of the subsidy. He is suggesting that more resources should be applied to them from within the RPA. We agree with him.
</p>

<a name="60327-20_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>At the very last stage before payment it was necessary for there to be six different authorisation processes before payments could be sent. The new chief executive suggested that that number could be decreased to two. That has been implemented at once.
</p>

<a name="60327-20_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>As for whether we will have more information by the time of our debate on Thursday&#151;I believe that the other place also is debating this issue, on Wednesday&#151;the new chief executive is coming forward later this week to the Secretary of State and me with other proposals. He has, after all, been in position for a total of only 11 days. I hope we will be able to say something about his proposals in those debates, but I cannot guarantee that.
</p>

<a name="60327-20_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>The noble Baroness asked about the 15 May deadline for farmers to apply under the 2006 scheme. The 2006 scheme literature, including sample forms, is already on the RPA website. Forms pre-populated with data will be distributed shortly. Of course we appreciate that some farmers would wish to have additional certainty on the detail of their entitlements before submitting a claim for next year, but we can see little chance of amending the deadlines which are set in <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_159"></a>
<a name="60327-20_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Neill of Bladen: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister give way?
</p>




<p><a name="st_160"></a>
<a name="60327-20_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   No, my Lords, I think I am obliged first to answer questions from the Front Benches. I will of course answer other questions in due course.
</p>

<a name="60327-20_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>Of course the delays are causing real hardship. We appreciate that very much, which is why we were so disappointed not to receive until 14 March of this year the advice which first told us that these payments would not be met in bulk by the end of March. The advice we have received from the banks so far is that they are not seeing any change in the number of farm business failures and that no otherwise viable business is likely to fail as a result of the timing of payments. On Thursday I will be seeing the banks; I saw them last December; and, in answer to the noble Baroness, I am also seeing the suppliers AIC later this week.
</p>

<a name="60327-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>The noble Baroness asked about who we are focusing on. In practice we are giving priority to those who received payments under the old CAP schemes, which the single payment scheme has replaced. They are the ones for whom cash flow may be an issue, as their annual income is traditionally supplemented by a CAP payment by this time of year. New applicants in 2005&#151;there are many of those&#151;generally have much smaller payments due. These are people who did not apply under the old schemes but who are applying under the new scheme because it is based on land rather than on production.
</p>

<a name="60327-20_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>As to the noble Baroness&#039;s comments about the Secretary of State and myself, we take our responsibilities extremely seriously and I think her remarks were a little cheap.
</p>

<a name="60327-20_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>In response to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, I have already mentioned that we are focusing on those for whom cash flow may be a really important issue. We accept that there are a number of those.
</p>

<a name="60327-20_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>I was asked about a more definite timetable. I want to be cautious. In the past there has probably been too much easy forecasting and not enough solid fact. Until we get the next advice from the new chief executive, I am not prepared to make forecasts about future payments. I can tell the House how much has been paid to date, and at my weekly meetings with the NFU, CLA and the TFA we will regularly let them know what the weekly figures are as they advance. In the past week &#163;60 million of claims were met and in the three and a half weeks before last week &#163;75 million of claims were met. So there was a considerable improvement during the course of the past week.
</p>

<a name="60327-20_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, will know that a further review is to start immediately to ensure that we get some results in time to affect next year&#039;s scheme. We will not allow the remainder of the review to interfere in any way with what we need to do to get the 2005 payments out, which is the absolute essential and our first priority. This review will involve a team of <br>&nbsp;<br>

consultants and will focus on getting all the processes right, especially for next year. It is essential that we have a good look at how the RPA works and how it is run. It is a big organisation and that is what the Hunter review will do.
</p>

<a name="60327-20_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>The precise details of the RPA&#039;s actions are for the new chief executive to firm up. We are focusing resources&#151;a priority for medium-sized claims&#151;to maximise the value of the payments, not the actual number of claimants. With regard to disproportionate checks, some did turn out to be either duplicated or of very little value. As I have told the House already, four out of six checks at the payment stage have now been dropped. The noble Baroness asked about RPA staffing. I shall write to her or answer her if she raises these matters in the debate on Thursday.

I am very surprised by that statement. Is he not aware that, as many as four years ago, warnings were given in the other place about exactly this eventuality arising, not only in the Chamber during the passage of legislation but also in Select Committee? How is it that, four years on, the noble Lord claims that he was surprised by this new knowledge?

<a name="60327-21_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, it was the noble Baroness&#039;s government who set up the introduction of arm&#039;s-length delivery agencies as one of the major Civil Service reforms of the 1980s. The RPA is precisely one of those arm&#039;s-length delivery agencies&#151;even though it may have been created well after that time, we are dealing with such an agency. This agency&#039;s job is to pay out these sums. It is for Ministers to get advice from such agencies and to take action accordingly. All the advice we had from the agency up until Tuesday evening of 14 March was that the bulk of payments would be made by the end of March. Earlier advice from the agency was that we would begin payments in February. That advice was right; we did begin payments of the single payment subsidy on 20 February. The advice on bulk payments was wrong. Ministers first heard about it on 14 March.

<a name="60327-21_spnew1"></a><b> Viscount Bledisloe: </b>   My Lords, I declare an interest as a farmer who is awaiting this money with ever-increasing impatience and ever-diminishing faith. I thank the Minister for the frankness of his Statement. I am pleased to see that a head has rolled. However, I very much hope that no real question will arise of the noble Lord&#039;s departure. I am sure that nobody in the farming community would want to lose a Minister who both listens and cares, and I hope that the noble Lord and his colleagues will take that to heart.
</p>

<a name="60327-21_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>Does the Minister recognise that these payments are vital to the vast majority of farmers, who are attempting to live on the proceeds of farming and that these delays create intolerable burdens?

burdens and problems. He has not yet answered the questions about interest or compensation. What is the position on that? If a farmer is late with his taxes, he is charged interest. Will the Government treat the tax-paying farmer equally and pay proper interest and, where appropriate, compensation for this inexcusable delay?
</p>




<p><a name="st_164"></a>
<a name="60327-21_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Viscount for his kind remarks; I very much appreciate them. I accept the premise of what he says: this is a serious state of affairs for many farmers. That is why we regret so much that this has happened. I am afraid that I cannot offer to pay compensation. The issue of compensation does not arise, as the EU regulations governing the scheme provide for a payment window&#151;as I think noble Lords know&#151;until 30 June. It is not the end of March yet. Farmers have been aware for more than 12 months that payments would not be made until February 2006.
</p>




<p><a name="st_165"></a>
<a name="60327-21_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Monro of Langholm: </b>   My Lords, I am sad to say it, but this must be one of the most disgraceful Statements ever heard on agriculture in either House. How does the Minister expect farmers to continue to survive when there has been a failure to make their basic payments by the end of March? Maybe not April, maybe not May. I declare an interest as a Scottish farmer. I was paid in January. If Scotland and Wales can do it, why on earth can&#039;t England? What were Ministers doing in November, December, January, February and March? Were they actually checking that the cheques were going out? Were they making any effort to see that the crucial payments to farmers were made? They have left agriculture in a parlous state, grossly short of cash that they should have received in this financial year&#151;probably ending on 5 April&#151;and apparently, from what the Minister has said, with very little hope of payment in the next few weeks.

<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>Our objective for the use of this sizeable sum of public money&#151;some &#163;1.6 billion a year&#151;is to promote a truly sustainable English agriculture industry; in other words, the subsidies paid to farmers for years and years on the basis of production alone constituted a system that should have disappeared a long time ago, if we were to have a properly sustainable farming sector in this country. So I make no apology for our adoption of these measures as a result of the latest CAP reforms. I wish that the noble Lord&#039;s government had done something to modernise farming in any way at all while they were in power.

<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>The system we are using in England is different from the model used in Scotland and Wales. They base their payments on an historic basis alone. In accordance with our hope of achieving a sustainable farming sector, we have a mixed historic and flat-rate system. Indeed, there are rumbles in EU countries that have adopted the historic system alone that they are beginning to wish that they too had a mixed system in place.

<p><a name="st_169"></a>
<a name="60327-21_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Neill of Bladen: </b>   My Lords, I declare an interest as one of many thousands of farmers who remain unpaid. For me, the two most startling points in the Statement were the late discovery that the level of chaos in the RPA was such that not until 14 March did it reveal to the Government that it could not comply with the promise, made on many occasions, that the bulk of the payments would be through by the end of March. That is completely extraordinary. The other matter of dismay to the country is that the Minister is not in a position today to give any forecast of when these payments will be made. I accept the integrity of the position he takes: he is not giving us a false forecast. But it is a very desperate position when a Minister cannot say that, &quot;at least by the end of April&quot; or &quot;by the end of May&quot;, the payments would all be through the machine. He cannot even say that, which is deplorable.
</p>




<p><a name="st_170"></a>

I share completely what the noble Lord has said about that. I regret that, although I would love to do so, I cannot give the House a date by which all the payments will be made. Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to be able to do so from the Dispatch Box today. However, that would be irresponsible of me. We have put the new chief executive in place and, in his first report to the Secretary of State and me last week he said that he wanted more time before he could make a judgment on that crucial figure.

<a name="60327-21_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Cavendish of Furness: </b>   My Lords, I also declare an interest as a hopeful farmer. The Minister spoke of farmers with cash-flow problems. Surely he is aware that all farmers rely entirely on positive cash flow. Is he further aware of the extraordinary distress caused to my neighbours in Cumbria? I know that the noble Lord is sensitive to criticism, but will he look at the Statement again and accept that its language suggests total indifference to all of us who work in the countryside?

I was born there and my title is of Reading. I am a little disappointed that the Minister has not yet answered my noble friend Lady Mar&#039;s question about the computer crash. Will he take up the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Carter, about an interim payment? In Scotland I have already had 81.9 per cent&#151;a magical percentage&#151;of my single farm payment, but an interim payment would ease the burden of hardship on an enormous number of farmers. Even 50 per cent would be something. One must not forget that, particularly with the very wet spring that we have had, most farmers are at least a month behind in their cultivations, which means that harvest will be a month late and payments for arable farmers&#039; harvests will be in turn a further month behind.

It is a matter of immense sorrow. However, does the Minister accept that responsibility for this difficulty really lies not with the agency&#151;the idea for which might have originated under a Conservative government&#151;but with the people who took the decision to put the system in place and required the agency to implement it?

<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>I cannot rehearse to your Lordships the terrible experience of the peoples of what is now the DRC, subjected successively to the kleptocracy of King Leopold, to life as a Belgian colony, to 30 years of the vicious, west-supported dictatorship of Mobutu, and then to the appalling history of the past 10 years or so in which well over 3 million people have been killed or have died of disease or as refugees, and millions more have been&#151;to use a euphemism&#151;displaced. Nor can I paint more than a sweepingly general picture of the DRC&#039;s situation today.
</p>

<a name="60327-22_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>There is hardly a hint of a footprint of government, national or regional, in terms of services to the people across that vast country&#151;larger than western Europe&#151;anywhere after three years of the Transitional National Government; and this notwithstanding the constant advisory engagement with them of the committee of the ambassadors, the UK&#039;s prominent among them, of those states most engaged with aid and technical assistance.
</p>

<a name="60327-22_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>The DRC has the largest currently deployed UN Force, MONUC, with some 17,000 personnel. MONUC&#039;s mandate is to disarm, demobilise, resettle or repatriate the bewildering number of armed groups, to integrate some of them into a new national army and to train it, and to assist this force to defend local people and to combat those who refuse to come out of the forests. But in many parts of the vast country militias continue to fight each other, the national army&#151;which is as yet far from a reliable or disciplined force&#151;or MONUC; whether for minerals, or for territory, or as proxies for neighbouring states that arm them, to settle tribal scores, or simply to survive.
</p>

<a name="60327-22_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>Many hundreds of thousands of people have been freshly displaced this year both in the south and all up the east side of the country. That implies constant <br>&nbsp;<br>

further attrition of the sparse and fragile provision, largely by the churches, of schools and health clinics. I doubt whether more people are killed each day in Iraq than in the DRC. The first appearance before the International Criminal Court in The Hague at the end of last week of a Congolese indicted for war crimes is a most important step; but there are many others much more prominent, and with as much if not more blood on their hands, than Thomas Lubanga; and it is vital that MONUC and Congolese forces work at bringing them too to justice.
</p>

<a name="60327-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>Elections of a president and of a legislature, which will bring into effect a new constitution, should take place by the end of June: an immensely complex task for the Independent Electoral Commission which is very substantially supported by the EU. But on the closing date last week for the registration of candidates, two of the four chief protagonists were not among the four who had registered as candidates for the presidency; and there were many fewer candidates registered for election to the legislature than there are seats in it. The latter may be down to difficulties with communications and travel&#151;both, as I know at first hand, are extremely difficult&#151;but the former, much more seriously, shows that some individuals and parties are still jockeying for position and are dangerously suspicious of the electoral process and of each other. The commission has extended the registration period until 2 April.
</p>

<a name="60327-22_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>It is most welcome that in these circumstances the UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, spent three days last week in the DRC. According to reports he saw everyone he could usefully see, both privately and publicly, and in Kisangani as well as in Kinshasa; he said clearly and toughly to the politicians that the elections had to take place and that they owed it to the people to ensure that they did and to abide by the results; and he committed himself to the continued presence of MONUC after the elections because it still has so much to do.
</p>

<a name="60327-22_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>I welcome too the Council of the EU&#039;s decision on Thursday to deploy a German-led EU force to support MONUC through the period of the elections. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us that there will be some British participation in that deployment and that our ambassador in Kinshasa, with whom I had a stimulating meeting there last summer, is doing all he can to follow up and to reinforce the persuasive activity of the Secretary-General.
</p>

<a name="60327-22_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>Looking ahead to the period after the elections and supposing for a moment that they yield a clear result and one that is largely accepted, I hope that the Minister will reassure the House about the intentions of the UK, with its EU and Security Council colleagues. How are we planning to support and encourage the new Government in approaching the unimaginably large agenda that will face it? The scale of the issues it will face is simply unimaginable.
</p>

<a name="60327-22_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>Specifically and briefly, will we recognise, and hold partners to recognise, that this is the beginning of a long haul and that there must be no disengagement from support for the DRC and collaboration, to the <br>&nbsp;<br>

greatest possible extent, with its government? Will we try to continue the mission of the committee of ambassadors under another guise? Will we&#151;this is a critical point&#151;encourage the new president, whoever he is, to be as inclusive as possible of the losers in the election in his government? Will we support at the UN the continuation of MONUC and the further development of its mandate and play our part in the still necessary struggle to control the inflow of arms into the DRC? Will we encourage international and DRC support for the further development into the DRC of the International Criminal Court process, with an eye especially on General Laurent Nkunda among those still to be hunted down and brought to justice?
</p>

<a name="60327-22_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>Will we put much more effort and resources, with UN and EU partners, into assisting the DRC to gain control for its people&#039;s sake of its vast mineral resources and to police what is still at present their largely criminal exploitation? Will we take appropriate action both against neighbouring states and their nationals and against first-world companies and individuals, Britons among them? Will we try to ensure that the peoples of the DRC, longing for security and peace after 130 years or so of horror, see some real &quot;democracy dividend&quot; from these elections&#151;and soon?
</p>

<a name="60327-22_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>Lastly&#151;and I do not expect more from the Minister in response to this question than an assurance, but let it be copper-bottomed, that the Government and their partners have contingency plans in place: what if the DRC, in these next months, should after all fall back&#151;as it only too possibly may&#151;into large-scale regional conflict and devastation, which could have&#151;no, would have&#151;very serious effects indeed more widely across the region?
</p>

<a name="60327-22_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>I look forward very much to other speeches and to the Minister&#039;s response.

<a name="60327-23_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Giddens: </b>   My Lords, I congratulate the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester on initiating this debate. He does not have many takers for this debate, which I think is a bit disturbing.
</p>

<a name="60327-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>The Cold War was not very aptly named. A Cold War it might have been for us in the developed countries, but it was a hot war for much of the rest of the world. The main powers fought out their war by proxy, as it were, in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Central and South America, the Middle East and Africa, and Africa, of course, suffered especially. Once the Cold War was over, the erstwhile superpowers disengaged from the areas that they had fought over, where they had often supplied rival sides in civil wars. Zaire, as it then was, is a clear case in point where the US lost interest after having supported Mabuto against Soviet-backed Angola.
</p>

<a name="60327-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>The five years war, which has been called Africa&#039;s world war, came out of this, involving troops from a diversity of countries. No one knows how many people died in that war but the estimates range <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_614"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 614</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

from 2.5 million minimum to over 4 million maximum. We know that there was massive loss of life in northern and eastern Congo especially, which went almost unnoticed by the rest of the world at the time. It is said to be the equivalent of an Asian tsunami every six months. We know that more than 1,000 people&#151;maybe many more than 1,000 people&#151;are dying every day. Hilary Benn, when he went there, called this the forgotten crisis. I am not sure that you can call it the forgotten crisis any longer when so many people have now said that it is the forgotten crisis and we have a large number of United Nations troops there.
</p>

<a name="60327-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>Steve Crawshaw, the London director of Human Rights Watch, visited the small town of Nyakunde in north-eastern Congo and produced a moving account of what happened during the war. He states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;C&#039;&#233;tait beau ici&quot;, says a Congolese, on entering the little town of Nyakunde. It is easy to see how the town might indeed once have been beautiful. The town nestles amidst soft green hills. Banana trees and oil palms, acacia and eucalyptus grow in profusion&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>But this is a place of ghosts. The document continues:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>&quot;The events of Nyakunde were horrific even by the standards of the Congolese war. The killing spree began on 5 September 2002. From the hills above the town, militias descended on Nyakunde. The attack lasted for 10 days, including a door-to-door operation which the militias called Operation Polio&#151;mass murder as social vaccination. The hospital was a particular target for looting, burning and slaughter . . . At least 1,200 people were murdered during those days. Most in Nyakunde believe the numbers of dead to be closer to 3,000  . . . With insane courage, somebody in the hospital sent an e-mail, even as the killings were still under way. The e-mail was headed &#039;Nyakunde&#151;on fire and in blood&#039;. Church groups forwarded the message to the United Nations mission in Congo. The UN did not respond&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>Other observers have noted that nearly one in two militiamen fighting in Ituri Province was under 18. Ironically, the hospital, which was previously one of the best developed hospitals in the country, is now home to some 300 former child soldiers, of which a contemporary description goes,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>&quot;dressed in anything from rags to camouflage t-shirts and fake Versace gear&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>To this very disturbing scenario we can add the fact, reported just this month, that over 200 chickens and ducks in the country are suspected of dying of avian flu. Some 100 chickens died in a single day in Tshikapa, a south-central province and there seem to be migratory birds among the dead. As someone who has spoken in this Chamber about the dangers of avian flu, I find this a very worrying situation.
</p>

<a name="60327-23_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>Africa is fighting back against its misfortunes. It used to be said that you could not have democracy in poorer countries, especially countries recovering from civil war or strife, but the recent history of Africa shows that that is not so. There are a number of emerging democracies in Africa, some in very poor countries and some in countries that have been the sites of civil war. As the right reverend Prelate said, there are at least two very good signs in the DRC. First, a coalition is setting up elections, even though those elections seem to be continually being put back a little. Some 7,000 UN troops are there to help and, as the right reverend Prelate said, a force of EU troops is due to be introduced. Indeed, some are already <br>&nbsp;<br>

there. Kofi Annan, during his visit, said that there are major logistical problems, if not nightmares, in carrying out the elections. There is no road or railway running across the country. One can see the force of the Secretary-General&#039;s observation. The second important development, which was already mentioned, is the decision of the ICC to announce the first arrest warrant against Thomas Lubanga. He was the leader of an armed group charged with war crimes and the recruitment of child soldiers. He seems to have been operating near the town of Nyakunde.
</p>

<a name="60327-23_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>The Government are to be congratulated on their response to the continuing crisis in the country. They have given &#163;60 million for reconstruction. The UN is calling on donors to provide some &#163;400 million for the action plan for the DRC. The UK is the second largest bilateral donor to the country and the largest donor to the election preparations, and with the visits of Ministers and others to the country, we have taken a direct interest in its likely fate.
</p>

<a name="60327-23_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>There are a few questions that I would like the Minister to consider; no doubt they will overlap with other questions asked by other contributors to the debate. First, will he update us on avian flu in that country? We know that the more common avian flu becomes, the more dangerous it is not only to the country where it develops but to the rest of the world. The biggest danger with avian flu is that it is no longer passed not just from birds to humans but that the virus mutates so that it can be passed from human to human, and the more common it is in passing from birds to humans the more likely it is that a pandemic could emerge.
</p>

<a name="60327-23_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>What are the Minister&#039;s comments on the possibility that the elections can be free and fair in such a situation, given the obstacles that have been mentioned? Thirdly, will the Government give further support to the ICC for more action in the country, as the right reverend Prelate said? It is only a beginning in chasing down the war criminals. Finally, what plans are there for economic regeneration? The Government have made some contributions; economic regeneration is possible. War-torn countries can recover, but the country is suffering from the curse of plenty. It is one of the richest countries in Africa in terms of minerals, but as we know from so many other countries around the world, that is not necessarily a basis for easy economic development. One of the problems of the DRC is that those resources are now to a large degree in the hands of warlords or criminal groups. It will be important to turn that situation around.

<a name="60327-23_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Alton of Liverpool: </b>   My Lords, the House is greatly indebted to the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester for providing us with this rare and welcome opportunity to debate the catastrophic situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo. I wholeheartedly endorse the remarks that he made earlier.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_616"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 616</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60327-23_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>Imagine for a moment that we woke up tomorrow and read a newspaper headline that told us that the whole of the population of the Republic of Ireland had been wiped out. Presumably, we would be shocked into disbelief. In the case of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the equivalent is exactly what has happened&#151;4 million people have died over just 10 years. That is the biggest loss of life in any single conflict since the Second World War. Together with the loss of life in Sudan, Darfur, Rwanda and Uganda, it totals a staggering 7 million lives lost. This is Africa&#039;s Great War, and until it ends it is impossible to see how development or human progress can be properly sustained.
</p>

<a name="60327-23_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>Over a recent, brief, comparable period, twice as many people died in the Congo than in conflicts in the Middle East, yet lives in the Congo hardly rate a column inch, let alone a television report. That begs the question&#151;why do we seem to attach so little relative importance to a life lost in the Congo compared with the loss of a life elsewhere in the world?
</p>

<a name="60327-23_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>For all the proper political interest in Africa during 2005, little was done to stabilise the Congo. When the Prime Minister appeared before a parliamentary committee a few weeks ago, it was significant that in two and a half hours of exchanges Africa was not mentioned once. Notwithstanding what the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, said about our welcome contribution to reconstruction in the Congo, it is depressing how quickly political issues move on&#151;although the Minister has shown consistent and real commitment to the continent.
</p>

<a name="60327-23_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>Just over a year ago, under the auspices of the charity Jubilee Action, along with Canon Anthony Harvey, Sam Burke and Raphael Mpanzu, I travelled to the DRC and compiled a report on the devastating consequences of the continuing violence there&#151;the report is published on the Jubilee Action website. On return, a small charity to help Congo&#039;s street children, the Jedidiah project, was set up under Jubilee&#039;s auspices. The right reverend Prelate, the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, and I are among its patrons. One of the first initiatives was to help St. Martha&#039;s School in London to send a container of equipment to Kinshasa. That is a good example of how young people get on with making a difference when we who have so much political influence often seem so impotent. Perhaps they understand better than we do that, where there is constant attrition, other children are the greatest losers.
</p>

<a name="60327-23_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>I attended a recent meeting of the All-Party Group on Street Children, where it was said that 40,000 children are now living on the streets of the country&#039;s capital, Kinshasa, with 6,000 more in Lubumbashi, 7,000 in Kananga, 7,000 in Bukavu and 2,000 in Goma. This crisis has been brought about by the continuing conflict in the east and north-east of the country, by the spread of AIDS, by poverty and by a negative view of orphaned children. The crisis has even spilled over into the inner cities and suburbs of Britain, with evidence emerging, thanks mainly to the BBC, of children being trafficked into Britain and some being branded as &quot;witch children&quot; and used in <br>&nbsp;<br>

sordid rituals, including dismemberment. The torso of one child believed to have been killed in some such ritual was retrieved from the River Thames; the child is believed to have originated in the Congo.
</p>

<a name="60327-23_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>Inside the DRC, children have become cannon fodder for the rival armed insurgents. As many as 300,000 children have been recruited into the competing militias, and the demobilisation process and subsequent reintegration into society have proved to be a painstakingly slow business. UNICEF told me that in broad terms about 30,000 children are still under arms and comprise about 10 per cent of the armed groups. Despite the demobilisation programme, it said,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;both recruitment and re-recruitment is continuing&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-23_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>Children as young as seven carry arms. I cannot adequately emphasise the importance of ending the traffic in small arms from neighbouring states, which is in breach of UN Security Council Resolution 1493.
</p>

<a name="60327-23_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>Amnesty International reported in December 2003 that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>&quot;all armed forces in the DRC&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-23_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>had used children as soldiers. In the east of the country, children have comprised as much as 40 per cent of the militias. Some were sent into combat, and some were used as sex slaves. In the light of the graphic comments, I make it clear that this is a direct quotation from Amnesty&#039;s report:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>&quot;Some were forced to kill their own families; others were made to engage in cannibalistic or sexual acts with enemy corpses. Girl soldiers were raped and some died as a result&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-23_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>Sexual violence has often been accompanied by subsequent HIV/AIDS. In January 2004, Human Rights Watch confirmed those reports. The noble Lord, Lord Giddens, has already referred to that. I quote from the report:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>&quot;All groups have recruited children, some as young as seven years old, for military service, subjecting the children to the risks and trauma of military operations&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-23_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>UNICEF told me that, as well as being used as combatants, children have routinely been used to clean and carry guns and to collect and prepare food and camps for combatants.
</p>

<a name="60327-23_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>Organisations such as War Child, Jubilee Action and the Princess Diana Memorial Fund have all identified this as the world&#039;s worst humanitarian disaster and have committed themselves to highlighting the plight of Congo&#039;s children and to offering some practical small-scale help. They need our full support. When War Child gave evidence to the all-party group, it told the story of a boy called Jacques whose mother and father were used as human shields and burnt alive. He is now on the streets in Bunia. It also told the story of Jean, aged 12, who fled Bosinga after bombardment by rebel militia. Her mother and father were both killed and she fled to Gbadolife, over 100 miles away, where she is now living on the streets.
</p>

<a name="60327-23_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>So what can we do? Governments such as our own can insist that the declarations in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child are put into <br>&nbsp;<br>

effect. Likewise, the International Crisis Group&#039;s Congo action plan needs urgent implementation. We should be working with other players in the international community to exert real pressure.
</p>

<a name="60327-23_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>Undoubtedly, Congo graphically illustrates what happens when a state fails and is disfigured by corruption and conflict. This is not some small sideshow. The DRC is the third largest county in Africa and the fourth most populous. Per capita income is just $107. Paradoxically, a country that is rich in minerals and natural wealth, and which should be able to sustain itself and its people, has suffered grievously as a consequence of its own natural riches&#151;which everyone, from colonial rulers to voracious neighbours and corrupt rulers, has sought to acquire for themselves. As a result, Congo has been benighted by exploitative rule and by callous and corrupt leadership.
</p>

<a name="60327-23_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>During my visit, I heard many allegations that, to this day, with the complicity of western governments, European quartermasters continue to fuel the conflict through the sale of weapons. The country&#039;s Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, Professor Mbwinga Bila, told me that, as a consequence of the long corrupt and rapacious rule of President Mobutu and the almost incessant armed violence since decolonisation,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>&quot;the decaying infrastructure we have today is the one we inherited at the moment of independence. In fact, we have even less now than we had then. The only change is that in 1960 the infrastructure supported a population of 14 million and today the population is closer to 60 million. We have had 35 years of bad government followed by 10 years of armed conflict&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-23_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>I visited a hospital and a school in Kinshasa. In the hospital, I saw a premature baby unit, where there were nine incubators&#151;only two of them worked. I learnt subsequently that the children in the non-functioning incubators died. I also visited a school, Mbenseke Futi, situated about 50 kilometres from the centre of Kinshasa. There are about 300 children in the school, including 50 street children. The headmaster showed me decaying buildings, including a wing that had been storm damaged in 1991. Food was being prepared over open fires. Teachers had not been paid in months. There was nothing to treat the malaria that affected all of the children. The sleeping conditions&#151;wooden slats on bunks in filthy dormitories&#151;were an absolute disgrace. When I asked him about this, Minister Bila said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>&quot;In our schools, books don&#039;t exist, parents have to pay and the buildings are in ruins&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-23_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>He was quite emphatic. He said that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a>&quot;the real problem is the war. It has destroyed the infrastructure&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-23_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>Surely that must be our starting point in tackling the conflict in that country. When the Minister comes to reply, I hope that he will be able to tell us what action is being taken to bring about the end of this conflict and what more we can do to accelerate the demobilisation, reintegration, protection and education of the children&#151;especially those under arms, the street children and the so-called &quot;witch children&quot;. I hope that he will say what leverage we are exerting on Rwanda to end all military involvement in Congo, and to actively collaborate with the DRC, <br>&nbsp;<br>

starting with the exchange of ambassadors. I raised that issue directly with the Rwandan President Paul Kagame when I subsequently visited Kigali; it is a small thing, but it would be an important step forward, as would working with the DRC and with MONUC&#151;as the right reverend Prelate mentioned earlier&#151;in disarming the militias. I hope that the Minister will say what we are doing, along with other western governments, to hunt down and prosecute the arms dealers I mentioned, and those benefiting from involvement in Congo&#039;s conflicts. What measures are we taking to help to build up agencies involved in conflict resolution, reconciliation, human rights advocacy, and the training of judges, magistrates and police officers?
</p>

<a name="60327-23_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>I could have returned from my visit to the DRC deeply depressed, but these are not insuperable or insurmountable challenges. By helping to heal this wound at the very heart of Africa, and by driving out corruption and conflict, we will be creating a climate in which real development can occur. If, however, as our first priority, we do not solve those issues, everything else that we try to achieve&#151;including elections&#151;will be in vain.

<p><a name="st_190"></a>
<a name="60327-24_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, the right reverend Prelate has drawn our attention to the desperately bleak history of the DRC. The noble Lord, Lord Alton, has just spoken about the horrible present. We might feel depressed as we consider what the United Kingdom can do, if it were not for the fact that, as the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, has told us, this is not a forgotten country.
</p>

<a name="60327-24_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>Things are happening there. In particular, working towards the elections on June 18 is the biggest and most costly exercise of this kind ever undertaken by the United Nations. If they contribute towards a peaceful and orderly environment, allowing the 460,000 refugees in neighbouring countries to return and the 1.3 million people displaced internally to be rehabilitated, it will be a rewarding investment for the international community. We welcome the decision by the European Union to comply with the request of the Secretary-General to provide additional troops for the election itself and the immediate post-election period&#151;though we do wonder whether such a small number of troops for such a short time can be more than just a token of moral support. Apparently, there will be only 400 to 450 EU troops in the DRC, with a further 800 to 1,000 on standby somewhere else. Is the UK providing any of these troops and, if so, how many and in what capacities?
</p>

<a name="60327-24_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>The European Council statement of 23 March says the 450 troops will be deployed in Kinshasa, with the other 1,000 somewhere &quot;over the horizon&quot;, outside the country. But any attempts to disrupt the elections, which the commander of the local UN force has said he will deal with proactively, are likely to be at the other end of the country, in the east. So what will the European Union troops be doing in Kinshasa? Who is going to pay for them? The Council statement seems to imply that it is the EU rather than the states <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_620"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 620</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

contributing to the force, which is fair; but the Minister said in the week before last that we are making a &#163;40 million contribution to MONUC. Presumably the EU contingent is not covered by MONUC&#039;s budget. Perhaps the Minister could enlighten us on that point.
</p>

<a name="60327-24_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>The European Council says that it will,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a>&quot;provide . . . support to MONUC&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>but surely this needs to be properly defined and amplified. The Minister&#039;s gloss was that the EU troops,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a>&quot;should be only for purposes that add value to the existing MONUC force on the ground&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 16/3/06; col. 1344.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-24_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>However, he then added that discussions were going on about what they might do, implying that no firm decisions had yet been made. Will the EU contingent come under the command of General Cammaert&#151;in which case, they can presumably be asked to do anything that comes within the mandate of MONUC? If not, do all requests for support on particular tasks or operations have to be routed via Brussels? Will the support include military action against armed factions such as the Mai Mai in Katanga; the FLDR, who are mostly former Interahamwe <i>genocidaires</i> from Rwanda, numbering 8,000 to 10,000 in North Kivu; and the LRA, now reported to be concentrating in Garamba National Park, where the leader Kony and his deputy Otti have now joined up?
</p>

<a name="60327-24_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, Mr Guehenno, said that MONUC had asked the Security Council for a complete brigade in northern Katanga, where the UN had so far had no presence. The Secretary-General also said that he made a request for an unspecified increase in the MONUC force but was refused by the Security Council. Did it make that decision on the grounds that troops were not needed in the province, or because it formed the view that no suitable member state or states would be willing to provide the extra troops? Did it ask the EU whether the 1,500 troops it is going to supply could be used in northern Katanga? It is now intended to redeploy a battalion from north Kivu, which means less protection for civilians in a province where the FLDR and, even more so, the Congolese army itself&#151;the FARDC&#151;are accused of dozens of atrocities every month. But the consequences of neglecting Katanga are even more serious.
</p>

<a name="60327-24_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>I understand that in the past six months 150,000 people have fled their homes, caught in between the Mai Mai and the undisciplined army. Earlier this month MONUC asked for the withdrawal of the 63rd Brigade, stationed in Mitwaba, which has been guilty of serious crimes against civilians. I hope that the noble Lord can assure me that those troops have now been replaced by MONUC forces.
</p>

<a name="60327-24_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>From all the reports made by the UN, the FARDC is responsible for infinitely more atrocities than any of the non-state armed groups, and surely it ought to be drastically reduced in size, dismissing soldiers who commit any acts of violence against civilians, and making sure that the core who remain are properly <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_621"></a>

trained, equipped and paid. The International Crisis Group says that reform of the army is far behind schedule, and it criticises the policy of demobilising militias and giving handouts to ex-combatants. Of the $2 billion spent on the DRC by the international community so far, only a small fraction has been used to improve the status and management of the armed forces and the police. We know something about this from our experience in Sierra Leone. If the UN adopts the cluster response principle being tested in Uganda, which we talked about a couple of weeks ago, could the United Kingdom perhaps volunteer to play the lead role in the security sector reform cluster in the DRC?
</p>

<a name="60327-24_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>In spite of all this, the security situation is better than it was a year ago, and the decision to postpone the elections turned out to be fully justified. There have been some hopeful signs&#151;notably the decision at the end of last week by the biggest armed group, RCD-Goma, to end its boycott of the peace process, and for its leader, Azaria Ruberwa, to stand as a candidate for the presidency. As the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, reminded us, the first trial has begun at the ICC of a prominent war criminal, Thomas Lubanga, who is accused of forcing nine year-olds to fight for his Union des Patriotes Congolais in blood-drenched Ituri. Other militia leaders from the same area are awaiting trial on charges of killing nine Bangladeshi peacekeepers in February last year.
</p>

<a name="60327-24_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>MONUC has captured Bosco Atubo, one of the LRA&#039;s senior commanders, in Garamba, and I hope that this means it is on the trail of Kony and Otti. It would be a major achievement if MONUC and the FARDC brought these evil men to justice, ending their reign of terror over large areas of Uganda, the DRC and south Sudan, boosting confidence in the elections and helping to promote amicable co-operation between the three neighbouring countries.
</p>

<a name="60327-24_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>In both south and north Kivu, thanks to MONUC, it was claimed that voter registration was carried out in almost every polling district before the December 2005 referendum, at which 25 million people voted. But the register was not perfect, and Etienne Tshisekedi has asked for it to be reopened, because he now accepts that there was massive support for the new constitution. Although the head of the Electoral Commission said there was no time, surely a supplementary list could be produced over the next 10 weeks to include not only Tshisekedi&#039;s UDPS supporters, but also the districts not covered, and the voters left off the register last October. If nominations can be extended, as the right reverend Prelate explained, why not registrations, too?
</p>

<a name="60327-24_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>Will the refugees and internal exiles be able to vote, and if so, have they been registered? Secondly, was the registration equally successful in the north, particularly in the areas of Ituri and Bunia, and in Katanga province in the south? People are still crossing Lake Albert into western Uganda, though not in large numbers, and clashes were reported with rebel forces south of Bunia only last Wednesday. It would be good to have some reassurance about the stability of that area in the period leading up to the elections.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_622"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 622</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60327-24_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>But it is also time to begin thinking about the next stages. The Secretary-General has talked about the post-election challenges, which need the continuous assistance of the international community. The priorities that he mentions are the reform of the army and the police, and the establishment of state authority and the rule of law. To achieve these objectives we need to stay the course, recognising that it will take several years. But as the DRC starts to build effective and disciplined police and armed forces, MONUC will downsize, and its role will shift towards training.
</p>

<a name="60327-24_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>Correspondingly greater attention will need to be given to the question of how the vast mineral riches can be harnessed for the benefit of the people, and not for the foreign interests dealt with in the reports of the UN Panel on the Illegal Exploitation of Resources of the DRC. There is now a mining code, developed with the assistance of the World Bank, but it is not well enforced and has failed to attract large investors. Huge quantities of unprocessed minerals are smuggled across the borders into Zambia untaxed, losing state revenue. Foreign business interests and corrupt politicians have contributed to instability. Potentially, DRC is one of the richest countries in Africa. We must help the people not only to eliminate non-state armed groups and create a firm democratic foundation, but to establish control over their mineral resources so that they no longer need our help.

<a name="60327-25_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton: </b>   My Lords, I, too, add my congratulations to the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester on securing this debate. The issues covered are never far from the attention of your Lordships&#039; House or hearts in our many debates on Africa. But it is important and timely to be concentrating tonight on the Democratic Republic of Congo. On behalf of my noble friend Lady Rawlings, I apologise for her absence from this debate today.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>In preparing for this speech&#151;I have had to do a lot of preparation for tonight&#039;s debate because I knew very little about the DRC before I picked up this brief&#151;I have undertaken some grim reading, as the right reverend Prelate outlined, of a tragic history and the aftermath of an almost forgotten emergency at the heart of Africa. As so many of your Lordships have pointed out, more than 4 million people have died in the past four years alone in what the International Rescue Committee has called,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a>&quot;the most deadly conflict in terms of its impact on civilian population since the Second World War&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-25_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alton, reminded us of that.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>More than 100,000 people have been displaced, and the <i>Lancet</i> estimated in January this year that 38,000 people die every month. The noble Lord, Lord Giddens, described that graphically when he quoted Kofi Annan, saying,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a>&quot;if you look at the figures and the extent of the suffering cumulatively . . . you probably have a Tsunami in this country every six months, in terms of the dead and dying&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-25_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>Perhaps the most shocking description came from the noble Lord, Lord Alton.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_623"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 623</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60327-25_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>Outright civil war officially ended three years ago and the long awaited transitional Government have been in place since July 2003. They have brought a degree of stability to the DRC and have so far remained intact, despite reports of growing political tensions. However, factional conflicts continue, particularly in the east of the country.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>As noble Lords have highlighted, the human rights situation remains shocking. Indeed, it is one of the worst in Africa, with atrocities against civilians being committed daily&#151;none more so than in the Ituri district in the north-east of the DRC. Militia and foreign groups have taken part in rape, torture, cannibalism, forced labour, abduction of women and children and illegal detention. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office human rights report, among others, also highlights that there is evidence of internally displaced people being used as human shields. Meanwhile, poorly fed and unpaid Congolese soldiers often harass local populations, imposing illegal taxes, stealing and using sexual violence.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>I could not refer to the human rights situation without raising the plight of the women and children of this war torn region. More than four in every 10 children in the DRC die before their first birthday, around half of all children do not attend primary school, and in conflict-affected areas may have been recruited or abducted into armed groups and forces.

</p>

<a name="60327-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>In the east many children have become separated from their families by the conflict. The figures for this one region alone were 2,797 children in 2003 without family unity, physical security and protection. The breakdown in social structures increases the opportunities and potential for gender-based violence. Sexual exploitation, such as rape, is committed as a systematic weapon of war to deliberately humiliate and break community cohesion. Adolescent girls are often the most vulnerable and are put under enormous pressure to support themselves, particularly in refugee camps.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>The short-term reality of the situation is bad enough, but the consequences of gender-based violence can be long term and devastating. There is a marked decline in health due, among other things, to an increase in sexually transmitted diseases, in particular HIV/AIDS, forced and unwanted pregnancies, which can lead to dangerous termination practices, and a high maternal and infant mortality rate because of a lack of infrastructure and healthcare. The babies born as a result of rape often face a serious risk of being abandoned, and daughters can be ostracised from their communities owing to the shame of rape or becoming pregnant outside wedlock, which only further increases their vulnerability.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>These problems are not restricted to the DRC alone; it is a cross-border issue that also involves Rwandan children and Sudanese and Ugandan refugees. As the noble Lord, Lord Alton, highlighted, children, predominantly based in urban areas of the DRC, are also experiencing the horrifying phenomenon of being <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_624"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 624</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

accused of witchcraft. Many are institutionalised in childcare homes or revivalist churches, which, Save the Children reports, often leaves them open to abuse.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>I am sure the Minister shares my concerns regarding the plight of women and children in this region; I hope he will be able to tell us how the Government are helping to raise awareness of these issues at local and national level in the DRC. Promoting education and preparing children and families, who have witnessed and experienced so much, for reunification will be a vital and difficult task. Central to this task will be the charities and NGOs working tirelessly within the DRC.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>One of the more pleasant findings in my weekend research was the work of the Cambridge-based charity SOS Children. Fifteen years ago it opened the gates of a children&#039;s village, a school and a kindergarten in the troubled eastern province of South-Kivu, and in 1997, it established an emergency village in Uvira to house war orphans and abandoned children. Its work is truly unique when compared to other NGOs. It pioneered the first family-based approach to childcare through the creation of children&#039;s villages and is now the world&#039;s largest orphan charity, with every penny that it raises for a specific project going directly to that project, with nothing deducted for administration purposes.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>Sometimes it is these small grass-roots projects that make all the difference. I hope the Minister will be able to reassure your Lordships&#039; House that the Government will listen to organisations such as SOS Children and that mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, because their experience is worth everything.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>I have painted a bleak picture of life for just one section of society, but there is a dim light at the end of the tunnel. We on these Benches welcome the support that the UN, the EU and Her Majesty&#039;s Government are providing in terms of resources and advice. We must recognise the major logistical challenges of the election. Kofi Annan highlighted that the DRC is at a critical stage in its history. It is clear that there is still a very long way to go, but the success of the constitution referendum last year gives hope. If a stable enough environment can be maintained, then this could be a serious step to cementing the transition from bloody civil war to peace and democracy, and providing the people with much-needed accountability, justice and the chance to rebuild their lives. I echo the question posed by the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, on hoping for fairness in the forthcoming elections.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>The transitional government have been slow in key areas, particularly the integration of the army, police force, and promotion of the rule of law. As your Lordships have highlighted, it is imperative that security is brought to the entire population. Impunity has been a problem exacerbated by the decision of the Congolese authorities to promote militia leaders into senior army positions. Although the prosecution of Thomas Lubanga by the International Criminal Court for enlisting child soldiers, among other crimes, is a significant step forward, mobile tribunals are also <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_625"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 625</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

starting to provide some basic work in some of the more rural areas. I hope the Minister can further update us on progress on this issue and on what steps the Government are taking to help to promote the mind shift that is needed as the rule of law is reintroduced to a land that has seen only the rule of the powerful and the armed for so long.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>It is clear that there is still much to be done in a country where stability and peace are fragile at best. We will watch carefully how the DRC copes with the challenges ahead, such as the need for efficient control of natural resources, good management of state enterprises, a fully national development policy that excludes no region and restoration of state authority over the entire country. But get that right and it will help to foster peace, stability and reconsolidation throughout the Great Lakes region and, I hope, beyond. Recent debates on the Sudan and Uganda have emphasised how much this is needed. I am sure the Minister will reiterate the importance of communicating with the DRC&#039;s neighbours in the run-up to the elections. This passionate debate has emphasised your Lordships&#039; desire to see all the people of the DRC, particularly women and children, realise the future that has been denied them for so long.

<p><a name="st_192"></a>
<a name="60327-25_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  My Lords, I thank the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester for initiating an important debate. I also thank all noble Lords who have participated in the debate: the noble Lords, Lord Giddens, Lord Alton and Lord Avebury, and the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton. I am particularly grateful for the understanding that your Lordships&#039; House has shown of the complexity of the situation in the DRC, emphasised, a few moments ago, by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris. As the right reverend Prelate said at the beginning, this is a very long haul. We have discussed much detail this evening, but the broad issues are also important.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>This is a critical moment, not just for the Congolese, but for the future of Africa. The noble Lord, Lord Alton, asked whether we remain totally committed to Africa. I believe we are. He also wondered whether it is mentioned enough. I met with all the heads of our missions serving in Africa today to discuss this and other issues. We hope that the Congolese people, with help from the international community, will hold their first free and fair elections in June. I emphasise the point that each life in the DRC is as important as a life anywhere else and indeed each vote in the DRC in a democratic election is as important as a vote anywhere else. This could be the first genuinely accountable and democratic government. As the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, has just pointed out, tens of millions of people across the whole Great Lakes region would benefit. If they get it wrong, we could easily see a return to the horrific and tragic conflict of the past, which is still there in a somewhat subdued form&#151;a conflict that has plagued <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_626"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 626</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

this region for over a decade. So the stakes are very high. It is right to ask what we, the British Government, are doing to help to secure success.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>The breadth of discussion we have had this evening serves to underline the vast scale of the problem with which we are dealing. Let us see what those problems are. We are talking about a country of about 60 million people, the size of western Europe, without any real roads or infrastructure. The noble Lord, Lord Giddens, described it and some of the horrors that have taken place in parts of it. As the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, said, more than 4 million people have died as a direct result of the recent war in the DRC. Who knows, the numbers may be very much larger. That is 1,200 people every day dying from disease, malnutrition and through violence, over and above normal mortality rates. Over 80 per cent of the population live in abject poverty. The numbers of internally displaced people&#151;I do not much like the expression either&#151;are the highest anywhere in the world after Darfur and northern Uganda. Latest UN figures suggest that there are 150,000 displaced people in the north of Katanga Province alone and 1.5 million in the DRC overall. The war of course compounded the DRC&#039;s problems. It brought insecurity and instability across the country and it shattered the already collapsing infrastructure.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>These raw figures show just how important it is that we get the DRC right, to relieve the long-suffering Congolese population. A stable, secure and prosperous DRC will also lay the foundations for peace and economic development in the Great Lakes region. If we want Africa to do better and to thrive then the DRC has to survive and thrive.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>So, what are we doing? The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester and others asked that question. The United Kingdom is playing an increasingly influential role in the DRC. We are now the biggest bilateral European donor. This financial year we allocated &#163;55 million for programmes to consolidate the peace and support the elections. From our bilateral support, we have earmarked &#163;65 million for emergency humanitarian relief over the next two years. We are an important member of the CIAT&#151;the international mechanism based in Kinshasa which has supported the transitional process. Through the UN Security Council, we have secured what we believe is the right mandate for the UN forces on the ground. We are strong advocates at the Security Council. I was there last Monday and we were emphasising that MONUC&#039;s efforts to protect civilians and support elections is absolutely imperative. The European Commission is also making several hundred million euros are available each year: &#8364;149 million for the election process alone, constituting over half the total cost. Much more of the money is now going to EU police missions in Kinshasa: &#8364;1.6 million to the EU advisory and assistance mission for security reform; &#8364;205 million on priority areas in the fight against poverty, the cause of healthcare, capacity building throughout the transition to democracy and macroeconomic support; and &#8364;105 million on external debt alleviation. We believe that these steps, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_627"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 627</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

including the mandate for the MONUC forces to protect the investments are vital to allow it to respond robustly and flexibly, including in its requirement to protect civilians.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>As in other parts of the world, in the DRC the UK is a strong voice. We are calling for democratic and accountable government, with respect for human rights and the rule of law. The Congolese Government and non-governmental organisations listen to us. The Congolese population respects us and have paid generous tribute for the work that has been done. But, for all that, the challenge, as we have all said this evening, is immense.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>There are no democratic traditions in the Congo. The last real elections were in the 1960s, and they were not as real as any of us would expect here. Few people voted in those elections, and still fewer of them are alive today. But it is clear too that the Congolese people have a real desire to have their democratic voices heard. Amazingly, as we have heard this evening, 25 million people registered to vote in this huge country without roads, railways or any other tangible infrastructural links. We now need to ensure that those 25 million voters get to vote and have faith in the process that they are participating in and in the result that the process will deliver.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>We have been working with civil society and through NGOs on the ground, to encourage the Congolese to take greater ownership of the election process. My noble friend Lord Giddens and the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, have urged that on me this evening. I wholly support their view. We must ensure that these are fair elections, and our endeavours must go into ensuring that. We must encourage the people of the Congo to demand that the outcome is representative and credible&#151;it is not us on their behalf; it is theirs, and they must demand it for themselves.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>In our contacts with the politicians who are taking part in the elections, we have also stressed that the new government will need to be inclusive and representative&#151;another vital point made this evening. The government need to be accountable to the people who elected them; only then will they be truly legitimate in the eyes of the Congolese people and the international community.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>On top of delivering messages, we have put &#163;10 million into the UN trust fund to support the process and &#163;9 million into security directly around the elections, making us the largest bilateral donor to the election process.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>As recent news reports have made plain, political tensions remain very high&#151;they are possibly getting higher&#151;in the Congo. We have been playing&#151;I have had the opportunity myself to play&#151;an active part in mediating between the different political groupings to overcome the current political blockages, where some people are feeling somewhat excluded from the process. The next major challenge will be the elections themselves&#151;helping the Congolese to stick to their agreed timetable and to deliver a result which is credible&#151;and credible to the population as a whole. <br>&nbsp;<br>

Part of what we need to do, as my noble friend Lord Giddens said, is to ensure that as they look forward they see real hope of economic regeneration, making it all worthwhile.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>There have been significant changes since the war ended. There are commercial flights linking east to west and the national phone network is back in place&#151;I do not know whether it runs all the time, but I believe it is pretty good now compared with what it has been. We have seen an increase in international and multinational investment; roads which had previously been blocked or were insecure for other reasons, are open, and the River Congo has been opened up to commercial traffic. The United Kingdom&#039;s focus on economic regeneration lies in these areas so that the DRC can pull itself out from the collapse and the devastation it has experienced.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>The international community is focusing on rebuilding the DRC&#039;s roads, ports, and customs structures and on regenerating the old parastatal natural resource and mining companies. Private investment as well as donor assistance is needed to bring off all these changes. The International Monetary Fund in its most recent report shows how some of this work is now having an effect on poverty reduction. The growth facility, which has been uneven since mid-2004, is showing some signs of improvement. But there is obviously a great deal to be done. One thing that must be done is to overcome corruption in some of the things that have been got going again, in order to ensure that they deliver properly.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>Those will be among the biggest challenges the day after the election, but so will the &quot;winner takes all&quot; mentality, because it will not offer the inclusive and representative government that will make for long term stability, as the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester said. All key actors, whether they have won or lost in the elections, need to have a stake in the peace that will follow if we are successful, and in the new government. We have made these views clear to the key Congolese politicians and groups.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>Our aim in a democratically elected and accountable government will be to change the dire human rights situation in DRC, which, as the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, said, we also outlined in the FCO&#039;s annual report. But as we have heard in the House today, the situation remains one of the worst anywhere in the world. Foreign and Congolese militia groups and even the DRC&#039;s own forces are responsible for many of the abuses that take place. We have heard of the terrible incidents of rape, killing and pillage of entire villages, particularly in the east of the country. The plight of Congolese children accused of witchcraft must be of particular concern to us all, as the noble Lord, Lord Alton, said. I shall refer to the work that we are doing with the police and judiciary in that regard.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>As elections come closer, we are seeing a rise in rhetoric inciting ethnic hatred, which inhibits free expression in the election. We are trying to help to combat this. We are working on a programme to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_629"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 629</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

encourage journalists to retain independence and to report accurately during the election campaign. Those issues are reflected in all our dealings with the authorities in the DRC.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>The third pillar of our action, raised by the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, and the right reverend Prelate, has been action to bring to justice those carrying out abuses. It is always difficult to strike the right balance between peace and stability on one side and justice on the other. Last week, we saw a major step forward with the transfer of Thomas Lubanga to the International Criminal Court in The Hague. We shall continue to pursue war criminals, as we intend that MONUC will do so. The UK has been a strong supporter of the ICC, and it is our obligation. Thomas Lubanga&#039;s arrest and surrender sends a strong signal throughout the region that those who carry out human rights abuses will one day face justice. The ICC has far more to do. We shall assist it in doing so.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>In parallel to ICC action, we also need to help the Congolese strengthen their own justice system across the board. There is fundamental work involving prisons, police, the judiciary and a neutral supreme court. Good progress is being made on reforming and retraining the police, which the UK has supported. We have an EU police training and mentoring mission (EUPol), which the Congolese have welcomed. The UK is involved in a programme to train judges to run mobile courts in some of the provinces across the DRC. It means that many more in local communities will have access to justice that is consistent with proper, national standards. That has begun to replace the arbitrary justice meted out throughout the war. But there is still a long way to go. With our help, we believe that we can make the changes. I do not know whether we can change minds. Mind-shift is always difficult. But the practicalities may be the basis for changing people&#039;s minds.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>MONUC has been described to your Lordships. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked about MONUC forces. No decisions have yet been reached within the EU on the precise number or deployment, although discussions continue on those fronts. The internal discussion so far, and consultations with the Congolese and UN, suggest that the force will comprise a pre-deployment of 400 troops in Kinshasa with the remainder, as the noble Lord said, over the horizon on standby. The aim at this stage is to retain as much flexibility as possible. Kinshasa can be a very combustible town. If it is in a reasonably good state, the prospects of other people being deployed elsewhere become correspondingly higher. The EU forces will not come under the command of MONUC or its commander in the east.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>We shall continue to look at the cluster principle being deployed in Uganda. However, as I said in the case of Uganda, it is very early to know whether it is yet fully working. We are playing a leading role in security sector reform in the DRC. EUSEC, the EU&#039;s mission, is playing the co-ordinating role for international community support for security efforts. We have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_630"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column 630</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

experts in this mission. We also have experts supporting the European and MONUC missions, although we do not have troops on the ground.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>The vote lists are now closed. The logistics are too difficult to get the systems at this stage up and running outside the DRC. We are satisfied with the registration process. We believe that, although it has been slower in one or two provinces because of technical problems, none the less the registration systems have worked fairly well.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>We take seriously the allegations of sexual exploitation by MONUC. In the UN a special committee on peacekeeping is looking at the issue. It is also true, as the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, said, that we must do a great deal of this work with the local and national organisations in the DRC. I, too, have looked at SOS Children. The word &quot;unique&quot; was used. It is a remarkable project and one which I highly commend to your Lordships.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>There have been a great many other questions. My noble friend Lord Giddens raised avian influenza. There have been several suspected cases of wild and domestic birds dying of avian influenza in the DRC. The samples from some birds have been sent to South Africa for testing. The Congolese Government have reported that the results were negative. Neither the WHO nor the Congolese Government have been able to confirm whether avian flu is in fact currently present, but we will keep the House fully informed.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alton, asked about Rwanda and relations with some other countries. We emphasise to those countries that there must be no external support for the Congolese armed groups that are disrupting the peace process. The DRC must take action to deal with armed groups. We will support the US-facilitated tripartite-plus commission, which is aiming to bring Ugandan, Rwandan, Burundian and Congolese Foreign Ministers together to ensure that there is no crossover of such forces and assistance. I cannot tell your Lordships that it will work perfectly, but we will work at it.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>As every contributor to the debate has said, we are talking of a country blighted by a history of murder, war, rape, rampant theft, poverty, hunger and disease but that is now making some progress towards a different state of affairs. It is a terrible history; the advances are slow; and there are many setbacks. It is not like any area in which we normally think of the conduct of normal democratic life. It is not Orpington, Winchester or Bolton. But we are working at it, because it is a matter of global concern.
</p>

<a name="60327-25_para40"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>I know that every noble Lord will join me in expressing a sincere desire to see the future of the DRC and of the Congolese people a great deal brighter than it has been. They have suffered long enough. We must end the brutal and repressive regimes, civil war and corruption. The rape and violence must stop. Impunity must end. Security Council Resolution 1493 must be respected. As the noble Lord, Lord Alton, rightly demands, the population as a whole, rather than an elite few, must benefit from the huge wealth and natural resources.

<a name="60327-25_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>The bits of the jigsaw that we need are there. The framework for peace is potentially there. The democratic elections are just around the corner. We must keep that process on track day by day, as we are trying to do with the leaders of some of the contending factions, on the phone and in person, just trying to make sure that peace lasts long enough to ensure that the election is successful. Through the expertise and finance that we are providing, we hope that we can give the Congolese the tools to do the job.
</p>

That is the aim of the Government; I believe that it is the aim of the whole House. We do not think that there is any difference between any of us about that. We cannot let it fall back.

<a name="60327-26_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Fowler </b>   rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the second report of the Select Committee on the BBC Charter Review (HL Paper 128).
</p>

<a name="60327-26_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_0"></a>The noble Lord said: This is our second report on the BBC charter review in which, as our title rather inelegantly expresses, we examine further issues concerning the corporation. A word on the venue this afternoon: the choice was between having the Moses Room now or the Floor of the House at some indeterminate time in the future, so we decided it was best to have this debate now.
</p>

<a name="60327-26_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_1"></a>Among other issues, we looked at the licence fee, spectrum charging, the World Service, broadcasting of sports and religious broadcasting. I shall not try to deal with every one of those issues, but let me point to one unexpected success. In a committee which included the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester and the noble Lord, Lord Peston, who came to the issue of religious broadcasting from slightly different perspectives, we managed, surprisingly, to get an agreement. I intend to quit while I am ahead.
</p>

<a name="60327-26_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_2"></a>I thank the members of the committee for their work. I was talking to a journalist just before this debate who spoke of the real strength of the team, and I agree wholeheartedly. I also thank our staff&#151;Richard Collins, our special adviser, Peter Hill-Jones, our excellent secretary, Rita Logan, and, above all, our Clerk, Chloe Mawson, who sits here today. It is always a good idea to keep well in with the adviser to the referee in case I go one or two minutes into extra time. That is probably my last reference to sport, not because it is not important but because I live in hope that the noble Lord, Lord Maxton, who is a great expert&#151;certainly a greater expert than I am&#151;will deal with it in his speech.
</p>

<a name="60327-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_3"></a>Our committee is beginning to get quite well known. I am now receiving letters which, if not quite hate mail, leave me in no doubt that their writers do not agree with the committee&#151;and that is not just letters from the Government. I acknowledge receipt of a letter from the Abolish the BBC campaign which believes <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC232"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column GC232</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that the licence fee is money demanded with menaces for an unwanted product. I acknowledge another letter which says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_0"></a>&quot;For a former Conservative MP to support an institution that one perceives as at least broadly soft left and perhaps either consciously or unconsciously has an agenda to keep the Tories out of government is simply appalling . . . I can only conclude in your support of the licence fee that you have some hidden career agenda&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_4"></a>Hidden from the writer and, I have to say, hidden from me.
</p>

<a name="60327-26_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_5"></a>More encouragingly, I received a letter last week, forwarded to me because it was addressed to Norman Fowler, 10 Downing Street, Westminster. Of course, I knew there was a vacancy, but I had not realised it was an open competition. If I was Prime Minister&#151;that is an extremely good link, as they say in the trade&#151;I would be very disappointed with the White Paper served up by the Secretary of State, which inadequately addresses some of the issues that the committee has raised. For all the words about consultation on the future of the BBC, there has been next to no movement from the Government since their original Green Paper. In spite of the criticism, the White Paper persists with its eccentric model for the governance of the corporation, continues to add costs to the licence fee and rejects the case for proper parliamentary scrutiny and better outside regulation. We should be clear of the consequences; as things stand, neither the charter nor the licence fee can be effectively challenged in Parliament.
</p>

<a name="60327-26_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_6"></a>The committee is strongly in support of the BBC and services such as the much admired World Service. We also support the principle of the licence fee itself. The BBC is a world leader, with programmes such as &quot;Planet Earth&quot; and news reporting that is both objective and of a very high standard. We pay tribute but, equally, we do not see it as our role to be uncritical cheerleaders. Our concerns are that the public should get the best possible value from the money that they pay, that the BBC should attain the highest possible standards in programming and news reporting and should not use its position unfairly against competition, and that it should be independent of government and seen to be independent.
</p>

<a name="60327-26_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_7"></a>Here we come to a fundamental point in both our reports. The White Paper does not lead to legislation which Parliament can examine. There will be no Bill and no scrutiny in Committee. The decisions have been taken; this is a deal between the Secretary of State and the chairman of the BBC, albeit financed by the public. The question is whether that way of making decisions is in the public interest, and we believe that it is not.
</p>

<a name="60327-26_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_8"></a>With the licence fee, the BBC wants a seven-year settlement. Its proposal is that each year for the next seven years the fee should be increased by RPI plus at least 2.3 per cent&#151;so there will be assured increases for seven years at over double the estimated rate of inflation. The BBC estimates that by the end of the period the cash bill for the licence-fee payer will be &#163;180. There is now no disagreement on that figure, I believe, nor that the income of the BBC will rise to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC233"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column GC233</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

more than &#163;4 billion a year. The ITV estimate is that licence-fee income will soon outstrip all television advertising revenue across all television channels on all platforms. Perhaps it can therefore be agreed that spending on this scale needs to be carefully justified.
</p>

<a name="60327-26_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_9"></a>We do not believe that RPI should be taken as a base line for licence-fee increases, because we think that an automatic link gives no incentive for efficiency gains. We also believe that the BBC should cost its bids more carefully. Its estimated cost for the move to Manchester has now been reduced by &#163;200 million&#151;one-third&#151;since its original bid was submitted. Even more crucially, we do not believe that government should place costs on the licence-fee payer&#151;the licence fee is a regressive charge&#151;when such costs should be borne by general taxation. The outstanding example is helping the most vulnerable viewers with digital switchover. Free licences for the over-75s is a social cost taken up by general taxation, but when it comes to social help on switchover the cost will be borne by the licence-fee payer because according to the Government it is a broadcasting cost. There has never been any serious attempt to justify the inconsistency.
</p>

<a name="60327-26_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_10"></a>At the same time we await the decision on the spectrum tax. Currently the BBC is allocated spectrum-free. The fear is that the Treasury is now pressing Ofcom to charge the BBC for the use of spectrum. We would then have the prospect of the BBC paying licence-fee money raised from the public for programme-making to the Exchequer. The curious decision of the Office for National Statistics that the licence fee is now a tax would be underlined in practice. It would be being used as a tax.
</p>

<a name="60327-26_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_11"></a>Not everyone may agree with the committee on these issues, but I hope that we can all agree that they are important and deserve to be examined. But how is this to be done? For the licence fee, the only opportunity will be an order placed before Parliament. Parliament can accept it or reject it, but it cannot change it or properly scrutinise it. This may be an arrangement which suits the Government, but whether it is in the public interest is another matter. No one is asking for primary legislation every year, year after year, but there is no reason why we should have primary legislation to decide the basis of the seven-year settlement&#151;particularly given that we are talking about over &#163;4 billion of public money.
</p>

<a name="60327-26_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_12"></a>The same criticisms apply to the charter. There is a take note debate, but no scrutiny&#151;not even an order. Yet not everyone agrees that the charter is beyond debate and is completely uncontroversial. In the new governance arrangements we will now have a trust and an executive board taking the place of the governors, who, just in case we should forget, have been partly responsible for the worldwide reputation that the BBC enjoys today. Not everyone believes that a trust with one outside chairman and an executive board with the prospect of another outside chairman is necessarily an improvement on the present position. The potential for confusion seems enormous, because the White Paper states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_1"></a>&quot;The BBC Trust is not a &#039;Trust&#039; in a legal sense&quot;,</p>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_3"></a>&quot;That is a unique solution for a unique organisation in unique circumstances&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 14/3/06; col. 1312.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-26_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_15"></a>I am not sure that the Secretary of State quite gets our point. No one disputes that it is unique. Indeed, that is the kernel of our criticism. It is a solution that is unknown to man. The real question is whether it is right; and the committee is not alone in its doubts about that.
</p>

<a name="60327-26_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_16"></a>More broadly, our view is that the public has an undoubted and incontestable right that its money is used to best effect. That is why we advocate greater access to the National Audit Office. We had some fascinating evidence on that last Wednesday from the noble Lord, Lord Birt, who spent 13 years as director-general and deputy director-general of the BBC. He was frank. He said that the BBC that he joined was a wasteful organisation and that he had laboured long to put that right. But in the period that money was being wasted, did the public know that? Of course they did not. There was no way that they could know. The BBC was not accountable then to the public, and in my view it is insufficiently accountable now. It is for that reason that the committee advocated greater access for the National Audit Office, including scrutiny of the licence-fee bid.
</p>

<a name="60327-26_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_17"></a>The Government&#039;s response to what they called this &quot;untrammelled extension&quot; of National Audit Office access was that it would risk editorial independence and in some way conflict with the principle that the main line of accountability should run directly to the licence-fee payer. But how can the BBC be accountable to the licence-fee payer if the licence-fee payer is not provided with the information? Why, if independence is challenged, does that arrangement work perfectly well with the World Service, which says that it has actually improved matters? Am I not right in thinking that the chairman of this undesirable body&#151;the National Audit Office&#151;has just been appointed by the Prime Minister to check ministerial standards? The Government&#039;s case is very weak.
</p>

<a name="60327-26_para19"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_18"></a>The Government make a wider point that the public do not want either government or Parliament to have a wider role. They base that on some dubious research which they say showed that only 9 per cent of the public thought that the Government should be responsible for holding the BBC to account when things went wrong, and only 4 per cent thought that it should be Parliament. However, those findings are more than slightly compromised by the fact that half the respondents, some 48 per cent, had not the first idea who was responsible for ensuring that the BBC provided services of an acceptable standard, and even more that no one seemed to understand the difference between government and Parliament. The net result is that the Government have taken their 9 per cent vote as a vote of confidence. They have made no change and retained power for themselves. In my view, that position cannot last.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_19"></a>Lastly, I shall say a word about the BBC World Service. The World Service is greatly admired and, frankly, it is extraordinary that we have not developed it even more than we have. We have a world leader, but, as in so many areas in this country for some reason, we seem incapable of developing it to its full potential. The World Service is financed not by the licence fee, but by general taxation through the Foreign Office. Frankly, I am not sure that this sponsorship is an advantage. The noble Lord, Lord Birt, told us that in his day the Foreign Office was reluctant to see the World Service go online&#151;doubtless believing that this new, modern development would not catch on.
</p>

<a name="60327-26_para21"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_20"></a>Even worse, we have a position today where the World Service intends to launch an Arabic language television service. Potentially, that could be an important development. The World Service would like to run it as a 24-hour service, but has been told that there are only the resources for 12 hours. The extra cost would be &#163;6 million, compared with the &#163;80 million the commercial service BBC World has lost since 1999. This seems a curious set of priorities.
</p>

<a name="60327-26_para22"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_21"></a>In another way, the World Service also brings us full circle. The Government&#039;s original Green Paper was entitled <i>A strong BBC, independent of government</i>. The whole authority of the World Service comes from its independence&#151;it is not a means of government propaganda. That is why the committee is concerned that the Foreign Office is setting up a new public diplomacy board, chaired by a Foreign Office Minister, where the World Service will be required to attend as an observer. Public diplomacy is defined by the Government, following the report of the noble Lord, Lord Carter of Coles, as:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_4"></a>&quot;work aiming to inform and engage individuals and organisations overseas, in order to improve understanding of and influence for the United Kingdom in a manner consistent with governmental medium and long term goals&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-26_para23"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_22"></a>We see very real dangers in taking the World Service down that road. We do not believe that the World Service should be seen as a tool of public diplomacy or governmental goals, and we do not believe that it is appropriate for a representative of the World Service to serve on a board to be chaired by a Minister. The World Service, as the BBC generally, must always be seen to be independent of government. We do not believe that is achieved by that proposed policy.
</p>

<a name="60327-26_para24"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_23"></a>I need no extra time. In essence, our view is that the Government have missed an opportunity for underlining the independence of the BBC, for increasing its accountability, and for constructive scrutiny of proposals affecting the BBC by the only body that has the real authority to do so, which is Parliament. I hope this committee, or a committee like it, will have the opportunity of following progress as months go by. Perhaps, as a debate seems to be beginning on the functions of the Lords, it is timely also to say that, in this respect, the Lords can play an important role. Select Committees like the BBC Select Committee have independence, and can draw on experience that I believe can be put to the public good. I beg to move.

<p><a name="gc_st_2"></a>
<a name="60327-27_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Peston: </b>   In my contribution I start more or less where the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, ended&#151;with the independence of the BBC. I think we all agree that this is vital, and should not be taken for granted. Indeed, since independence includes the right to be mistaken as well as the right to be right, the BBC will always be subject to attack. Having said that, I do not believe&#151;and nor did the committee&#151;that independence is incompatible with transparency and public scrutiny. The committee reiterates the view, which has just been enunciated by the noble Lord, that parliamentary scrutiny of the BBC and the whole decision-making process needs strengthening, and your Lordships&#039; House must play a larger role in that on a permanent basis.
</p>

<a name="60327-27_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_25"></a>It is most disappointing that, although your Lordships&#039; committee recommended&#151;this is related to independence&#151;that the Nolan principles on standards in public life should apply throughout the BBC, the White Paper appears implicitly to reject this.
</p>

<a name="60327-27_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_26"></a>I turn to the question of the licence fee as a tax. The Office for National Statistics has made this change for national accounts purposes. The licence fee now appears in the national accounts on the tax side. As I understand it, BBC current expenditure will now be reclassified as public expenditure and appear on the other side of the national accounts, leaving the overall fiscal position unaffected. The ONS states that it is simply a statistical matter which has no implication for the independence of the broadcaster. From what little I know about the Treasury&#039;s position, it takes the same view. We end up with a tax that it is not really a tax.
</p>

<a name="60327-27_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_27"></a> However, it is not obvious that either the ONS or the Treasury is right. We have to ask, particularly since this expression is still used, whether it is still a &quot;fee&quot; at the same time. The report asks whether it is perhaps not a fee but a hypothecated tax. Paying the fee/tax is supposed to be a necessary but not sufficient condition for being able to receive TV broadcasts more generally. If you put it that way, it looks like a fee. It looks a fee also when you realise that, as far as my limited understanding tells me, the money is paid to the BBC. It is not paid to the Treasury to hand on to the BBC.
</p>

<a name="60327-27_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_28"></a> We could do with a much better answer from the Government on whether the licence fee is a fee or a tax. This is vital for me wearing my old academic hat, because I can see marvellous exam questions of the sort, &quot;When is a fee not a fee but a tax? Answer with special reference to the BBC&quot;. But there is a serious side to it. We have not received that answer from the Government. Since it is a highly technical matter, I would be perfectly happy to accept a Written Answer rather a long, read-out briefing from the Treasury.
</p>

<a name="60327-27_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_29"></a> I turn to the RPI link. There are three questions that we need to ask. First, what in broad terms do we want the BBC to achieve? Secondly&#151;our esteemed <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC237"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column GC237</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

chairman brought out this point&#151;are these ends achieved efficiently? Thirdly, given the answers to those two questions, what financing formula follows? What seems to happen is the reverse; namely, we start from the RPI-plus base line and see what then follows for the BBC and its efficiency. That seems to be entirely the wrong way round.
</p>

<a name="60327-27_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_30"></a> The problem becomes even worse, as the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, said in his introduction, when one sees that the BBC&#039;s task seems to involve targets that are not obviously to do with what one thinks public sector broadcasting is about, not least the whole business of targeted help with the digital switchover and those sorts of matters. Having just passed the age of 75, I find it bizarre that the free TV licence for the over-75s seems to come out of social security expenditure, but that help with the digital switchover does not. It makes no sense. One is almost tempted to say that no one thought any of this through.
</p>

<a name="60327-27_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_31"></a> The only case I can see being made for RPI-plus is that it is an administrative convenience. If you cannot answer any of the fundamental questions, you can say &quot;RPI plus a bit more&quot; and forget about it all. Perhaps that is all that it is about, because as soon as you ask what the logical basis for the BBC&#039;s funding is, you end up with all sorts of very difficult questions.
</p>

<a name="60327-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_32"></a>The other day, there was a letter&#151;I think from someone at the BBC&#151;which stated that an appropriate comparison for the licence fee would be personal disposable income. The implication seemed to be that as long as it did not rise relative to personal disposable income, it was okay. From the point of view of economics, that is plain nonsense. We do not ask whether the ratio of anything else to personal disposable income should be held constant&#151;or, indeed, whether that ratio has any meaning whatever. It is beyond me why anyone should suggest that it is all okay as long as it does not rise as a fraction of personal disposable income.
</p>

<a name="60327-27_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_33"></a>I could easily make a case for the licence fee rising more than its ratio to personal disposable income. I rather like the BBC and, like a great many other members of the committee, I think it does a very good job. But, equally, if someone asked me to make the opposite case for it to rise more slowly, I could do that as well, because that is the business economists are in.
</p>

<a name="60327-27_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_34"></a>I think we deserve some argument as to why what is proposed for the BBC is justifiable. That is what I, and I think the committee and noble Lords more generally, want to know. I reiterate that I speak as a devotee of the BBC and as a listener to Radio 3. I think that Radio 3 is worth the whole of the licence fee. I am therefore getting all the rest for nothing. I may be a bit unusual in that.
</p>

<a name="60327-27_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_35"></a>I turn now to religion, an issue mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Fowler. I speak as someone who believes that there is already enough religious broadcasting, if not too much. I regard the existence of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC238"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column GC238</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

a religious broadcasting department as an anomaly, but I am delighted that its name is now &quot;Religion and Ethics&quot;. It certainly seems to me that public broadcasting has an important role in setting moral and ethical standards and in exposing the ethical dilemmas that occur so frequently in real life, from which religion is not separate. Equally, the role that religion plays in so many of the world&#039;s problems requires objective and expert reporting in news programmes and elsewhere, so I have no difficulty with any of that. As a firm believer in all committees coming to unanimous conclusions, I sign on to what we say, even though, as you can tell, there is an implicit agenda here for me&#151;namely, if I were writing this, it would be a little different. But I support what is in the report.
</p>

<a name="60327-27_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_36"></a>I turn now to the controversy about &quot;Thought For The Day&quot;. I preferred it when it was called &quot;Lift Up Your Hearts&quot;. It is a pity that a secular contribution and interpretation is ruled out of this programme but it is not something that I would die in the last ditch for. Indeed, given the illogicality of what is often said in the programme, the case for secularism is typically made overwhelmingly by default. This is exactly what happened when I was at school, where the only effect of the compulsory religious instruction was to make atheists of all of us.
</p>

<a name="60327-27_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_37"></a>Your Lordships&#039; committee had a difficult job to do. Under the leadership of the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, it has produced a very good report and indicated to us the direction in which we ought to go. Those of us who have been around a long time know that, in the short term, all governments, no matter what their political persuasion, take no notice of what committees such as ours recommend. But one should never be depressed about that because the evidence is that in the longer term such committees are influential&#151;especially as Ministers are often desperate for some good thinking and will turn to our committee. I am confident that the guidance we offer in our report will, in due course, be followed.

<a name="60327-27_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Bonham-Carter of Yarnbury: </b>   I welcome the opportunity to debate this second report and to thank again the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, for his excellent work as chairman. The report tested his abilities and qualities as a chairman even further than the first did. As he mentioned, its remit involved the broadcasting of sport and religion. Both subjects elicited lively differences of opinion from those on the committee. However, he managed to bring together, under a unanimous report, those with and without religious beliefs, to rein in the enthusiasms of the champions of, variously, cricket, soccer and rugby&#151;I know a lot more about Scottish rugby now than I ever thought I needed to&#151;and to rather deftly rebuff those lobbying for bridge to be regarded as a sport.
</p>

<a name="60327-27_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_38"></a>Since the second report was published, the Government have finally produced their White Paper. As has been much referred to in the press, it extols the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC239"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column GC239</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

BBC to &quot;take fun seriously&quot; and make entertainment &quot;central to its mission&quot;. Speaking as a member of the committee&#039;s cricket lobby, I suggest some live test matches. By failing to bid when the English cricket board last issued an invitation for its broadcasting rights, the BBC is &quot;partly responsible&quot;, as our report says, for the fact that the ECB then went on to enter into an exclusive deal with BSkyB. The result&#151;no live cricket on any free-to-air channel for the next four years. The BBC&#039;s funding by the licence fee and its other public service broadcasting responsibilities mean that it should have bid.
</p>

<a name="60327-27_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_39"></a>As we all know, the publication of the White Paper is a significant political event. It is significant because of the unique role that the BBC plays in the life of the nation, because it comes after one of the most damaging episodes in the BBC&#039;s history&#151;the Hutton inquiry&#151;and because it comes when we are experiencing unprecedented change in the world of broadcasting. It is to be welcomed in its endorsement of a,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_5"></a>&quot;strong BBC, independent . . . and responsive to public wishes&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-27_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_40"></a>and in its support of the licence fee. However, in so many areas it does not address the concerns voiced in the report.
</p>

<a name="60327-27_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_41"></a>I think that most people have always felt the licence fee to be a bit of a bargain&#151;reliable news, some &quot;Ab Fab&quot;, some Dickens, soothing David Attenborough and a bit of Jeremy Paxman to stir things up. Then there is all that radio, as the noble Lord, Lord Peston, mentioned, and now BBC online as well. However, the public&#039;s faith in the corporation will be put under severe strain if, at the same time as channels and choices multiply, the cost of the licence fee rockets due to the Government&#039;s insistence that the BBC&#151;in other words, the licence-fee payer&#151;funds the Government&#039;s policy of switching to digital.
</p>

<a name="60327-27_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_42"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, has already asked, why should the cost of switching from analogue to digital not be paid out of general taxation? The licence fee is already a regressive tax. This makes it more so. Paying for switchover through it will particularly hurt low-income households, which already face covering the costs of replacing TV sets and recorders, and possibly updating their aerials. It gives grist to the mill of the enemies of the BBC who cry, &quot;Poll tax&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60327-27_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_43"></a>There is worse, as the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, has said, but I feel so strongly about it I must repeat it. The cost of help for the over-75s and the vulnerable is also to be carried by the BBC. The Secretary of State is quite categorical about that. Her view is that a targeted assistance programme of help with digital switchover is a broadcasting cost. It is not; it is a social cost, and it is not appropriate for the licence fee to be used to pay for a social cost. This is in effect a new tax collected through the disguise of the licence fee and, again, it inflates the cost for every licence-fee payer.
</p>

<a name="60327-27_para19"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_44"></a>To add insult to injury, the Treasury is set to make a substantial amount of money out of the sale of the analogue spectrum.

That would involve the licence fee going straight back to the Treasury, or what the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, rather colourfully referred to in evidence to us as &quot;double dipping&quot;. The multi-channel landscape of the digital future is one that poses particular challenges to all public service broadcasters. The BBC is the cornerstone but it must not become a monopoly supplier. It is vital that Channel 4 is not left to flounder for lack of finance&#151;a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Birt, when he appeared before us last week. The Government must consider allocating free spectrum to Channel 4 as well.
</p>

<a name="60327-28_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_46"></a>Then there is the leading role that the BBC is being asked to play by the Government in an enterprise that may not be wholly popular. I agree with Jocelyn Hay, chair of the Voice of the Listener & Viewer, in fearing that, having been put in charge of switchover by politicians,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_6"></a>&quot;the corporation will increasingly be perceived by the public as a quasi-government agency&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-28_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_47"></a>That brings me to another area that we covered in the report where the interventionist style of this Government gives cause for concern&#151;the World Service. The noble Lord, Lord Fowler, has already mentioned&#151;so I shall not quote again&#151;the review on public diplomacy commissioned by the Foreign Office and the Treasury, which has given us all cause for concern. It is essential that the World Service is, and is perceived by its listeners to be, editorially independent. It must not be seen as a mouthpiece for the British Government if it is to continue to play its vital global role as a source of impartial international news. This is particularly important in the world we live in today and as it embarks on launching its Arabic television service&#151;an enterprise which is to be supported wholeheartedly.

Of course the BBC must entertain but it also has to take on the difficult subjects, and not be damned if it does because these do not always attract large audiences.

<a name="60327-28_spmin1"></a><b>The Lord Bishop of Manchester:</b>  It must be a constant frustration for those who frequently serve on Select Committees to realise that not only will much that is recommended not be accepted by the government of the day, but that on some matters the government, from the start, will let it be known that they are immovable. Just so with this Select Committee. As the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, indicated, charting the journey from Green to White Paper demonstrates how sparse has been the acceptance of recommendations made in the first report. Suspicions about done deals between the BBC and government, without appropriate scrutiny, inevitably raise proper questions about whether such methodology best serves the public interest.
</p>

<a name="60327-28_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_52"></a>The second report has a somewhat different role from the first&#151;not least because of its timing and much of its content. It may have come too late to have significant influence on government thinking, but that does not necessarily diminish its longer-term importance as an indicator of some of the issues that the BBC itself needs to take seriously in the years ahead if the licence-fee payer is to be deemed as having value for money, and as a way of drawing attention to the need for effective scrutiny of what the noble Lord, Lord Birt, tellingly described as a wasteful organisation.
</p>

<a name="60327-28_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_53"></a>Indeed, this report, with its wider brief, is an example of the value and role that would accrue from a permanent Select Committee, for which the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, has so eloquently argued, as we move into an era of unprecedented change in the culture of programme-making and broadcasting, irrevocably influenced by the huge technological advances that are now gaining unimaginable momentum and of which the noble Lord, Lord Maxton, has often powerfully reminded us.

authorities and the North-West Development Agency, and what now seems to be the unswerving commitment at the highest levels of the BBC. I think the way the financial figures have been bandied about for the costs of the move has been extremely unhelpful. I recognise that until the licence-fee settlement is reached, the scope of what is affordable for the whole of the BBC&#039;s output remains unclear, but that is not helped by the Government beginning to use the licence fee as tax. But there was something ludicrous about the sudden drop in proposed costs by &#163;200 million. One of the national newspapers quoted me as asking humorously if there was a similar drop still to come. Humorous it may have sounded, but it was meant as a wry comment on what had seemed at one point to be figures plucked out of the air. I hope that a properly costed move, that gives reasonable long-term value to the licence-fee payer, will soon be confirmed to one of the excellent locations in Greater Manchester. Incidentally, one of the concerns that I and other noble Lords have raised about help over digital switchover for the elderly and disabled licence-fee payer still awaits a satisfactory response.
</p>

<a name="60327-28_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_55"></a>Undoubtedly, one of the most exciting things about the new location will be the opportunities for the much-vaunted creative hub. The Government&#039;s emphasis on the need for creativity, especially the window, has been consistently welcomed by the Select Committee, but whether the hub will be able to turn vision into reality remains uncertain. Intriguing evidence was given to us from ITV by Charles Allen. His reputation as a quick-thinking, astute businessman and strategist is well known in Manchester, where his brilliant efforts in relation to the 2002 Commonwealth Games provided the benchmark to which Melbourne has had to aspire.
</p>

<a name="60327-28_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_56"></a>In his evidence to the committee, Mr Allen rightly and robustly questioned the financial projections the BBC had made about the move north. But he then went on, with almost bubbling enthusiasm, to welcome the opportunity of working alongside the BBC at the hub. However, several people in evidence had told us of the reputation the BBC has for its inability to work in partnership with others. That in itself will require the director-general and the chairman, by then in transmogrified form, to take the utmost care to make sure that the way the BBC operates in the hub belies that reputation. They might be forgiven for wondering why, when such a reputation is alleged, ITV, through Charles Allen, should be so very keen to work with the BBC. It would be ungracious for me to suggest that either side should sup with each other with long spoons, but I think some canny awareness would not go amiss and is no doubt very present. It would, in any case, be inappropriate for ITV to benefit from licence-fee money, particularly when it has recently walked away from some of its public service obligations and could even, at some stage in the future, be owned from outside the United Kingdom.

over independents, which, rightly, are also proposed for inclusion. How will a balance be achieved between American or other foreign-financed independents and small national or regional companies? What about the other publicly owned broadcaster? Will Channel 4 be able to participate in this? These and other issues underline the fact that precisely because the hub is such an imaginative and exciting idea, it is hugely important for it to be set up in a way that gets it right, so that the chief energies are given to creative programme-making and broadcasting, enabling a flow of new talent, best use of the latest technology and value for the licence-fee payer.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_58"></a>I turn, perhaps not unsurprisingly, to the chapter on religion. It is a miracle&#151;its wording carefully honed and its recommendations, as the noble Lord, Lord Peston, has wittily indicated, unanimously agreed. Thanks indeed go to the committee&#039;s excellent support team and to the skilful and courteous chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Fowler. It also reflects the spirit of tolerance and respect for other views, be they of belief or non-belief, that increasingly characterised our deliberative sessions.
</p>

<a name="60327-28_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_59"></a>I am heartened this afternoon, as one of its regular contributors of old, by the mention made by the noble Lord, Lord Peston, of &quot;Lift up your Hearts&quot;. But the thought that I thereby strengthened his atheism presents me now with the challenge to remedy my mistake.
</p>

<a name="60327-28_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_60"></a>Many of the recommendations of this part of the report take on an added significance in the wake of the announcement last week that the present head of the BBC&#039;s department for religion and ethics&#151;a title, incidentally, that has been in place for some time&#151;will be vacating his post soon. In the light of our report, I would expect the BBC, in appointing his successor, to take particular note of the Select Committee&#039;s recommendations on that department and the responsibilities the BBC has for making sure that news and current affairs coverage on religious matters provides competent and knowledgeable reporting; and that specifically religious programmes should enable viewers and listeners, not least for the stronger cohesion of our society, to have a better understanding of different religions and other belief and non-belief systems in terms, where appropriate, of worship, practice and belief, in compliance with the Communications Act 2003. That also depends on the imagination and effectiveness of the commissioner of religious programmes and clearer structural provision of output. I certainly hope that the new head of religion and ethics will take heed of the Select Committee&#039;s support of a wide definition of broadcasting about religion and other beliefs, applicable nationally and for local BBC stations, and will note the report&#039;s encouragement to the BBC and all broadcasters,

</p>

<a name="60327-28_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_61"></a>To some extent, the measure of how seriously the BBC takes the recommendations of the chapter on the broadcasting of religion will be judged by the calibre of <br>&nbsp;<br>

the appointment and the swiftness with which it is made, as well as by the outcome of the BBC&#039;s current review of the role of its Central Religious Advisory Committee, to which our report refers. CRAC would be made more effective by clarifying its purpose in bringing together different faiths and reducing the tendency for competition between them.
</p>

<a name="60327-28_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_62"></a>Meanwhile, I express gratitude to the colleagues with whom I have sat on this Select Committee for our informative deliberations, rigorous questioning and the spirit of courtesy and tolerance that has so characterised our meetings.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_63"></a>I can thank the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, this time&#151;he was not present the last time&#151;for his excellent chairmanship of the committee. I will not pay him the same back-handed compliment that I paid him on the previous occasion of comparing him with Sir Gerald Kaufman.

As the right reverend Prelate said, it is an enormous compliment to the drafting skills of both our chairman and the Clerks of the Committee that they were able to produce a report which received the agreement of myself, my noble friend Lord Peston and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester.
</p>

<a name="60327-29_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_65"></a>There will be among my committee colleagues an expectation that I will speak again on the new technologies as I seem to have gained a reputation as the committee&#039;s techno-anorak. The Minister will be relieved to hear that I do not intend to do so. He does not share my enthusiasm for new technology and the way it is progressing. I outlined that in my speech on our first report and I do not need to repeat it.
</p>

<a name="60327-29_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_66"></a>Before I move to the major theme of my speech, I want to add my support to those who have spoken in favour of the BBC being covered by an Act of Parliament and having proper parliamentary scrutiny. I understand the arguments about keeping the BBC free of political influence; however, no other organisation but Parliament&#151;particularly the House of Commons&#151;can represent the licence-fee payers. They are, after all, the electors as well as the licence-fee payers. No one but Members of Parliament can claim to be their representatives. There are organisations which try to do so&#151;but they do not. Such organisations have few members and only the House of Commons can be the licence-fee payers&#039; representative. In a democracy, public-funded bodies must be responsible to the people through their elected representatives.
</p>

<a name="60327-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_67"></a>Although I endorse all the conclusions of the report, I have not been as over-concerned as some of my colleagues with the governance issues in the Green and White Papers, and others are better qualified to speak <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column GC245</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

on those issues. I am more concerned with what the BBC will do for the licence-fee payer over the next 10 years and what it will provide in services. On the previous occasion, I looked at its role in the world of changing technology; this time I shall concentrate on one aspect of the report&#151;namely, the broadcasting of sport. I am sure most of my colleagues will be delighted about that. I asked the committee to look at this issue as I believe it is an important part of broadcasting. Certainly one of the BBC&#039;s major competitors&#151;Sky&#151;uses its sports coverage as a major means of attracting new subscribers.
</p>

<a name="60327-29_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_68"></a>I begin by congratulating the BBC on its broad and in-depth coverage of the recent Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. The showing of a large number of sports which normally never get any TV coverage was very welcome. I also take the opportunity, on behalf of all Members, to congratulate the sportsmen and sportswomen from all the nations of the United Kingdom on their tremendous achievements in Melbourne. The Committee will not be surprised, of course, that I think Scotland did particularly well.
</p>

<a name="60327-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_69"></a>Unlike some of my colleagues, however, as a Scot, I am not gravely concerned about the failure of the BBC to show test match cricket. I believe, however, that showing sport&#151;particularly sports that are not universally popular&#151;is part of the public service remit of the BBC. Increasingly, medical research shows that a healthy lifestyle must include regular exercise if it is to be effective. Sport on television encourages a percentage of those watching to take exercise, as well as being a major source of entertainment. In particular, coverage of events such as the London Marathon and the Great North Run, which show ordinary people&#151;even people older than myself&#151;taking part in a televised event, encourages others to take up exercise. Encouraging even a small proportion of people to undertake physical exercise, which will be both good for their health and reduce the burden on the National Health Service, is something that the BBC and other broadcasters should do as part of their public service remit.
</p>

<a name="60327-29_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_70"></a>However, not all licence-fee payers want to watch sport. Indeed, only a minority watch sport on a regular basis. Thus the BBC is limited on its two terrestrial channels as to the amount of sport it can show. One of the reasons that it did not bid for test match cricket in this country is because a test match can take up to five whole days to complete, and the BBC did not believe that that would be fair on other licence payers.
</p>

<a name="60327-29_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_71"></a>In the new digital world&#151;which will be almost universal by 2012&#151;there are three ways in which the BBC will be able to encourage sport by increasing its range and output. First, the BBC must consider how it uses its present digital channels, such as BBC Three and BBC Four, for sports coverage as well as for entertainment. It should also consider using its UK Gold channels, in partnership with others, to show immediate replays, as it did during the Six Nations rugby competition. It should show the enormous archive of great sporting events that it holds. This is tremendously important. A great many people want <br>&nbsp;<br>

not only to watch for the umpteenth time England winning the World Cup in 1966, but all kinds of other events as well.
</p>

<a name="60327-29_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_72"></a>While I accept that the setting-up of a new BBC channel will be difficult to achieve, I believe that there is a very good case for the BBC having a separate sports channel, not only for the reasons I have already given but to show&#151;live&#151;less popular sports, such as badminton, which may not be great viewing but which have a large participation among the public.
</p>

<a name="60327-29_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_73"></a>I wish to make two more points. First, we are concerned about the way in which the BBC is going to move towards more local television and radio. In my view, the BBC has an opportunity here to extend its role in sports coverage. Once you get genuinely local television, with news coverage in quite small towns, why should not the local youth cup final between two teams, which have played throughout a long competition, be shown? There is no reason why that should not be the case.
</p>

<a name="60327-29_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_74"></a>Secondly, the BBC should use its website as a very important part of sports coverage over the next few years. At the moment, it can produce live sports commentary in voice but not yet in viewing. But that will come. Live streaming on to the internet will happen&#151;I apologise to the Minister if I am being a little technical for him&#151;and there will be an opportunity to show sporting events that would not otherwise get coverage on television. It will be feasible for every Premier League football match to be shown live on the internet. That can be done either through the BBC or by the clubs themselves but, preferably, I think it should be done through the BBC. More particularly, again, the BBC would be able to show sports that would not otherwise get the same coverage.
</p>

<a name="60327-29_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_75"></a>I accept that this subject has not always aroused the interest of noble Lords but I believe it is very important that the BBC should continue its role as a major provider of sports broadcasting&#151;and, in that role, it will continue to fulfil its role as a public service broadcaster.

<a name="60327-29_spnew1"></a><b> Lord King of Bridgwater: </b>   I join other colleagues who served on the Select Committee in paying tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, for his chairmanship, and in saying what a privilege it was to serve on that committee. I have had the opportunity to see other Select Committees in operation in another place as well as here, and would dare to suggest that this Select Committee compared extremely favourably, in the range of experience and background within it, with any that I have ever seen operate in either House. It is itself a tribute to the importance of the BBC that so many people of experience and background were keen to serve on this committee and serve under the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, which makes it all the more disappointing if its recommendations are so readily ignored.
</p>

<a name="60327-29_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_76"></a>I was going to say that there were no spots on this committee, until an unfortunate incident changed that situation. I could not help thinking that we are in the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC247"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column GC247</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Moses Room and it is a bit short of manna from heaven, but then it came down. Black Rod may consider an extra cleaning detail for this Room before the next Committee emerges.
</p>

<a name="60327-29_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_77"></a>The common thread throughout this committee, which was shared by every member, is our appreciation of the quality of so much of what the BBC has done and its reputation, both nationally and globally. The noble Lord, Lord Peston, will not mind me quoting him quite early in our discussion; he said that it is one of the few institutions in the UK that commands such a wide international and national reputation. Albeit it is ever possible to find criticism arising in the many different activities it faces, the BBC generally commands very high respect.
</p>

<a name="60327-29_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_78"></a>It is against that background that I hope the BBC also understands that, in the criticisms we have made, we have always sought to be constructive, and that some of our suggestions that have been viewed with horror by the BBC&#151;for example, scrutiny by the NAO&#151;are actually in its best interests. The Government&#039;s response to that suggestion, and to our suggestion that the present system was singularly untransparent, was that the Government expect the trust to demand transparency from the BBC. I will come on to who the BBC actually is in a moment, but that in itself is concealed transparency. It is kept in-house.
</p>

<a name="60327-29_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_79"></a>The BBC is embarking on a very challenging future, when a lot of people are questioning not merely whether the licence fee should go up by the RPI or some other percentage, but why there should be anything like so large a licence fee. Maybe not now, but in five or 10 years&#039; time, with the multiplicity of platforms and the variety of options for people, it will be vitally important that the BBC can demonstrate publicly that it has taken outside scrutiny into account and that the costs it is seeking are fully justified. It is very ill advised of the Government and the BBC not to welcome the recommendation we made and put it into effect. As I say, it is on an all-party basis; this is an all-party committee, and that is a very important recommendation. Of course it is complicated. The other reason why I strongly support it is that the Government have further complicated matters by offloading a bit of public expenditure on to the licence fee by transferring the cost for the elderly and disabled of the transfer to digital. That is a further reason why the BBC ought to welcome outside scrutiny, because then it could point out clearly to the public what costs have been transferred to the BBC that are not its responsibility, for which otherwise it would be criticised.
</p>

<a name="60327-29_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_80"></a>Against that background, there is one small item that I do not think has been mentioned. When the committee visited Germany, we were particularly struck by the issues regarding the cost of collection. Some quite different figures were advanced by the German authorities, which appeared to have a much more economical method of collection. The Government&#039;s response, if ever it sounded like, &quot;Don&#039;t call us, we&#039;ll call you&quot;, is:
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_10"></a>&quot;The use of appropriate benchmarks, whether domestic or international, may also be helpful, although as pointed out in the Government&#039;s recent letter to the Committee, direct international comparisons are not always straightforward&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-29_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_81"></a>I would like to have felt that somebody would look into the issue straightaway and report back to Parliament, but whoever wrote the report will have said, &quot;Don&#039;t worry about that, Minister. I have dealt with that. We&#039;ve dealt with the Select Committee&#039;s recommendation and you won&#039;t have to look at that again&quot;. I hope that the Minister will give us an assurance exactly as I have spelt out&#151;that the matter will now be looked at&#151;rather than some bland rebuttal.
</p>

<a name="60327-29_para19"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_82"></a>I accept entirely that the World Service is not the responsibility of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport&#151;it had to include this matter in its White Paper&#151;but everybody will know that great concern is felt about the proposals and the evidence that was given to this committee. The Government said that the World Service was bringing the UK to the world and the world to the UK. They spoke of the importance of public diplomacy. They said also that it was important that the World Service supported the Government&#039;s international priorities and was consistent with the Government&#039;s medium-term and long-term goals.
</p>

<a name="60327-29_para20"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_83"></a>It was the unanimous view of the committee that the World Service should not be used as a political instrument of the British Government and that if it were, particularly in some of the controversial activities in which the Government have become involved recently, it would be hugely damaging to the World Service&#039;s enormously valuable worldwide reputation of integrity and good faith. Will the Minister give two examples of the Government&#039;s international priorities which the World Service is expected to support? What are the Government&#039;s medium-term and long-term goals with which the World Service must be consistent? We recall the shadow which the events that led to the Hutton and Butler reports cast over the renewal of the charter of the BBC. What came to light then was the concern of Alastair Campbell and No. 10 about the BBC&#039;s attitude and some of its coverage of the war in Iraq. Was that inconsistent with the Government&#039;s priorities or their medium-term and long-term goals? Would the BBC be censured for some of the World Service&#039;s coverage in that respect?
</p>

<a name="60327-29_para21"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_84"></a>With great respect to my noble friend Lord Kalms, I cannot forbear from saying a word about an issue which concerns me greatly and to which other Members of the Committee referred; that is, governance. The issue was extremely well summed up in an article that was written as long ago as 12 December by Sir Howard Davies in the <i>Financial Times</i>. Perhaps I may quote from it:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_11"></a>&quot;The Lords committee, chaired by Lord Fowler, described the proposals for reforming the governance and regulation of the BBC as &#039;confusing, misguided and unworkable&#039;. In evidence to the committee, important features of them were opposed by Ofcom, the media regulator; by Michael Grade, BBC chairman, and his predecessors, Gavyn Davies and Sir Christopher Bland; by Greg Dyke, former BBC director-general; and by Lord Burns, chair of the independent panel advising the culture department on the <br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-29_para22"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_85"></a>We have had the privilege of the hearing the evidence of the noble Lord, Lord Birt, since that article was written. He did not let down his colleague, Sir Howard Davies, in that respect. The article continued:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_12"></a>&quot;How has the government achieved this remarkable full house of opposition? It has done so by proposing a new structure that bows in several directions at once. There would be a so-called BBC Trust (though the white paper says it might not actually be a trust), which is part regulator, part supervisory board. Below it it plans an executive board, which is part management committee and part corporate board, with a chairman who might be executive or non-executive. That, in itself, is an indication that its role has not been properly thought through. Sir Christopher Bland was right to describe it as an uneasy compromise between creating a separate regulatory body and imposing a German-style two-tier form of governance. In the light of this devastating and unanimous critique it seems astonishing that the government appears determined to plough on&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-29_para23"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_86"></a>What has happened since then? The Government have been determined to plough on.
</p>

<a name="60327-29_para24"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_87"></a>I say this very clearly. Having started with a tribute to the quality of the BBC, which is an institution of international value, I would like to know who was responsible for putting forward this proposal. Those names need to be attached as we watch what many of our witnesses have warned&#151;and it is a view that I certainly share&#151;could lead to confusion and chaos and be very damaging to the future of the BBC.
</p>

<a name="60327-29_para25"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_88"></a>I should also like an explanation of a sentence in the Secretary of State&#039;s introduction to the White Paper. I may be very slow on this but it said of the proposals that the,


</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_13"></a>&quot;guarantor of the independence and robustness of the Trust is the next Charter Review process . . . in 2016&quot;.</p>

<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-29_para26"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_89"></a>I would be awfully grateful if the Minister would explain to me what on earth that sentence is meant to mean, because I find it quite incomprehensible.
</p>

<a name="60327-29_para27"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_90"></a> As a nation, we are extremely lucky in our broadcasting corporation. Anyone who travels overseas will know the respect in which it is held worldwide. Anyone who seeks to care for the future of the BBC must proceed with great care with any reforms that they make. I say simply to the Government that, having been warned by the committee, they are embarking on an approach that we believe is extremely damaging to the future of the BBC. I hope that the Minister will take that fully into account and will see that&#151;whatever we are embarking on, with no further parliamentary chance to change it&#151;the confusions and complexities that are all too apparent in the White Paper will be explained to people so they have some confidence at last that this difficult and confusing arrangement will somehow work.

<a name="60327-30_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Holme of Cheltenham: </b>   This has been a remarkably interesting and in many ways enjoyable committee on which to serve and, like others, I express my appreciation to noble colleagues. However, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC250"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column GC250</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I found myself thinking, in contrasting the White Paper to the two reports of our committee, what a contrast they represented. On the one hand, a very open-minded and constructive committee produced a report that has in it radical analysis and clear conclusions&#151;not least, as other noble Lords have said, because of the leadership of the noble Lord, Lord Fowler. On the other hand, we have a muddled and cautious government White Paper, standing pat on so many positions, which does not do the committee even the courtesy, apparently, of listening to what we have recommended. In fact, it ignores virtually all the recommendations that we made&#151;and I think how little that is commensurate with the challenges that the BBC faces in the digital age.
</p>

<a name="60327-30_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_91"></a>Speaking at this stage in the proceedings, one is bound to be slightly repetitive, but I want to address two aspects of our report. First, as other noble Lords have said, what a sorry mess the Treasury is making of the clarity that should exist on what the licence fee is for and what the British licence-fee payer gets for it&#151;and it is the Treasury that is doing that, of course, as in this respect the DCMS is merely a cat&#039;s paw for the Treasury. In loading costs on to the BBC, the Treasury has constructed a sort of zero sum game, whereby all the benefit of digital switchover goes to the Treasury and all the costs go to the licence payer. Therefore the Treasury does not, as it should, pay the costs of switchover, which is greatly to the benefit of UK plc, including the necessary social costs that are implied; but the Treasury takes the substantial extra income from the sale of spectrum, including a proposal to charge the BBC for digital spectrum use. Here you have to marvel at the sheer nerve of the Treasury, although those who have been Treasury Ministers will not be as astonished as me. The licence-fee payer will therefore be faced with a spectacular hike in costs in what is now described as a tax. I fear that the Chancellor is in danger of doing to the BBC what he has done for company pensions&#151;destroying a well understood system by excessive opportunism and greed.
</p>

<a name="60327-30_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_92"></a>The other subject to which I shall refer at perhaps greater length has just been mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord King. A noble purpose is set out in the BBC White Paper:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_14"></a>&quot;Bringing the world to the UK and the UK to the world&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-30_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_93"></a>That is well said and is a great purpose in this age of globalisation, when the world stands sorely in need of shared understanding and enlightenment.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_15"></a>&quot;Nation shall speak unto nation&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-30_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_94"></a>indeed. But if the BBC is the crowning glory of British culture, the World Service&#151;if Paul Scott and ITV will forgive me&#151;is the jewel in the crown, precisely not in the imperialist manner of the original analogy. The BBC World Service is a model of cross-cultural respect and tolerance, and upholds democracy, transparency and human rights. It possesses many of the qualities, including reason, objectivity, honesty and fairness, which this country at its best would like to think it stands for in the modern world.

<a name="60327-30_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_95"></a>That depends on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, on whose grant-in-aid the World Service depends. It depends on the FCO recognising precisely the value that the World Service represents to the United Kingdom. Most of the time, the FCO has got it right. It knows that the BBC World Service creates a context of respect and appreciation for this country and its values. But I was very alarmed, as are other noble Lords, at the report by the noble Lord, Lord Carter of Coles, on so-called public diplomacy, which looked to the World Service as a way of promoting not the United Kingdom, but as others have mentioned, medium-term government aims and describes them as a tool of public diplomacy.
</p>

<a name="60327-30_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_96"></a>I detest the term &quot;public diplomacy&quot;. Diplomacy is like making sausages or inventing party policy&#151;it is an activity that is traditionally practised at best in private. I suspect that in practice we need to call public diplomacy by its proper name&#151;propaganda. More fundamentally, medium-term British Government aims are exactly what the World Service should not be about. Imagine, as we say in our report, if every hour, on the hour, the BBC World Service, in the interests of honesty and transparency, had to have one of its dulcet-toned announcers say, &quot;What follows is designed to promote the medium-term aims of the British Government&quot;. How credible, and, therefore, how useful would the service be in its proper aim of promoting British values? The BBC World Service does not exist to give the British Government a propaganda platform.
</p>

<a name="60327-30_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_97"></a>Throughout the Cold War, the World Service was listened to, often surreptitiously and with some danger, in preference to the blatant propaganda of the &quot;Voice of America&quot;, by people who were then subject to totalitarian tyranny because they thought that the World Service was the &quot;real thing&quot;&#151;not a sort of Orwellian loudspeaker. Successive governments, including this one, must have the humility and realism to recognise that &quot;Brand Britain&quot;, as we call it in these days of new Labour, is more durable and more important than the priorities of any particular administration. Yes, the BBC World Service can set a benign context for the Government&#039;s external policies, but no, it is not a launch pad for British Government initiatives, any more than it is a promotional platform for British companies or a showcase for admirable British NGOs such as Amnesty or Oxfam. The Government, the companies, the NGOs&#151;each and every one of them can benefit indirectly from a strong, independent World Service. The moment that independence is compromised, we have killed the goose that lays the golden eggs, and that will represent a grievous loss to this country and the world alike.
</p>

<a name="60327-30_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_98"></a>I was very struck by the evidence of the noble Lord, Lord Birt, last week&#151;I am glad to see him in his place today&#151;when, as a former director-general, he said unambiguously that it was not the role of the BBC World Service to promote public diplomacy. I go further than the noble Lord, Lord King, who asked for examples of these medium-term aims that the BBC World Service is now supposed to implement&#151;indeed, let me go in the reverse direction. May we have a <br>&nbsp;<br>

categorical assurance from the Minister not only of the editorial independence of the World Service&#151;which we have had on previous occasions&#151;but that the Government do not regard the BBC World Service as a way of furthering their foreign policy objectives?

<p><a name="gc_st_10"></a>
<a name="60327-30_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </b>   I am sure we are all very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, for having secured this debate&#151;the second in three months&#151;because it enables your Lordships to comment not only on the work of the Select Committee but on the Secretary of State&#039;s White Paper. However, we are even more grateful to the noble Lord for his quite brilliant chairmanship of the Select Committee. The background knowledge and leadership he brought to the task has been quite invaluable.
</p>

<a name="60327-30_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_99"></a>There are three areas where agreement on the way forward is clear. First, there is wide agreement about the BBC&#039;s quite unique cultural and financial value to this country. The World Service has been mentioned many times as the jewel, and that it is. Abroad, the BBC is perceived as the international benchmark for accuracy and independence. At home, the vast majority of licence-fee payers trust&#151;that fast-disappearing dictionary word&#151;the BBC.
</p>

<a name="60327-30_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_100"></a>Secondly, most would also agree that with technical developments moving even faster than the speed of light, and with digital switchover imminent, a further review of the way ahead will be needed about half way through the 10-year period. Thirdly, for the whole of that 10-year period, at least, the licence fee remains the best system for financing the BBC.
</p>

<a name="60327-30_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_101"></a>However, as your Lordships have already heard, there are disagreements. There are two to which I attach importance. First, only an Act of Parliament, rather than a charter, will bring the BBC under proper democratic parliamentary&#151;as opposed to purely governmental&#151;scrutiny. Secondly, as both Select Committees agreed, the trust/executive board system of governance for the BBC proposed in the Green Paper will not secure a BBC that is sufficiently accountable to licence-fee payers. Nevertheless, a continuation of the charter and the trust/executive board are the routes chosen by the Government.
</p>

<a name="60327-30_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_102"></a>If our committees have, so far, failed to convince the Government of the need for more radical change, then the next five years, with huge technological and content challenges ahead, will be an excellent time to see if in practice the Government&#039;s preferred model is sufficiently robust to meet today&#039;s licence-fee payer&#039;s expectations for, as the Secretary of State said, far greater transparency and separation of powers.
</p>

<a name="60327-30_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_103"></a>Certainly, on the face of it, the White Paper&#039;s principles of good governance set out a pretty robust agenda, with emphasis on the trust&#039;s involvement with, and accountability to, the licence-fee payer. Rightly also stressed is the need to protect&#151;indeed, to strengthen&#151;the independence of the BBC. As my noble friend Lord Birt, who has been quoted in this debate, said in his evidence to the Select Committee last Thursday, even if the trust/executive board is not <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC253"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column GC253</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the preferred model of governance and accountability, perhaps we can see it as a step in the right direction. But noble Lords will want to keep a watching brief.
</p>

<a name="60327-30_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_104"></a>There will be, it seems to me, one very clear test of the ability of the new structures to deliver sufficient transparency and accountability; that is the extent to which the process by which new members of the trust/executive boards are appointed will or will not be truly independent of government. As the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, has pointed out, there is an ominous silence on that point.
</p>

<a name="60327-30_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_105"></a>A second indicator will be the way in which complaints about the content of programmes&#151;not currently subject to regulation by Ofcom&#151;are dealt with. The BBC trust has already put in place a more independent process for the first internal stage of dealing with complaints. But the licence-fee payer may well continue to have concerns about the absence of a more robust and obviously independent regulator. Our first report&#039;s proposal, which the Government have rejected, was that Ofcom should take ultimate responsibility for all content complaints, including that of accuracy and impartiality, currently the responsibility of the BBC governors. However, because of the perceived economic predominance of Ofcom&#039;s work, we argued that the content board should become more open and transparent. At present, we know far more about the work of the Consumer Panel&#151;even though we are told it is no more than an advisory body to Ofcom&#151;because it regularly publishes its reports. If the content board sometimes met in public and, above all, regularly published its findings, making clear when its decisions had been reversed by the main Ofcom board, that would generate much more confidence in its independence and credibility.
</p>

<a name="60327-30_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_106"></a>The next few years will be a testing time for these structures. But, equally, all that reinforces the clear need for the establishment of a permanent communications Select Committee of your Lordships&#039; House. The expertise undoubtedly exists in this House&#151;I could not have been more convinced of that by sitting on the board&#151;and it would also meet the growing concern that no effective parliamentary accountability exists for matters which are so blatantly of public interest.
</p>

<a name="60327-30_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_107"></a>Regarding the charter itself, like the noble Baroness, Lady Bonham-Carter, I was delighted that entertainment has been re-emphasised as a clear purpose; and that the promotion of education and learning remains. That has been one of the major achievements of the BBC. As a previous deputy chairman of both the Open University and the Equal Opportunities Commission, I have no doubt that the OU/BBC partnership in enabling women, with the help of their TV sets, to study at home and take degrees while bringing up children, has been a crucial factor in women&#039;s advance towards equal opportunities.

<a name="60327-30_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_108"></a>In addition, the,

</p>

<a name="60327-30_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_109"></a>takes on even greater importance, given the special emphasis that the Government have rightly placed on meeting the needs of those children whom the system has consistently failed. Having recently seen a presentation by Liz Cleaver, controller of BBC Learning, on some of the new online imaginative interactive ways of supporting children, and indeed adults, on a one-to-one basis in attaining required curriculum levels&#151;learning foreign languages and so on&#151;I have no doubt that once again the BBC will play a vital role in that field, not least when each school-age child is to have its own individualised learning schedule based on its specific needs and potential.
</p>

<a name="60327-30_para19"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_110"></a>I turn to the contents of our second report. The subjects on which evidence was taken were definitely issues of current concern. First, sport, which, was discouraged in schools in the 1960s as too competitive, is firmly back on the agenda and rightly so. That, too, applies to the increasingly urgent case for a greater BBC presence in the nations and regions. The invaluable high definition TV developments that have resulted from BBC Bristol&#039;s wildlife expertise make that point succinctly. All who have seen the Sunday night episodes of &quot;Planet Earth&quot; recognise that instantly. There will also be many other commercial as well as cultural benefits if the projected move to Manchester&#151;the gateway to the north&#151;comes off. I hope that it does.
</p>

<a name="60327-30_para20"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_111"></a>For me, by far the most important and interesting subject on which we took evidence was the role of BBC and other public service broadcasters in covering religious issues. Our debates were all the more stimulating, as our Select Committee membership included those of religious beliefs and none. Perhaps I may say that on this occasion the Select Committee was particularly lucky to have the expertise of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester to aid our deliberations.
</p>

<a name="60327-30_para21"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_112"></a>There is, of course, little doubt that people&#039;s religious and other spiritual beliefs are relevant issues for the BBC. Indeed, the Communications Act 2003 states that such coverage is a specific duty, and rightly so. But as Mark Thompson made clear in an article in January&#039;s <i>Tablet</i>, this has been the most controversial subject of his tenure so far. It may be thought that that is unsurprising, given 9/11, Iraq and all that has followed; but that is no reason for running away from the subject&#151;and we did not. Although the BBC already covers that ground with a range of programmes, our recommendations stressed the importance of using a wide definition of religion throughout the different genres. We stressed, too, that the BBC needs to search for ever more innovative and informative ways to tackle issues of religion, spirituality, ethics and values.
</p>

<a name="60327-30_para22"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_113"></a>There was concern also about news programmes, as the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester pointed out. The lack of people with sufficient expert knowledge to be able to give audiences the background knowledge to understand the context of the story must be remedied. Living as we do in increasingly multi-cultural and multi-faith communities, helping to create an atmosphere of understanding, respect and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC255"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column GC255</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

tolerance for each others&#039; religious and spiritual views, is surely the most important contribution that the BBC and other public service broadcasters can make. Thankfully, we have seen recently some hopeful signs of collaboration on admitting a percentage of non-faith children to faith schools. If that can be combined with a determined effort by the leaders of each religion to make clear the central values and beliefs of each religion, and if we can all work harder to achieve understanding and harmony&#151;as the Prince of Wales said in Cairo, that ancient heart of Muslim learning a few days ago&#151;I hope that the power and influence of the extremists will begin to diminish at last. The public service obligations of the BBC should be right at the heart of that process.
</p>

<a name="60327-30_para23"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_114"></a>We are all signed up as BBC groupies, but the BBC must be seen to perform within today&#039;s very relevant expectations of openness and independence.

<a name="60327-31_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Macdonald of Tradeston: </b>   I congratulate the Select Committee, in particular its chairman, the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, on the breadth, quality and insight of its reports. As a former broadcaster, I was tempted to opine on almost every issue covered, but today I shall touch only on the broadcasting of religion. I declare an interest as chairman of the Parliamentary Humanist Group, so perhaps I can expand on a few of the matters about which my noble friends Lord Peston and Lord Maxton, in the interests of unanimity, said a little less than perhaps they might have.
</p>

<a name="60327-31_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_115"></a>I started my broadcasting career over 40 years ago on a religious programme, &quot;Sunday Break&quot;. Subsequently, in my work for almost 20 years with Granada in Manchester and for 13 years with Scottish Television in Glasgow, at times I had the benefit of having my own committee of religious advisers, as I was responsible for religious broadcasting. We had extremely good relations, despite the fact that my secular beliefs were clearly declared. We worked very well together and made a number of excellent series. One reason was that we had a shared interest in many areas of ethics, social matters and spirituality and so on. Then, and more so now, in television the squeeze on the time available for slots that cover issues of that kind was increasingly intense, and of course we were always the poor relations when it came to budgeting. So, in some ways, I want to make a common cause here.
</p>

<a name="60327-31_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_116"></a>I welcome very much what the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, said in her excellent contribution and I hope to build on some of her remarks. The Communications Act 2003 gives the BBC a duty to make programmes on &quot;religion and other beliefs&quot;. In the debates on the Communications Bill, it was made clear that that included non-religious beliefs, such as humanist ones. It was also made clear by the Minister of the day, my noble friend Lord McIntosh.
</p>

<a name="60327-31_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_117"></a>However, that duty does not seem to be taken seriously by the BBC as it relates to programmes about non-religious beliefs, such as humanism. The British Humanist Association has entered into <br>&nbsp;<br>

correspondence with the BBC since the Communications Act received Royal Assent. The repeated response to the request that non-religious and religious beliefs be given equal time in broadcasting is that most of the BBC&#039;s programming is secular. That seems to me to miss the point entirely. It suggests that non-religious licence-fee payers who want programmes on their beliefs of an equivalent depth to programmes on religious beliefs should somehow be satisfied with secular game shows, dramas and soap operas.
</p>

<a name="60327-31_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_118"></a>The recommendation of the Select Committee that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_17"></a>&quot;the BBC should review its programme output to ensure that it complies with the Communications Act 2003 by providing services of a suitable quality and range dealing with religion and other beliefs&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-31_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_119"></a>is welcome in that it urges the BBC to meet its obligations in relation to those &quot;other beliefs&quot;. But the concern must be that the BBC will not be responsive. Dealing with it in the past gives good reason for pessimism.
</p>

<a name="60327-31_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_120"></a>On the question of the broadcasting of non-religious beliefs as part of a public service, people with humanist beliefs are not seeking any privileges. Correspondingly, we are concerned that those privileges are accorded to the adherents of religion simply by virtue of their beliefs. There are two major institutional examples of that kind of privilege being granted to religion. One is the education system and the other is the BBC.
</p>

<a name="60327-31_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_121"></a>Broadcasting offers by far the most important means for members of a modern, open society to communicate with each other and jointly address the challenges that face them. A large number of people in the United Kingdom are non-religious. A rather loaded question in the 2001 census put our number at over 15 per cent of the population&#151;around 10 million. But other polls and surveys consistently put the number higher&#151;at around 25 per cent of the population, especially among the young. These people are leading their lives according to non-religious principles, but I believe they are just as entitled to have programmes that speak to them as are the religious people. Does the BBC assume that none of those millions has any interest in exploring what it means to live a life without religion, to find non-religious answers to the so-called &quot;ultimate questions&quot; and to articulate a non-religious basis for morality? It would seem so from its failure to provide any platform for such exercises, even while it continues to give a great deal of time to religion in many matters.
</p>

<a name="60327-31_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_122"></a>The programmes that we seek would not be attacks on religion but reflections on the basis of a secular morality, on particular moral issues, on a secular spirituality and on living a non-religious life, drawing on the tradition of non-religious life-stances from ancient times down to the present day. I believe that such programmes would help the large number of people who do not hold religious beliefs to explore what they do believe and how those beliefs affect the way they lead their lives. They could be expected in a small way to yield a social dividend&#151;to help social <br>&nbsp;<br>

cohesion and commitment and to combat the moral anomie, cynicism and selfishness that some commentators perceive in modern society.
</p>

<a name="60327-31_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_123"></a>There are now many non-Christian religions and a far greater disparity within Christianity than Lord Reith could ever have dreamed of, let alone a popular renunciation of religion as a guiding force that would have alarmed him severely. There are also increasing numbers of people who are not renouncing religion but are simply growing up with a totally non-religious world view. I speak as someone who was brought up as an atheist, although my free-thinking parents insisted that I spent a great deal of my childhood at Bible class, the Boys&#039; Brigade and Church of Scotland lectures, none of which I regret, but I came back to an atheistic view of the world and have maintained that. The BBC needs to regain its balance and neutrality by extending its programming to those citizens&#039; beliefs and to include secular life-stances such as humanism in its coverage.
</p>

<a name="60327-31_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_124"></a>I shall finish on the question of the Central Religious Advisory Committee, or CRAC. As I said earlier, I had at my disposal committees of religious advisers. In Manchester, as I recall, we had Anglican, non-conformist and Catholic advisers. When I went to Scotland, we had Church of Scotland, non-conformist and Catholic advisers and, indeed, people from the &quot;Wee Free&quot; Church in Scotland. But even the Wee Free man was very consensual in his approach. Noble Lords will find that the religion that comes out of CRAC and elsewhere is very much middle of the road. Perhaps noble Lords would argue that there are no problems with that, but they would find very few &quot;holy rollers&quot; and very little fire and brimstone emanating from the religious committees in which I was involved, and I imagine that the same will be true of CRAC.
</p>

<a name="60327-31_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_125"></a>In the light of the Human Rights Act, which makes discrimination between people on the grounds of their religious or non-religious beliefs illegal, and in the light of the Communications Act, which does not give the BBC an obligation relating to &quot;religion&quot; but to &quot;religion and other beliefs&quot;, it is surely clear that the Central Religious Advisory Committee should have humanist representation on it. Speaking from my own experience, I would say that our presence might actually help to make the slots more attractive by broadening their appeal. Sadly, the BBC has not offered such representation, so it is a disappointment to me that the Select Committee&#039;s recommendations on CRAC do not engage with this issue.

</p>

<a name="60327-31_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_126"></a>My noble friend Lord King has pre-empted some of my comments but he has generously allowed me certain scope. However, as I am speaking on a single issue, I should like to put some meat on the bones of my contention and refer in particular to the DCMS review of the BBC Royal Charter and the draft charter and framework agreement, which sets out the constitution of the proposed trust board and executive board.
</p>

<a name="60327-31_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_127"></a>It is an interesting paper. It flies in the face of all known experience in this field. It flies in the face of the recommendations of our BBC Charter Review Committee, and it flies in the face of virtually everyone we interviewed, including the former chairman of the BBC. Their views ranged from trenchant criticism to damning by faint praise. I think it was fair to say that the noble Lord, Lord Birt, whom we interviewed only this week, was slightly more enigmatic, and I mention that in fairness.
</p>

<a name="60327-31_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_128"></a>As noble Lords are aware, the management of the BBC is to be changed from a single unitary board into a dual structure, with a top tier named the BBC Trust. It is accepted in the document that the word &quot;trust&quot; is not necessarily the correct one but it is being used in a colloquial sense, whatever that means in this context. It hints that a better name could be used and I shall try to oblige during the course of my remarks.
</p>

<a name="60327-31_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_129"></a>The purpose of the trust is to direct and monitor the activities of the BBC executive board. The list of the trust&#039;s functions include: to approve; to assess proposals; to assess performance; to define performance; to issue licences; to discharge; to hold to account; to set the framework; to conduct investigations&#151;that is mentioned twice&#151;to commission value for money; and, to ensure. Those words seem to be given out of context, but they are unambivalent in authority. These are deep and intrusive responsibilities. The role allows little discretion for subsidiarity. So perhaps it would be better if we started now by redefining the name of the trust to something more appropriate to its role. The word &quot;distrust&quot; somehow comes to mind. In truth, the trust is a pure regulatory body, appointed by the Government, and it would be disingenuous to call it anything else. A regulator by any other name does not smell like a rose.
</p>

<a name="60327-31_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_130"></a> The trust sits over the BBC board. It appoints a chairman and, if one has doubts about the trust, they bear comparison to those about the complexity of the BBC board itself. The executive board will be appointed and will include, <i>inter alia</i>, four non-executive directors. That is a revolution&#151;a first time&#151;a completely novel way in which to run a large institution. It is a ground-breaking, breath-taking phenomenon: non-executives being appointed to an executive board. My research through the panorama of UK companies showed that a non-executive on an executive board is about as rare as finding an unleaking Thames water main. It is a contradiction in terms. I am a strong believer in non-executive directors, as they bring a fresh view and skill to the top <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC259"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column GC259</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

table, but that role is totally neutralised and absolutely redundant if they will inevitably have thrust upon them executive involvement and, by implication, responsibility. It is an impossible scenario and should be so recognised.
</p>

<a name="60327-31_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_131"></a> I turn to the role of the board. The chairman and the executives, plus their sad passengers, have to submit to the trust or regulatory board virtually every detail of their management&#151;their strategy and their operation. So to allow the trust to be in a position of judgment, the trust itself is recruiting is own substantial bureaucracy; when I first inquired, several months ago, it had reached 40 senior personnel, and was still growing like Topsy. Their function will be to ensure that nothing escapes their eagle eye as to the budget, the performance criteria and the guidelines covered under the headline words that I mentioned previously. Virtually nothing is outside their remit.
</p>

<a name="60327-31_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_132"></a> We have this extraordinary scenario in which the BBC executive and a large panoply of planners and budgeteers is fighting tooth and nail with another group of bureaucrats above them&#151;the one below to get as much as possible, the one above to keep as tight a rein as possible. A great new corporate game is being established within the same organisation. The cost, the time, the delay, the process are the original ingredients of nightmares. The dynamics of the creativity of the BBC are becoming stuck in the morass of procedure. It is an extraordinary, useless waste of effort.
</p>

<a name="60327-31_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_133"></a>It is worth reflecting why this Frankenstein was created. Apparently, it was felt that the BBC was not independent enough of its own organisation&#151;and the recent Kelly case seemed to indicate a prima facie case. The remedy would have been simplicity itself: an experienced chairman of any large company would have found a simplistic but robust procedure within the organisation to deal with what was clearly a defective process. A repair job was needed, not major surgery. But unfortunately the issue was a godsend to a bureaucratic mindset within the DCMS, and the BBC has had imposed upon it a suffocating regulatory straitjacket. I believe that the Secretary of State must be responsible, once again, for not seeing through the implications of her proposals.
</p>

<a name="60327-31_para19"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_134"></a>The first question is: will it work? Of course it will work. Things work. Institutions work. It will be dramatically more expensive but that will be just another cost added. It will be monstrously inefficient, but that is also just another cost added. It will be a poisonous atmosphere, but that will affect only the players. Will it affect the quality of the BBC? I believe that that is inevitable.
</p>

<a name="60327-31_para20"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_135"></a>Equally disturbing is that it sets an example of political incompetence, governmental interference and ministerial autocracy over a great British institution, which I hoped were no longer on the agenda&#151;at least, I did before I was privileged to join the Select Committee.
</p>

<a name="60327-31_para21"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_136"></a>I conclude on a happier note. As a connoisseur of chairmen and chairmanship, I compliment my noble friend Lord Fowler on leading the committee in a <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="gc_st_13"></a>
<a name="60327-32_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Barnett: </b>   I also congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, and the committee. I congratulate the noble Lord in one respect in particular. Anyone who can achieve the huge result of obtaining the support of my noble friend Lord Peston, let alone getting the agreement of a whole Select Committee, is, frankly, remarkable and deserves our congratulations.
</p>

<a name="60327-32_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_137"></a>Where I agree with the White Paper, I shall say just a couple of words because I want to be brief&#151;and can be in my support of the White Paper. I strongly welcome charter renewal. I also welcome the BBC move to Manchester, but for slightly different reasons from the right reverend Prelate. I was born in Manchester and have lived there all my life. Indeed, I regularly drive past the residence of the right reverend Prelate. I say that I have lived all my life in Manchester but for 42 years I have lived in the centre of London&#151;namely, around Parliament&#151;as my wife constantly tells me.
</p>

<a name="60327-32_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_138"></a>Those are the two points on which I strongly agree with the White Paper but I hope that my noble friend Lord Davies will understand if I tell him that I believe the rest of the White Paper is a waffle&#151;almost throughout. I know that he will forgive me for saying that because we are very good friends. I say that it is all a waffle for one simple reason, although there are a number.
</p>

<a name="60327-32_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_139"></a>First, we are told that there is a triple-lock system, the first of which is that the trust will issue licences. My experience of the board of governors and the board of management is that effectively they were already doing that job. I speak from experience, in particular, of the time when the noble Lord, Lord Hussey, was chairman and I was vice-chairman. Unfortunately the noble Lord, Lord Hussey, is too ill to be here today; I am sure we all regret that. In my experience, the board of management did its job, as I assume the executive under this so-called triple-lock system will do, and the board of governors did the job of the trustees. So there is no need whatever for this change.
</p>

<a name="60327-32_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_140"></a>Secondly, we are told that the BBC will have to have distinctive characteristics, such as being original, of high quality, challenging or innovative. It always did have those characteristics. There is nothing new in this triple-lock system. Thirdly, there will be a &quot;public value test&quot;. That is a meaningless phrase and we all know that it is.
</p>

<a name="60327-32_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_141"></a>We are told on page 9 of the White Paper that there will be six public purposes for the BBC: sustaining citizenship and civil society; promoting education and learning; stimulating creativity and cultural excellence; reflecting the UK&#039;s nations, regions and communities; and bringing the world to the UK and the UK to the world. The BBC always did all those things and did them very well. The only one of the six points that it did not do is &quot;Building Digital Britain&quot;, and I agree wholeheartedly with the committee that it <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC261"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column GC261</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

is not a matter for the BBC to build a digital Britain&#151;it is a matter for the taxpayer to decide how it should build a digital Britain. The committee was absolutely right in that regard.
</p>

<a name="60327-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_142"></a> When I said that it is something of a waffle, I think that I underestimated&#151;as my noble friend Lord Davies would say I always do&#151;that each programme should have at least one of the characteristics set out on page 11, and that it should have it in mind to achieve every one of them. What about repeats? Will the repeats have to achieve that, and how often will they have to repeat them? I must say that, having often missed some of the programmes the first time, some of the repeats&#151;especially the comedy programmes&#151;I enjoy very much indeed; but they are hardly new. The fact that I enjoy them is not really important.
</p>

<a name="60327-32_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_143"></a>The other point, made in paragraph 3.1.7 in the report, is that the BBC should not always chase ratings. The Select Committee got it right when it referred to the fact that the BBC should not be confined to &quot;worthy&quot; programmes. Of course it should not. If they pursued their programmes in that way, the net result would be that they would lose audience figures and there would be a huge clamour that the BBC should be cut down to the size of their audience. So it is to create a vicious circle to suggest that they should not chase ratings.
</p>

<a name="60327-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_144"></a>We are also told, in paragraph 3.2.2, that &quot;accuracy and impartiality&quot; are important. I am not sure how the average BBC viewer and listener is able to decide what is accurate and impartial, given that the vast majority of our fellow citizens mainly read the tabloids&#151;if read is the right word. So I am not sure how they will know, in the same way, of course, as we in Parliament obviously know, what is accurate and impartial. I know when I listen to the &quot;Today&quot; programme whether it is accurate and impartial because I know exactly what they are talking about.
</p>

<a name="60327-32_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_145"></a>The big issue is the significant issue of the independence of the BBC. To me that is vital. I raise the issue of the Office for National Statistics saying the licence fee was a tax, as I did when the Statement was repeated on 14 March by my noble friend. I hope my noble friend will forgive me if I say that his reply, in col. 41 of <i>Hansard</i>, was not a waffle&#151;it was something worse than that. Certainly, it was not a reply to the issue. If the licence fee is a tax, all the expenditure is public expenditure. Perhaps all my years in the Treasury were a waste of time, but I put down some Written Questions to get a more realistic reply to the issue, and I got some replies, from my noble friend Lord McKenzie of Luton. It is worth reading one of them, at least. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_18"></a>&quot;The process by which the BBC licence fee is raised and the proceeds passed on to the BBC is unaffected by the ONS decision&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-32_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_146"></a>Well, that is a straight statement. But then it goes on to say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_19"></a>&quot;The decision does mean that, for the purposes of national accounts and Treasury spending presentations, the current expenditure of the BBC is added to measures of public spending <br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_GC262"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column GC262</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>as part of annually managed expenditure. BBC capital expenditure has, in any case, historically been included in measures of public expenditure&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 21/3/06; col. WA28.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-32_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_147"></a>It is conceded that it is current expenditure, so who decided that it is not a matter for the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee? I would not have thought it was a matter for the Treasury. It is a matter for Parliament, for the House of Commons, to decide on that.
</p>

<a name="60327-32_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_148"></a>So what does that mean? I suppose it is asking a lot of my noble friend to reply on behalf of the Treasury as well. I ask him to send me a letter and publish it in the Library some time or other to try and get some clarity about exactly what the Government mean if they agree with the ONS that it is public expenditure. Neither my noble friend Lord Davies in his reply on 14 March nor the Written Answers answer the question. To me the answers I have had from the Treasury&#151;and I have had a number of others I will not bother quoting&#151;are, frankly, gobbledegook. How can it be one and not the other? No doubt I will get a reply at some point, and I look forward to it with great pleasure.
</p>

<a name="60327-32_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_149"></a>The real question is about the independence of the BBC, about which I care desperately. It is a tricky issue. If we are going to have some degree of parliamentary control&#151;with which I agree as a parliamentarian, but am worried about as a former vice-chairman of the BBC&#151;how on earth do we get that kind of independence?  I am not convinced we should have it on a statutory basis instead of a Royal Charter. I am not at all certain that that is a good way of achieving true independence for the BBC. Indeed, if one did that, there would be a danger of risking parliamentary interference on a day-to-day basis. I am very worried about that.
</p>

<a name="60327-32_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_150"></a>I cannot say I have an actual answer, but, when a new charter is going to be set up for 10 years, the Committee is right to say that Parliament must have a say in how that kind of money is spent. The BBC&#039;s estimate of how it will spend money in Manchester is far from clear. Indeed, I fear that many senior executives at the BBC are unhappy about going to Manchester, and are delaying it and putting out ridiculous cost figures. If I may say so, they are quite wrong. Manchester is a booming city, and would be a wonderful place for BBC management to go to.
</p>

<a name="60327-32_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_151"></a>I am unhappy about the White Paper generally. I am unhappy about the incoherent replies&#151;if I may put it so moderately&#151;we have had so far. I hope that in its charter renewal the BBC will be sensible in its demands on costs.

<a name="60327-32_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Lyell: </b>   If your Lordships glance down the list of speakers, you will find me attempting to follow the marvellous contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, who has just sat down. First I want to thank my noble friend Lord Fowler, who presented his report so well today and pointed out the opportunity for some of us, who neither are listed as members of his committee nor have enormous experience in <br>&nbsp;<br>

broadcasting or the media, to say our piece. Indeed, I might speak as a founder member of the British association of troublesome Back-Benchers and the British association of couch potatoes, since I split my listening and viewing into two halves.
</p>

<a name="60327-32_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_152"></a>There is one point I wish to make, which luckily has been made by virtually every single speaker today: I want to push my strongest possible support for the BBC World Service. Thirty-five years ago I served on a parliamentary group called the North Atlantic Assembly, a collection of Nato parliamentarians. I, with the late Baroness Bacon and others, were detailed to go and look at what was called the &quot;third basket&quot; at Helsinki and the free flow of information across what was then the Iron Curtain. Part of our studies and deliberations was to look, not at television in those days, but at two particular radio stations: not Voice of America, which we heard about earlier, but Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty. If you mentioned those two stations 25 or 30 years ago to very erudite and sophisticated members of the Russian diplomatic community, you had them half-way to Mars in a frothing rage. Obviously the stations must have been doing something. In the course of my researches, however, every member of the North Atlantic Assembly and the others said, &quot;Go and speak to the BBC World Service&quot;. Up &#039;till then I was not aware of what went on at Bush House.
</p>

<a name="60327-32_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_153"></a>Since 1974-75, I have often been in consultation by telephone, and I receive a plethora of information and invitations to hear what the World Service is doing. Perhaps I should declare an interest, but I am extremely grateful. Until recently I had thought it was purely radio, but of course now my noble friend&#039;s report comes out with BBC World. If I may, though, I will concentrate on the radio aspect. I was fascinated by the figure in paragraph 56 of the report, and no doubt the BBC World Service has it right: 149 million weekly listeners. I do not know quite how they define the grade, personality or class of those listeners, but they all listen to the BBC at some stage, either in English or one of 32 foreign languages. That needs to be treasured and supported.
</p>

<a name="60327-32_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_154"></a>Virtually every one of your Lordships who has spoken today has asked the Minister&#151;and I will add my plea&#151;to see how it can be financed, and stressed that a delicate line needs to be trodden. The noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, wrote in paragraph 63 about underwriting the values. I was waiting for harps to twang in the sky about our democratic institutions&#151;that comes well from a hereditary Peer, but never mind&#151;but I know what he was on about. I hope that if there is one theme that goes out from me and above all from this report, which has been so beautifully presented, it will be: &quot;Take care of the BBC World Service&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60327-32_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_155"></a>I have had several informal meetings at Bush House. One of the aspects that was pointed out to me was that great efforts and technical expertise&#151;and, I hope, great capital expenditure&#151;are being spent, but not on what was called shortwave. A noble colleague was explaining to me at lunch today that many people learn English by hearing: &quot;This is London&quot;, followed by <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC264"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column GC264</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

extensive shortwave interference. Of course you have fun doing that, but the World Service on radio is making priorities of various regional centres where it will be able to have FM transmission. An FM radio&#151;or, as we call them in my neck of the woods north of the Border, as the noble Lords, Lord MacDonald and Lord Gordon, will know, a &quot;tranny&quot;&#151;is not a particularly sophisticated or costly piece of apparatus. Young people&#151;indeed, any people&#151;out in the boondocks of Kazakhstan or Tajikistan, all over the world, or in Africa, will be able to receive free-to-air transmission from the BBC, and it will do extraordinarily well.
</p>

<a name="60327-32_para19"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_156"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Maxton, referred to sport, and was wondering whether the BBC should have a sport channel. As far as I am aware, &quot;Grandstand&quot; and &quot;Ski Sunday&quot; and the other programmes do a superb job. He might remember that one of my passions&#151;indeed, I might encourage him to take part in it with me&#151;is cycling. I am sure he and your Lordships are aware that the 2007 Tour de France is scheduled to start here in London. In 1994 I was extremely lucky: through various methods I had given a cheeky interview to Antenne 2 in French on College Green, and they invited me to follow the Tour de France through Kent. I found the turnout fascinating. Looking through all the volumes of evidence, what will be the bidding procedure for the Tour de France in 2006, let alone in 2007? Thirty-five or 40 years ago the BBC used to do a particularly good series on the Tour de France. Then it got sidelined, sometimes to ITV, then much more to Channel 4, and as far as I am aware it is now only on satellite television, on Eurosport. The Tour de France in London for once in 10 or 15 years will provide a huge amount of interest. I will certainly be fascinated in it.
</p>

<a name="60327-32_para20"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_157"></a> In 1982, at the end of the last weekend in January, there was an interesting climatic change throughout the United Kingdom: hard frost. Not one horse race took place anywhere in the British Isles. The BBC &quot;Grandstand&quot; programme said, &quot;We&#039;ve got a bit of a problem&quot;, but they suddenly made their minds up, looked around Europe, and what did they find? The F&#233;d&#233;ration International de Ski world championships, taking place in Austria. A blue riband event was taking place just then. We watched racers come down. The winner, an Austrian, goes over the finish line, pulls his goggles up, but does not go to his trainer, or his sponsor&#151;he goes straight to the BBC. Why? &quot;Because,&quot; the BBC told me, &quot;we have very good relationships with these athletes and their association. Apparently they wish to learn English, and they regard the BBC as being their channel&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60327-32_para21"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_158"></a>That was 1982. The BBC certainly still does a very good job, and I congratulate it on what it has done with the Winter Olympics. I wish that coverage could have continued, but the BBC has moved on to Melbourne for the Commonwealth Games, which is fair enough. That was of great interest to me, and showed what the BBC can do. That is its reputation all over. I was fascinated by the opening comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Bonham-Carter, who referred to religion and sport. I thought there was some <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC265"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column GC265</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

separation. The three Scots among us&#151;the noble Lords, Lord Gordon, Lord MacDonald and Lord Maxton&#151;can take her up any Saturday afternoon and she will find a very healthy, perhaps even censored mixture of that. I will not denote the colours.
</p>

<a name="60327-32_para22"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_159"></a>I was interested by the noble Lord, Lord MacDonald, and his views on religion. As far as I am concerned, there is a button with three letters: &quot;OFF&quot;. If I have had enough, I can turn that. Also, when I was serving in Northern Ireland under my absent noble friend Lord King&#151;who, perhaps rightly, has vacated his seat when I was intending to quote him&#151;one of the esteemed Members of another place would always attempt to attack me early in the morning. I learned a very useful phrase, which will be relevant to the noble Lord, Lord Macdonald of Tradeston: Matthew 22:21. This is not a ping-pong score, but a reference to, &quot;Render unto Caesar what is Caesar&#039;s&quot;. The honourable Member said to me, &quot;You are not God&quot;, and I replied that too many people thought that he was. That always terminated the interview. It is a very useful thought. I note that in the conclusion of the report summary that religion should be there.
</p>

<a name="60327-32_para23"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_160"></a>I hope my noble friend, the Minister and the BBC, will guard and watch over the BBC World Service for the next 40 years and more. If it develops into television, that is fine. But let us slowly take the first steps of radio, of speaking to people who might not have all the apparatus and for various reasons might be blanked out. It is quite difficult to blank out radio late at night. It is certainly possible that the BBC World Service will continue to develop their broadcasts and production in regional centres, with FM where it is possible. I conclude by thanking my noble friend for his excellent report.

In the first debate I congratulated its members on dividing the task among themselves admirably so that no one covered the same ground as another.

</p>

<a name="60327-33_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_162"></a>There are quite a lot of similarities between then and now. We were debating then the draft BBC charter agreement. We were probably a little further ahead in the programme that year than we are this year as the Government were presenting the full agreement to the House of Lords. The issues were the same: governance and accountability. Something else had not changed. One of the speakers said how convenient it was that, in the following week, the Second Reading of the Broadcasting Bill would take place, when the rest of broadcasting would be discussed. Even then, there was a polarisation between the BBC and the rest of broadcasting.
</p>

<a name="60327-33_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_163"></a>I thought that we had all taken part a few years ago in a great debate on creating Ofcom, which was to be the single regulator for the whole of broadcasting except the BBC. I have always felt that it would genuinely be in the BBC&#039;s own interests to be fully under Ofcom. It would be more independent under Ofcom than it is under what I must agree is an unhappy compromise. During the debates, I was sometimes given pause for thought by governors of the BBC who said, &quot;Look, being a governor from the inside enables you to influence decisions much more could than a regulator from the outside&quot;. There is an element of truth in that. However, now that we have distanced the governors and trustees from the day-to-day running, we have lost the one advantage that we might have had and yet not attained the total separation which most people would like to see.
</p>

<a name="60327-33_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_164"></a>However, I think that the Government have made up their minds on this. I take some heart from the evidence of the noble Lord, Lord Birt, to your Lordships&#039; committee, which I watched on television on Sunday night. It is perhaps an indicator of how poor terrestrial television is at that time on a Sunday night that I had to fiddle around before I came by accident on an excellent Sitting of the committee. He made the point that even a bad system will work with good people. I think that it is a bad system, but I am prepared to give it the benefit of the doubt and hope that we manage to stagger through. Most people recognise that it is fraught with difficulties. There is also a danger of the trustees thinking that value-added bit outweighs the market impact assessment will be conducted by Ofcom. That is a recipe for conflict in the future. We should be careful about that.
</p>

<a name="60327-33_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_165"></a>I disagree with the committee on a couple of matters. I agree that the lack of parliamentary scrutiny is unfortunate, but I do not really want a BBC statute to be debated line by line. I prefer the Royal Charter. What tipped me more enthusiastically in that direction was the ONS now classifying the licence fee as a tax. I am nervous about the BBC being regarded as an arm of government. Let us therefore make it a bit different and keep the Royal Charter. There is a real advantage in that. Let us be honest, it is not simply the other end. When the Communications Bill was going through this place, some people wanted to add in to the public service obligations things such as showing plays in local dialogue, and all those other nice things to which nobody can object. As the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, pointed out, none of the aims have changed. When the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC267"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column GC267</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

BBC&#039;s mission was three simple words, &quot;inform, educate and entertain&quot;, it did all those things. Not only the BBC did them; ITV did them as well. Adding words makes politicians feel good about themselves, but it does not change anything. Indeed, it can change things slightly for the worse. I take the example of corporate governance&#151;I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Kalms, will agree with me. Under the old code, a director had to be independent and to have no conflicting relationship with the company or its executives. The rest was left up to common sense. Now a director must be independent of judgment and character, but nine little things are listed which could create a conflict.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_166"></a>We live in an audit society which does not like making value judgments about anything. &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; are words that we do not like to use. We love just ticking boxes. Instead of making a judgment about somebody&#039;s independence, we say, &quot;Ah, he&#039;s been on more than nine years. Tick a box and he&#039;s out&quot;. This is daft. I am worried that the same thing could happen to public service broadcasting if we add too many words. The more boxes there are to be ticked, the shallower the scrutiny of that box will be. There is a danger that we will end up just ticking.
</p>

<a name="60327-33_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_167"></a>The size of the licence fee is still a matter for negotiation, but I imagine that most people want to get their blows in early, as it were, so that the Government can take account of the likely reaction to whatever proposals they come up with. The important thing is what the BBC is doing, but that is a very difficult problem. The BBC&#039;s programming in the morning is given over almost entirely to home improvement. There is nothing wrong with that, but what is the follow-through? Would it be feasible for the BBC to franchise or endorse shops which offer a good home improvement service rather than shops which do not? Could the BBC even get into the estate agency business? We would all say, &quot;Don&#039;t be ridiculous&quot;, but why is the BBC publishing guidance on local areas? Is that its job? The BBC would do its job very well and be inspired entirely by public service motives, but it would also crowd other people out of the market and, as the noble Lord, Lord Birt, pointed out in his evidence to your Lordships, be left with a monopoly on public service broadcasting. That would be regrettable.
</p>

<a name="60327-33_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_168"></a>As has already been said, the National Audit Office should look at the size of the licence fee. The fact that the estimated cost of the move to Manchester came down from &#163;600 million to &#163;400 million implies a casual approach to money which would shock people. The BBC would be safer if it had the endorsement of the NAO and people could say, &quot;This is what it will actually cost&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60327-33_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_169"></a>I am not sure that I agree with the committee on building digital Britain. Let us remember that one of the key objectives of public service broadcasting is universality of provision. In the old days, the BBC and the IBA owned the transmitters. In digital Britain, it is question of owning the multiplexes, which is an extension of a practice that takes place already. I agree that helping with the cost of switchover should fall <br>&nbsp;<br>

under social security provision and be borne by the Government. I endorse a lot of what the committee said about that.
</p>

<a name="60327-33_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_170"></a>I would go further than the committee on charging for spectrum. It made the point that it would be unfair to the BBC and make the licence fee too large, which could be a problem next time around when people begin to question whether they should pay a licence fee. However, for the BBC charging for spectrum is just a book entry. The licence fee goes up and that money goes to the Treasury. What about ITV? Who is paying ITV&#039;s spectrum charge? There was a time when, apart from those who believed in the Kingdom of Heaven&#151;who seem to be a minority in this Room&#151;and wanted to make good programmes for their own sake, broadcasters were encouraged to make good programmes in the secure knowledge that they would lose their licence if they did not. That threat is no longer real because technology has changed it all. The only lever that Ofcom has is the prospect of free spectrum if a broadcaster fulfils certain public service obligations and paid-for spectrum if it does not. That is an incentive for broadcasters to do good when they might not otherwise be motivated so to do. It is therefore in the public interest.
</p>

<a name="60327-33_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_171"></a>On listed events, I shall say a brief word because, apart from having had to negotiate them when I was running some broadcasting stations, I also chaired the committee on listed events which, I am afraid, moved cricket from list A on to list B. But the important thing about that committee was the creation of list B, which has not been utilised by broadcasters as much as it could have been. I think that Ofcom came out with a ruling that the broadcast of list B events could occur as little as an hour after the event was over. So, even if it was live on Sky, cable or pay-per-view, within an hour the whole thing could be broadcast on terrestrial virtually live. That is quite important and should be utilised more by broadcasters.
</p>

<a name="60327-33_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_172"></a> Our argument about cricket was vindicated entirely by the evidence that your Lordships received. The BBC said that it presented scheduling difficulties. So why the blazes did the BBC insist that it alone could broadcast the cricket, when it clearly could not do so for perfectly understandable scheduling reasons?
</p>

<a name="60327-33_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_173"></a> I, like most of your Lordships, have had briefings from my former colleagues in radio and commercial television, and much of it I feel sympathy with because undoubtedly the dice will now be loaded very much on the BBC&#039;s side if the Government go with the BBC&#039;s licence demands. The present licence fee settlement is a little over-generous and has also coincided with a big downturn in advertising. But broadcasters in the commercial sector must realise that their real problem is not the BBC or even Sky but the fragmentation of the industry. No one in government or Ofcom seems to be taking an overview and saying, &quot;Hold on, enough is enough. We actually cannot finance more broadcasts of television or radio services&quot;. Logically, that point must come.
</p>

<a name="60327-33_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_174"></a>The danger is that we are also ending up with a situation in which broadcasting itself is under question. The concept of broadcasting, whereby <br>&nbsp;<br>

someone at the centre gives the audience what they think they should have as well as what they want, has been replaced by a world in which technology has created the opportunity for the viewer to demand what he wants when he wants it, right away. In those situations, a lot of public service obligations become meaningless because you simply cannot enforce them. I hope that the committee will consider that issue in a future report.

<a name="60327-34_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McNally: </b>   This is the first speech that I have made in this forum. I am reminded of the American comment that there has not been so much talent round one table since Thomas Jefferson dined alone. It has certainly made me a convert to the Grand Committee system; I was one of those who were hard to convince, but today&#039;s debate has shown that it can be extremely useful.
</p>

<a name="60327-34_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_175"></a>I am pleased, as always, to follow the noble Lord, Lord Gordon of Strathblane. In the years since I have been in the House, we have taken part in many debates about broadcasting. I am afraid he has still not convinced me that we should give Ofcom the wide-ranging powers that he wants. Ofcom is an excellent regulator for free market broadcasting but it is not equipped psychologically to oversee public service broadcasting. That remains my conviction.
</p>

<a name="60327-34_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_176"></a>I am very proud of the committee. One of the responsibilities that I had when I became leader of the Liberal Democrats was to go into one of the backroom committees that makes decisions. I found that there was quite a resistance among the powers that be to setting up this committee and, in particular, some harsh words were said about the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, who persisted in arguing for it. I hope that my presence on the committee helped to change the view so that it was established.
</p>

<a name="60327-34_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_177"></a>I was also pleased to see that the powers that be suggested the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, as chairman of the committee. I do not think that I am revealing any secrets to suggest that there was a feeling that putting such a dangerous radical at the head of the committee might result in too heady a brew, but the decision has been fully vindicated. The noble Lord has proved that the committee has not been an uncritical cheerleader for the BBC, as he put it. In that respect, I fully commend the work of the committee and I commend the noble Lord for resisting the blandishments of the Abolish the BBC campaign.
</p>

<a name="60327-34_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_178"></a>In the main, I am pleased that the committee&#039;s key recommendation is supportive of the continuance of the BBC supported by the licence fee. It is worth reminding ourselves in a body such as this that not only the Abolish the BBC people are at work out there; there is a large range of vested interests that want to see a smaller and weaker BBC because of their own vested interests, and we have to be ready to repel such attacks for that reason.
</p>

<a name="60327-34_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_179"></a> Most people still feel uncomfortable with the charter process, and it seems ridiculous that Parliament is left shouting its comments over a high <br>&nbsp;<br>

wall as the charter unfolds. But I can understand the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Barnett&#151;I think that the noble Lord, Lord Gordon, said as much as well&#151;that going straight across to a kind of parliamentary Bill scrutiny also has dangers. When the noble Lord, Lord Thomson of Monifieth, was chairman of the IBA, and after a round of dishing out ITV licences, he memorably said that there must be a better way. The result was the auction, which was quite clearly not a better way. So when we are looking for a better way, we must be clear about not ending up with something infinitely worse than we started with.
</p>

<a name="60327-34_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_180"></a> There is no doubt that the decision that we are taking about the BBC is one of the most important public policy decisions that we shall have to take in the first decade of this century. I very much agree with the noble Lord, Lord Sheldon, and I have often said it myself: in Britain the two great gifts of the 20th century and into the 21st have been the high-quality Civil Service and the BBC. It is against the backdrop of that great inheritance that we must look at the various proposals for change.
</p>

<a name="60327-34_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_181"></a> Where I disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Gordon, and where I always start when discussing the BBC, is that we must realise that the BBC represents a distortion of the market. I understand why market-driven competitors complain about the BBC, but they in turn must realise that, over the decades, successive British governments and parliaments have willed it that way. We want a large distortion of our market to underpin public service broadcasting, and we believe that public service broadcasting is not simply a marginal activity. Whether Rupert Murdoch ever actually said that public service broadcasting was simply a definition of market failure, I do not know; but it certainly represents more than just the bits that the market is unwilling or unable to fulfil. It has a large, immediate and beneficial impact on news and current affairs, on cultural quality and diversity, on regional voice and, as has been said by so many speakers today, on our international reputation. It is no surprise that the BBC is one of the best recognised and most trusted brand names in the world, rivalling, I think, only Coca-Cola in terms of international recognition.

</p>

<a name="60327-34_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_182"></a>I disagreed with the committee to some extent about top-slicing and bottom-slicing the licence fee, which worries me. Nearly 30 years ago, the then Prime Minister, Jim Callaghan, asked me to look at whether there was an alternative to the licence fee. I spent a happy few weeks talking to various people before returning to the conclusion that there was not. I am still worried that if we start to move away from the unique purpose of the licence fee, it will be diluted for one reason or another. I share the committee&#039;s concern about the licence fee being used for non-core activities. I am always worried that the Treasury, once it finds an effective stealth tax, will revisit that well time and again.
</p>

<a name="60327-34_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_183"></a>That is one kind of slicing that I am worried about; the other is the kind which the committee seems to favour and which has emerged time and again during the past 20 years; namely, that you can somehow use <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC271"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column GC271</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

part of the licence fee to fund other aspects of public service broadcasting by other broadcasters&#151;for example, an Arts Council of the air and so on. Once you start doing that, you are chipping away at what is the essential strength of the licence fee: that it is for a specific purpose. It should be retained as such.
</p>

<a name="60327-34_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_184"></a>I am not sure that I agree either with the noble Lord, Lord Peston, who said that the present claim has come completely out of the air. The BBC seems to have done a considerable amount of work and given a large amount of evidence to a range of bodies. It seems to have carried out a great deal of consultation in coming up with its request for the licence fee. It is absolutely clear from the documents that it has produced that quality of content will be the test of whether it spends public money well. When I judge the next licence settlement, I look to the view expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Birt, in his evidence to the committee that this country will regret it if the BBC does not remain a well funded organisation. He also advised the committee not to let the BBC wither on the vine. That was wise advice, although he expressed a certain amount of support for putting the money elsewhere.
</p>

<a name="60327-34_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_185"></a>I do not know whether the bid is a little bit of the politics of the souk or a carefully crafted and budgeted examination. The next funding round will have to determine that. I certainly agree with a number of Members of the Committee that the BBC would be strengthened by access by the National Audit Office. Whatever comes out of this round, that case will not go away, and the BBC would be well advised to accept the logic of it.
</p>

<a name="60327-34_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_186"></a>One point made by the noble Lord, Lord Gordon, perhaps tipped the other way the balance of the argument about the BBC&#039;s role in digital switchover; that is, that the BBC has had an excellent record, for almost the whole of its life, in innovation and introducing new systems and new technologies. Therefore, there may be some logic in entrusting the digital switchover to the best in the business.
</p>

<a name="60327-34_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_187"></a>Regarding the move to Manchester, I do not know whether, in watching repeats, the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, has seen the &quot;Yes Minister&quot; episode where Hacker tries to persuade the Ministry of Defence to send its leaders to the north, because he has worked out that that would be where the Russian threat came from, only to find that all the generals prefer to live in Surrey. I hope that the BBC generals do not prefer to live in Surrey, because, as the noble Lord said, there is a wonderful quality of life in Manchester. More than that, nothing would have a greater impact on our cultural life than if we could create another hub, another centre, of creativity outside the M25. That would be one of the greatest benefits. I say in the presence of the noble Lord, Lord Macdonald, that Granada at its greatest, when he was there, had an amazing impact on the whole of that region. The move by the BBC and the continuance of ITV in the north-west would have an impact not only on Manchester, but on creativity outside the M25&#151;and we would all be better for that.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC272"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column GC272</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60327-34_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_188"></a>The other reason why I want to see a well funded BBC&#151;I do not know whether it came to the Secretary of State in a flash or whether it was suggested to her&#151;is that the concept of the licence fee as venture capital for the creative industries was imaginative, and she proposed it as such. It is not a poll tax. If it was properly used and the BBC fulfilled its commitment to quality content, it could be just that. I do not want a BBC that plucks figures out of the air; I want to ensure the Government&#039;s commitment to the future of the BBC.
</p>

<a name="60327-34_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_189"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Birt, has said, the general thrust of the White Paper points in the right direction. It is by no means as bad as some feared; and those of us who set off on this road, determined to keep the BBC as a strong and benign influence in our public service broadcasting, can be well satisfied with the outcome. But the BBC must have the means to achieve, as well as willing, the ends. Therefore, although some of the criticisms of both the nature of the bid and its size may be justified, we must not lose sight of the fact that if we are going to say all these nice things about what the BBC has done and will do, we must provide it with the resources to carry that through.
</p>

<a name="60327-34_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_190"></a>I do not want to go on about Ofcom, but I have concerns about its involvement in the public value test, because the other thing about the BBC over the 80 years of its existence is that it has continued to innovate. Almost every time that it has innovated, people have complained. BBC online is a triumph, yet some people tried to keep it out of that technology. The BBC will wish to introduce future technologies, but I do not want to see Ofcom simply delivering the private sector&#039;s whine of the week. The BBC should continue to have a role in broadcasting innovation.
</p>

<a name="60327-34_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_191"></a>We need to look at how we help and underpin Channel 4&#151;and that would be my next priority. There are suggestions in relation to that regarding the spectrum charge. That may be one way. I am interested in what the noble Lord, Lord Gordon, said about using spectrum charging, or the absence of it, to encourage public service broadcasting elsewhere. That would be far better than raiding the licence fee. Certainly I would like to see the BBC adopt a generosity of spirit in that respect in its relations to Channel 4.
</p>

<a name="60327-34_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_192"></a>As has been repeated time and time again, we have a national asset which is beyond price; a bulwark against malign market influences and a protector of national and regional cultural identities and values. Are there needs for change? Yes. As the noble Lord, Lord Maxton, when he let slip his technology interests, and the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, pointed out, the changes will be vast and we shall have to adjust to them.
</p>

<a name="60327-34_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_193"></a>But we must avoid throwing the baby out with the bathwater. We have to make sure that the BBC continues with its commitment to quality programmes, high-quality training and in-house production. The independent producers have made a very strong case, but I am amazed by how many <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC273"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column GC273</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

independent producers say, &quot;Let me assure you, I know what I am talking about because I was trained by the BBC&quot;. The BBC&#039;s role as a high-quality in-house producer was again demonstrated by &quot;Bleak House&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60327-34_para19"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_194"></a>There have been a number of very wise words as regards this new structure from the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, and the noble Lords, Lord King and Lord Barnett, but definitely from the noble Lord, Lord Kalms. I have often said that, over an 80-year period, the board of governors did not do a bad job. They certainly gave us an institution; an organisation of world-wide renown. As such, as the noble Lord, Lord Kalms, put it, what was needed was a repair job, not major surgery. But we have got major surgery and we will have to see how it works. As I have said before, thus far&#151;and unless there are any nasties lurking for us&#151;we have stood our watch well in that the BBC has a chance to perform the roles we want it to in the decade ahead.
</p>

<a name="60327-34_para20"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_195"></a>I hope this committee will stay in place to follow that progress. If it needs something to do whilst the BBC settles down, perhaps it could look at the role of satellite broadcasting and whether it is providing a public service. No one seems willing to tackle that in the short term, so perhaps that could be the chairman&#039;s next task.

<a name="60327-35_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Luke: </b>   My noble friend Lord Inglewood has asked me to pass on his apologies to the Committee for being unable to attend, despite his great interest in the subject.
</p>

<a name="60327-35_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_196"></a>I thank my noble friend for introducing the debate and, like other speakers, I congratulate both him and his colleagues for the excellent reports they have produced. Their work is of considerable importance and I hope that the Government will take proper account of the recommendations made&#151;although, from reading the White Paper, I am afraid that it seems to be a missed opportunity. In particular, the Government appear to have ignored the demands of the Select Committees of both Houses that the BBC should be governed in future by an Act of Parliament; accountable to Parliament and not just to the government of the day.
</p>

<a name="60327-35_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_197"></a>The argument the Government have put up against an Act of Parliament is that it could be amended during the lifetime of the licence period. That really does not hold water as the Government, obviously, control the parliamentary timetable and therefore can always amend or renew the charter at any time if they want to.
</p>

<a name="60327-35_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_198"></a>I think it has been made clear what a disappointment the White Paper is by the very lukewarm response to it by the media. Is it therefore true that Parliament will not be able to scrutinise or amend the charter or agreement? As we know from my noble friend Lord Fowler, any body incorporated by Royal Charter surrenders power to the Privy Council. Indeed, the Privy Council&#039;s own guidance states:
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC274"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column GC274</b><br>&nbsp;<br>



</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_20"></a>&quot;This effectively means a significant degree of government regulation of the affairs of the body concerned&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60327-35_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_199"></a>So the Government make the rules and appoint the trustees, and it appears that only the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee will be in a position to hold the BBC to limited account after, but not before, the charter and agreement have been put in place. I do not blame the BBC for being put in this position by DCMS. I just hope that it realises now, after all the recent dramas&#151;the loss of its chairman and director-general&#151;the dangers of being too close to government.
</p>

<a name="60327-35_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_200"></a>I do not have to repeat all the good things that have been said about the BBC today. Its importance and qualities are agreed by all. That does not mean we do not think the Government have got it wrong.
</p>

<a name="60327-35_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_201"></a>We should remind ourselves of the BBC&#039;s size and predominance. Ten years ago the BBC&#039;s licence fee income was roughly equivalent to ITV&#039;s advertising revenue. Today it is twice the size, and by the end of the next charter period the licence fee will be larger than the total television advertising revenue in this country, as my noble friend Lord Fowler said. So the public value test and the market impact test will both become increasingly important as the BBC expands into the interactive market and competes with the independent sector. I believe that Ofcom should have some role in that&#151;which is perhaps a controversial remark&#151;but again it seems that the Government have made the BBC judge and jury in its own case.
</p>

<a name="60327-35_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_202"></a>Now that the licence fee has been designated as a tax, we agree with my noble friend Lord King that the National Audit Office should be involved in scrutinising licence fee bids. That should be as open a process as possible. It is particularly important now that the licence fee is also being used to cover the costs of the digital switchover. The licence fee should only rise significantly between charters, as the report recommends, if there are exceptional and well-substantiated reasons for it to do so.
</p>

<a name="60327-35_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_203"></a>The Minister will have the opportunity today to answer some of the questions that he was unable to address during the Statement on the White Paper. When digital switchover arrives, what will be done for those who are unable to receive the signal? What will be done to help those who cannot afford the costs of switchover, particularly the elderly? What will be the cost of any help which might be given? Will those two issues fall under the BBC, or will they be the responsibility of the DCMS?
</p>

<a name="60327-35_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_204"></a>With regard to the proposed spectrum tax, are the estimates of it costing some &#163;300 million correct? Will Channel 4 be exempt? What is the assessment of the likely product of the sale of the analogue spectrum? Clearly it will be a very nice earner for the Treasury and will amount to yet another stealth tax&#151;the very first TV tax. Does the Minister agree with the committee&#039;s report that the BBC should be exempt from any charge on radio spectrum?
</p>

<a name="60327-35_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_205"></a>A great deal has been said today about the BBC World Service. It has been supported strongly by every speaker. It is considered across the world as the voice <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC275"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column GC275</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of reason; the voice of democracy and human rights and the voice of the rule of law. It is a powerful weapon against religious fanaticism and terrorism. It was the ideal of democracy communicated on the BBC World Service and Radio Free Europe that brought about the collapse of the Berlin Wall and everything that stemmed from that. So it is important that the BBC considers expanding its Arabic language service to help the forces of reason and democracy prevail. My noble friend was strongly in favour of such a development.
</p>

<a name="60327-35_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_206"></a>It is estimated that some 1 billion people in the world have access to computers. That number will grow&#151;maybe double or treble&#151;by the end of the new BBC licence period. Through their computers, people will be able to access the World Service, which must be independent and not a tool of government; the quality of its news services must be pre-eminent. We all very much agree with that.
</p>

<a name="60327-35_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_207"></a>Personally, I do not believe that the quality of BBC news in Britain is as good as it was. There appears to be a marked tendency for real news to be more and more subordinated to magazine type programmes, particularly early in the mornings. I find myself increasingly having to switch to the BBC&#039;s 24 hours news service and CNN. This does not seem to be a problem with radio news.
</p>

<a name="60327-35_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_208"></a>Turning to sport, we on these Benches agree that the BBC should play a prominent role in bringing sport to the nation, and we agree with the committee on the regulatory framework for sporting events. However, the BBC must not use the list as a way of cutting fair payment to sporting lobbies for their programme rights. There should be as free competition as possible in bidding for rights, and the BBC must be able to bid to acquire major sports rights packages. Cricket has greatly increased in popularity as a result of winning the Ashes in summer 2005, and it is clear that the BBC has made a bad mistake in not bidding for the upcoming rights to broadcast home test matches.
</p>

<a name="60327-35_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_209"></a>In light of the changed circumstances, might it not be possible to encourage Sky to speak to the BBC and perhaps offer at least some free-to-air coverage? We support the report&#039;s strong recommendation that some home live test cricket should always be available on free-to-air television. As has already been said by other noble Lords, that should encourage the youth of today to get out and play sports. The BBC should also provide a platform for coverage of minority sports, as well as national events.
</p>

<a name="60327-35_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_210"></a>Does the Minister agree with the report&#039;s concerns regarding the Premier League? I understand that the European Commission will shortly end its long-running battle over the sale by the Premier League of television rights. Does the Minister have any further information on that subject?
</p>

<a name="60327-35_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_211"></a>Several noble Lords have referred to religious broadcasting, an issue that this House, in particular, regards as important. The Select Committee report has some interesting recommendations, which I am sure we will all study carefully. It is a fact that Britain is a majority Christian country and, as such, the BBC <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC276"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column GC276</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

should recognise that when promoting religious broadcasting, which we support. We also want to see due consideration given to other religions and beliefs. I should say that, personally, I like &quot;Thought for the Day&quot;. It always makes me think.
</p>

<a name="60327-35_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_212"></a>I hope that the committee will continue its good work. Perhaps I may be so bold as to make a suggestion. The Television Without Frontiers proposed revised directive is being considered by the EU Commission. The directive was last revised in 1997 and the Commission published its formal proposals for revision at the end of last year. We know that the Government have some major reservations about aspects of those proposals because they extend the scope of the directive to cover not only television services but also new media services, including the internet and mobile telephone networks. The worry is that this is another attempt to increase regulation over broadcasting, when the Government agrees with us that there should be less regulation. The Government are concerned, but I suspect they may need all-party support in holding their line&#151;so scrutiny and support from the committee could be very useful.
</p>

<a name="60327-35_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_213"></a>In this ever fast-changing world of multi-channel delivery, content and brand are king. The BBC has both. It is one of the great brands of the world, and we must help it to fulfil its public service broadcasting obligations in the space created by the new media. We must also protect the commercial sector from unfair competition. That is the greatest challenge that will face the BBC, Ofcom and the Government together.

</p>

<a name="60327-35_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_214"></a>The invention of radio did not put newspapers out of business; the advent of television did not put radio out of business; and the new methods of delivery will not put television out of business. They will provide us with new and exciting opportunities. I look forward to the Minister&#039;s reply.

<a name="60327-36_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I am grateful to all noble Lords who have contributed to this excellent debate on the second report and for the chance to extend the remarks I was able to make on the short announcement a few weeks ago. Like everyone else in the Grand Committee, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, both for the way in which he introduced the debate today and his excellent chairmanship of the committee&#151;although I detected from certain contributions that it was not always entirely unanimous in its first propositions, even though everyone signed up to the report at the end.
</p>

<a name="60327-36_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_215"></a>That healthy debate is reflected in the fact that there are different views about key aspects of the BBC. How could there not be over an institution which plays not only a significant role in our national life but in all our personal lives as well? The BBC is one of the most important institutions in the country, and that is why a report of this kind&#151;compiled after many weeks of hard work&#151;needs to be taken seriously. This debate is one earnest of the Government&#039;s intentions in that regard.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC277"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column GC277</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60327-36_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_216"></a>Of course we expect there to be parliamentary debate about the charter and the licence fee&#151;who could prevent Parliament debating those issues? It is not for the Government to dictate to Parliament the terms for debates; issues can be raised from time to time, and are. The difference is that we do not think the BBC&#039;s charter should be subject to parliamentary approval; nor do we think that with regard to the licence fee. We are confident that we take the view that is broadly supported by licence holders throughout the nation.
</p>

<a name="60327-36_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_217"></a>The much-valued independence of the BBC&#151;which all Members of the Committee and all noble Lords who have contributed to the debate have stressed&#151;raises very real issues about the extent to which there should be parliamentary scrutiny and parliamentary control. I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Gordon for expressing his anxieties with regard to the implications of putting the BBC under statute. We are not convinced of the argument. I am conscious, of course, that it was one of the central recommendations of the committee and the Government do not resist it lightly. There are other areas where we take the committee&#039;s views very seriously indeed, but on that central position we take a different view.
</p>

<a name="60327-36_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_218"></a>I also recognise the concerns of Members of the Grand Committee about whether the concept of how the BBC is to be governed is justified by its unique role as an institution in our society. I recognise that there were bound to be criticisms. These were voiced, with a great deal of cogency, by the noble Lord, Lord Kalms, but he was preceded in his expressions of doubt by the noble Lord, Lord King&#151;and, of course, the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, also mentioned in his introductory remarks that this particular model does not exist in private organisations. So it does not. The BBC is not a private organisation; it is not a quango; it is not a non-governmental body&#151;it is a unique institution.
</p>

<a name="60327-36_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_219"></a>So when we recognised&#151;and when I say &quot;we&quot;, I mean not only the Government but the nation&#151;that there were weaknesses in the existing structures of the BBC, and hence the swathe of criticism that occurred during the time of the Hutton report and the difficulties in which the BBC governors, its director-general and its executive found themselves at that time, the view was expressed that the existing model had been tested to breaking point and had been found wanting.
</p>

<a name="60327-36_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_220"></a>I respect the views of my noble friend Lord Barnett. I will deal in a moment with his more particular issue about the inadequacy of Treasury Answers&#151;I could not possibly resist that invitation&#151;but I respect the fact that he played a prominent part in the BBC in the past as vice-chairman in somewhat happier times, when the crisis had not reached quite the dimensions of the time I have just identified. Times change. Institutions need to change their nature of governance if what they have in place does not meet the test of the day. That is why we now believe in distancing those who are responsible for the BBC and hold it to account, in terms of holding its executive to account&#151;the former governing body. The concept of the trust is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC278"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column GC278</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to create a greater distance in those terms. The trust will fulfil its many roles in ensuring that the BBC is fit for purpose.
</p>

<a name="60327-36_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_221"></a>I took note of a number of somewhat derisory comments about the fact that the BBC&#039;s role and objectives were being expressed in fairly generalised terms. My noble friend Lord Barnett actually produced a series of epithets along the lines of &quot;waffle&quot; and &quot;gobbledegook&quot;, and other flattering terms of that kind. When one is talking about the broad objectives of an organisation like the BBC, one is bound to speak in very generalised terms. Of course the objectives will be expressed broadly.
</p>

<a name="60327-36_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_222"></a>Let us not make any mistake about this point: the committee has worked very hard with regard to this report, but the Government were also working hard with regard to our Green Paper and the consultations that took place about that procedure. What we got from that Green Paper, which might have emerged from the committee, I am not too sure, is that it would ill behove the BBC if it did not place entertainment as one of the significant roles it had to play in our society. That is an important consideration. We all recognise how the high standards of the BBC could be debased and dumbed down through crude ratings-chasing, which is rightly subject to criticism, but by the same token it should be recognised that the BBC needs to fulfil every part of the nation&#039;s life. No one need be ashamed of the fact&#151;and I should not think anyone in this room is&#151;that the BBC is a source of entertainment for us all, and so it should be.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_19"></a>
<a name="60327-36_spnew1"></a><b> Lord King of Bridgwater: </b>   The Minister has moved seamlessly on from the issue of governance, which I think he has now completed. He referred kindly to the noble Lords who had referred to their concerns, and of course it was the committee&#039;s overall conclusion. I listed all the people who might be in a position to give considerable experience to their views on this, such as former chairmen of the BBC, none of whom agree with the Government. Could he tell us who recommended this idea, and who is actually in favour of it?
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_20"></a>
<a name="60327-36_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   Governments do not attribute good concepts and bright ideas to particular individuals. They do what we are doing: propose that here is a model of how the BBC should be governed in the future, which in our view is superior to the previous position, now that we have taken on board the criticisms of it. It is contended that the model has weaknesses and flaws that will render it unworkable. We do not take that view. We have confidence that the trust knows what its responsibilities are.
</p>

<a name="60327-36_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_223"></a>The separation from the executive is important. As we all recognise, the problem in the past was that governors were caught in the dual position of both making the directorate responsible to them and, at the same time, defending decisions of the directorate outside in circumstances where that duality raised very real difficulties. The concept of the trust obviously creates some distance in those terms. The different concept for the BBC is a reflection of the fact that no <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC279"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column GC279</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

one would put forward a model for governance of the BBC that followed the traditional model of private industry. I listened carefully to the criticisms that were being voiced but they were about the difficulties of this model. No one was articulating, &quot;Well, of course, we have got a much clearer system, derived from private industry, which would make the public institution that is the BBC a better governed model&quot;. We take a different view.
</p>

<a name="60327-36_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_224"></a>Questions were raised about the licence fee. Let me deal, first, with the issue raised by my noble friend Lord Barnett about the inadequacy of the Treasury response. The Treasury takes the view, quite straightforwardly, that the decision of the Office for National Statistics&#151;not a government decision but a decision taken by the Office for National Statistics, separate from government&#151;is solely in respect of the treatment of national accounts. It does not change the relationship between the Government, or any part of the public sector, and the BBC. It cannot be much clearer than that. I hasten to tell my noble friend that that was the reply that my noble friend Lord McKenzie of Luton gave on behalf of the Treasury, and that is the position.
</p>

<a name="60327-36_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_225"></a>So the way in which the licence fee is implemented, collected and surveyed does not change. What changes is where it appears in the national accounts. I am not gainsaying the fact that my noble friend Lord Barnett will say, &quot;Well, that is a very significant change&quot;. It certainly may be a significant change in the economic analysis of the national accounts, but we are maintaining, and making absolutely clear, that we do not see any other way in which that changes the nature of the licence fee and the way it is structured and developed.
</p>

<a name="60327-36_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_226"></a>Again we maintain that those who contend that the public sought greater political control over the BBC through more direct parliamentary control over the licence fee cannot substantiate their case. That was not the response we received from our consultation. Nor do I believe that it is necessarily a widely-held view across the whole of Parliament.
</p>

<a name="60327-36_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_227"></a>The question of sport was raised.

</p>

<a name="60327-37_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_228"></a>The noble Lord recognises that we disagree on this point, but it is not clear that all our political colleagues are convinced of the argument put forward by the noble Lord. Certainly we have the excellent work of the Select Committee in this area.

</p>

<a name="60327-37_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_229"></a>I recognise that this is a point of disagreement between us. It is not that the Government did not have the benefit of the Select Committee report before they considered these issues, nor the prior report, which was even more fundamental, but we beg to differ on that point.
</p>

<a name="60327-37_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_230"></a>A number of other issues were raised. On the question of sport, let us be careful about associating sport with cricket. I declare an interest: as someone who has regularly been getting up at 4.15 in the morning to watch our test team in action, I bow to no one in terms of enthusiasm for cricket. However, we recognise that cricket is not the nation&#039;s sport. It is an important one but, for the BBC to be involved in bids for cricket, raises the issues which my noble friend Lord Gordon identified. Cricket is very difficult for any main broadcasting channel to schedule. Secondly, international competition under the main broadcasters has upped the costs of all sports by a significant amount. When the BBC carried cricket regularly on its channels a decade or so ago, it did not have the enormous competitive challenge that currently exists.
</p>

<a name="60327-37_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_231"></a>I agree with the Committee that the BBC has a responsibility towards cricket and to our other major sports as well. The BBC can play a unique role with regard to minority sports&#151;its excellent coverage of the Commonwealth Games is to its credit&#151;and they are sports where we expect and need to see greater participation. The problem with team games is that they get terribly selective about excellence, whereas encouraging people to take up other sports such as cycling, running or walking can show gains in terms of improved public health, although there can be a competitive element. I have no doubt that the BBC has an important role in sport, although I cannot quite accede to the proposition for cricket.
</p>

<a name="60327-37_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_232"></a>Important issues were raised about the World Service of the BBC and the Government have been strongly pressed on this matter, quite rightly. We are out to guard jealously the independence of the World Service; that is why it is so valued in the world and why it is one of the unique services of the BBC. It is axiomatic that the World Service is financed separately from the rest of the BBC and comes under the FCO budget. We would not dream of putting the independence of the World Service of the BBC in doubt. The director of the World Service has made it clear that he would not accept anything that called into question its editorial independence.
</p>

<a name="60327-37_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_233"></a>All the recommendations on public diplomacy in the report of my noble friend Lord Carter of Coles were agreed by the World Service. Its content, its independence and the perception of its independence will not change. In recognition of its unique status, the World Service will be an observer on the Public Diplomacy Board, but not a full member. It takes <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC281"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column GC281</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

observer status because it gains some insights into what the Government position is on so many issues, but it is not part of the Foreign Office and not a participant member of any board in the Foreign Office which decides policy. It is appropriate for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which funds the World Service, to agree where and how it broadcasts&#151;on radio, TV or online&#151;but its editorial line is an issue only for the World Service. Those are the cardinal points which have governed the World Service since its origins and have led to its great success. I assure the Committee that the Government have no intention of jeopardising that.
</p>

<a name="60327-37_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_234"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester spoke about the transfer of the BBC services to Manchester. That is not without cost; it is a brave and important decision. It is important that an institution as significant as the BBC should play its part in nourishing alternate centres of excellence to London. If there is one issue with regard to our national life that we probably all share, it is that London is dreadfully predominant across such a range of our economic, social and cultural life. We need to take opportunities to create breadth and the Government welcome the move to Manchester. But the trust will need to satisfy itself that the BBC&#039;s current proposals represent value for money for the licence fee payer. There is a lot of work to be done but; nevertheless, the decision speaks well of the BBC being concerned, as a national broadcaster, to look beyond London.
</p>

<a name="60327-37_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_235"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lyell, asked about cycling. Cycling has got reasonable coverage on television in recent years; certainly, the Tour de France has. However, Channel 4 has been the provider, and the expectation is that it will bid for the start of the Tour de France in London. But that is still under consideration. The BBC will take an interest, but the noble Lord will recognise that one terrestrial television company has already secured its position.
</p>

<a name="60327-37_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_236"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, asked about appointments to the trust. I agree that they must be made through a process the integrity of which is guaranteed. They will be made according to Nolan principles and in agreement with the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments. So we will guarantee fairness and transparency in that way.
</p>

<a name="60327-37_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_237"></a>The noble Baroness also spoke about complaints. Ofcom already regulates the BBC on content standards, except for accuracy and impartiality, but we continue to believe that accuracy and impartiality are at the heart of the BBC&#039;s editorial independence. That is why, following the point that the noble Lord, Lord McNally, made so forcefully, we do not think that Ofcom is the regulator for the BBC.
</p>

<a name="60327-37_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_238"></a>I am conscious that I have spoken for a considerable time and that I may not have done justice to every contributor. However, one formidable point was made throughout the discussion, which the noble Lord, Lord Luke, emphasised&#151;and that is the question of whether digital switchover is a proper cost on the licence fee. I know that there is a divergence of opinion <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC282"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column GC282</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

on this point and I noticed that the Government&#039;s position was not reinforced by contributions this afternoon.
</p>

<a name="60327-37_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_239"></a>Let me state the position clearly. When analogue gets switched off, the BBC and all terrestrial broadcasters cut their signal. To replace it with digital&#151;a process that will start from 2008 and will be completed in 2012&#151;is not a social or an economic service; it is a broadcasting service. The service will be switched off by broadcasters and has to be switched on by broadcasters. That is why broadcasters should pay the cost. It should therefore come out of the licence fee, not out of taxation.
</p>

<a name="60327-37_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_240"></a>The next question is: who should be supported? Some people will need help with the switchover&#151;they will need advice about how they adapt to the new system and a modicum of familiarisation with the new television sets. Such help is not social welfare; it is technical help for people to receive and interpret the signal so they can get it on their television. That is why the cost properly falls there.
</p>

<a name="60327-37_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_241"></a>It is different from other support, which is a social cost in relation to the cost of the licence fee. This is about the costs of digital switchover. We maintain that it is properly a broadcasting cost and, as the BBC will be responsible for the totality of this exercise, it is only right that we should make arrangements for the BBC to be able to fund it. That is why the licence fee needs to bear this cost.
</p>

<a name="60327-37_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_242"></a>I also heard the point about the extent to which the licence fee is to be increased. I have heard various descriptions of the bid&#151;but it is still a bid. The noble Lord, Lord McNally, thought that we had entered a souk and that this was the first part of a bargaining process. It is a little more sophisticated than the opening bid to a market trader; but, nevertheless, it is not cut and dried and a great deal of discussion has to take place. Representations from this Committee and from other debates in this House and another place help to inform those decisions.
</p>

<a name="60327-37_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_243"></a>I apologise for not covering every contribution to what has been a very significant debate. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, will feel that it has been worth while introducing it this afternoon.

<a name="60327-38_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Fowler: </b>   This has been an extremely good debate. I particularly welcome and thank the contributors who were non-members of the Select Committee. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Macdonald, for his thoughtful contribution on religious broadcasting, the noble Lord, Lord Barnett&#151;whose description of the waffle in the White Paper I cannot improve upon&#151;my noble friend Lord Lyell and the noble Lord, Lord Gordon, with all his experience.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_244"></a>I also thank the Minister for his reply. I am afraid that I did not agree with either the early or the late part of what he was saying, but I agreed with a bit in the middle.

parliamentary scrutiny of the licence fee, expenditure which amounts to more than &#163;4 billion a year. I would have thought that that might be something for Parliament to scrutinise.
</p>

<a name="60327-38_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_245"></a>If I can say this politely, we recognise the limits of what the Minister can do in this debate. He has been given the department&#039;s brief and I pay tribute to him for keeping to it impeccably. But if I were the Minister, I would study what has been said very carefully. It has not exactly been an endorsement of the White Paper or the decisions in it. If I were the Minister, I would note the value placed by the Committee on the World Service and, above all, on preserving its independence. If I were the Minister, I would note the comments made by various speakers throughout this debate on the licence fee, including the noble Lord, Lord Peston, who challenged its whole basis, the noble Baroness, Lady Bonham-Carter, the noble Lord, Lord Holme, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester, and the noble Lord, Lord Gordon, who talked about the National Audit Office. If I were the Minister, I would note what was said on governance by my noble friends Lord King and Lord Kalms.

There is an enormous need for Parliament to be involved much more, and much more closely, than it is at the moment. That would be to the benefit of the BBC as well as to the benefit of the public.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_247"></a>I say to the Minister that we will not win that battle with him this afternoon, but I also say to him that I believe that, in the end, and with the support of the House of Commons Select Committee, we will win the argument and ultimately it will come under parliamentary scrutiny. I thank all Members of this Grand Committee for their contributions.

<a name="wms_subhd_0"></a>
<a name="60327-38_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Armed Forces: 655 Squadron Army Air Corps</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="60327-38_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence  (Lord Drayson): </b>  My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Adam Ingram) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60327-38_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a>I would like to inform the House that we will disband 655 Squadron Army Air Corps (AAC), the Northern Ireland (NI) based Lynx Light Utility Helicopter squadron, by April 2007. There are no military or civilian redundancies anticipated as a result of the disbandment.
</p>

<a name="60327-38_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>This decision has been taken for two reasons. First, we need to reduce the size of the Lynx fleet, which will leave service in 2012. This will facilitate better focus of resources on sustaining and improving the remaining fleet until the arrival of its replacement in the form of the Battlefield Reconnaissance Helicopter, which will be delivered as part of the Future Rotorcraft Capability programme.

</p>

<a name="60327-38_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a>Secondly, the ongoing normalisation process in NI and the increasing ability of the Police Service of Northern Ireland to operate without military assistance means that the requirement for light utility helicopter support, currently provided by 655 Squadron AAC, is reducing and is expected to end completely by August 2007. The anticipated levels of aviation support required after April 2007 do not warrant the retention of a dedicated Lynx squadron in NI beyond that date. Any residual requirement for helicopter support between April and August 2007 will be provided by other aircraft remaining in NI and mainland-based Lynx.
</p>

<a name="60327-38_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a>This decision means that we can reduce the size of the Lynx fleet, better focus our resources and still sustain the current six deployable squadrons of Lynx to support expeditionary operations.
</p>

<a name="wms_subhd_1"></a>
<a name="60327-38_head1"></a><h3 align=center>Armed Forces: Merlin Helicopter</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="60327-38_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence  (Lord Drayson): </b>  My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Adam Ingram) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60327-38_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a>The Ministry of Defence has today announced the award of a contract to AgustaWestland for the Integrated Merlin Operational Support (IMOS) programme, part of the wider defence logistics transformation programme, which seeks to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of military logistics support to the front line.
</p>

<a name="60327-38_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a>IMOS is a radical departure from the current method of supporting the Merlin helicopter: in-service support of the Navy and Air Force Merlin variants will <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS52"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column WS52</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

be fused, under IMOS, into a single, innovative, availability-based contract. IMOS will focus support activities for Merlin at the main support base recently established at RNAS Culdrose. It will provide comprehensive technical servicing, including supply and depth servicing, and will incentivise industry to improve aircraft availability to the front line while reducing costs through life.
</p>

<a name="60327-38_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a>The 25-year contract is worth approximately &#163;450 million over the first five years and will result in approximately 20 per cent savings&#151;some &#163;1 billion&#151;over the 25-year life of the aircraft. The IMOS programme will complement the Defence Logistic Organisation&#039;s broader strategy to relocate the majority of support to the single most effective site, which is already showing early success with the Harrier and Tornado fleets.
</p>

<a name="60327-38_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a>As set out in the defence industrial strategy, the MoD is working to establish a multi-platform strategic partnering arrangement with AgustaWestland. IMOS is a key element of this strategy, which sets out to enable the delivery of improved output at reduced cost to the MoD while allowing industry to benefit from greater openness and business opportunity.

<a name="wms_subhd_2"></a>
<a name="60327-38_head2"></a><h3 align=center>Armed Forces: Uranium</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_3"></a>
<a name="60327-38_spmin2"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence  (Lord Drayson): </b>  My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Adam Ingram) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60327-38_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a>I am pleased to announce that our report on the production of highly enriched uranium for the defence programme and arms control verification has now been completed. Copies of the report will be placed in the Library of the House and published on the MoD website.
</p>

<a name="60327-38_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a>This follows a similar report on defence holdings of plutonium, published in 2000, and meets our commitment for historical accounting as set out in the Strategic Defence Review. It is also intended to have the report circulated during the current session of the conference on disarmament in Geneva, which closes on 31 March 2006, as a contribution to wider consideration of these complex issues.
</p>

<a name="60327-38_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a>Its publication demonstrates our continuing determination to work constructively towards negotiation of a fissile material cut-off treaty, our goal of the global elimination of nuclear weapons and our commitment to openness in government.

<p><a name="wms_st_4"></a>
<a name="60327-39_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   As part of a review being conducted by Sir Gus O&#039;Donnell, the Cabinet Secretary, into the role and functions of the Cabinet Office, the central operation and support functions for Directgov, and the 17 Civil Service posts providing them, will move to the Central Office of Information (COI) with effect from 1 April 2006.

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column WS53</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60327-39_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a>The COI already provides valuable support to Directgov and this transfer will provide a better longer-term location for this work including a wider pool of profession skills on which to draw. Nevertheless, Directgov remains key to transformational government, so strategic leadership will stay in the Cabinet Office.

<p><a name="wms_st_6"></a>
<a name="60327-39_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills  (Lord Adonis): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State (Ruth Kelly) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60327-39_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a>I have today laid before the House a White Paper <i>Further Education: Raising Skills&#151;Improving Life Chances</i>, which sets out the Government&#039;s plans for the reform of further education.

</p>

<a name="60327-39_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a>There is much to be proud of in our further education system. We have many excellent colleges and training providers. Participation in education and training has risen significantly since 1997. Success rates are rising. Our 14&#150;19 and skills strategies have set the country on the road towards a coherent, accessible, high-quality system of lifelong learning which meets the needs both of employers and of individuals.
</p>

<a name="60327-39_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a>But we cannot stand still. Major challenges remain if we are to ensure a high-level skills base which matches and exceeds that of other high-performing economies. The FE sector is central to delivering the skills that are essential for economic success and which give individuals of all backgrounds and aspirations the basis for productive, sustainable employment and prosperity.
</p>

<a name="60327-39_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a>The White Paper sets out a comprehensive programme of change, which will transform our FE system into a powerhouse of economic prosperity and social mobility. In developing our proposals, we have listened to the sector and the needs of its users, through Sir Andrew Foster&#039;s excellent review of the role of colleges and through widespread consultation with employers, providers and other key stakeholders. We have accepted, and are building on, the vast majority of Sir Andrew&#039;s recommendations.
</p>

<a name="60327-39_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a>Our plans will ensure:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_0"></a>A new economic mission for FE: the heart of the sector&#039;s role should be equipping young people and adults with the skills for employability that underpin both economic success and social mobility.

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_1"></a>World-class specialised vocational learning, driven by the needs of employers, including the <br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_WS56"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column WS56</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>strengthening of centres of vocational excellence and the development of vocational sector networks.

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_2"></a>Responsiveness to employers and learners: giving them greater say in the provision of education and training, more choices, and the tools to make the most of these opportunities. That includes expansion of work-based training to meet employer needs and trialling a new accounts programme for adults.

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_3"></a>New entitlements: introducing a new entitlement to free tuition and support to help 19 to 25 year-olds gain technician, associate professional and skilled trades qualifications at level 3. Over time and as resources allow we intend to extend this entitlement so that it can include programmes within the foundation learning tier that support progression through to level 2 and beyond.

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_4"></a>New freedoms for high-performing colleges, coupled with tougher, faster intervention to combat poor performance. Quality will be improved through new styles of delivery, including federations, collaborative partnerships and trusts. There will be a new quality-improvement strategy offering an integrated approach to quality development and improvement across the sector.

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_5"></a>Reduced bureaucracy and less regulation, and a new relationship with colleges which releases their energy, initiative and dynamism, while ensuring that they are accountable for their performance.

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_6"></a>Opportunities both for new high-quality providers to enter the system, and for existing providers with a strong track record to expand.

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_7"></a>A funding system which is driven by the choices and needs of learners and employers. Within local authorities&#039; strategic leadership role for children&#039;s services overall, local authorities and the LSC will work closely together to drive progress through a shared strategy for delivering the 14&#150;19 entitlement in every area.

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_8"></a>A fairer playing field for capital funding available to schools and colleges, and a capital strategy that delivers the 14&#150;19 reforms and supports the plans set out in the White Paper.
</p>
</ul>
<a name="60327-39_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a>New investment announced in this White Paper and by my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer last week will target the Government&#039;s priorities for FE including:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_9"></a>&#163;25 million from 2007&#150;08 to fund a 19&#150;25 entitlement to first full level 3.

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_10"></a>&#163;11 million from 2007&#150;08 to allow the full national rollout of the adult learning grant to be brought forward to 2007&#150;08.

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_11"></a>&#163;11 million from 2007&#150;08 for new programmes to recruit and train excellent staff for the FE sector.

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_12"></a>&#163;20 million to address the skills and training obstacles faced by women, as identified by the Women and Work Commission. That will extend support for women in training at level 3, expand the availability of skills coaches to support <br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_WS57"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column WS57</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>women in entering employment, and develop new recruitment routes into industries where women are underrepresented.
</p>
</ul>
<a name="60327-39_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a>These reforms will build a further education system fit to meet the challenges of economic and social change, and to achieve its full potential as the powerhouse of a productive, competitive economy and a just, inclusive society.

<a name="60327-40_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Gibraltar: New Constitution</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_7"></a>
<a name="60327-40_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  I wish to make a Statement to the House informing Members about the Gibraltar constitutional negotiations, which concluded successfully in London on Friday 17 March.
</p>

<a name="60327-40_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a>A joint statement by the UK and Gibraltar was made earlier today, which sets out the main provisions of the new constitution. The full text of the new constitution will be published in the coming weeks, and put to the people of Gibraltar in a referendum. If it is approved by them, it will then be given effect by Order in Council.
</p>

<a name="60327-40_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a>As my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary (Mr Jack Straw) set out in his Statement of 6 February 2004, the starting point for the work to modernise Gibraltar&#039;s 1969 constitution was the invitation in the 1999 White Paper <i>Partnership for Progress and Prosperity: Britain and the Overseas Territories</i> to OT governments to submit proposals for constitutional reform. In July 1999, the Gibraltar House of Assembly constituted a Select Committee to report on constitutional reform. The committee published its proposals in January 2002. We formally received them in December 2003. These proposals were subsequently discussed between delegations from the UK and Gibraltar in November/December 2004, September 2005 and March 2006.
</p>

<a name="60327-40_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a>The new constitution provides for a modern and mature relationship between Gibraltar and the UK. As the Foreign Secretary will make clear in the despatch that he will send to the governor when the Order in Council is passed, it does not in any way diminish British sovereignty of Gibraltar. The UK will retain its full international responsibility for Gibraltar, including for Gibraltar&#039;s external relations and defence, and as the member state responsible for Gibraltar in the European Union. Gibraltar will remain listed as a British Overseas Territory in the British Nationality Act 1981, as amended by the British Overseas Territory Act 2002.
</p>

<a name="60327-40_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a>The preamble to the new constitution will also make clear that the UK stands by its longstanding commitment that Gibraltar will remain part of Her Majesty&#039;s dominions unless and until an Act of Parliament otherwise provides, and furthermore that Her Majesty&#039;s Government will never enter into arrangements under which the people of Gibraltar would pass under the sovereignty of another state against their freely and democratically expressed wishes.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS58"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column WS58</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60327-40_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a>The new constitution confirms that the people of Gibraltar have the right of self-determination and that the realisation of this right must be promoted and respected in conformity with the provisions of the UN Charter and any other applicable international treaties. In the despatch, the Foreign Secretary will note that, in the view of Her Majesty&#039;s Government, Gibraltar&#039;s right of self-determination is not constrained by the Treaty of Utrecht except in so far as Article X gives Spain the right of refusal should Britain ever renounce sovereignty. Thus independence would be an option only with Spanish consent.
</p>

<a name="60327-40_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a>The remainder of the constitutional text introduces substantial reform and modernisation. The main elements include limiting the responsibilities of the governor to the areas of external affairs, defence, internal security and the public service, thereby reversing the previous practice and giving Gibraltar much greater control over its internal affairs. The House of Assembly will be restyled the Gibraltar Parliament, and may determine its own size. The governor&#039;s powers to withhold assent on laws passed by Gibraltar are streamlined and my power to disallow them is removed (although the power to make Orders in Council is retained). New commissions will be created to handle appointments in the judiciary and public service. The creation of a new Police Authority for Gibraltar will give Gibraltar a greater input into policing matters. Finally, the human rights chapter has been updated to bring it into line with the ECHR.
</p>

<a name="60327-40_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a>The Foreign Secretary has written to Miguel Angel Moratinos, the Spanish Foreign Minister, to clarify those matters of importance to Spain relating to this constitution.
</p>

<a name="60327-40_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_56"></a>I warmly welcome the text of the new constitution. I believe that it is a clear demonstration of our enduring commitment to the people of Gibraltar and that it represents the development of a modern, mature and appropriate relationship with the people of Gibraltar. I believe that the whole House will wish to commend it wholeheartedly to the people of Gibraltar.

<p><a name="wms_st_8"></a>
<a name="60327-40_spmin1"></a><b>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr   Charles Clarke) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60327-40_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"></a>In April 2004 my predecessor required the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), under Section 79(1) of the Police Act 1996, to undertake a review of the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr Christopher Alder. This was in response to continuing concerns from Mr Alder&#039;s family. Honourable Members will recall his tragic <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS59"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column WS59</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

death in police custody at Queen&#039;s Gardens Police Station in Hull during the early hours of 1 April 1998, with the last moments of his life captured on CCTV.
</p>

<a name="60327-40_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_59"></a>I am today laying the report of the IPCC review before Parliament, as I am required to do under Section 79(5) of the Act. I thank Nick Hardwick, chair of the IPCC, and his team for his thorough review and his findings and recommendations. The IPCC sought the assistance of the Healthcare Commission in assessing the standards of medical care that Mr Alder received. A summary of the HCC conclusions is provided at annexe 8 to the IPCC report. I understand that separate arrangements are being made to publish its report today.
</p>

<a name="60327-40_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_60"></a>There are criticisms of individual officers for their handling of Mr Alder when they arrived at the scene of his assault, at the hospital to which he was taken and at the police station. They are criticised for some of the accounts of their actions which the IPCC, having reviewed the evidence, does not accept. They are criticised as public servants for not co-operating with the review, although I acknowledge that this was their right.
</p>

<a name="60327-40_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_61"></a>The IPCC find that unwitting racism was a factor in Mr Alder&#039;s treatment, measured against the standards subsequently established by the Macpherson report and the guidance issued by the former Police Complaints Authority (PCA). They acknowledge that Humberside Police has made progress on racial awareness since. I return to this.

</p>

<a name="60327-40_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_62"></a>The former deputy chief constable of Humberside Police is criticised for his decision that there should be no legal representation available to the parties at the disciplinary tribunal set up to hear the charges against the five police officers, which reduced the disciplinary sanctions available to the tribunal. In the absence of legal support, the current chief constable of Cleveland, who approached his responsibilities properly, mistakenly accepted a submission that there was no case to answer.
</p>

<a name="60327-40_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_63"></a>The West Yorkshire investigation into Mr Alder&#039;s death, which was supervised by the PCA, is criticised as inadequately resourced and directed.
</p>

<a name="60327-40_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_64"></a>Additionally, there is criticism of Humberside Police for not having apologised to the family of Christopher Alder for his treatment.
</p>

<a name="60327-40_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_65"></a>The IPCC find that support for the family was mishandled. There is criticism of the police and, to a degree, of the PCA, for the level of support provided to the family&#151;though it is acknowledged that things would be better handled these days. Lancashire Constabulary, one of whose officers passed on incorrect information to Mr Alder&#039;s sister, gets passing criticism.

</p>

<a name="60327-40_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_66"></a>On the other hand, the review found no reason to believe that the police assaulted Mr Alder, used CS spray against him or that his sister was subsequently harassed by Humberside Police. It finds no evidence that Humberside deliberately mishandled its investigation, nor reason to criticise the handling of the failed prosecution of the police officers. It dismisses the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS60"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column WS60</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

suggestion of police cover-up of evidence of racist banter. Any failings in the West Yorkshire investigation were not deliberate or malicious.
</p>

<a name="60327-40_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_67"></a>The IPCC is satisfied on the basis of its review that there is no need for a further inquiry. It makes a number of recommendations. At this stage I wish to focus on three areas:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_13"></a>the police service response to racism following the Macpherson report;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_14"></a>efforts to improve the standards of care for those coming into police custody; and,

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_15"></a>plans to improve the police disciplinary process.
</p>
</ul>
<a name="60327-40_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_68"></a>I found particularly disturbing the conclusion Mr Hardwick reaches regarding the officers&#039; &quot;unwitting racism&quot; in their treatment of Mr Alder. However, I am confident that since Sir William Macpherson&#039;s inquiry into the tragic death of Stephen Lawrence in 1999, all police forces have taken steps to eradicate racism in the police service. However, we must not lose sight of the continuing need to ensure that those in the public service who serve their communities do so to the highest professional standards
</p>

<a name="60327-40_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_69"></a>The Home Office, the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Association of Police Authorities and Centrex published <i>A Strategy for Improving Performance in Race and Diversity 2004&#150;2009</i> in November 2004. Also in November 2004 the Association of Police Authorities issued guidance on <i>Involving Communities in Police Learning and Development</i>.

</p>

<a name="60327-40_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_70"></a>The strategy is the product of extensive consultation and sets out a five-year strategy for the Police Race and Diversity Learning and Development Programme. The strategy builds upon recommendations made in Her Majesty&#039;s Inspectorate of Constabulary&#039;s (HMIC) report <i>Diversity Matters</i> and responds to two independent reports commissioned to quality assure and examine the effectiveness of community and race relations (CRR) training. The strategy is fundamentally different from the previous approach to CRR training. Race necessarily remains the primary focus but the strategy expands the area of work to include other aspects of diversity: gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, and religion and belief. It extends to police staff and to the wider police family, including special constables and police community support officers (PCSOs).

</p>

<a name="60327-40_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_71"></a>The strategy is not just restricted to training and is linked to other police learning and development programmes, including the initial police learning and development programme, the core leadership development programme and the senior leadership development programme.
</p>

<a name="60327-40_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_72"></a>Much hard work has been put into improving the care and custody of people in police detention since this tragedy, and, eight years on, a number of important changes have been made.
</p>

<a name="60327-40_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_73"></a>The safer detention guidance, published on 8 February 2006, requires that before accepting a detainee to return to custody, the escorting officers should request that the doctor immediately in charge <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column WS61</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of the detainee or the A&E manager provide clear written advice to inform the detainee&#039;s care plan. The custody officer must consider any requirement for a healthcare professional to see them in person on return from hospital. The healthcare professional must be called for certain aspects of illness, which are set out in the guidance. The Police Healthcare Project, a joint project being developed by the Home Office and the Prison Service, will look to develop national agreements for local implementation.
</p>

<a name="60327-40_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_74"></a>Improved police disciplinary arrangements are being considered in the context of work being taken forward in response to the Taylor report; a code of professional standards and an improved discipline procedure are being formulated. A proposed draft code and guidance has already been drawn up and is currently open to public consultation. It is our <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS62"></a>

<b>27 Mar 2006 : Column WS62</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

commitment to provide the Police Advisory Board for England and Wales with draft policy proposals in July.
</p>

<a name="60327-40_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_75"></a>I am confident in the ability of the police service and of the chief constable of Humberside Police to respond positively to the IPCC findings.
</p>

<a name="60327-40_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_76"></a>There have been calls for a public inquiry into Mr Alder&#039;s death, which have been resisted. There has been an investigation, an inquest, criminal trial, internal disciplinary hearings and now this independent review. I agree with Mr Hardwick that a further investigation would not add anything of substance. This review contains a detailed account of all the circumstances surrounding the death of Christopher Alder. I hope that the findings go some way to answering their questions and concerns and can bring them some closure to this tragic case. Our thoughts are with them today.

In October 2005, EU Foreign Ministers added the EU&#039;s voice to support for an international treaty to establish common standards for the global trade in conventional arms, and called for the start of a formal negotiation process at the UN at the earliest opportunity. Commonwealth heads of government, meeting in Malta in 2005, also formally stated their support for work on such a treaty to commence at the UN. Numerous other countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Benin, Cambodia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guinea, Holy See, Iceland, Mali, Norway, Senegal, Switzerland and Turkey have also expressed support. We will continue to work with international partners to generate support for a process to build momentum towards our objective of initial discussions in the UN later in 2006.

<a name="60327w01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   We envisage a treaty covering all conventional arms and see no reason to restrict this only to small arms and ammunition. Although small arms are at the core of the problem, larger conventional arms are also responsible for fuelling conflict and instability, and have been used for repressive purposes. We believe that all conventional arms need to be included in the treaty to make it a fully effective tool against the irresponsible trade in arms.

<a name="60327w04_spmin4"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions  (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </b>  It is a longstanding principle that, where it is cost effective to do so, recovery is sought of all overpayments.

</p>

<a name="60327w04_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_42"></a>The Department for Work and Pensions seeks to recover social security overpayments where customers innocently or otherwise, provide incorrect information in relation to their claim or fail to notify a change of circumstances. In addition, the department seeks to recover overpayments that are not recoverable under social security legislation&#151;for example, paid twice for the same period. This is on the basis that customers have no right to retain money that they should not have received. The department&#039;s policy is to seek recovery in the cases where it is reasonable to expect the customer to have been aware of the overpayment.

circumstances of the customer. In exceptional circumstances the Secretary of State can exercise his discretion to waive recovery of an overpayment to avoid severe hardship or where the recovery would be against the public interest.

</p>

<a name="60327w04_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_44"></a>With regard to housing and council tax benefits, the local authority must decide whether an overpayment is legally recoverable and, if it is, whether it should actually recover it. This decision, as well as the method and rate of recovery, is the responsibility of the local authority. The authority must have regard to the customer&#039;s financial circumstances and avoid causing hardship to either customers or any of their dependants.
</p>

<a name="60327w04_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_45"></a>The policy of HM Revenue and Customs on recovery of tax credit overpayments is set out in its Code of Practice 26, <i>What happens if we have paid you too much tax credit?</i> The criteria used to determine whether overpayments of tax credits should be remitted are contained in Code of Practice 26.
