Supporting the economy through these difficult times will benefit not only current but future generations. While this means allowing borrowings to increase in the short term, the Pre-Budget Report sets a credible plan for fiscal consolidation, ensuring that, in the medium term, borrowing is low and debt is stable and falling as a proportion of GDP.</p>

We have laid out a clear fiscal plan to move back to a cyclically adjusted balance once we are past this global economic crisis and eventually to return to the course which we were previously on of reducing debt as a percentage of GDP. In the mean time, we strike an appropriate balance between the current generation and the future generation. At 2.7 per cent of GDP, public expenditure and net investment will be the highest that they have been since 1977. Future generations will benefit from the investments being made now. It is only fair and proper that they should pay a contribution towards the investment from which they will benefit.</p>

The level of current debt is forecast to rise to around 70 per cent of GDP. According to the ONS, by the time that we have added in the nationalised banks, it will be multiples of GDP. Can the Government say what is an appropriate amount of debt to bequeath to future generations?</p>

It is clearly sensible when we are in an economic crisis of a global nature that the public sector should be an important support of demand to bring the economy back into equilibrium. We shall not see wasted investment, wasted capital or wasted manpower. We shall move back towards a more sustainable fiscal position once this crisis is behind us. I have already addressed intergenerational benefit by reference to public sector net investment.</p>

Indeed, if the banks recover in the way that Northern Rock has done, it could be rather better than some of the more pessimistic forecasts. However, the reality is surely that doing nothing would have been even worse.</p>

The consequences for the economy if we did not have the combined benefit of the fiscal stabilisers and the bringing forward of capital expenditure as announced in the PBR would be GDP growth this year that was at least 0.5 lower than would otherwise be achieved.</p>

Does he also accept that, if we let the economy fall even faster, as the Conservatives seem to imply we should, it would lead to vast swathes of British industry going bust and even more pressure on pension funds? That would be a very short-sighted view.</p>

Should the management of debt be a compulsory subject to address this on the school and university curriculum?</p>

That is one reason why we are committed to reducing borrowing as a percentage of GDP once we are past this global crisis. We have set out very clear programmes and have said that the rate of growth for public expenditure will be lower. We have also identified already taxation increases that will be introduced at the appropriate time to ensure that we manage our debt in a sustainable and prudent manner.</p>

Is it not clear that they are seeking to justify their existence because they think they might be scrapped?

On the more general issues with regard to RDAs, of course, they face different problems in different parts of the country. Given his representation of part of Cornwall, he will be all too well aware just what a difficult situation the south-west region&#146;s economy is in. Therefore, I should have thought he would applaud the fact that the Government are giving as much support as possible in terms of resources to the regional development agency and, through it, to economic development.</p>

Given that these quangos have important messages to convey, they should have adequate budgets. But are those budgets overseen and controlled by people who are experts in this sphere, who can decide whether they are being spent wisely and efficiently?</p>

Noble Lords will recognise that people with very high qualifications apply to sit on quangos. The chairman and the board are responsible for its accounts. The Comptroller and Auditor General surveys the position. At the end of the day, Ministers are responsible for the action of quangos within the remit of their departments. That is the basis on which public accountability is best administered.</p>

Sir David&#146;s review will examine board management of risk, incentives to manage risk in bank remuneration policies, the competences needed on bank boards, board practices and structures, and the role played by institutional investors.</p>

Given that the Companies Act 2006 further specified duties on directors and that Sir Ken Macdonald, the former DPP, this week called for the prosecution of directors who have ignored those rules, how many prosecutions are under way? Secondly, what are the Government doing to enhance the role of internal management on the boards of major companies so that there is direct access to the board, particularly the non-executive directors? Finally, will the Minister provide funds for a special cadre of speech therapists to teach bankers how to pronounce the word &#147;sorry&#148;?</p>

I cannot answer the noble Lord&#146;s first question about the number of directors who are being prosecuted for breach of the Companies Act, but I shall obtain that information and write to him. I should make it clear that, to the extent that there have been breaches of legislation in respect of the management of banks, or indeed any other form of incorporated body, I wholly endorse and support pursuing the correct procedure of such matters through the courts. That would be a matter for the prosecuting authorities, the Financial Services Authority or whichever agency it fell under. Securing broader access for employees to boards is, in part, up to the boards. If boards rely on the information that they receive from a small number of executive directors and do not make appropriate inquiry elsewhere in the company, do not visit the factory floor, do not sit in the canteen and do not listen to what is said, they will not be as informed as they otherwise could have been. I do not think that this is a matter for law; it could be a matter for code, and David Walker will look at that. I am hopeful that he will produce an earlier report of some of his conclusions, perhaps in interim form. I have no comment to make on speech therapy.</p>

Is it true, as reported in the <I>Financial Times </I>yesterday, that some of the companies that are 100 per cent controlled and some that are virtually 100 per cent controlled by the taxpayer are planning to evade the issue by approving bonuses to be paid in cash in a year or two?

We must be careful not to demonise this concept. It is a matter of proportionality and of correctly rewarding the right type of performance. What went wrong with the banks was that bonuses were frequently paid for illusory gains. I was told the famous story about a transaction between two banks, which both banks booked as an immediate profit on execution of the transaction and presumably paid bonuses for. We need to stop that sort of thing. It is not a question of evading restrictions on bonuses by deferring payment. Part of this is good process to ensure that an early indication of bonus can be subject to clawback in the event that subsequent information suggests that the original gains were not as first realised. The answer is well designed schemes that are alert to unintended consequences, transparent and clearly explained to the owners of businesses.</p>

In so far as the criminal law boundary is concerned, Section 6 of the Theft Act 1968 stipulates that a person who intends to deal with the property of another as if it were his own to dispose of, regardless of that person&#146;s rights, commits an act that is tantamount to theft.</p>

Whether there has been a breach of criminal or company legislation will be a matter for prosecuting authorities and for subsequent directors of those organisations.

I have always thought that that was poppycock. With experience comes knowledge and a capacity to challenge in a constructive and informed way. I am sure that David Walker will look at that, along with many other factors.

In the past, we have been served by plentiful supplies of coal and of oil and gas from the North Sea.

Of course, that is very encouraging. There are also proposals from E.ON, in conjunction with other companies, to build new nuclear. Looking behind the noble Lord&#146;s question, although one can expect 18 to 19 gigawatts of electricity generation to close over the next decade, we know that 10 gigawatts of new electricity generation are already under construction, with 10.5 gigawatts having received planning consent and grid-connecting agreements.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="09022571000223"></a>&#147;My amendments will create a UK border police force which we believe could more effectively police and safeguard our borders than has been the case in recent years. There are currently six agencies dealing with our borders; it is clear that the system is unsatisfactory. We seek to bring those disparate groups of people together so that they can be managed more coherently and the powers can be shared&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 2/7/07; col. GC 32.]</p>

<p><a name="09022571000211"></a>It is not only members of my party who believe that the police are a major absence from such a force; that position is supported by others. The noble Lord, Lord Stevens, conducted an inquiry for my party some time ago&#151;its findings have been published&#151;in which he supported the involvement of the police.</p>

<a name="90225-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="09022571000068"></a>What is the Government&#146;s objection? Why are we going to spend this afternoon going through 36 convoluted clauses to come out at the end with a force that combines Customs, immigration and Revenue but leaves those officers having to contact or bring in the police at any stage of their inquiries, rather than having the police as an integral part of what they do? The Government have made great play of the fact that our borders need to be secure; we support that. It is essential that we have borders that are not porous to crime, drug trafficking and trafficking of people or illegal immigrants and that there are proper regimes to deal with that. Given that those measures are not there as a whole, we will waste three days or so putting together something that is inadequate.</p>

<a name="90225-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="09022571000069"></a>It is essential that we discuss this clearly and cogently today and find out from the Government why they are not prepared to commit themselves to a dedicated border police. It is beyond peradventure that this will have to be revisited and that yet another piece of borders and immigration legislation will be required, which would be the ninth or 10th that we have had since 1997. A border police force would be able to combine the powers of the police, Customs and immigration in a single dedicated force.</p>

<a name="90225-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="09022571000070"></a>We have also included with our amendments stand part debates on the other clauses in Part 1. That is to give Members of the Committee the opportunity today also to discuss the proposals for what the Government are pleased to call their integrated force. I beg to move.</p>

We look at the crossing between UKBA and HMRC as an important step towards the ultimate goal that we share with the noble Baroness, so we welcome the intention behind Part 1 of allowing immigration officers and officials of the Secretary of State to exercise revenue and customs functions. As she implied, the lines of this debate are bound to follow those of the one that we had on similar amendments to the UK Borders Bill in 2007 at both Committee and Report stages. I do not intend to repeat the arguments that were used on both those occasions; I just want to highlight the differences between our ideas and those of the Tories, which have not changed substantially since that occasion.</p>

<a name="90225-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="09022571000072"></a>The Liberal Democrats&#146; policy is that an integrated borders force would cover the border functions of the police as well as the functions of the UKBA and HMRC, whereas the functions of what the Conservatives describe as a UK border police force would extend to a range of other matters, including the detection and removal of illegal overstayers and the investigation of employers of illegal immigrants. The suggestion that the border force be given these functions, which are essentially part of the normal duties of the police&#151;although they may require close liaison with UKBA and possibly others on the same lines as a result of the order-making power proposed in the Conservative amendments&#151;indicates some confusion in Tory thinking about where the boundaries of the United Kingdom are located.</p>

<a name="90225-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="09022571000073"></a>We maintain that the arguments in the Home Affairs Select Committee report HC 163, which was published in January 2001, for including the police in a force whose activities are confined to the borders are still valid. The report highlighted the ways in which the division of responsibilities at the ports foster inefficiencies, because the UKBA, HMRC and the police operate in slightly different ways, depending on the skills of their staff, their objectives and priorities, their equipment, their facilities and their legal basis. The report says, for example, that although larger ports such as Dover have Customs, immigration and police on duty, at the smaller ports there may only be a single police officer whose powers as an examining officer are confined to those in Schedule 7 to the Terrorism Act 2000. Those powers may be extended to an immigration or customs

<a name="90225-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="09022571000074"></a>Nevertheless, we are realistic about the prospects for dealing with this in the current Bill for two reasons. First, there would need to be full consultation with the Scottish Parliament, which has authority over policing in Scotland and thus at the UK&#146;s borders in Scotland. Secondly, although the noble Baroness has cited the report of the noble Lord, Lord Stevens, we have not consulted ACPO or the Association of Police Authorities, which would need to be given details of how the police at the borders would fully exchange roles with the UKBA and HMRC so that they could make useful suggestions in that regard. In 2007, the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, told your Lordships that ACPO was uncertain about the benefits of the single agency. However, we know that it has given the matter further thought since then. Could the Minister bring us up to date on ACPO&#146;s thinking and on any discussions that the Government have had with ACPO on Part 1 in particular? Can he at least tell us how the police at the borders can work more closely with HMRC and UKBA under existing legislation and whether the Government have any further thoughts on how to overcome the problems that were identified by the Home Affairs Select Committee before we get to the ultimate ideal of a unified border force?</p>

I have seen enough of multidisciplinary groups trying to work together to recognise that they frequently meet with some success. However, based on the experience that I have alluded to, I have no doubt that in any grouping you are much better off if you have a number of things in place. That is pertinent to what we are about to discuss. You need one clear chain of command; you need one clear line of responsibility, both up and down within the organisation; you need one very clear line of accountability to one identifiable person, which in this instance is presumably the Home Secretary; and it is clear that you need one set of powers that can be discharged throughout the organisation&#151;in this discussion we are considering powers that would include, among other things, those of search, arrest and detention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09022571000076"></a>I have always advocated that in this example the above powers should be discharged by one all-inclusive and all-embracing agency. I checked the ACPO position as recently as the end of last week. Its firm view, which I understand has been communicated to the Government, is exactly in line with what I have just outlined. ACPO would support an all-embracing, in-totality organisation to cover our borders. Not surprisingly, the association has reported that two or three of the 43 forces in England and Wales are less than supportive of the view. Understandably, perhaps, they are unwilling to give up their quite considerable involvement in the policing of ports and airports. To some extent, although I cannot gainsay it myself, I am given to understand that this is as much a financial point as anything else in that the forces would lose their budgetary base as a result. That could be addressed in other ways. But the

<a name="90225-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="09022571000077"></a>This morning, your Lordships&#146; Sub-Committee F of the European Union Committee took evidence from the Minister of State for Home Affairs. She said&#151;admittedly in a different context, but in one that is tangential to this&#151;that the Government&#146;s policy is to maintain strong borders. That statement is self-evident and flows through much of what we are going to discuss. However, I think that there is a nettle to be grasped. If we are going to maintain strong borders, it is wrong to try to brigade together disparate groups and treat them, if you like, as chalk and cheese. That fosters divisions within the organisation, invites partisan and protectionist attitudes and allows issues to fall between the cracks.</p>

<a name="90225-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09022571000078"></a>In papers that I have been shown and which I believe have been communicated to the Government, ACPO recommends that the force should be headed by a police officer. I am not so sure about that. If you take a series of what at the moment are separate organisations and roll them together into one, the early stages are important, so it might not be the best thing to have a police officer in charge. However, if counterterrorism is as important as we all believe, perhaps the first appointment could come from the police. I leave a question mark over that, as I do not necessarily follow that element of the ACPO argument.</p>

<a name="90225-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09022571000079"></a>We may touch on the key duties later, but let me cite the recommendations made in the Stevens report, which I endorse. They are to provide effective counterterrorism measures, combat other serious and organised crime, prevent the importation of illegal drugs and illegal weapons, prevent smuggling in order to protect the UK tax base, prevent illegal immigration and cover issues touching on environmental control and protection. That is quite a long list but it is by no means daunting. However, to discharge it all, if one accepts that as the premise, I believe&#151;here I shall repeat myself, but only briefly&#151;that one must have a unified command and a unified composition within that command. One must have, of course, unified technology, including IT, and one must have, importantly, unified conditions of service so as to attract and retain the best-quality personnel within it. A move to that obviously could not be taken in one gigantic step; one would have to move through a series of rational steps towards a clear and well defined goal.</p>

<a name="90225-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09022571000080"></a>I shall not weary the Committee further. I think that I have said enough to indicate why I support the amendment: we should have an all-embracing border agency or border force, which should involve all the agencies, including policing.</p>

<a name="90225-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="09022571000083"></a>According to the Conservative amendment, the first function of the border force should be,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="09022571000226"></a>&#147;detecting and removing illegal overstayers&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09022571000214"></a>Surely that is a kind of tabloid headline function to &#147;send them all home&#148;. But that is not what the Bill is about. We need a civilised approach to a difficult problem and I suggest that the Liberal Democrat amendment is superior in its approach and presentation to that contained in the amendment proposed by the Official Opposition.</p>

I should like to ask the Minister a couple of questions. The first question concerns the very real threats to this country that are almost never talked about. The Minister is tasked to deal with terrorism issues which, quite rightly, are in the forefront of his mind, but threats to the general population can occur through health risks and through animal health risks. If we were back in the years of foot and mouth, that issue would be at the forefront of noble Lords&#146; minds in this House when debating borders and border forces. How will the new force be more effective in dealing with such issues? I hope that it will be because there has been a continual failure to deal with the smuggling of meat products, which was one of the issues that led to foot and mouth.</p>

<a name="90225-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="09022571000085"></a>My second question concerns the risks that a physical border is unable to deal with: that is, issues around e-crime and e-terrorism. As the Government, rightly, physically strengthen our land borders with personnel to deal with particular issues, what effect will this have on pushing crime and terrorism on to the internet; for example, by encouraging terrorists to go down the completely different route of cyber attacks as opposed to physical attacks? While these attacks may not threaten life in the same way, the results economically could be devastating to this country.</p>

<a name="90225-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="09022571000086"></a>Finally, I would be sad if the effect of this was to conflate immigration and asylum-seeking issues with criminality as a matter of course. We must strongly resist that route.</p>

<a name="90225-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09022571000088"></a>That can occur anywhere within the country. It does not always emerge at the ports of entry. It seems to me that there will be a lack of clarity and a lack of a clear chain of command. I am very doubtful about both amendments.</p>

<a name="90225-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="09022571000090"></a>Taking up the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, I should have thought that there would not be a great deal of difficulty in dealing with the preventing and detecting of human trafficking by agreement between police forces, because, as he says, they are to be found from time to time in different parts of the country. One of the major concerns of course is at the ports, particularly at the airports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="09022571000091"></a>There is currently very good work being done by small groups of police. I am happy to say the Metropolitan Police are doing very good work with Romania that is funded by the European Commission. That is excellent work and I cannot see that it would be very difficult if that went either to the border police force or stayed with the special group of the Metropolitan Police by agreement. Work is done across police forces already and to have it in this UK border police force would not seem to me to prevent existing police forces from doing this work.</p>

One of the reasons why I support this UK border police force is to have a police force which is, as part of its work, committed to dealing with this very evil trade of trafficking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="09022571000093"></a>It does cross my mind that the Government have created a very serious omission by not having a border police force. I find it very sad that it is not in the Bill, but it may be that it will be said that it will take some time to achieve. The fact that it may take some time for it to be set up and be operational does not seem to be a good reason for not having it in place as part of the law, although it may take time for it actually to be up and working. What is sad about the Bill is that it does not even contemplate the possibility. That is a sad reflection on an aspiration that should be up front at this moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09022571000094"></a>I am not sure whether I support Amendment 1 or Amendment 2. It is rather sad that the two parties opposite have not got together to put forward a composite arrangement for the UK border police force, because what comes in each of them seems to be very good common sense. What is necessary is to have the police force. I find it sad that the Government have not thought it necessary to do so.</p>

With regard to the customs powers and the revenue powers and people that are being passed down, it is not clear from the Bill whether they will be one and the same person and whether the powers will be absorbed into a single power so far as the officers are concerned, nor how the Government envisage this aspect of their proposals being carried out.

That is my response to the noble Lord, Lord Hylton; when we are talking about human trafficking, we are talking about its detection and prevention at the borders, not within the United Kingdom as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="09022571000098"></a>It is a corollary of having a unified border force that we have these exercises of functions by UKBA officials of what was formerly the sole prerogative of HMRC. General customs matters, which are defined in Clause 1 and exclude matters relating to tax in particular, will be the proper responsibility of designated immigration officers under Clause 3. The designated officer would have the same powers as an HMRC officer with regard to general customs matters, and those include the functions listed in any other enactment except those listed in Clause 1(2). This gives me the opportunity to say that we have concerns about Clauses 16 and 17. That is why we put our names to the amendments leaving out those clauses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="09022571000099"></a>I do not know whether the Committee will have seen an article in the <I>Guardian</I> today quoting a paper written by the former Whitehall security and intelligence co-ordinator, Sir David Omand, in which he says that the security services will have to be given access to a sweeping range of personal data. There are already enormous databases, such as the passenger name records that have to be kept by airlines, that include millions of innocent people. The sharing of personal data between HMRC and UKBA may be a comparatively small step towards Sir David&#146;s ultimate goal, but it is Parliament&#146;s duty to build in ever more powerful safeguards as state agencies accumulate and share increasing amounts of potentially sensitive data about individuals. We would like to hear something from the Minister about how that is to be achieved in the Bill.</p>

It is good for us to make our position clear from the start as the Government did in advance of Second Reading debate. There is a wide range of options from a gargantuan organisation that combines the UK Border Agency with thousands of police officers and parts of other agencies to an entirely police-based body which will work in parallel with the UK Border Agency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="09022571000102"></a>The amendment tabled by the Opposition is similar to the one spoken to on 9 October 2007, for what was then the UK Borders Bill. From a brief comparison between the two, I can see that the Opposition&#146;s thinking has not been spelt out in any greater detail. That is a shame when the Government have put forward solid and reasoned proposals for the functional and management changes that we need to strengthen the arrangements for immigration and customs at our borders. These changes are ready to be implemented as soon as the Bill is passed.</p>

<a name="90225-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="09022571000103"></a>The new border force has already been stood up and started in its shadow form since April 2008 and is waiting for these things to be put properly into force. I am sure that the House will want to weigh the benefits of immediate, well-grounded and well-planned change against a much more generalised aspiration for a long-term future.</p>

<a name="90225-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="09022571000104"></a>I know that the House will agree that the protection of this country&#146;s borders is of vital importance to our national security and the well-being of our citizens. That is why the Government have already taken steps to strengthen and integrate operational activity at the border, bringing immigration and customs functions together in a way which is properly connected to local policing. This work started out as a discussion in July 2007, in a Statement by the Prime Minister, just after the attacks on Tiger Tiger and Glasgow airport. One issue that I looked at was border security, with a resultant Cabinet Office study, <I>Security </I><I>in a</I><I> Global Hub</I>.</p>

<a name="90225-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="09022571000105"></a>Abroad and at ports and airports up and down the country, border force operational staff are working on a daily basis to protect this country from those who traffic people. Trafficking of drugs, the import of dangerous guns, knives and wild animal meats&#151;and I have some statistics on that&#151;were also discussed this morning. At the same time, those staff provide a welcome to tourists and business travellers and a service to businesses that import goods and drive our economy. Far from what the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, has said, the police are already fully involved. I will come onto that in more detail later.</p>

<a name="90225-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="09022571000106"></a>It might be useful initially to provide some examples of the way in which the agency is already delivering real and practical improvements, making our nation and its people safer, since it was stood up, in shadow form, in April 2008. There has been flexible deployment of our 9,000 border guards to search for and seize record quantities of Class A drugs, dangerous weapons, people hidden in trucks and trailers, and an estimated saving of about &#163;150 million to tax revenue. We have begun cross-training 2,600 frontline officers in screening more passengers travelling to and from the United Kingdom to reduce waiting times over peak summer periods.</p>

<a name="90225-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="09022571000107"></a>There is a new deal for port operators through service level agreements that reduce duplication, improve the experience of customers and make us more effective. Police expertise has been embedded at both the strategic level&#151;and Chief Constable, Roger Baker, is a member of the executive board of UKBA&#151;and at the operational level, with more than 280 police officers seconded to UKBA in local immigration teams up and down our country.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_214"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column 214</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90225-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="09022571000108"></a>Similarly, UKBA staff are embedded in police countertrafficking teams at Heathrow and Sheffield. Our intelligence capability has been linked through the national border targeting centre&#151;where police and UKBA staff screen passenger information&#151;and in police counterterrorism and organised crime units. Our enhanced port security teams have increased significantly the number of referrals to the Security Service following the delivery of counterterrorist training and online updates. Cutting-edge technology has been used to screen more than 3.5 million vehicles for the illegal importation of nuclear and radiological materials.</p>

<a name="90225-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="09022571000109"></a>The Government are not against making structural change in the area of law enforcement and policing where there is a compelling case to do so. Take the example of the Serious Organised Crime Agency, which brought together the four agencies which had hitherto dealt with organised crime&#151;the National Crime Squad, the National Criminal Intelligence Service, part of HMRC and part of the Immigration Service. A Cabinet Office review had identified some overlap of functions and unclear lines of accountability between these agencies. A White Paper and a substantial Bill followed, leading to the establishment of SOCA in April 2006, which was designed to be more than the sum of its parts.</p>

<a name="90225-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="09022571000110"></a>This is relevant to the present debate. The establishment of SOCA involved a huge amount of work, but it was a much more straightforward process than establishing a single UK border police force. SOCA was about drawing together four national agencies. The border policing picture is significantly more complicated; I will return to this complexity point shortly.</p>

<a name="90225-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="09022571000111"></a>In other important areas relating to public protection, we have not pursued major structural change. Take, for example, counterterrorism policing. We have not established a national counterterrorism police force, nor do we intend to. Our approach is different: working with the leadership of the police service, we have supported and underpinned, with record investment, the development of what has become known as the police counterterrorism network. This comprises regionally based specialised police units, known as counterterrorism units and counterterrorism intelligence units, which are increasingly integrated and co-ordinated at a national level. The network is providing the benefits of a national enterprise without, crucially, this becoming dislocated from local policing or disturbing the critical settlement of accountability for policing in this country.</p>

<a name="90225-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="09022571000112"></a>Last year&#146;s Green Paper on police reform consulted on what model of policing, working alongside the UK Border Agency, would work best in terms of increasing security at our borders and improving public protection. That consultation did not throw up a consensus view among the key stakeholders on a preferred model for policing at the border. The formal stated position of the Association of Chief Police Officers was in favour of a single national border police service. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked that question, and the noble Lord, Lord Dear, referred to it. But ACPO acknowledged that this would need considerable further planning and development as a model and would have the potential to bring with it significant additional costs. The noble Lord, Lord Dear, was wrong about it  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_215"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column 215</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>being an all-embracing agency. ACPO&#146;s formal response favoured a single national police service, working alongside the border service.</p>

<a name="90225-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="09022571000113"></a>The Association of Police Authorities took a completely different view. It was very strongly opposed to the creation of a single national border force. In my brief period as a Minister, I find it interesting how often the views of ACPO and others differ on these issues.</p>

<a name="90225-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="09022571000114"></a>We have reflected very carefully on the thoughtful engagement on this issue from our key stakeholders. As I have said, the police are already fully involved and I have referred to a number of areas where they are. We acknowledge that more can be done to improve our border security&#151;as always, more can be done. We are therefore working with the leadership of the police service to develop an even greater enhancement of our already close working arrangements, of the collaboration between police forces and between the police and the border force. There is, coincidentally, a day-long workshop happening today, involving the police service, the border force, Home Office officials and others to work on proposals for making even more practical improvements.</p>

<a name="90225-0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09022571000115"></a>Our intention is to pursue a phased approach to this significant enhancement of our border security, concentrating first on counterterrorism. There are three elements to this: first, exploiting the increasingly integrated approach being brought about through the development of the police counterterrorism network, about which I spoke a little earlier, and its links with local Special Branch; secondly, the enhanced national co-ordination of specialist policing assets; and, thirdly, strengthening even further the increasingly good working relationship between the border force and the police service, including through more joint working on operations and intelligence sharing.</p>

Why are the police still being left to one side? The purpose of the Bill as we understand it is to ensure that all revenue, customs and immigration functions are able to be carried out by particular officers&#151;some may be separate, some may be not. It is clear that that is the direction that the Government want. The police are still being left to one side despite what the Minister is saying.</p>

I was hoping to get across how closely the police work with the border force in every area and at every level&#151;strategic, operational and tactical. You do not have to be formed up as a unit to achieve those things. We are very clear that it is into the area covered by this Bill that we should put our current energies and finite resources of people and money. It will provide the advantages of robust collaboration, but without the drawbacks of pursuing the significant structural change that would be involved in establishing a new national police force. Those drawbacks would be substantial. I shall come to them shortly, because it is important to explain these things and talk them through. Just on collaboration, we have proposed measures in the Policing and Crime Bill, presently in another place, which clarify and strengthen the legal framework for police collaboration and which, as I understand it, have received broad support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09022571000118"></a>As we have heard already today, there are very different views on border policing issues, but our bottom-line judgment is that we have not yet seen a robust, compelling case for the operational benefits to be derived from creating a new national border police force, such as would outweigh the potential risks and delays involved. The case for fundamental structural change has not been made.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90225-0004.htm"/>


<a name="90225-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="09022571000119"></a>Having said that, and having set out what the Government are doing to improve our border security, I should like to spend a moment or two exploring the complexities around the amendment proposed. It is a serious and complicated proposal of which we need to consider the detail. There are significant issues which are simply not addressed in the amendment. They go to the heart of what is practical and what can be done.</p>

<a name="90225-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="09022571000120"></a>On the functions of the proposed new force, I am slightly quizzical about the fact that although the amendment tabled by noble Lords proposes the establishment of a UK border police force, it does not ascribe explicitly to that force any of the three broad elements of policing which take place at the border&#151;namely, Special Branch, which is responsible for national security and counterterrorism; protective security, providing policing to secure the infrastructure of ports; and general policing, dealing with crime and disorder. I am not clear either about how many functions of the UK Border Agency or the border force the proposed force would absorb, what would be left and what it would form in terms of a coherent set of responsibilities&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, I think, touched on this concern.</p>

<a name="90225-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09022571000121"></a>On personnel, there is no detail on who would make up the border police force, from where they would come, what powers they would have, and what the terms and conditions of the staff would look like. We need to be clear that people are at the heart of this.</p>

<a name="90225-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09022571000122"></a>The amendment is silent on leadership. Who is in charge of the force? Is it a chief constable&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Dear, touched on that. From that discussion flow some crucial questions about accountability of the force. To whom is the new force to be accountable? Is there to be a new, bespoke police authority-type body? What about the constitution? How are priorities set? Who monitors outcomes and progress? Are noble Lords opposite planning on putting key immigration functions into the hands of a chief constable? Would that mean a chief constable reporting directly to the Home Secretary, including on operational matters? Where does that leave the debate on the politicising of policing?</p>

<a name="90225-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09022571000123"></a>Is there an inspection function of the proposed new force? What about a mechanism for people who would like to complain about their treatment by it? Does it come under the ambit of the Independent Police Complaints Authority?</p>

<a name="90225-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09022571000124"></a>There is also the devolution question, as was raised very accurately by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury. There is a major issue here. There are 52 territorial forces in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and the picture is very complex. Policing in Scotland is a devolved matter, and I can see huge complications. How will it work? What will happen in Northern Ireland?</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_217"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column 217</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90225-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09022571000125"></a>Finally, we need to consider the crucial question of funding and who will pay for the establishment of a new force. Would it be from top-slicing of the general policing grant&#151;I think it probably would have to be&#151;by carving out money from existing specific policing grants, or by some other means? Has there been any discussion with the police authorities about this? When one day long in the future the party opposite comes into power, I shall be fascinated to go through in some detail the 300, 400 or 500 clauses required for this sort of proposal.</p>

<a name="90225-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09022571000126"></a>I make no apologies for raising these issues. My intention in doing so is not to be &#147;clever&#148; but to illustrate just how complex this area is, because we have been wrestling with it. As a Government, we are in a position of having to work through how practically to bring about change and make improvements in public services. We are making the nation safer already with a stronger border and joined-up border force, and this Bill reinforces what has been done already and what needs to be enacted to get the full benefit and effect. We have a clear way forward for our border force and for its relationship to border policing, which will certainly enhance public protection and security. The case for fundamental structural change in terms of creating a UK-wide border police force has not been made out. Even if it could be, the present proposal leaves so many questions unanswered as to make it unworkable as an immediate practical proposition. Part 1 of the present Bill, on the other hand, gives us a well grounded, practical basis for building on the substantial progress that we have already made. I hope that the House will agree that this is a substantial bird in the hand, which we should not put at risk for the sake of a flash of colourful feathers in a rather ill defined bush.</p>

<a name="90225-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09022571000127"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, raised the issue of e-crime. She is absolutely right that this is an area of great concern and worry, but we have done a lot about it recently&#151;we have now formed an e-crime unit. More broadly, the newly formed National Security Secretariat, which I have set up in the Cabinet Office, addresses the key issue of cyber-security, with a number of papers tackling that matter. People are pushing on there; it is becoming a much greater worry.</p>

<a name="90225-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09022571000128"></a>I said that I would talk about the smuggling of meat. The border force will have customs powers to tackle that. We have actually had some success since the force was established; something in terms of 238,000 kilogrammes of products of animal origin have been picked up&#151;things that should not have been brought into this country&#151;which is quite staggering.</p>

<a name="90225-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="09022571000129"></a>Mention was made of an article by Sir David Omand about data. We make a proposal on how data will be looked after, as we see that as very important. Sir David was being quoted with reference to the IMP and the IMP consultation document. The reason why we produced such a document is that this is such a significant issue; we need to look at it very carefully and get it right. One of my concerns is not so much about government, because we are scrutinised and we take it seriously. Sometimes I get concerned about how much data on people are flowing around privately,   


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_218"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column 218</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>whether on Twitter, Facebook or whatever&#151;and even when people use their credit cards. Some of those things I find quite worrying.</p>

<a name="90225-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09022571000130"></a>I turn to the question of clauses stand part. I know that this response seems rather long, but the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, was right that I should address those clauses and go through them. I shall do so in some detail, which I hope will give some clarification.</p>

<a name="90225-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09022571000131"></a>Clauses 1 to 5 give the Secretary of State the power to exercise general customs functions concurrently with the commissioners. Clause 1 specifically prevents the Secretary of State from exercising any of the revenue functions of the commissioners or HM Revenue and Customs and any of the commissioners&#146; non-revenue functions that are not relevant to the UK Border Agency&#146;s role, such as the work of HM Revenue and Customs inland. We are pulling part of HMRC out, and she should not be responsible for any of that work inland. Clause 2 enables the Secretary of State to make an order to amend the list of matters specified in Clause 1(2) that are considered general customs matters for the purposes of the Bill and to make any necessary consequential modifications to other enactments.</p>

<a name="90225-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="09022571000132"></a>Clauses 3 to 5 set out the arrangements by which functions relating to general customs matters will be exercised by the Secretary of State&#146;s officials. In effect this will allow the Home Secretary to designate immigration officers and any other of her officials as designated general customs officials. Later, I shall expand on the detail of what exactly that means.</p>

<a name="90225-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="09022571000133"></a>On Clauses 6 to 8, as I have explained, customs functions will not be vested in the Secretary of State. By convention decisions on tax liability, including customs duties and tax administration generally, are kept at arm&#146;s length from Ministers. The Bill therefore puts in place a different arrangement for dealing with customs revenue matters than that relating to general customs matters. While the general customs functions set out in Clause 1 are vested in the Secretary of State and designated general customs officials, Clause 6 creates within the Home Office the position of Director of Border Revenue. The customs revenue functions of the UK Border Agency will be vested in the director and those customs revenue officials will be designated to her. Clause 7 sets out what these revenue functions are and Clause 8 enables the Treasury, by order, to add to, remove or modify the list of the director&#146;s functions.</p>

<a name="90225-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="09022571000134"></a><b>C</b>lause 9 enables the Director of Border Revenue to delegate his or her functions to allow for operational flexibility. In practice most of the director&#146;s functions will be undertaken by officers of the Border Agency under the designation arrangements set out in Clause 11. Only those designated officers will be able to exercise the coercive powers currently relied on by officers of HM Revenue and Customs at the border for law enforcement purposes.</p>

<a name="90225-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="09022571000135"></a>Clause 10 requires that the Director of Border Revenue, in the exercise of any of her functions, and any person to whom such functions have been delegated, must comply with any directions of a general nature given by the Treasury. This reflects existing provisions in Section 11 of the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005, which require the commissioners to comply with any directions of a general nature  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_219"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column 219</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>given by the Treasury. While this power enables the Treasury to make directions relating to the Director of Border Revenue&#146;s strategies, critically, it does not permit Treasury directions to be issued in relation to day-to-day or operational decisions. Clause 10 also requires the director to act in accordance with the policies of the Commissioners of HM Revenue and Customs. This includes the application of any concession published by the commissioners and any interpretation of the law issued by the commissioners. This requirement will ensure that there is consistency in the administration of taxes between HM Revenue and Customs and the UK Border Agency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="09022571000136"></a>Clauses 11 to 13 set out arrangements for enabling the Director of Border Revenue to designate officials for the purpose of exercising functions and powers<I></I>relating to customs and revenue matters.</p>

The Minister has given the broad outline of what the clauses mean but I want to get to the bones of this and the questions that I have asked on a couple of occasions. As I understand it, some of the powers of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, in terms of revenue and customs, are being handed to the Border Agency. Not only are some of the powers being dealt with in that way but presumably a number of the officials will also be transferred. As I understand it, at the moment there is no link between what a revenue official does and what a customs official does. I further understand that neither of them has any idea what an immigration official does. However, the Bill proposes that these all come together and suggests that appropriate training will take place. However, if I had expertise in revenue, how could I suddenly become an expert in customs matters and immigration matters if I was obliged to undertake all those things myself? Or, is this just a device whereby the revenue officials come into the border agency, the customs officers come into border agency and the immigration officers are already there? Do those three groups continue to carry out the duties that they would have been carrying out anyway?</p>

<a name="90225-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09022571000138"></a>That is the nub of this; what will these animals look like? When you come into the country and are accosted by an official from the border agency, will you know that they carry the powers of customs, immigration and revenue all together, or will a customs officer have to call in the revenue people, if that is appropriate? We need to unpick this and I say with great respect that the Minister is not doing that. We have had a sort of Second Reading review of the clauses, but we are now into the meat. I should be grateful if he would get into the meat and perhaps we could have a discussion as to what these officials will look like, what their responsibilities will be and who will be responsible for them.</p>

They are customs-type people who understand customs rules; they are customs officers&#151;the chaps who are normally at the ports and that sort of thing.</p>

<a name="90225-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="09022571000140"></a>The aim is that those people become part of the border force. As I have said, the shadow force has already stood up. That border force includes them and the people who were in the BIA&#151;now called UKBA&#151;and are immigration officers who understand immigration law, and have practised immigration matters and that sort of thing. We have also sucked into the border force people like the visas officers abroad and other little ancillary groups, who together will make the totality of the border force.</p>

<a name="90225-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="09022571000141"></a>Clearly, we wish to use customs officers as part of this border force, partly to obtain more flexibility by having one person who can do customs and immigration, because that will mean that you go through one person and do not have to go through two people to get into the country. This gives us a lot of flexibility in terms of drafting people to small ports, moving people around and those sorts of things. That person will need to have training which enables him to understand and perform the immigration functions. The immigration officers who will be carrying out a customs, HMRC, function will have to be trained to do that. In the detail of the Bill it is stated that we will not do that with every single one of them, because we do not need to, but many will have that dual training to be able to do both things.</p>

<a name="90225-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09022571000142"></a>Already, for example, the Home Secretary has a responsibility for some general customs matters, including drugs smuggling, weapons smuggling, plant and animal health controls, and so on. We intend to move across to the border agency functions such as collecting duty at the red channel, catching tobacco smugglers and charging duty on postal packets, which are already on the border. HMRC will still do all the deep revenue things within the country, totally separately from any of this.</p>

<a name="90225-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="09022571000143"></a>However, because we do not allow Ministers to get closely involved in those revenue customs matters, we have to set up a division of responsibility whereby the officer in the Home Office responsible for the agency actually has another hat, which allows her to be responsible to the Treasury for these particular matters.</p>

<a name="90225-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09022571000144"></a>I hope that that clarifies this issue a little more, but the proposal gives us huge flexibility, it lets us use this force more usefully, it means you do not have to go through two checks when going through, it means you can deploy people to small ports, and it means we can use our force. We are not going to cut jobs by doing this; we are effectively increasing the size of our border force and giving it that single focus. I know that some people might think that this is amusing, but the fact that all these people are already in a uniform makes a&#151;</p>

In relation to the shadow form that will come rushing in, how long does it take to train a Revenue officer in all that they need to know to run a border, and how long does it take to train a Customs officer to do all of that? Does it take two years or one and a half months?

It is more than 20 years since I was the Minister responsible in another place for Customs, but during that period there were only about 30 ports of entry into this country&#151;or airports at any rate&#151;which were designated international and therefore had a Customs presence. Within the past 10 years, I have landed at a significant airport at which the only Customs presence was a red telephone on the wall which you could call if you wished. Has that changed in the past 10 years so that all airports are now international? If not, will the Bill produce a situation whereby all airports become international, with a Customs presence, because everyone will be interchangeable?</p>

I always say that we could expend our entire national wealth on counterterrorism, but obviously it has to be based on risk. However, the noble Lord is absolutely right: there are a lot of small ports&#151;small airports and small coastal ports&#151;where very often there is no one to do a check. This will give us more flexibility and allow us, with intelligence-based information as well, to cover more of those ports than we have been able to do. However, I would be wrong if I said that we will cover them all, because we will not and cannot do that, and realistically we should not try to, because it is just so difficult. What we do has to be done on the basis of intelligence; it has to be done with irregularity so as to catch people out; and we need to use other methods to ensure that we ensnare people who are criminal or wish to do us harm in other ways. However, this measure will definitely make us more capable, and is already making us more capable, than we were before.</p>

Those clauses set out arrangements for enabling the Director of Border Revenue to designate officials for the purpose of exercising functions and powers relating to customs revenue matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="09022571000157"></a>Clause 11 provides that immigration officers and other officials of the Secretary of State who can exercise general customs functions may be designated as customs revenue officials by the Director of Border Revenue. This enables appropriately designated UK Border Agency officials to do everything that an HM Revenue and Customs officer might do in relation to customs revenue matters. This will ensure that officials have the full range of customs powers that they need to be able to deal with any illegal goods, such as drugs or tobacco. UK Border Agency officials will thus be able to exercise immigration and customs functions, both revenue and non-revenue.</p>

<a name="90225-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09022571000158"></a>Clauses 12 and 13 make additional provision in respect of designated customs revenue officials. Clause 12 mirrors for the designation of customs revenue officials the provisions of Clause 4 in relation to the designation of general customs officials.</p>

<a name="90225-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="09022571000159"></a>The provision that we are making is intended to provide flexibility in the designation of customs officials and to provide any necessary safeguards. Accordingly, Cause 12 allows the director to limit the particular functions vested in an official, or the purposes for which any such official may exercise customs revenue functions in general. This provides flexibility for the designation to reflect the official&#146;s allocated duties. It also ensures that the director must be satisfied that a person is capable and appropriately trained. The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, made that point at Second Reading and she was absolutely right: they have to be appropriately trained. We are aware of this and we are already going through exactly what the TPs will be to train people before designating anyone as a customs revenue official.</p>

<a name="90225-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="09022571000160"></a>Clause 13 requires that a designated customs revenue official must comply with directions given by the director in the exercise of customs revenue functions. Clause 14 sets out the purposes for which customs information may be used and disclosed, and by whom.</p>

There is a separate confidentiality framework for the use and disclosure of information provided by HM Revenue and Customs and the Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office, which is set out in existing legislation including, in particular, the UK Borders Act 2007.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, is quite right about this clause, which is of great concern to us, too. The Minister was saying that Clause 16 is very narrow and that only in a small number of cases would this data sharing take place. The difficulty is that the Government have included a let-out clause that talks about the prevention of crime. I am sure that we shall examine that in more detail, but it is hard to see how it is a narrow function, as an official could claim that almost anything was done to aid the prevention of crime.

The Minister can rule it out of order if he wishes. Twenty years ago, one problem of friction between the commissioners and the unions was that working in customs positions at ports was an attractive job and there was a desire that the posts should, if possible, be filled on the basis of Buggins&#146;s turn. On the other hand, there were quite clearly customs officers&#151;other than those who were good dog handlers and achieved great results with the assistance of highly intelligent spaniels&#151;who had a peculiar knack for identifying people who were behaving in a criminal manner. Given the importance of what we are debating, will identifying people who have the knack take preference over appointing those to the office simply on the basis of Buggins&#146;s turn, or has that already happened?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="09022571000168"></a>The type of information that UKBA will handle and disclose will be persons stopped at ports and airports who are smuggling goods and legitimate travellers&#146; payment of customs duty at the red channel. UKBA officers may disclose certain interceptions to trading standards&#151;for example, goods that may pose public health risks. Those sorts of things will be used as statistical data primarily, but personal customs information cannot be exchanged or used. I hope that that clarifies the point.</p>

<a name="90225-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="09022571000169"></a>We had reached Clause 16. As I said, where personal customs information has been disclosed, recipients may not further disclose that information unless they obtain the consent of a relevant official or do so in accordance with the limited and specific circumstances set out in the clause. For example, a designated customs official could disclose information to a police officer in relation to a matter of national security in accordance with the Clause 16 exceptions. The police officer could then lawfully further disclose the information to a third party, such as the security and intelligence agencies, provided that the disclosure was also made in accordance with one or more of the Clause 16 exceptions.</p>

<a name="90225-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="09022571000170"></a>The test in respect of personal customs revenue information is stricter still. Under Clause 17, before a person can disclose such personal information they must ensure not only that the disclosure is being made for one of the reasons prescribed in the Clause 16 exceptions but that it does not contravene a restriction imposed by the Commissioners for Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs.</p>

<a name="90225-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="09022571000171"></a>Clause 18 creates a similar criminal offence to that of unlawful disclosure of personal customs information under the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005 to cover the Home Office and the UK Border Agency. That means that a relevant official of the Home Office, the Secretary of State for the Home Department or any Minister of the Crown in that department or other person who discloses personal customs information in breach of Clause 15(1), Clause 15(2) or Clause 17 will commit a criminal offence.</p>

That disclosure can be made only with the permission of what is deemed a relevant officer, who is presumably over and above the officer whom we are discussing. Is an offence of wrongful disclosure committed if the information is given to an outsider, a newspaper or a solicitor acting for the defence or for someone being charged?

<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09022571000174"></a>Clause 19 puts it beyond doubt that nothing in Clauses 14 to 17 authorises the making of a disclosure that contravenes the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998 or as prohibited by Part 1 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. Clause 19 serves three important purposes. First, it ensures that the Freedom of Information Act cannot be used to obtain confidential taxpayer information. Secondly, it provides that none of the exceptions to the duties of confidentiality created by this Bill will override the protections afforded to personal information in other legislation, including the Data Protection Act. Thirdly, it secures equality of treatment of personal customs information under the Freedom of Information Act, no mater where it is held by HM Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09022571000177"></a>Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs already shares customs information with the Secretary of State for her immigration purposes. Section 41A permits disclosure of customs information to those responsible for the discharge of customs functions by the UK Border Agency or any person acting on its behalf with information for use in discharge of customs functions exercisable by the recipient. In particular, this will enable those staff who currently work for HM Revenue and Customs and who will soon transfer to the UK Border Agency to continue to receive relevant information for the discharge of their customs functions. Section 41B, meanwhile, sets out the specific circumstances in which those who receive customs information supplied under new Section 41A may themselves disclose it to a third party. Wrongful disclosure of such information to a third party will be subject to the criminal sanction prescribed in Section 42 of the UK Borders Act 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09022571000178"></a>Clause 21 amends Section 36 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act, which imposes a duty to share information relating to persons or goods crossing the frontier between the police, HM Revenue and Customs and the Secretary of State. The amendment effected by this clause ensures that the duty under Section 36 reflects the fact that the UK Border Agency will in future exercise customs functions. Information is, of course, an essential tool in support of law enforcement and national security. It is also key to the agency being able to secure the optimum deployment of its resources across all its functions&#151;noble Lords

<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09022571000179"></a>Clause 22 provides that the Secretary of State may by order apply any provision of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 that relates to the investigation of offences or the detention of persons by police officers to investigations conducted or persons detained by designated customs officials or immigration officers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="09022571000180"></a>Clause 25 provides for the sharing of facilities and services between Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs and the UK Border Agency. In future, the principal responsibility for the exercise of customs and revenue functions at the border will rest with the new border force rather than with HM Revenue and Customs, and a number of HM Revenue and Customs staff will also transfer to that force. Accordingly, specific provision is needed to facilitate the transfer to the Home Office of the rights, powers, duties and liabilities under the contracts that Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs currently has with those staff due to transfer.</p>

<a name="90225-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="09022571000181"></a>Clause 26 amends Section 48 of the UK Borders Act 2007, which established the office of the Chief Inspector of the Border and Immigration Agency, the forerunner of the UK Border Agency, and Clause 27 gives the Secretary of State power to make regulations to confer functions on Her Majesty&#146;s Inspectorate of Constabulary, the Scottish inspectors and the Northern Ireland inspectors in relation to those with responsibility for the exercise of immigration and customs functions by the UK Border Agency.</p>

<a name="90225-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="09022571000182"></a>Section 41 of the Police and Justice Act 2006 provides the Secretary of State with a power to make regulations conferring functions on the Independent Police Complaints Commission in relation to the exercise by immigration officers and officials of the Secretary of State of specified immigration and asylum enforcement functions. Clause 28 enables the Secretary of State to further extend the functions of the IPCC to inspect in the future any contractual services provided in relation to the discharge of those enforcement functions. The chief inspector provides an external review, independent of the UK Border Agency. Currently, that remit applies to immigration, asylum and nationality functions only. Clause 26 will allow the chief inspector to look at the full range of functions exercised by the new border force. This clause also specifies those functions that the chief inspector shall monitor and report on only if directed to do so by the Secretary of State. Allowing HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, HM Inspector of Constabulary, the Scottish inspectors and the Northern Ireland inspectors to continue to have oversight of removal centres, short-term holding facilities and detention facilities will ensure inspection by inspectors with the right experience and expertise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="09022571000183"></a>I will deal with other provisions covered in Clauses 29 to 32 as a group, despite their variety. Clause 29 enables the Attorney-General, if she considers it appropriate, to assign functions by order to the Director of Revenue and Customs Prosecutions to institute or assume the conduct of criminal proceedings in England

I have been letting him drift on because it is nice that he is able to read out his brief, but perhaps I may pick up on a couple of points that I would have made during a clause stand part debate.</p>

<a name="90225-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09022571000185"></a>Clause 29 seems to follow more or less exactly the provisions in the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005, when those powers were given to the commissioners. Are there any differences here? When legislation is amended or chunks of it are taken out in new legislation, I think that it is beyond the wit of most of us to get into a detailed examination of the legislation it has come from. I have looked at the 2005 Act and I want to be clear about Clause 29 in that the power here is to undertake the prosecution of offenders. Would that power extend to the Director of Revenue and Customs being able to bring in lawyers and barristers, or would the people dealing with such cases come from in-house? Are these matters contracted out for prosecution purposes or are they always handled internally? I ask that because subsection (2) gives a list of the people to whom subsection (1), which assigns the function of the institution of criminal proceedings, applies. Subsection (2) then delegates further from the Director of Revenue to others who are responsible for dealing with matters which obviously will go to court. It would be helpful to know where the buck stops in the institution of legal proceedings, and who then is brought in to conduct those legal proceedings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09022571000187"></a>Clause 30 deals with the accounting of revenue collected by the UK Border Agency and Clause 31 provides the flexibility to meet any future changes in the revenue accounting arrangements set out in Clause 30. Clause 30 requires the Director of Border Revenue and the Secretary of State to pay any money received by way of revenue to Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs in accordance with Treasury directions. The term &#147;revenue&#148; is defined for the purposes of Clause 30 to include all duties and taxes, penalties and the proceeds of forfeitures. This will include duties and taxes collected from passengers in the red channel and on goods imported in the post.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09022571000188"></a>The current intention is that these moneys will be paid directly into Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs existing bank accounts. The revenue collected is not available to the new border force to fund its operations and Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs will be responsible for the payment of receipts into the Consolidated Fund, together with its other revenue receipts. Clause 31 provides flexibility for future changes in the revenue accounting arrangements set out in Clause 30.</p>

<a name="90225-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09022571000189"></a>Clause 32 amends Section 21 of the UK Borders Act so that it applies to the UK Border Agency and to those persons who have principal responsibility for exercising customs functions at the border.</p>

<a name="90225-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09022571000190"></a>Clause 33 provides an order-making power for the Secretary of State to modify enactments. This provision will ensure that current and future legislation which is relevant to and necessary for the exercise of customs functions by the UK Border Agency is applied as appropriate. Specifically, the provisions will enable the Secretary of State, subject to consultation with the commissioners, in certain prescribed circumstances to modify and apply legislation to the relevant persons specified in the clause or to the exercise of functions by those persons. For example, the order may be used to apply legislation currently applicable to the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs and their officers to the Secretary of State, the Director of Border Revenue, designated customs officials, immigration officers or other officials of the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="90225-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09022571000191"></a>Although Part 1 of the Bill provides for references in certain enactments to the commissioners and their officers to be construed, where appropriate, to include references to the Secretary of State and her officials or the Director of Border Revenue, these provisions cannot be used to modify the content of relevant enactments. Accordingly, Clause 33 is necessary to ensure that legislation currently applying to Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs will in future apply, with any necessary and appropriate modifications, to the Secretary of State and her officials or the Director of Border Revenue. Clause 33 will also ensure that any terms in enactments, such as references to the offices of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs or to particular staff grades within that department, are applied appropriately to the Secretary of State and her officials or the Director of Border Revenue.</p>

<a name="90225-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09022571000192"></a>Lastly, Clause 33 requires the Secretary of State to consult the commissioners before making an order under the clause which makes provision in relation to a customs matter, whether general customs or customs revenue, or in relation to the exercise of a customs functions. As the order may amend primary legislation, it will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure to ensure the appropriate level of parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

<a name="90225-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09022571000193"></a>Clause 34 provides for incidental, supplementary, consequential, transitional or transitory provision to be made by order. Such provision may be made where considered appropriate for the purposes of Part 1, or in consequence of that, or to give full effect to any provision made by or under that part. It is not possible to anticipate all of the areas in which such provision might be required, either now or in the future. This clause will provide the necessary flexibility to ensure that Part 1 of the Bill delivers all that it is intended to achieve and to respond to future developments in other areas which impact on the border force. This clause sets out the scope of the order-making power, and establishes that where the order amends or repeals primary legislation, it will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. Otherwise, as the order may deal only with incidental, supplementary, consequential,  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_230"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column 230</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>transitional or transitory matters, the negative resolution procedure will provide the appropriate level of parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

<a name="90225-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="09022571000194"></a>Clause 35 makes further provision about subordinate legislation made under Part 1 of the Bill. It provides that, with one exception, the orders and regulations made under Part 1 of the Bill must be made be made by statutory instrument and establishes the scope of such instruments. This provision also establishes the parliamentary procedures to which orders and regulations, made under Part 1, are subject.</p>

<a name="90225-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09022571000195"></a>The clause makes clear that orders made under Clause 29, relating to the assign to the function of the Director of Revenue and Customs Prosecutions, are not made by statutory instrument and follow no parliamentary procedure. This approach is consistent with similar order-making powers already available to the Attorney-General, such as that found in Section 35 of the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005, relating to customs prosecution, and Section 3(2)(g) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, in relation to the assignment of functions to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Clause 36 provides interpretation of the terminology used in Part 1.</p>

<a name="90225-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09022571000196"></a>I am afraid that it was rather a long slog going through all of those provisions, but I hope that was useful, because I know that I will be answering some specific questions later. I hope it was of value; I think it was important. The amendments would not make our nation and people safer. Indeed, the turmoil caused would actually make our country less safe, while the detailed work that is already underway and happening is making us safer.</p>

However, I am still unconvinced about the desirability of entirely incorporating the police into a force, although I think that it is. I shall read very carefully what has been said. It is still my view that we will miss a trick if we do not incorporate the police and ensure that they are more than consultees in what is going on in defence of our borders. Every one of us here is interested in ensuring that we have the best possible mechanisms for ensuring that our borders are safe and secure, so that they are intimidating where they have to be intimidating but welcoming where they should be welcoming.

<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="09022571000206"></a>Amendments 3 and 5, in Clause 1, are probing amendments, as are many of the other amendments coming forward today. They are intended to probe the functions of the Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and the powers being transferred to the Secretary of State and the UK Border Agency. As I noted on Second Reading, Part 1,</p>
<ul><a name="09022571000232"></a>&#147;parts the department of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs from most of its customs and many of its revenue functions, and gives them to the Home Office&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 11/2/09; col. 1133.]</ul>
<p><a name="09022571000215"></a>I also expressed concerns about the proposals. We have already covered some of those concerns. They include the Government&#146;s capacity or competence to handle sensitive information; the extension of policing powers being given to the UK Border Agency&#151;by default really, because there are no police; and the level of training to be provided to officials of the agency.</p>

<a name="90225-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09022571000207"></a>I think that we will be going through subsection (8) in detail but should like to know now what is meant by &#147;general customs function&#148;. It is a new phrase. We know about the customs functions that are part of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, but what are the general customs functions relevant to the Bill? Once we know, we can decide whether we feel it appropriate that they should be transferred. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="09022571000208"></a><b><a name="90225-0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09022571000358"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> The noble Baroness&#146;s amendment allows us to explore what powers and functions immigration officers will have when they are acting as customs officers as opposed to what they will not have, which is spelt out in Clause 1(2). The powers of HMRC officers, as far as we know, are specified in the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 and the Finance Act 2008. They include a number of powers which are clearly not relevant to border posts, such as visiting and inspecting without obtaining consent and searching computer records; and other powers which may be exercisable at the borders, such as invasive physical search, seizure of goods, impounding aircraft and ships, and powers to arrest and detain. What we need to know in each of these cases is whether these powers will be exercisable by immigration officers and where to look for the particular statutory authority that confers those powers on them.</p>

<a name="90225-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="09022590000001"></a>The Finance Act 2008 renews the criminal offence of destroying or concealing records and introduces several penalties for non-compliance. It requires a third party to provide information and documents for the purpose of checking a person&#146;s tax position, and the definition of &#147;tax position&#148; outlined in the same Act would appear to require the possession of personal data that could be of use in the immigration context. Under existing immigration legislation, requirements relating to third parties are narrowly defined, so the obligation for third parties to provide information for immigration purposes seems to be a major increase in powers and constitutes a substantial intrusion into civil liberties. If that is correct, the Government, so far as I see it, have made no attempt to justify this potential interference with Article 8 rights.</p>

<a name="90225-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09022590000002"></a>HMRC powers of arrest allow a person to be arrested for an offence that was allegedly committed up to 20 years before. Can we have an assurance that that would not apply to immigration offences? What safeguards are there in the Bill against the extension of HMRC arrest powers to immigration offences?</p>

<a name="90225-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09022590000003"></a>We have a broad policy concern, as my noble friend has already said, about the continued association between immigration and criminal activity, which is potentially underlined by the merger of immigration and HMRC powers. The 1979 Act&#146;s search powers for a customs officer are directed at persons who may be carrying any item that is prohibited or restricted, or which is liable to excise duty or tax that has not been paid, and the threshold for suspicion is low. The search may extend to a strip search and an intimate search, and HMRC officials may detain for as long as is reasonably necessary while a search is carried out. If a person does not agree to the search, the customs official may arrest him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="09022590000004"></a>Under the Bill, UKBA staff will be able to carry out physical examinations at the border, either of their own volition or at the request of HMRC. Although they have their own powers of detention, the search powers that they have already under the 2007 Act are being enhanced. What assurances can the Government offer that UKBA officials will not inappropriately use powers that are designed for customs purposes in immigration control? Will they be obliged to serve a

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="09022590000005"></a>Liberty is concerned about the power of HMRC officials to take fingerprints and DNA samples, and we are worried about the progressive extension of taking and retaining biometric information. We are particularly concerned about the failure of the Government to respond to the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the S and Marper case, where it was found that our policy on the retention of DNA samples was in breach of Article 8.</p>

<a name="90225-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="09022590000006"></a>We will be raising that issue under Amendment 111, but I give notice that I shall be mentioning the particular case of a British citizen who was stopped at Heathrow terminal 1 and required to give fingerprint and DNA samples which are to be retained indefinitely, in contravention of the judgment. I wrote to the Secretary of State about this on 5 December, the day after the judgment, and had an unsatisfactory reply from the Minister of State, Mr Vernon Coaker. I will give the reference so that the Minister can look it up: it was M50/9, dated 14 January 2009. At the time of the judgment, almost 900,000 samples were being retained from people who were never charged or convicted subsequently of any offence.

General customs functions are alluded to in the first four lines, from Part 1 downwards, and a definition is given in Clause 1(8):</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="09022590000079"></a>&#147;In this Part &#145;general customs function&#146; means a function exercisable in relation to a general customs matter&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09022590000075"></a>That does not, of itself, tell us what a general customs matter is. I realise that subsection 2(a) to (e) allude to a general customs matter. Am I right in thinking that, patently, revenue customs functions fall within subsection 2 (a) to (e) but that some of the latter are matters that are clearly the responsibility of the commissioners but not actually cash revenue issues? It would be helpful if the Minister gave us a phrase that described those functions that remain with HMRC but which are not specifically tax revenue. I hope that question is clear. If it is not, I would be glad to clarify it.</p>

It is the same issue about the extent of the split. The &#147;general customs matters&#148; is a phrase that has been coined for non-customs revenue matters in relation to which the Secretary of State may exercise functions concurrently with the commissioners.</p>

I have no problem with understanding the revenue functions. Money laundering does come into this subset, but is not, to the best of my knowledge, a specifically revenue-raising exercise&#151;although the penalties may be. If we are discussing a general customs matter as being distinguished from the five items 2(a) to (e), but not all those are tax revenue items, can the noble Lord give us a phrase that we can allude to in shorthand hereafter, so that we know what we are talking about?</p>

Clearly, there is confusion. If I may, I would like to think about how we might clarify that. It is not in anyone&#146;s interest to have confusion on this. The distinction between the customs functions that the Secretary of State may exercise and those vested in the Director of Border Revenue are extremely important. Therefore we must make sure that they are clear in everyone&#146;s mind. Perhaps we have not done that sufficiently well. Therefore, I will take that away to look at it to ensure that it is clear.</p>

<a name="90225-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09022590000012"></a>We try to use the description &#147;customs revenue matters&#148; in relation to the way in which the Director of Border Revenue may exercise functions concurrently with the commissioners. &#147;General customs matters&#148; is the term coined for non-customs revenue matters in relation to which the Secretary of State exercises functions. It is important that those two functions are separated to ensure which provisions are relevant and applicable to each set.</p>

<a name="90225-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09022590000013"></a>The term &#147;general customs matters&#148; does not mean that the Secretary of State will be able to exercise all of the non-revenue functions of the commissioners for revenue and customs. He will not be able to exercise all of them. In addition to excluding revenue matters from the definition of &#147;general customs matters&#148;, we have also tried to be careful to exclude other non-revenue functions of the commissioners, which the Secretary of State will have no need to exercise, such as, as mentioned by the noble Lord, regulation of money and service businesses, which impinges on money laundering and the like.</p>

<a name="90225-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09022590000014"></a>I hope that that will clarify the position for the noble Baroness and show the importance of having those distinctions clear in our mind. On that basis, I hope she will be content to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09022590000015"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked about provisions relating to customs offences applying to immigration. I understand his nervousness; indeed, I would like to take this opportunity to say that Part 1 is aimed at having a stronger border force and making the nation safer. There is no intention to criminalise immigrants or immigration, and we are not trying to relate counterterrorism provisions to immigration either. The provisions relating to customs offences will continue to apply only to customs matters and not to immigration. The powers may be used by designated customs officials in the border force in respect of those particular customs offences, so there is a division&#151;they will not be used for other matters. Officers have to be very clear about whether they are exercising customs or immigration powers&#151;it is part of their training. They cannot use customs powers for immigration purposes, or vice versa.</p>

However, he is handicapped by the fact that neither he nor we have access to Schedule 1 to the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005 which I suspect delineates which areas would be general customs matters to be passed over. I am assuming that a general customs matter being taken out of Schedule 1 means that there are other powers left behind in the schedule for Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs to continue to use. It is a great shame that the Bill is so truncated because those powers and responsibilities are not delineated in it. It is of fundamental importance what these officers will do and what powers they will have. It is extremely difficult to discuss the Bill without being quite clear what those are and being able to see the build-up in Part 1&#151;it begins as a germ and becomes a virus&#151;of how this is being done.</p>

<a name="90225-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09022590000017"></a>I should be grateful to have from the Minister&#146;s officials a list of what general customs matters are. As I say, I suspect that they come out of Schedule 1 to the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act, but if not, I should be glad to know that. Before the next stage of the Bill, we want to know what will be done in the name of the Secretary of State that was previously done in the name of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs. Otherwise, this part of the Bill is too opaque for us to be able just to let it go through.</p>

As I said earlier, the revenue customs matters include collecting duty in the red channel, catching tobacco smugglers and charging duty on post and packets, but I am not sure that that is the totality. I assure the noble Baroness that we will get that information so that it is quite clear what has been pulled out of the other Act. It needs to be absolutely clear. But having said that, I think it is right that some of these revenue customs matters have to go across because there is a border requirement for them. I will ensure that my team gets that information and lets all those who are party to the debate see it.</p>

Since everything comes from Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, there are two tranches to it. In this part of the Bill, the &#147;general customs matters&#148; seem to relate to the duties of the customs officers in their guise as Customs. Later parts of the Bill relate to the revenue aspects which are being passed down, which I presume are separate. They will then be amalgamated into one when those officials become all-singing and all-dancing. In the interests of clarity, please may we know the revenue powers that are being passed down from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and the general customs powers, because I suspect that they are different and are two separate streams?</p>

The provision merely clarifies the reporting lines, because matters to do with Revenue and Customs&#151;for example, the funding side&#151;cannot be dealt with directly by the Secretary of State.

One issue, which goes back to our debate on the previous group of amendments, is how the users of this service, the people who are coming into the country, will know what officials are allowed and not allowed to do. That may seem a nicety, because it is obvious that the officials are there to keep our borders safe, look after visitors and check that they are not criminals. However, if they stop an innocent person and subject them to searches, that person has a right to be completely clear about what officials are entitled to do and at what point they can appeal against the officials&#146; action because it is beyond what they are entitled to do. If we are confused as to who can do what, when, to whom and how, it will be much more confusing not only to people coming in who speak English but also to those who do not do so, and even possibly to their lawyers should they need to resort to them. Will the Minister indicate how he sees some guidance on those matters, even at the most basic level, being extended in ports and airports? It may state, for example, &#147;These officials have the right to do this. If they ask you to, you should comply. They do not have a right to do this, and, in these circumstances, you would be entitled to consult X&#148;. What guidance will be available?</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="09022590000081"></a>&#147;This section applies to ... an enactment passed or made before the end of the session in which this Act is passed, and ... an instrument or document issued before the passing of this Act&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09022590000076"></a>Those seem to me to be helpfully exclusive statements. The second, relating to Acts already passed, is straightforward. The Bill is then saying that the only other kind of enactment that could apply would be one that, because this is a running issue, may be passed after we have concluded the business of this Bill. In that case, the word &#147;only&#148; would not be needed, because it would exclude any Bill or enactment subsequently. If I have not understood that correctly, I have no doubt that the Minister will tell me.</p>

<p><a name="st_122"></a>
<a name="09022590000026"></a><b><a name="90225-0006.htm_spnew16"></a><a name="09022590000106"></a>Lord West of Spithead:</b> Clause 1 already expressly limits the general customs function that the Secretary of State may exercise concurrently with the commissioners to those contained in enactments, instruments or documents passed, made or issued, as the case may be, before the end of the parliamentary Session in which this Bill is passed. The insertion of the word &#147;only&#148;, as suggested by Amendment 4, is therefore unnecessary. However, Clause 2 allows provisions to be made by order for functions conferred on the commissioners in enactments passed or made after the end of the Session in which this Bill is passed to be exercisable concurrently by the Secretary of State. This provides the necessary flexibility to respond to future changes in the commissioners&#146; functions and to allow the Secretary of State to exercise those functions when it is appropriate that she should do so.</p>

<a name="90225-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09022590000027"></a>The order-making power in Clause 2, subject as it is to the affirmative resolution procedure, provides the appropriate level of parliamentary scrutiny for the making of any such provision. Various non-customs and revenue functions are given to the commissioners by various enactments: the Postal Services Act, the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984, the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, and so on. It is likely that future Acts may do likewise and may give functions to the commissioners, the Secretary of State or both. However, it is also sensible to retain some flexibility to allocate functions by order, in view of the new arrangements at the border and the likely need for HMRC and the UK Border Agency to have a role in enforcement of future matters. The noble Lord, Lord Brooke, is absolutely correct in his interpretation of what he read.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09022590000028"></a>I am not altogether clear what Amendment 9 seeks to achieve, but in practice it would have no effect. Clause 3(7) as drafted provides that the enactments, instruments or documents to which Clause 3 applies are enactments passed or made or instruments or documents issued before this Bill is passed and, subject to express provisions to the contrary, enactments that are passed or made or instruments or documents issued after this Bill is passed. Inserting the word &#147;only&#148; makes no difference at all to that, as it does not alter the enactments, instruments and documents to which Clause 3 applies. The effect of Clause 3 as drafted is that, so far as appropriate, general customs functions conferred on HMRC in enactments, instruments

This clause therefore provides the mechanism by which a designated general customs official will have access to the functions, powers and protections afforded to an officer of HM Revenue and Customs in respect of general customs matters both now and in future. It also ensures that policy guidance and instruction documents issued to officers at HM Revenue and Customs will apply where appropriate to a designated customs officer.</p>

<a name="90225-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09022590000029"></a>Generally speaking, it is right that functions, new or amended powers and protections that are granted to officers of HMRC in the future should apply automatically, together with the associated policy guidance. This reflects the fact that, although the UKBA will be principally responsible for the exercise of these functions at the border and HM Revenue and Customs for their exercise inland&#151;these are the two separate chunks&#151;in many cases they will be exercising the same powers. Where it is not appropriate, however, for functions and powers conferred on officers of HMRC to be given automatically to designated general customs officials, this can be provided for expressly.</p>

<a name="90225-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09022590000030"></a>In the absence of a provision in Clause 3 ensuring that any general customs functions conferred on officers in future are usually conferred at the same time on designated general customs officials, unnecessary inconsistencies might arise in the respective approach of the UKBA and HMRC to the exercise and protections afforded in respect of the same customs functions.</p>

<a name="90225-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09022590000031"></a>As regards Amendment 18, Clause 7 already limits the scope of the director&#146;s functions to those contained in enactments made or passed before the end of the Session in which this Bill is passed, or in instruments or documents issued before the passing of the Bill. Therefore, I believe that the amendment is unnecessary.</p>

<a name="90225-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09022590000032"></a>On the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, I do not have at my fingertips exactly what guidance will be available.

<a name="09022590000039"></a><b><a name="90225-0007.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09022590000111"></a>Lord West of Spithead:</b> Perhaps I may first answer the last question. It is quite usual for a designated official below a Secretary of State to carry out functions that are the responsibility of the Secretary of State. That is not unusual; it relates to the Carltona principle, which stems from a specific case.</p>

<a name="90225-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09022590000040"></a>I shall deal with Amendments 6, 7, 8 and 10 as a group. These amendments, by restricting the Secretary of State&#146;s ability to designate officials in her department as designated general customs officials, would effectively take away many of the advantages of the integration that Part 1 aims to achieve. I hope that I have explained why we are trying to achieve it. Significantly, they would hamper the effectiveness of individual officials exercising combined customs and immigration functions on behalf of the UK Border Agency. Therefore, I must resist these amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09022590000041"></a>Some 4,500 existing revenue and customs officers, as I mentioned, will be transferred to the new border force to carry out customs functions. On their transfer, they will no longer be officers of HMRC and will need to be designated under the provision in Part 1 to enable them to continue exercising the customs functions that they currently carry out. Depending on his or her role, a designated general customs official will need to be able to exercise some or all of the functions in relation to a general customs matter that are currently exercised by an officer of Revenue and Customs.</p>

<a name="90225-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09022590000042"></a>Amendment 6 would mean that officers who transfer from HMRC to the border force and become officials of the Secretary of State could not be designated to exercise general customs functions unless they were first appointed as immigration officers. We believe that this is unnecessary. While in the future the majority of the UK Border Agency officials at the front line will exercise immigration and customs functions, and therefore will be appointed as immigration officers, this may not be so in every case. Specialist roles and skills will also be retained by some of the agency&#146;s officials&#151;for example, by those exercising general customs functions at the postal hubs and by drug-detector dog handlers at airports, who are the very people that the noble Lord referred to earlier. Those officials will not require immigration powers to perform those specific functions.</p>

<a name="90225-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09022590000043"></a>An officer of Revenue and Customs currently exercises two sets of functions: those that are vested directly in him or her as a customs officer and those that he or she exercises on behalf of the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs. Likewise, a designated general customs official will need to be able to exercise both sets of functions, subject to any limitations that are placed on an individual&#146;s designation to reflect his or her particular role. Designated customs officials will, for example, need to make decisions on the return or disposal of seized goods. These are day-to-day operational decisions currently taken by officers of HMRC on behalf of the commissioners in accordance with a framework of policy and guidance laid down by the commissioners.</p>

<a name="90225-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09022590000044"></a>In the future, designated customs officials will need to be able to take these decisions on behalf of the Secretary of State so that the border force can run its affairs effectively and efficiently. Amendment 7 would prevent those officials from taking those decisions and would leave all such decisions to be taken personally by the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="90225-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09022590000045"></a>Amendment 8 would remove subsection (3) from Clause 3. The purpose of that subsection is to make it clear that, notwithstanding the exercise of the Secretary of State&#146;s general customs functions by designated general customs officials, the Carltona principle, to which I referred, is preserved. I am sure that noble Lords will appreciate the importance of the Carltona principle, in accordance with which the Secretary of State&#146;s functions may be exercised by any of her officials. Clause 3(3) ensures that this important principle is preserved.</p>

<a name="90225-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09022590000046"></a>Before designating a general customs official under Clause 3, the Secretary of State must be satisfied that the capability, training and suitability requirements set

This issue of training has been raised a number of times. The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, has particularly emphasised it and I agree entirely about its importance. The Government are satisfied that the robust designation process established by the Bill is the appropriate one, so I must resist Amendment 10, which would add a layer of parliamentary scrutiny to this, as unnecessary and disproportionate. The amendment would place a great burden on Parliament, necessitating each designation of a general customs official to be approved by both Houses before being made. While I am sure that more of the noble Baroness&#146;s time at the Dispatch Box would greatly please noble Lords, I doubt whether the Committee would like to be detained any more on this, as I have been going on at length. In light of this explanation, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

Our words go into <I>Hansard</I>, so that people know what is going on. I do not think that I have come across such generality of legislation and terminology as there is in this Bill before. Maybe that is just my ignorance. When it refers to,</p>

<p><a name="09022590000077"></a>then it is helpful to have had the noble Lord&#146;s explanation that that person has to be an appropriate person of an appropriate standing, because you could read into this Bill and these terminologies that the Secretary of State could say to anybody running down the corridor, &#147;Come here, we need you to do a little bit of this or that function&#148;. That is taking it to absurdity, but within the word &#147;any&#148; you have literally anybody within the remit of the Secretary of State. It is important that we are clear that there is a hierarchy that the Secretary of State can lean on but that we are not just talking about anybody; these people have to be appropriately positioned and they have to have appropriate training and knowledge to fulfil the functions asked of them. I thank the Minister for that reply and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

This position is effectively the top of the tree, after the Secretary of State. The director will have an enormous amount of power and influence and an enormous amount to do. Yet the Bill provides that the Secretary of State will designate this person. So the Secretary of State says to an official, or somebody he or she likes in the department, &#147;You are going to be the Director of Border Revenue&#148;. What other highly paid position of Government is chosen by the finger or the hand falling on the shoulder? For sure, that is what this is. It was made very clear at Second Reading when I asked who this person will be. The Minister said that the hand had of course already fallen and it was going to be the chief executive of the UK Border Agency. If it is intended that the Director of Border Revenue should always be the chief executive of the UK Border Agency, we should say so and we should not pretend that it is another official. It is not another official; the chief executive of the UK Border Agency will also be known as the Director of Border Revenue.</p>

<a name="90225-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09022590000049"></a>I find it absolutely inconceivable that a position such as this should not be open to competition and that it should not at least be put out to competition within the department. There will be no choice other than that of the Secretary of State. The Minister may say to me, &#147;But of course it won&#146;t happen like that. There will be a proper process and proper consultation. Someone will spend a huge sum of money on head-hunters and we will go all the way through the normal processes that cost everyone a lot of money but at least are transparent&#148;.</p>

<a name="90225-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09022590000050"></a>The whole question of who is to be the Director of Border Revenue is only transparent at the moment because I asked about it at Second Reading; otherwise, at this stage of the Bill we would not know who it was going to be. However, we do. We have a very clear idea of the process but I think that the Minister needs to explain to us why that is the process for this post.</p>

<a name="90225-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09022590000051"></a>Presumably, the next chief executive of the UK Border Agency will not just have a hand fall on their shoulder when the current one leaves. That post, I hope, will also be a matter for open competition. Therefore, when subsequently&#151;a very long time down the line, I am sure&#151;the post of chief executive of the UK Border Agency is to be filled, the post will be advertised not only as the chief executive of the UK Border Agency but as the Director of Border Revenue.</p>

<a name="90225-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09022590000052"></a>I await the Minister&#146;s reply with great interest because I find this an extraordinary way to deal with a very senior position in the organisation. I beg to move.</p>

However, it would be interesting to know from the Minister what the procedure is to be on future occasions. Does he envisage that the normal course of events will be for the same person to fill the post of Director of Border Revenue and head of the UKBA, or is this an exceptional and unique arrangement which is simply to start the process off but will never be repeated in the future?</p>

That is the aim here. The role of Director of Border Revenue needs to be very closely integrated with that of the chief executive of the UK Border Agency to provide a single line of command in the agency&#146;s management structure. Our intention is that that will always be one and the same person, even in the future. That is what we would want.</p>

<a name="90225-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09022590000056"></a>I had hoped that I had made it clear to the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham&#151;although plainly I had not&#151;that it was our intention that the current chief executive of the UK Border Agency should be designated as Director of Border Revenue. The chief executive will be accountable to the Home Secretary in relation to all non-revenue matters, but in respect of revenue matters she or he&#151;at present it is she; as was mentioned, it is Lyn Homer&#151;will act independently, subject, like HM Revenue and Customs, to the general oversight of Treasury Ministers. Therefore, to an extent, there will be a certain schizophrenic element to the role but there are other examples of that, and we believe that it is more important to have this single line of command.</p>

<a name="90225-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09022590000057"></a>Under this model, we felt that a Home Office official was the most appropriate person to be appointed as Director of Border Revenue, having an understanding of the department&#146;s wider strategic objectives and the operational and managerial command of the UK&#146;s border forces. Of course, if the chief executive&#146;s post were to become vacant in future, it would be possible to fill it through open competition under Civil Service rules explicitly on the basis that the postholder, the chief executive, would also be the Director of Border Revenue. I hope that on that basis the noble Baroness will agree that her amendment is unnecessary and will feel able to withdraw it.</p>

Perhaps I am alone in this Chamber in not having read that the Director of Border Revenue will also be the chief executive of the UK Border Agency. It does not say so anywhere but we have now established that through some questioning. Following on from that is the question of whether there are any conflicts in this dual position. The chief executive of the UK Border Agency would find him or herself in great difficulty in talking to the Director of Border Revenue because they would be one and the same person. I find the idea of two very senior positions metamorphosing into one extremely challenging. Presumably, whenever this position becomes vacant in future, it will be advertised, and it will be known that the Director of Border Revenue is to be the chief executive of the UK Border Agency.</p>

Similar functions using the same powers will still be carried out by HM Revenue and Customs officials inland, however. For example, checks on goods and customs audits at business premises or warehouses, et cetera, will remain a matter for HM Revenue and Customs: the processing of customs freight declarations and collections of duties on freight, which is a centralised function, will also remain with that department, which will have all such functions. Therefore, we believe it absolutely vital that the Director of Border Revenue is able to exercise such functions concurrently with the commissioners for Revenue and Customs. While Amendment 16 would not, in itself, prevent this arrangement, it might lead to confusion about how those functions are exercised by the commissioners and the director respectively.</p>

For this reason I hope that the noble Viscount will agree that this amendment is inappropriate and that he will feel able to withdraw it.</p>

We are clear now that we are to have one in three, or three people in one, as customs, revenue and immigration&#151;or, we may have customs, immigration and revenue. If we are clear on that, will the Secretary of State be able to designate an immigration officer as a customs revenue official, as it seems to be the only thing she will be able to do? That would then be a dual role of customs and immigration. Or is this the power that will designate them as one into three? I know this is getting to be a bit like the Trinity, with one in three or three in one, but it is a short question.</p>

All those things have to be done, but we have extremely talented people who are capable of multi-tasking. I have great faith that they will do this job extremely well. Some are, effectively, already doing it.</p>

<a name="90225-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09022590000072"></a>It is appropriate that designated customs revenue officials are within the department responsible for exercising customs functions. The border force will be an executive agency of the Home Office and will work within that department to ensure the main aim in creating the agency is fulfilled; namely, as the noble Baroness clearly mentioned, to integrate at the border the exercise of customs functions, both general and revenue, with immigration functions. In general, it is not intended that customs revenue officials should be a separate cadre; rather, that the officials of the Secretary of State working in the border force should, subject to that training, be able to perform a range of customs revenue, general customs and immigration functions as necessary. As I have said, we know how long the training will take and I am sure that they will be capable of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09022590000073"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, also asked whether the Secretary of State will be able to designate a customs revenue official. No, she will not: the director will make such designations. The officer will be accountable to the director for the exercise of those functions, not to the Secretary of State. That is one reason why we have had to have that differentiation, because that cannot be allowed. On that basis, I hope that the noble Baroness will agree that the amendment is unnecessary and that she will feel able to withdraw it.</p>

<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_248"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column 248</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09022597000002"></a>We said on Second Reading that we would table amendments to satisfy ourselves about the terms and level of training. We now know the terms, because the Minister has given them to us, but we do not know the level or the content. One of our chief worries is that officials may be struggling with their existing duties. How are they then meant to understand, retain and apply borders, customs, immigration and, in some cases, police provisions all at the same time and ensure that they do not get into difficulties? We want to ensure that the standard of training is sufficiently rigorous to meet those concerns. That is why we suggest that the word &#147;adequate&#148; in page 8, line 41 should be removed and substituted with &#147;all necessary&#148;. Matters such as tax revenues, tax raising and all the other things that they are entitled to do and must do need to be included in training. We need to be sure that it will be more than adequate and that the director can be truly satisfied that all those who are to be the composite trinity know what they are doing. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_150"></a>
<a name="09022597000003"></a><b><a name="90225-0008.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09022597000068"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> The noble Baroness has raised an extremely important matter and we support the amendments. The provision is simply that the director must be satisfied, but we do not know what criteria will satisfy him; they are not laid down anywhere in the Bill. The word &#147;adequate&#148; is extremely vague, as the noble Baroness said.</p>

<a name="90225-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09022597000004"></a>Earlier, the Minister told us that customs officers who are to carry out UKBA duties would be given 14 weeks&#146; training, although he did not say what that training would consist of. If it were intensive training, I can imagine that 14 weeks may well be adequate. One knows that it is possible to have immersion courses that teach people a large amount of information in a short space of time, such as the Foreign Office has for language training. We need to know a little more about this before we leave the subject, because simply to have the wording in the Bill that the director must be satisfied without telling us how he will satisfy himself and the use of the vague word &#147;adequate&#148; will not reassure those who have to deal with the officials that they will receive top-quality training and that they will be as qualified as is necessary to enable them to do the job properly. I sincerely hope that we will receive a lot more information from the Minister in answer to the amendment.</p>

I imagine that the job of an immigration officer can be very stressful. They have people from so many different situations coming to be interviewed. What psychological preparation is there for those who undertake that work so that they can cope with the stress? What linguistic preparation is there? Someone may have no knowledge whatever of the English language. What preparation is there so that those who deal with people who speak another language and are not able to converse properly in English can do so in a sympathetic way?</p>

I say just one thing about drafting. I am pleased to see the words &#147;is satisfied&#148; in the Bill, because in previous legislation the much vaguer word &#147;thinks&#148; has crept in. &#147;Is satisfied&#148; is rather more precise.</p>

The more one looks at it, the more one sees that there is a need to understand what is being said. For example, is 14 weeks the normal amount of training that other countries give officials undertaking similar jobs? If there were that sort of standard by which to measure, perhaps it would become a little clearer, so my instinct is to support the amendment.</p>

Apparently, the Government have replied to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee on Clause 8. I have not seen that reply and clearly neither has he, but apparently they have responded.</p>

<a name="90225-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09022597000009"></a>On the amendments, the clause already dictates that the director must be satisfied of the appropriate criteria, so in practice the director will be required to demonstrate an objective basis for concluding that any given person can exercise customs revenue functions appropriately. I mentioned the 4,500 who are transferring to the border force to carry out customs revenue functions. They will clearly already have been capably and appropriately trained by Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs. Equally, those designated customs officials within the border force who have not transferred from HMRC will have been trained to the same level as the revenue and customs officers for the powers that they will be exercising and the activities that they will be carrying out.</p>

<a name="90225-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09022597000010"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, talked in particular about training. Training will be delivered by trainers accredited by HMRC. Trainees will be mentored by the personal training officer network, transferring from that department to the UK Border Agency. New recruits joining the border force who are deployed at the border will undertake an accredited foundation course including training to enable them to carry out customs revenue functions where that is a part of their role.</p>

<a name="90225-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09022597000011"></a>The way in which we resolve the language training issue&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, said, there are so many languages that you cannot possibly have someone there to cover them all&#151;is by the use of interpreters. We can rapidly get hold of people who can interpret. That is how we get round that one. We do not have a specific language course for any of these people in their training.</p>

<a name="90225-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09022597000012"></a>Clause 12 already requires the director to be satisfied that a person has completed adequate training before the director may designate that person as a customs revenue official able to exercise customs revenue functions. For training to be deemed adequate, the definition is that it must provide a designated customs official with all the instruction and skills appropriate and necessary to exercise the customs revenue functions conferred on them fully and properly. As I said, that is monitored by the personal training officer network to ensure that it is done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09022597000013"></a>Amendment 22 does not in practice impose any different requirement from those already imposed by the Bill. On that basis, I hope that the noble Baroness will agree that the amendment is unnecessary. It is worth adding that the requirement in the clause mirrors that imposed in conferring customs functions on officers in SOCA. We have been doing that since 2005 and it is appropriate that the same standards should be required for officials designated under the Bill.</p>

The wording in the Bill is pretty passive: the person must have &#147;received adequate training&#148;. It does not then give any benchmark about how they would have benefited from it if they were a candidate for this job and if they had passed the job test. They have only to have received the training. I may have missed something in what the Minister said. I am still not clear as to whether it is full-time or part-time training. If the individual has greater training needs, will they receive more than 14 weeks&#146; training?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09022597000015"></a>Finally, could the Minister say something about what would happen if the person did not want to be designated?

The noble Lord asked whether people would receive any psychological training, presumably in their support. What about care of people who come within their remit or&#151;to use a horrible jargon phrase&#151;&#147;customer focus&#148;? These officers have a very difficult task. To some they have to be an anodyne officer who looks at the passports or whatever and does not do anything. To others they have to be able to answer difficult and searching questions. To some they have to be, I suspect, abrupt and difficult. To others they have to be extremely charming. What sort of training will they get in people management? There was a time when all immigration officers were boot-faced and you never knew whether or not you had committed an offence as you went through. Now there is an easier attitude when you go through immigration and you get a smile from the immigration officer. That could change like the weather if it were not appropriate that they should smile. Where it is necessary for them not to be pleasant, respectful and welcoming, what training do they get in dealing with those more difficult situations?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09022597000018"></a>When you go into the United States, it is noticeable that the immigration officers there talk to you more than the ones here.

I was interested that the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, said how welcoming the US immigration people are. She must have used a different airport from the one that I have always used. Possibly my problem was that on the green form where it said, &#147;Are you or have you ever been involved in espionage?&#148;&#151;I was once Chief of Defence Intelligence&#151;I put, &#147;Yes&#148;.

<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09022597000021"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, along with other noble Lords, correctly pointed out that this is a difficult and stressful job. There is policy, guidance and education available for personnel dealing with specific stressful posts. They are instructed on these things. There is also a business support team available to officers who are stressed or who have particular issues. They can raise these confidentially and they are dealt with. That is covered, therefore. There is also role-playing in the training, which is a good way of allowing these things to happen.</p>

It is clearly a major move for many people. That dialogue has been successful. Interestingly, an awful lot of the HMRC people who are coming into the new border force see themselves as border people rather than broader HMRC people. It has not been as big a chop as it might have been. There are issues over terms of service and pay and so on, which are still being negotiated and talked through, but we have not come across a real problem about any of these officers not wanting to do the job. They see themselves very much as wanting to be part of the border force and part of the protection&#151;the front line, in a sense&#151;for the United Kingdom.</p>

The amendments would impose a statutory obligation on any person listed in subsection (2) to have grounds to be satisfied that the disclosure of customs information to any other person is &#147;reasonable&#148;. That is a fair test of what one would want to limit this to. It would require consideration of the need for disclosure and the sensitivity of the information. My concerns have been raised because the Government&#146;s track record on keeping a hand on personal data is not very good, if not to say abysmal. We are therefore concerned that strict controls should be placed on information that is

I beg to move.</p>

Clauses 14 to 20 deal with the disclosure of information between customs and immigration, and Clause 14(1) creates new powers for the use of disclosure of information. Designated customs officials, immigration officers, the Secretary of State or another Minister,</p>
<ul><a name="09022597000062"></a>&#147;by whom general customs functions are exercisable&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09022597000054"></a>the Director of Border Revenue and any other &#147;person acting on behalf of&#148; these people may use customs information that they have acquired through one function for the purposes of any of their other functions. Even more broadly, any of these people may disclose customs information to any other official for any exercisable function.</p>

<a name="90225-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09022597000028"></a>Once you give officials multiple functions, there is nothing to prevent them using information discovered or received under one function for the purpose of another. Allowing full disclosure between all immigration and customs officials goes even further. There needs to be proper justification for allowing complete information sharing and use between HM Customs and Revenue on the one hand and the Immigration Service on the other.</p>

<a name="90225-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09022597000029"></a>We have also had representations from the Law Society of Scotland which suggests that information subject to legal professional privilege should be expressly protected from the general disclosure provisions in these clauses. We would like the Government to explain whether, and if so to what extent, information subject to professional legal privilege is protected under the Bill and how this is to be specified.</p>

The first stop when things go wrong is quite rightly the Office of the Information Commissioner. Given the increased amount of data sharing that is going to take place if the Bill goes through in its current form, may we know, first, what representations, if any, the Information Commissioner&#146;s department has made to the Government about the Bill and what advice it has been given? Secondly, given the inevitable amount of extra work that will result from this, what extra resources are being given to the Office of the Information Commissioner, which is now severely stretched through having to deal not just with issues of data loss but also inappropriately used data? It is the one office in the entire rather gloomy data picture at the moment that does command public confidence, and I commend the Information Commissioner on developing the office as a repository of public confidence. But to continue in that role, it needs to be properly resourced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09022597000031"></a>The Government made a bit of progress when they accepted that the Information Commissioner should be able to make spot checks on public bodies and that there should be a system of penalties for officials who

Perhaps I may address him to Clause 14(5), which relates to disclosure of information. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="09022597000060"></a>&#147;This section is without prejudice to&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09022597000056"></a>What on earth is the definition of &#147;without prejudice&#148; in this context? Who is the prejudice towards, and if there is no prejudice, why specify &#147;without prejudice&#148;? I know that it is a legal term which crops up fairly often, but I do not know why it is included here. I shall be extremely grateful for a reply.</p>

<p><a name="st_167"></a>
<a name="09022597000034"></a><b><a name="90225-0009.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09022597000085"></a>Lord West of Spithead:</b> Clause 14 will provide the border force with the ability to pool its customs information internally so that any such information acquired by a person to whom the clause applies can pass it to another person to be used for that other person&#146;s function. The clause also permits any such person to disclose customs information to another person to whom the clause applies for any function exercisable by the recipient. This will enable the UK Border Agency to use its resources as effectively as possible by improving targeting and data matching across the full range of its immigration and customs functions. It will also improve customer service as it will prevent the agency having to request information from people more than once.</p>

<a name="90225-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09022597000035"></a>Amendments 23 and 24 would prevent those to whom Clause 14 applies from using or disclosing customs information, whether personal or not, unless satisfied that such use or disclosure is reasonable. However, customs information may be used only by a person to whom Clause 14 applies for one or more of the functions that he or she has been given, and if that person needs to use customs information for the exercise of any such function, I believe that by definition the use of it will be reasonable. Further, any use of information under Clause 14 would also be subject to the provisions of the Human Rights Act 1998 and the Data Protection Act 1998, and would thus be required to be both reasonable and proportionate.</p>

<a name="90225-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09022597000036"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, asked how much the Information Commissioner would be involved in this. I am not aware of how deeply he was involved in the discussion of the Bill, and I have the Bill team  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_255"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column 255</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>finding out if he was or was not. But, as I have said, this is covered by the provisions of the Human Rights Act and the Data Protection Act, so in the sense that it is covered, it means that obviously he will have an interest and a certain authority to supervise that the Act is being complied with.</p>

<a name="90225-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09022597000037"></a>I turn now to the disclosure of customs information. The data sharing framework established by Clauses 14 to 21 restricts the disclosure of personal customs information; that is, customs information that identifies or is capable of identifying the persons to whom it applies. I think that in that sense it applies to legal privilege. However, I shall get back to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, on the particular point. It is absolutely right that the provision is protected in this way in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90225-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09022597000038"></a>Amendments 23 and 24 would restrict the disclosure of non-personal customs information such as statistical data. Those statistical data are crucial in informing policy development and refinement and there is no need to restrict their disclosure provided they go only to those people who need them for the functions they have been given.</p>

<a name="90225-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09022597000039"></a>Meanwhile, disclosure of personal customs information is tightly circumscribed under the Bill. Clause 15 imposes duties of confidentiality in respect of personal customs information generally and personal customs revenue information. The limited exceptions to those duties are set out clearly in Clause 16 and any disclosure made in accordance with those exceptions would certainly pass any test of reasonableness.</p>

<a name="90225-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09022597000040"></a>On the points made by a number of speakers about data protection, there have been bad examples in the past but the Government have now got to grips with the issue. The great danger for all of us is that we go down the route of thinking that we must not use data. If we do not use data, we will not get all of these efficiencies. The world has changed; we cannot turn back the clock. Certainly now, with the Cabinet Office review and the work going on across government, we are gripping the issue. However, this is not only a government matter; it is also a private one. People will need a complete mindset change to understand how important data are and how easy it is for people to get hold of their data. It is something that we all have to get to grips with but, as I say, the Government have learnt their lesson and are frantically trying to do this. But we are dealing with human beings, and sometimes private individuals are not very good at looking after their own data even. It is a big learning process and we have to go through that.</p>

<a name="90225-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09022597000041"></a>On the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, the list has been produced by parliamentary draftsmen. There are no policy implications but it is slightly extraordinary. I might dig a little deeper into that. It is like always having the Royal Navy to the right of the line. If someone put it the other way round I would be more than a little surprised. Lists have quite a significance sometimes.</p>

<a name="90225-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09022597000042"></a>The noble Baroness asked why the phrase &#147;without prejudice&#148; is used. As she rightly pointed out, it is a legal term. Apparently it ensures the continued application of existing provisions concerning confidentiality, and that is why it has been put into the Bill.</p>

I come back to my &#147;trinity&#148;. Of the three individuals, subsection (2)(a) refers to a &#147;designated customs official&#148;, who I think is a part of the trinity. Is that correct? There is then an immigration officer, who is not a part of the trinity but an individual, and we do not have a customs and revenue officer or a general customs officer whose individual functions form the other parts of the trinity. Perhaps the Minister can explain.</p>

In the bulk of these posts people will be capable of carrying out the duties of both immigration and customs. As I understand it, they will be a part of the border force immigration officers and will be able to carry out both functions. But not everyone will be designated. A small number of people will be left with specific responsibilities&#151;dog handlers, for example&#151;who, although they will be in the border force, will be customs officers focusing purely on the dog handling aspect. Rather than being a trinity, the designated customs officers are a duality of immigration and customs officer. I think that is the case but perhaps I may come back and clarify the situation before the next stage. We are aiming to ensure that the bulk of the people involved are capable of carrying out the customs and immigration functions. If we achieve that with each of the officers, it will give us huge flexibility and allow us to do so much more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09022597000046"></a>If there is some confusion in the text as to exactly how they are named, I shall make sure it is clarified.

We have a customs revenue officer, who has been transferred down from Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs; we have a general customs officer, who has been passed down from Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs; and we have an immigration officer. Many hours ago we established that those three positions could be either what I termed the trinity, or they could be individual immigration officers who just do immigration, individual customs officers who just do customs, and individual revenue officers who just do revenue&#151;but all of these duties could be combined into one and so one person could do revenue, customs and immigration. If that is not correct, then I have misunderstood the whole of the last seven pages.</p>

There are customs and revenue officers, who we want to be able to be immigration officers, and there are immigration officers, who we want to be able to do customs duties; we do not have purely revenue officers. That is what I meant by a duality rather than a trinity.</p>

<p><a name="09022597000057"></a>That seems to mean that a customs officer can also be a revenue officer or can be both, one or the other. Earlier we had the designation that a general customs official, who comes from the customs, can be a revenue official.

We hope that will be done in the border force and that the immigration officers will be trained to do revenue and customs duties. So that is how we will make them all the same.

The UK Border Agency or the border force must have flexibility to respond to the ever-changing challenges of protecting our borders. From time to time, the agency will need to use contractors to support and supplement its own staff. It is only right and proper that where the agency needs to do that, the contractors concerned should be able to use and disclose any customs information in so far as that is necessary for them to fulfil their contractual obligations. Any such contractor will be subject to the provisions in the Bill regulating the use and disclosure of customs information, including Clause 18, which establishes a criminal offence of wrongful disclosure. Existing arrangements between the UK Border Agency and its contractors already include provisions to protect information and regulate the circumstances in which it is used and disclosed. Contractors in breach of these confidential provisions face the appropriate action, which could include dismissal, termination of contract and, of course, prosecution.</p>

<a name="90225-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="090225107000004"></a>I regret that I must also resist Amendment 26 because it is unnecessary. Clause 14 applies, and is intended to apply, to the use and disclosure of customs information only. Clause 14(5) is intended to clarify, and the removal of that clarification would be likely to cause confusion as to the type of information to which Clause 14 and the wider provisions in the Bill dealing with the use of disclosure of information apply.</p>

<a name="90225-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="090225107000005"></a>It may be that the intention underpinning Amendment 25 is to ensure that Clause 14 and the wider data-related provisions that I have referred to, apply to immigration, asylum and nationality information as well. Such information has never previously been subject to a distinct disclosure regime, but is regulated instead by the provisions and safeguards in the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Human Rights Act 1998, which I have already referred to, and we do not propose any change to that approach now.</p>

The statutory duty of confidentiality in Clause 15 seeks to protect personal customs and personal customs revenue information from disclosure, except in the limited and defined circumstances where disclosure is specifically permitted. This reflects the fact that such information, which may include taxpayer information, should be protected from disclosure in the same way as that information is protected by Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs. Therefore when the border force acquires such information, it will be subject to the statutory duty of confidentiality, unless it is clear that it acquired the information other than in the exercise of the customs function or customs revenue function.</p>

When the UK Border Agency acquires information in the exercise of its non-customs functions, such information is protected from unlawful disclosure by the provisions and protections inherent in the data protection and human rights legislation.

<a name="090225107000013"></a><b><a name="90225-0010.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="090225107000069"></a>Lord West of Spithead:</b> I shall deal with government amendments 29 and 32 together as they are related. In bringing Revenue and Customs functions within the remit of the border force, officials of the UK Border Agency will be given the same or similar powers to those used at present by officers of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs. The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (Application to Revenue and Customs) Order 2007 and the Police and Criminal Evidence (Application to Revenue and Customs) Order (Northern Ireland) 2007, which I shall refer to for these purposes as the Revenue and Customs PACE orders, provide for the application of important powers and safeguards relating to the investigating of offences are applied to HM Revenue and Customs. These include powers for the investigation of Revenue and Customs offences at the frontier and elsewhere and for the designation of custody suites and custody officers, as well as for the application of safeguards in relation to those persons who have been detained.</p>

<a name="90225-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="090225107000014"></a>We need to ensure that in so far as they will in future be investigating and detaining people for the same offences, and exercising the same functions at the border as officers of HMRC do currently, the designated customs officials of the border force have the same powers and are required to provide the same safeguards. It is our intention, therefore, that the vast majority of the substantive provisions of the Revenue and Customs PACE orders should apply in future to criminal investigations in relation to customs matters conducted by designated customs officials of the border force, as well as to any persons detained by such officials.</p>

<a name="90225-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="090225107000015"></a>Certain provisions in the Revenue and Customs PACE order are excluded. This is because they are unnecessary or they relate to investigative tax functions and will not be required by the UK Border Agency. For example, the powers relating to production orders in tax investigations are not applied to the UK Border Agency because it would not be appropriate to do so.</p>

<a name="90225-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="090225107000016"></a>In summary, this clause effectively applies the bulk of the provisions of the Revenue and Customs PACE orders to designated customs officials in the UK Border Agency exercising equivalent functions. It will ensure seamless applications of PACE to those officers transferring from HMRC to the UK Border Agency, until a further bespoke PACE application order is made in relation to the border force customs and immigration functions under Clause 22.</p>

<a name="90225-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="090225107000017"></a>As a consequence of the introduction of the new clause on the application of PACE that government Amendment 29 seeks to insert in Part 1, we have also tabled Amendment 32.</p>

<a name="90225-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="090225107000018"></a>Amendment 32 inserts a new subsection into Clause 22. This new provision will enable an order made under Clause 22 to amend or repeal the new clause on the application of PACE, the detail of which I have just outlined. As I mentioned, Amendment 29 will enable the transfer of HMRC officers to the UKBA, while keeping all their existing powers, until a further bespoke PACE application order is made under Clause 22. We also intend to use the order-making power under Clause 22 to replace the Immigration (PACE Codes of Practice) Direction 2000 and the Immigration

In doing so, we will also seek to bring together in one place the PACE powers and safeguards to be applied in relation to the border force customs and immigration functions.</p>

<a name="90225-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="090225107000019"></a>Amendment 32 ensures that the order-making power in Clause 22 is sufficiently flexible to deliver that objective. I would ask the Committee to accept Amendments 29 and 32.</p>

<p><a name="st_186"></a>
<a name="090225107000020"></a><b><a name="90225-0010.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="090225107000070"></a>Baroness Hanham:</b> It is not that we object to the extension of PACE to officers; it is that we are concerned that these officers should be in the position of police, which is effectively what they now are. PACE already applies to immigration officers, because they are given the power of arrest, and that is what will happen with these other officers. So there is a great extension in the number of those with the power of arrest and detention of people coming through the immigration and border system. If those powers are to be there, then PACE must apply, because PACE is the safeguard to ensure that people are properly dealt with and protected to some extent by a code of conduct and code of practice.</p>

<a name="90225-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="090225107000021"></a>This brings us back to an earlier amendment. We should have police embedded within the border agency so that we do not have to give police powers to other officials regardless of the role they are operating in. It is a great and worrying extension of police powers to other people. I think that we are in danger of removing the distinction between criminality and immigration control. I am sure that the Minister will explain the Government&#146;s rationale. However, this means that we are extending&#151;under previous clauses, I think&#151;to immigration officers and to customs and revenue officers the power to arrest people. If the Minister had not produced this amendment, there is no doubt that someone else would have done. It is clear that we have to discuss the whole issue of PACE and where it applies. We are very uncomfortable about the extension of these PACE powers. I remain very concerned about the reasons given for extending them.</p>

We would like to know why the provisions of PACE identified in subsection (5) are expressly excluded from application to designated customs officials. PACE standards are to be applied to immigration officials only when they are acting as designated HMRC officers and not when they are performing any of their existing functions under the Immigration Acts. We will come on to that in the next group of amendments.</p>

<a name="90225-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="090225107000023"></a>Meanwhile, we also note that the amendment to Clause 22 would allow the Secretary of State to amend or repeal by order the new clause under discussion. We would like more information about the Government&#146;s thinking and how they expect to use this virtually unlimited power. Are they committed to maintaining the application of the PACE provisions to designated customs officials? If so, why is there a necessity for such a broad power as they are asking for in Amendment 32?</p>

Basically, this will enable them to do what they can already do but in the context of the border force. That is why the provision is being made. It enables them to fit in as part of the border force. It is not growth involving other people, as the HMRC can already do this. These HMRC officers are now becoming part of the border force and, in that context, they need these PACE powers.

Our concern is that immigration officers will be given revenue and customs functions but without the appropriate accountability and safeguards. The purpose of Amendment 30 is to change the power to apply the PACE codes to the acts of customs officials and immigration officers to a duty. The purpose of the second amendment, as I am sure the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, will be pleased to hear, is to ensure that private contractors exercising functions in connection with investigations or detention will also be subject to the PACE codes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="090225107000030"></a>The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which came into effect after the civil unrest of the early 1980s and the recommendations of the Scarman report, protected both police officers and those being dealt with by the police, by introducing codes of practice regulating the use of police powers, notably in sensitive areas such as stop and search, arrest, detention and questioning. Immigration officers now exercise almost the same powers in relation to potentially vulnerable people and for their own protection as well as that of the person who is the target of these powers, the PACE codes of practice should apply to them. So we very much welcome the Government&#146;s decision in Amendment 29 to apply the PACE orders specified from Royal Assent, though some of the gilt was taken off the gingerbread by the power to amend or repeal that new clause.</p>

<a name="90225-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="090225107000031"></a>The PACE codes themselves can be amended from time to time, but if the Secretary of State is to be given absolute discretion to apply them only to the extent that she thinks proper to UKBA or HMRC officials exercising similar powers of search, detention, treatment and questioning of suspects or the recording of interviews, we can have no great confidence in her commitment to the principle. We should bear in mind the history of the matter: the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 gave the Secretary of State power to apply full or modified versions of the PACE codes to immigration officers&#146; powers of arrest, questioning, search or taking a person&#146;s fingerprints, entering or searching premises or seizing property, but in fact only two orders were ever made under that provision, the last in 2001. Ministers have repeatedly said, whenever immigration legislation has come before Parliament, that further orders were under review, but have done nothing as the exercise of police powers by immigration officers and private contractors has increased with every Act.</p>

<a name="90225-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="090225107000032"></a>Immigration officers have numerous police and police-like powers, including the power to arrest with and without a warrant; to search and arrest without a warrant; to enter premises and make an arrest; to search premises; to search personnel records with and without a warrant; to search arrested persons and those in custody; to seize material; to detain; to search detained persons and retain evidence; and to fingerprint persons&#151;and the use of force in the exercise of all those powers is expressly sanctioned. That extends to the private contractors, who may exercise several of those powers. While many of the powers relate to immigration-related offences, those who may be subjected to them include British citizens as well as foreign nationals, children as well as adults. Some of the powers have no specific relation to immigration-related offences, such as the power to detain someone at a port for up to three hours on suspicion that he may be of interest to the police and to retain evidence revealed from a search of that person.</p>

<a name="90225-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="090225107000033"></a>During the passage of the earlier UK Borders Bill through both Houses, Ministers stressed the importance of much stronger oversight, transparency and accountability of what is now the UK Border Agency. That will not happen, however, if we have no certainty that officials exercising the even greater powers that

<a name="90225-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="090225107000034"></a>At Second Reading the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, drew attention to a dossier containing the details of 48 alleged assaults on asylum seekers by security guards, which he passed to the Home Secretary in July last year. That is still being investigated by Dame Nuala O&#146;Loan. My noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford also drew attention to the operation of secret and unlawful immigration policies revealed in the December 2008 judgment of the High Court in R v Abdi and others. On 18 February this year, the High Court ruled in yet another case, where a policy was not publicly disclosed and was relied upon unlawfully in circumstances where serious allegations of mistreatment were made. These policies relate to detention and removals respectively, so there is abundant evidence to demonstrate the necessity of clear and publicly available guidance and instructions to immigration officers, and to private contractors exercising immigration powers, that accord with the standards expected of police officers in exercising similar powers.</p>

<a name="90225-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="090225107000035"></a>As the late Lord Williams of Mostyn recognised on behalf of the Government as long ago as 1999, the adoption of PACE codes of practice is necessary&#151;and, 10 years later, is seriously overdue. If immigration officers and private contractors are not sufficiently trained or competent to be made publicly subject to PACE, they ought not to be exercising the powers that they already have, let alone those that they will be given under the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

In doing so, we will also seek to bring together in one place the PACE powers and safeguards to be applied in relation to the UK border force and its immigration functions. We believe that the approach in Clause 22 is the right one, mirroring as it does the construction of similar enabling provisions within PACE itself&#151;for example, within Sections 114 and 114A&#151;and that Amendment 30 is therefore unnecessary.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90225-0011.htm"/>


<a name="90225-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="090225107000041"></a>It is also proposed that the scope of the order that may be made under Clause 22 should be extended to cover contractors providing services relating to investigations conducted or persons detained by immigration officers and designated customs officials. There is an important distinction between the nature of the services provided by contractors and the exercise by immigration officers and designated customs officials of their functions and powers related to criminal investigations. Contractors are not charged with the duty of investigating offences, nor do they have the legislative responsibility of custody officers. The responsibility for those matters will lie instead with the designated customs official or immigration officer in charge of the relevant investigation or detention, as the case may be. Accordingly, the responsibility for ensuring that any services ancillary to the investigation or detention that a private contractor will supply will, and should, rest with the customs official or immigration officer concerned and not with the contractor. We do not agree, therefore, that this amendment is necessary or appropriate.</p>

<a name="90225-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="090225107000042"></a>Most people detained by immigration officers are held in connection with administrative immigration processes rather than as part of any criminal investigation, and it would not be appropriate to apply the provisions of PACE or PACE Northern Ireland to those administrative processes or to any persons detained in connection with them, nor is it intended that any order made in due course under Clause 22 of the Bill should alter that position.</p>

<a name="90225-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="090225107000043"></a>Arrangements are also made under Section 40 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act for the Secretary of State to authorise contractors to search ships, aircraft, vehicles and so on for the person subject to control by an immigration officer. Arrangements under Section 40 must include provision for the appointment of a Crown servant to monitor the exercise of the powers, inspect the exercise of the powers and investigate and report to the Secretary of State about any allegation made in respect of an authorised contractor. We consider that it is right to distinguish the limited operations of those authorised by the Secretary of State to search under Sections 40 and 41 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act from the activities of immigration officers who arrest individuals as part of their enforcement functions under their administrative and criminal powers.</p>

<a name="90225-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="090225112000001"></a>In respect of customs functions, where contractors are used to provide services relating to custody or escort functions, the PACE codes make clear that the custody officer remains responsible for making sure that the procedures and tasks are carried out correctly and in accordance with those codes of practice.

In addition, many police forces already contract out these functions without any need for legislation, as does HRMC, at the Colnbrook centre, near Heathrow. In the light of this explanation, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<a name="090225112000002"></a><b><a name="90225-0011.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="090225112000110"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> I am afraid that I cannot take great satisfaction in the noble Lord&#146;s reply. Although he tells us that the PACE codes of practice are to be extended to private contractors, there are certain exceptions in his comments which cause me tremendous anxiety. In relation to the private contractors who are employed in escorting duties, many complaints have been made, as the noble Lord might be aware, about assaults on persons being deported under the care of private contractors who are acting on behalf of the Immigration Service.</p>

<a name="90225-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="090225112000003"></a>In a recent report, it was found that some 3 per cent of all complaints by detainees related to assaults that were made on them during the process of deportation. Considering that it must be extremely difficult for someone who has been deported to formulate such a complaint, the true percentage is probably much higher. If the private contractors charged with those duties are to be excluded from the PACE codes, we would very much deplore it.</p>

<a name="90225-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="090225112000004"></a>However, there is a more fundamental difficulty. The noble Lord has told us that the PACE codes of practice which relate to the UKBA will be brought together, consolidated and made available to the public. However, we have not seen it and if all that is on offer is consolidation of the existing PACE codes, we know that they are inadequate.</p>

<a name="90225-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="090225112000005"></a>We were thinking of a set of codes that were far more similar to those that apply to the police, considering that, as I have already mentioned, so many powers that the immigration officers exercise are tantamount to police powers. Therefore, they need to be dealt with in a similar manner by the PACE codes of practice. If the Minister could let us have the consolidated PACE codes that will apply to the UKBA between now and Report, that would be extremely useful. We will then be able to take advice on them and see whether they satisfy those who are pointing us in the direction of much greater restrictions on the use of powers by immigration officers and more forceful scrutiny by outside agencies. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="qnpa_4"></a>What is their assessment of the future of public service broadcasting in Scotland.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="st_199"></a>
<a name="090225112000008"></a><b><a name="90225-0011.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="090225112000113"></a>Lord Macdonald of Tradeston:</b> My Lords, I hope that this debate will highlight some immediate concerns about public service broadcasting in Scotland and outline some of the options to secure its future. I declare my interests as an adviser to Macquarie Capital, whose funds invest in and manage Arqiva and Red Bee, companies supplying transmission and other services to UK broadcasters. In addition, until joining your Lordships&#146; House in 1998, I worked for more than 30 years in ITV, first with Granada and then with STV, from which I receive a pension.</p>

<a name="90225-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="090225112000009"></a>Most of the regional licences for broadcasting and Channel 3 are now consolidated into ITV plc, based in London. The three remaining independent companies include STV with its two licences to broadcast on Channel 3 to the north and to central Scotland. For these commercial broadcasters, this is undoubtedly the most difficult time since the launch of the ITV network back in the 1950s. Satellite and cable channels compete strongly for viewers and advertising revenue is migrating to the internet. Share prices have fallen steeply, and programme budgets and staff numbers are being cut back ever further by the current economic crisis.</p>

<a name="90225-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="090225112000010"></a>Sadly, but understandably, ITV plc wants to shed the cost of key public service obligations by reducing quotas for regional programming and independent production. In Scotland, ITV plc also wants to renegotiate the programme supply contract it has with STV. However a deal done on ITV plc&#146;s terms could impoverish STV and undermine its ambition to restore to its schedules some of the specifically Scottish programming lost in recent times.</p>

<a name="90225-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="090225112000011"></a>The other threat to STV&#146;s viability is the warning from ITV plc that it might be forced to hand back its Channel 3 licences and relaunch itself as a purely commercial digital channel, free of all public service obligation. If this happened, and Ofcom took the warning seriously, STV would be cut adrift from the network schedule of ITV plc on which it currently depends. The existing contracts between STV and ITV plc are protected by the network undertakings imposed when Granada was allowed to merge with Carlton to form ITV plc in 2003. These could only be removed with the consent of the Competition Commission.</p>

<a name="90225-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="090225112000012"></a>My noble friend Lord Carter of Barnes knows more about these contractual matters than any of us, having been chief executive of Ofcom around the time these undertakings were given. Would the Minister now encourage his successors at Ofcom to broker a fair settlement which ensures the continuing viability  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_270"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column 270</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the Scottish licences, along with the measure of public service commitment appropriate to a nation with its own distinctive traditions and politics&#151;obligations also expanded ideally to deliver a better service to the Scottish border region?</p>

<a name="90225-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="090225112000013"></a>Another service that Ofcom might do for network programme-making in Scotland is to reclassify the separate production arm of STV as an independent producer. This would remove an obstacle to its winning commissions from UK broadcasters which must satisfy independent production quotas, such as the BBC and Channel 4.</p>

<a name="90225-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="090225112000014"></a>The importance of broadcasting and programme-making to the Scottish economy is perhaps best demonstrated by the BBC, with its 1,300 permanent staff in a dozen production sites across Scotland. The Highlands and Islands got a welcome boost with the recent launch of the Gaelic channel, BBC Alba.</p>

<a name="90225-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="090225112000015"></a>However, the BBC is also planning a policy change of historic proportions for Scotland. Noble Lords will be aware that public service broadcasters spend most of their network programme budgets on their peak-time evening schedules, which attract by far the biggest audiences. These network budgets total several billion pounds a year and fund high-quality drama, entertainment, comedy and factual series&#151;programmes that help define how the people of Britain see their society, tell their stories, share their cultures and shape their identities. Yet, remarkably, after half a century of state-regulated television in Britain, the overwhelming proportion of peak-time, networked programmes is made only in England.</p>

<a name="90225-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="090225112000016"></a>Viewers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland make up about 17 per cent of BBC licence-fee payers and advertisers&#146; audiences, yet barely 1 per cent of UK peak-time programming is commissioned from the three smaller nations. This arithmetic has denied Scotland the investment of tens of millions of pounds a year which would have supported a critical mass of talent, underpinned other creative sectors, and enhanced Scotland&#146;s reputation for quality through a heightened presence on screens in the UK and abroad.</p>

<a name="90225-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="090225112000017"></a>However, the BBC is now committed to giving Scotland a fairer share, a due proportion of its network programme budget: 8.6 per cent of about &#163;850 million, which represents an increase from just over &#163;30 million a year at present to more than &#163;70 million a year. That is a huge increase for which all credit is due to the director-general of the BBC, Mark Thompson. My only concern is that the 8.6 per cent target will not be hit until 2016&#151;surely too long a transition. Could the Minister please encourage the BBC to speed things up? While doing so, could he also invite Channel 4, which Ofcom suggests will be the core of a new, more robust public service entity, to adopt a new, more reasonable policy by commissioning a significant share of its future programming from Scotland?</p>

<a name="90225-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="090225112000018"></a>Lastly, I come to the most radical proposal. The Minister, having published a bold and purposive vision in his <I>Digital Britain</I> report, will be aware of the equally well received vision of a new digital network for Scotland. The Scottish Broadcasting Commission was set up by the Scottish Government in 2007. Its choice of Blair Jenkins as chairman brought industry experience and ensured political impartiality, as did its  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_271"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column 271</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>well balanced membership of Scots distinguished in their own fields, none more so than the noble and learned Lord, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, whom I am pleased to see in his seat.</p>

<a name="90225-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="090225112000019"></a>The commission&#146;s report, <I>Platform for Success</I><I>,</I> has won the endorsement of all parties in the Scottish Parliament&#151;indeed, I believe that its main recommendations are now Conservative policy north of the border. The key proposal is for a Scottish network, based around a linear digital channel and online platform. It would broadcast only high quality or innovative Scottish programming, becoming a secure source of competition for BBC Scotland and, one hopes, STV for many years ahead.</p>

<a name="90225-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="090225112000020"></a>The unresolved question is obvious: how to pay for a new Scottish digital network that is estimated to cost between &#163;50 million and &#163;75 million a year. In its recent review, <I>Putting Viewers First</I>, Ofcom floated the idea of so-called contestable funding. This funding could come from the sums at present reserved inside the BBC licence fee pot for digital switchover. Another source might be a share of the income to the Treasury from the sale or lease of the analogue spectrum, which will be made available by the switch of broadcasting to digital. Ofcom suggests that producers and broadcasters might bid for this &#147;contestable funding&#148; to reinforce endangered areas of public service provision such as regional news on Channel 3, including Scotland, or programming for older children. Does the Minister think that a Scottish digital network could also be funded from these sources? Does he foresee any problems if the Scottish Government offered direct funding to support a new channel, as was done by the previous Scottish Administration to launch BBC Alba? In these hard times, of course, funding better broadcasting will not be the top priority of any Government. But it does seem to me uncommonly odd that a nation such as Scotland, after half a century of public service broadcasting, still does not have a television network it can call its own.</p>

It is potentially a pretty valuable event, which I hope the Minister, with his unrivalled expertise in broadcasting policy, will also attend. I hope, too, that the noble Lord, Lord Carter, will also see the potential of the proposals made in this debate to contribute to his ambitious strategy for a digital Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="090225112000023"></a>Prior to the setting up of the Scottish Broadcasting Commission by the First Minister, I am bound to say that I thought that Elaine Smith was a rather pretty face with a rather pleasing wit and strong political views.

In fact, we all got on very well indeed. I recall her telling me that she was having a one-woman show; her character was an MSP from the Holyrood Parliament called Mrs Bridie from Forfar. Her philosophy of life was that, if you have driven a minicab in Dundee, there is nothing else you need to know about life. I tend to agree with that as a fine description.</p>

<a name="90225-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="090225112000024"></a>I said to Blair Jenkins at the outset that I had no clear idea of what the future of broadcasting would be in five years, an even less clear idea of what it would be in 10 years and a deep distrust of anyone who told me that they knew the answer to either question. He said that that was exactly what he was looking for&#151;someone who did not know just the technical arguments but was much more interested in what was going on in the living room at home.</p>

<a name="90225-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="090225112000025"></a>What I would regard as being important in Scotland&#151;I invite the Minister to take account of this in his assessment of what is going on in broadcasting there&#151;is that, notwithstanding the fact that we had strongly differing political views, we came to the unanimity of view that there should be the maintenance of public service broadcasting and, as the noble Lord, Lord Macdonald, indicated, a new channel. That is not just a sentimental recollection of a happy time on the commission. We were less clear about how that would be funded, but we will leave that to others. It is not that we were avoiding the issue; we saw a number of options that could be taken up by those who were better able to come to a conclusion.</p>

<a name="90225-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="090225112000026"></a>The other important point that the Minister should take account of is that in the Scottish Parliament there was a unanimity of view that what we had suggested in the commission report was the correct way forward. I hope that he will appreciate that it is quite remarkable to achieve such a unanimity of view in television. Even though the noble Lord, Lord Macdonald, was somewhat cheeky in saying that it was now Conservative Party policy north of the border, I confirm that it did indeed agree with us.</p>

It has already been made clear just how timely it is, given the publication last year of the report of the Scottish Broadcasting Commission and the fact that it comes just a few weeks after the publication of Ofcom&#146;s second public service broadcasting review. It is timely because of the stresses and strains on the viability of the Scottish licences, as the noble Lord, Lord Macdonald, indicated, and because it comes on the day when Border TV news, serving the Scottish Borders and Dumfries and Galloway, moved to Gateshead. As someone who was brought up on &#147;Border News&#148; and &#147;Lookaround&#148;, I think that that is a regrettable step. This reverse devolution reminds us just how fragile good local public service broadcasting can be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="090225112000028"></a>That public service broadcasting plays an important part in the life of Scotland post-devolution is reflected in the fact that Ofcom&#146;s second review paid specific  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_273"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column 273</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>attention to it. Indeed, it highlights the fact that what viewers want most from programming specifically made for the devolved nations and the English regions is news. It is also significant that the review concluded that there would not be one-size-fits-all approach.</p>

<a name="90225-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="090225112000029"></a>For the most part, I believe that Scotland is well served by public service broadcasting. &#147;Reporting Scotland&#148; had a daily audience of 465,000 in 2008 and an average of nearly 2 million people weekly are unique users of BBC Scotland&#146;s exceptionally good online news service. I probably could not go home at the weekend without reflecting that BBC Radio Orkney and BBC Radio Shetland, each of which broadcasts a weekday half-hour news programme, have a percentage penetration into the homes of the northern isles that would gladden the heart of any producer.</p>

<a name="90225-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="090225112000030"></a>STV has seen a 13 per cent increase in its viewing share over five years. Importantly, it has honoured the commitments made when Grampian was subsumed; there are two distinctive regional services at 6 pm and four new localised sub-regional bulletins. I know that this regional service is particularly valued by audiences in the north of Scotland. It contrasts with the perception&#151;right or wrong, fair or unfair&#151;of BBC Scotland&#146;s Glasgow-centricity when it comes to reporting Scotland, whereby a jobs announcement in Paisley will always command more attention than a jobs announcement in Aberdeen.</p>

<a name="90225-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="090225112000031"></a>Noble Lords who have attended the highly informative briefings from Rob Woodward, chief executive of STV, will know of STV&#146;s commitment to deliver quality public service broadcasting in Scotland as well as the precarious nature of doing so because of the increasing cost&#151;a cost that is seen increasingly to outweigh the benefit of holding the PSB licence. Indeed, Ofcom has recently reduced the obligations on STV&#146;s public service broadcasting licence.</p>

<a name="90225-0011.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="090225112000032"></a>When the Minister responds to the debate, there are three particular points that I would ask him to address. First, among its proposals, Ofcom has suggested that contestable funding might be made available for news services. Do the Government have a response to this and, if so, are they minded to consider it favourably? Will they also consider embracing current affairs output as well as news? I also acknowledge that, because of some of the considerations already mentioned, time is of the essence in coming to a decision.</p>

<a name="90225-0011.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="090225112000033"></a>Secondly, to reiterate a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Macdonald, STV has for some time argued that its production division should be given independent status. That has frequently been acknowledged, both by Ofcom and by the Minister&#146;s department, but the second review was silent on the matter. The increased commissioning by the BBC gives STV a chance if it is allowed to compete. I ask that the department acts promptly and favourably in resolving this matter.</p>

<a name="90225-0011.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="090225112000034"></a>Finally, will the Minister indicate at some point if not tonight that the Government will respond to the Scottish Broadcasting Commission&#146;s proposals, albeit that the commission was set up by the Scottish Government? The value of the work and the contribution

An exciting opportunity is presented, although the cost is very high. It would be useful to have the Government&#146;s response, but that response in terms of cost should not compromise what we have already. We should secure what we have as good and then look forward to taking forward the proposals from the commission.</p>

I am conscious of the fact that we have only a limited time and that other noble Lords who are going to speak know a great deal more about the detail of broadcasting than I do, so I shall confine myself to some general points.</p>

<a name="90225-0011.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="090225112000036"></a>First, I share the view, which I am sure is common in this House, about the enormous importance of public service broadcasting. I see that as being at two levels: a local level and a national level. I was particularly struck in the happy days a few years ago when I had a job that took me fairly frequently to the northern isles and the Western Isles by what the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, has referred to as the quality of Radio Orkney and Radio Shetland and the significance of what they broadcast to the local communities. I was similarly struck by the Gaelic Service of the BBC in the Western Isles. That was of enormous importance. At a national level, public service broadcasting is very different, but it, too, is tremendously important in creating a well informed public opinion that knows not just about its own locality but about the wider world as well. I am sure, too, that most of us here would share the view that competition is important&#151;it matters everywhere&#151;and that monopolies are bad, but monopolies in the broadcasting of news must be a good deal more dangerous than monopolies elsewhere.</p>

<a name="90225-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="090225112000037"></a>When reading with enormous interest the report of the Scottish Broadcasting Commission, in which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, played a prominent role, I was struck by what he referred to as an interesting proposal for a new digital Scottish network. I can see the attractions of that, but I hope that I shall not sound too cynical if I also pick up the point about funding and say that I can see all too easily that this will be a pretty acrimonious business and probably rather long drawn out. One therefore asks oneself the question: if that new proposal does not get off the ground in the near future, what could be done with the present system that could make it work better? There is surely a great deal that could be done. I notice that the report refers to Radio Scotland. Here, Scotland has its own Scotland-based, directed-at-Scotland radio programme, which does a very good job. The commission noticed that there had been a good deal of criticism about it, but it is surely up to the BBC to deal with those points of criticism, to deal with the questions of funding and content of those programmes and to make Radio Scotland a better service.</p>

<a name="90225-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="090225112000038"></a>The commission also made the point, which the noble Lord, Lord Macdonald of Tradeston, referred to, that the BBC has committed itself to significantly

Indeed, if the BBC stuck to its original proposal of doing so by 2012 instead of 2016, and if it used the newly devised methodology on funding, the benefit to Scotland of the increased spend would be considerable, with all its knock-on effects. Similarly, if, as the report points out, Channel 4 was less metrocentric and put more effort into programme making in Scotland, that, too, would have a beneficial effect. I would be very interested in the views of the Minister on those points and whether he would support them.</p>

<a name="90225-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="090225112000039"></a>My final point is simply that I have been struck recently by the increasing divergence in the way in which news and newspapers treat Scotland and the rest of the UK. I can sit down having breakfast in Edinburgh and read, for example, the Scottish edition of the <I>Times</I> and think that a great deal of material in Scotland is covered. However, when I come down to your Lordships&#146; House and look in the Library, I find that there is hardly anything about Scotland. This divergence is dangerous. I hope that, in any public broadcasting arrangements that are made, a national broadcaster will cover Scotland not just as an add-on and that a Scottish system would not be too Scotocentric.</p>

It is not only timely but critical given the situation in Scotland. I shall start, however, by raising an aspect of public service broadcasting that is frequently ignored: universality of provision. We all recall how engineers from both the BBC and ITV painstakingly expanded at huge and, I would freely concede, in some cases unreasonable cost, and over a long period, the terrestrial transmitter network to ensure that 99.7 per cent of the British population could receive television programmes, a figure that is not likely to be equalled by either satellite or digital terrestrial broadcasting. It was therefore with great pleasure that I read the recent report, <I>Digital Britain</I>, and the Minister&#146;s commitment to introduce a universal service obligation for broadband at a minimum of 2 megabits a second throughout Britain by 2012. That is hugely good news, because, in addition to the vital role that broadband could serve in rural areas such as telemedicine, it could also be a major provider of broadcast programme content. More important perhaps, it could provide content aimed directly at local communities, which could be done only at huge, wasteful cost on satellite.</p>

<a name="90225-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="090225112000041"></a>The scarcity of time this evening reminds us that money also is scarce. It is quite easy to reach the conclusion that Scotland could do with a new digital network; it will be lot more difficult to find the &#163;70 million to pay for it. The first heretical question to be asked is whether Scotland would give up the funding of Gaelic broadcasting to provide some of the money for it. I suspect that that would split it right down the middle.</p>

<a name="90225-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="090225112000042"></a>Let us start, however, with the BBC as the cornerstone of public service broadcasting. I do not want to be dismissive, but, by and large, it is all right; it has a licence fee settlement that was pretty generous and which makes it immune to advertising recessions or  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_276"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column 276</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>potential migration to the internet. The problem is much greater, as the noble Lord, Lord Macdonald, outlined, for commercial television, because STV has the normal problems of ITV exacerbated by higher public service obligations due to the separate nature of life in Scotland and compounded by a potential dispute with ITV over the rate at which it pays for network programmes. I have seen figures from both sides and they disagree. I can say only that I suspect that there is a subsidy, largely because there ought to have been a subsidy, but I echo the plea of the noble Lord, Lord Macdonald, that we get somebody from Ofcom to act as honest broker and try to deliver the goods.</p>

<a name="90225-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="090225112000043"></a>I disagree with the noble Lord slightly on the digital service for Scotland. Let us not make matters worse by creating a competitor for STV. It certainly could not take money from advertising, because there is not enough advertising revenue to go around. The service therefore has at minimum to be publicly funded and, preferably, to be latched on to STV so that it can become part of this network and provide a spine of programming for STV if the dispute with ITV went sour.</p>

<a name="90225-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="090225112000044"></a>My own background of commercial radio is due a word. The situation there is quite simple: there are far too many radio stations. Recognising that you cannot turn the clock back and that we will still have a lot of radio stations, I believe that the answer is to drastically alter the ownership rules. To put it very simply, if you have eight separate owners owning eight separate services in the one area, it is unlikely that any of them will be able to afford the good local news service and they will all end up producing programmes that compete with one another and are broadly the same. If you put one owner in charge of eight services, you will certainly get a good local news service and, not only that, you will get separate and different programming because it is in the owner&#146;s own interest. When you get self-interest and public interest coinciding, that is the best way forward.</p>

As my noble friend Lord Wallace of Tankerness pointed out, this week sees an end to the local programme that we have enjoyed from Carlisle studios and Border Television for very many years. During the time that I served as a non-executive director of Border Television, we were very pleased at the fact that that evening programme from Carlisle had the highest viewing figures of any local news programme on any channel in the United Kingdom. It was quite a remarkable achievement.</p>

<a name="90225-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="090225112000046"></a>One reason for that success was that the news was local, which was very welcome. During the time when our noble friend Lord Bragg was our chairman, we managed to improve that by having split news coverage for the Scottish transmitter and the English transmitter. That helped greatly to encourage the localness of news coverage. Granada Television, when it took over Border

The mind boggles. I do not think that it will work.</p>

<a name="90225-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="090225112000047"></a>I wish those involved well. They say that they are going to have opt-outs, that they will have people sitting on a sofa in Gateshead talking about issues in the Scottish Borders and that they will have a cameraman here and there to send pictures down to Gateshead. It may work but, as we say north of the border, Ah hae ma doots. If it does not work, there is an obligation on Ofcom in relation to the continuing discussions between STV and ITV. I have attended meetings in this House with Rob Woodward, the chief executive of STV, and Michael Grade, the guru of ITV. They both agree that something should be done, but they cannot agree on the financial set-up. Ofcom will have to sort this out, as we do not want to lose in one part of Scotland the quality of local broadcasting that we enjoyed over many years. There is a real danger of that happening.</p>

<a name="90225-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="090225112000048"></a>Moreover, if the commission of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Fraser, is to come to fruition, as I hope it does, it does not make sense to start off looking at an alternative channel to the BBC in Scotland, with one chunk of Scotland missing and being covered from Gateshead. This issue has to be sorted out. I am well aware that it has financial implications and that STV and ITV have failed and will continue to fail to resolve this issue between them. Therefore, I look to the Minister to give some indication that this matter is being taken seriously. Okay, it is a small matter dealing with just one part of Scotland that I used to have the privilege of representing in the Commons, but it is a matter of great importance to us. I hope very much that the Minister will give some assurance that Ofcom will pay attention to what happens to news coverage in that part of Scotland.</p>

I have to confess, however, that my reasons for saying this are not entirely altruistic. I am motivated in part at least by self-interest. As your Lordships will be aware, the time is fast approaching when, as a serving judge, I will be disqualified from sitting and speaking in the House. For various reasons, even now, it is hardly ever possible for me to take part in public business, but this evening's debate, because of its timing and its subject matter, provides one of those rare opportunities when these constraints that apply to me do not apply.

<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="090225112000050"></a>My own particular interest in the future of public service broadcasting in Scotland is based on my experience of working with the broadcasters during my seven years as Lord President of the Court of Session in Scotland. I saw it as part of my function to try to demystify the judicial process and to provide the Scottish public with a greater insight into the workings of the courts in their own country. Television was the obvious  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_278"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column 278</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>medium for achieving this. In contrast to the position in England, where photography of any kind in a courtroom was, and still is, prohibited by statute, there is no such prohibition in Scotland. We are all familiar with courtroom dramas based on practice in the English and American courts but, apart from one brief appearance by a sheriff during an episode of &#147;Dr Finlay's Casebook&#148;, Scottish court scenes were never shown. I was able to take advantage of the absence of regulation by statute by permitting the televising of proceedings in Scottish courts so that the Scottish public could have a better idea of what goes on there.</p>

<a name="90225-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="090225112000051"></a>The first documentary programme of a criminal trial ever to appear on television in the UK was broadcast by Scottish Television. It was of a trial which took place in the Sheriff Court in Glasgow of a man who was accused, and later convicted, of stealing a bus. This was not the most serious of crimes that had ever been committed in Glasgow, although it turned out, when his previous convictions were revealed, that the accused was a serial bus thief. But it was a very well made and very entertaining one-hour programme. Later, five documentaries of cases in the High Court and the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh were made and broadcast by the BBC.</p>

<a name="90225-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="090225112000052"></a>This initiative would not, of course, have been possible without the co-operation of the broadcasters. Two things in particular were of the highest importance in making the thing work. The first was the mutual trust with I was able to develop with them, based on close personal contact, because they were in Scotland, close to where I was. The other was the ability which they had to find time in their programming schedules for this kind of activity. Showing Scottish judges in their own courts, wearing the distinctive robes that Scottish judges wear, makes an important contribution to public awareness of our own distinctive legal system. I wish that more was being done to make use of the opportunities that exist for making documentaries.</p>

Devolution, too, has changed the focus of attention from what it was in my day. But the facility has not gone away, and I would welcome and encourage more use of it. I hope, too, that Scottish producers will make use of the television facilities that are being installed in the new Supreme Court. The prohibition of photography in the courts of England and Wales does not apply to that court. The delivery of judgments there will be available for public broadcasting, as will the hearings that will be taking place there. It is important that use is made of this facility for broadcasting north of the border. This is a court which will serve all parts of the United Kingdom. We believe that the public in all parts of it should be aware of its existence and of what it does. I hope that the Minister will feel able to encourage this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="090225112000055"></a>Public service broadcasting in Scotland has a part to play in this, through the investment that it brings and the opportunities that it provides to those who have developed their skills as actors, artists, musicians, producers or technicians in Scottish universities to put them into practice in such a stimulating environment. I warmly support the noble Lord's desire to see more Scottish-made programming appear on television screens throughout the United Kingdom.</p>

I hope that we will hear from the noble Lord, Lord Carter, tonight some answers to some of the points.</p>

<a name="90225-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="090225112000057"></a>The current economic situation is putting immense pressure on the commercial sector, as, indeed, is the switchover to digital broadcasting, and the structure of broadcasting is appropriately considered at this time. In addition, we have had three very notable, thoughtful reports: that of the Scottish Broadcasting Commission; Ofcom&#146;s second public sector broadcasting review, <I>Putting Viewers First</I>; and the report of the noble Lord, Lord Carter, <I>Digital Britain</I>. We cannot possibly cover all these subjects tonight but I hope that the noble Lord will address the most urgent issues.</p>

<a name="90225-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="090225112000058"></a>The independent sector, which is very strongly valued in Scotland, as the Ofcom research showed, provides necessary competition to the BBC. There are differences of interest between ITV plc holding 11 licences and STV holding only two, but they both recognise that change is now required since the cost of ITV plc licences as a whole will exceed the value of these licences by 2011, even with the recent Ofcom regulatory relaxations. Both recognise the need for an alternative method of finance for public sector broadcasting news and non-news programmes in the devolved regions of Britain. But whereas ITV plc advocates that the networking arrangements with the devolved country licence holders should move on to a commercial basis, STV, because it cannot influence ITV network scheduling and commissioning, seeks assurance from the Government and Parliament that they will maintain,</p>
<ul><a name="090225112000095"></a>&#147;a strong, resolute and fair regulator in place&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090225112000088"></a>I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Carter, will feel able to give that assurance tonight.</p>

<a name="90225-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="090225112000059"></a>It is most welcome that Ofcom&#146;s January report has recognised that the needs of the nations of Britain are different and, as my noble friend Lord Wallace said, that no single situation can fit all. For STV in particular it is important that it should be recognised that its news broadcasting is not merely theoretical competition  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_280"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column 280</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for the BBC. In the past five years its viewing share has increased by 13 per cent. It is now watched by 2.1 million people per week. Of not least importance in the Ofcom review&#151;it is a treasury of objective information&#151;is the acknowledgement that Scottish viewers value plurality, choice, domestic production and quality of output. Ultimately, we need a structure that enables co-operation with the creative industries and the exploitation of new technologies but does not result in monopolistic provision either at the United Kingdom level or at national or regional level. Therefore, it would be helpful if the noble Lord, Lord Carter, could indicate his thinking on the model proposed by Ofcom of a Scottish digital network sustained by a competitive fund to support a series of interconnected Scotland-wide TV, local television, online and radio content. In particular the financial aspects of the provision of regional news must be addressed since, as STV has pointed out, the cost of providing 600 hours of high-quality news across Scotland is approximately &#163;7 million, and will very soon outweigh the benefit of holding a PSB licence.</p>

This highlights the challenge faced by commercial broadcasters in the UK. The financial crisis calls into question whether this sector can survive effectively, let alone make a public service broadcasting contribution that matches the BBC&#146;s, in Scotland or anywhere else.</p>

<a name="90225-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="090225112000063"></a>Another challenge that has run through this discussion is the need to develop genuine local TV news. We believe that much of the national and regional coverage provided by ITV is not totally what audiences want. People do not identify with regions that are based simply on where the old analogue transmitters are, let alone the new ones to which the noble Lord, Lord Steel, referred. The basic message should be that in the long term to satisfy audience demands for local news we need to encourage Ofcom to do all it can to help foster a market with local channels. I understand that this means relaxing cross-media ownership rules so that newspaper groups can invest in community TV channels, and making sure that the interleaved spectrum that they are auctioning goes to companies which will use it for local TV. Will the Government give Ofcom

The commission in any case calls for a review of existing structures.

<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="090225112000064"></a>DCMS and BERR state in their interim report, <I>Digital Britain</I>:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a><a name="090225112000093"></a>&#147;In the final report we will examine measures needed to address the challenges for digital content in more detail, including opportunities ... to foster UK creative ambitions and alternative funding mechanisms to advertising revenues&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090225112000089"></a>Can the Minister enlarge on this theme tonight? One has to sympathise with the STV position as depicted in the Ofcom recommendations in <I>Putting Viewers First</I>. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a><a name="090225112000094"></a>&#147;Instead of four channels, there are over 400, and viewers are increasingly using the internet to watch TV-like content. STV&#146;s advertising revenue has fallen as it has lost audience share, and one area where it can make significant savings is in news. Even with other reductions&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="090225112000090"></a>as the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, reminded us&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="090225112000096"></a>&#147;the cost of STV&#146;s public service obligations are today significantly more than the value of the benefit it gets from being a public service broadcaster&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90225-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="090225112000065"></a>I hear that Ofcom has now given permission for STV to reduce its news output, as that is its most expensive item. In the digital satellite age, news has become more a matter of idiosyncratic choice across the world. For instance, the BBC and other British broadcasters have been banned from Zimbabwe for some years but have resorted to a cunning invention to circumvent this. Al Jazeera English TV has been allowed to have a resident reporter in Zimbabwe, providing at times exclusive pictures for British viewers concerning the suffering in that country.</p>

<a name="90225-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="090225112000066"></a>The issue concerns whether the right regulation framework can be put in place to allow the ingenuity of the Scots to come up with a new forum of Scottish news and creative output that will be authoritative, genial and affordable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="090225112000068"></a>Speaking personally and as the relevant Minister, an opportunity to discuss how the issues which we are looking at across the United Kingdom relate to Scotland is very welcome. As has been said, the Government&#146;s <I>Digital Britain</I> interim report, which covers the strategic issues facing the converging communications industries and the increasing importance of this sector, tries to address some of the specific questions that have been raised this evening.

<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="090225112000069"></a>I welcome the entirely appropriate underscoring of the importance of universality on the part of the noble Lord, Lord Gordon of Strathblane. He said that

I think that we all agree with that. It seems to me, therefore, a statement of the obvious that there is an equal level of importance in the universality of provision of broadband connectivity.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90225-0013.htm"/>


<a name="90225-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="090225112000070"></a>Our report and Ofcom&#146;s report made it clear that despite this changing world, audiences care about public service content and, interestingly, care more about local content and so-called hyper-local content. They care that it is provided in a format and by providers beyond just the BBC, whereby we have, in the jargon of broadcasting policymakers, competition and plurality beyond the BBC. It is less clear how that should be delivered and what the future platform should be.</p>

<a name="90225-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="090225112000071"></a>Taken together, however, we have significant contribution already in Scotland, which has been mentioned this evening. We have public service content delivered by strong brands across Scotland, enshrined in SMG, the BBC and Alba, with regional variations within the nation. However, as my noble friend Lord Macdonald of Tradeston rightly points out, commercial broadcasters are going through a particularly challenging time, given the huge expansion of digital broadcasting, online access and declining advertising revenues.</p>

<a name="90225-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="090225112000072"></a>Perhaps I may underscore this. The noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, reminds us that advertisers are not flocking to commercial television in either the same volumes or, importantly, at the same prices as they were only four or five years ago. Some providers in the market tell me that they are facing declines of between 20 per cent and 30 per cent, when one looks at comparable year-on-year performances. Indeed, one major player in the market told me only two or three hours ago that it believed that when and if we come out of the cyclical recession facing these providers, we will see a structural repricing of advertising inventory in television which could see the rebased price at between 25 per cent and 30 per cent below what it was before the market hit a recession. This is a profound change in the sources of funding available for quality broadcasting and content&#151;hence the timeliness of these debates.</p>

<a name="90225-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="090225112000073"></a>This Government recognise that there is a need to secure adequate provision of content for the nations and, as we explained in our <I>Digital Britain</I> interim report, we need at least one other provider of scale, as well as the BBC, for the future; noble Lords, particularly the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, underlined that. We will later come back to how we will do that. Ofcom suggests that the current model may be unsustainable for the longer term, so our current review provides us with an ideal opportunity to provide some answers for PSB in Scotland and the UK as a whole.</p>

<a name="90225-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="090225112000074"></a>My noble friend and the noble Lord, Lord Steel, asked specifically about the arrangements between ITV plc and SMG plc. These rest on a mixture of contractual arrangements, the undertakings to the Competition Commission given at the time of the Carlton and Granada merger and the networking arrangements between the channel 3 licensees. The undertakings, as well as dealing with the CRR, also require ITV plc to offer airtime sales to SMG plc on  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_283"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column 283</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the terms in the contract with Carlton plc in 2003, unless altered by mutual agreement. The networking arrangements broadly require the supply of a clean feed of network programming with provision for opt-outs&#151;again on a contribution level that applied in 2003, uprated by RPI.</p>

<a name="90225-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="090225112000075"></a>All the parties to the networking arrangements agree that the changes since 2003 require a more fundamental reappraisal of the arrangements. What they do not agree on is how and what the final outcome should be. The Office of Fair Trading has said that while it has not included the undertakings that applied protections to the minority licensees in the CRR remedy review, it proposes to consider these issues separately and it is contact with Ofcom and the other parties concerned. Ofcom has made it clear that it intends to undertake a review of the networking arrangements during this year and is mindful of the need for them to work effectively and of the economic impact of any changes to the arrangements on individual licensees. Therefore, to answer directly the questions of the noble Lords, Lord Steel and Lord Maclennan, we will invite Ofcom in I hope its fullest, robust and independent form, with the Office of Fair Trading, to consider the longer-term implications of the airtime sales provisions alongside Ofcom&#146;s review of the networking arrangements.</p>

<a name="90225-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="090225112000076"></a>The Government are clear that there is a priority for investment in UK original content at a scale which can deliver high-quality impartial news at UK and international level for the devolved nations and the English regions. The Government believe that plurality of provision, particularly in news and current affairs, is fundamentally important. Our ambition is to identify not an immediate solution, but the right solution for the medium to long term.</p>

<a name="90225-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="090225112000077"></a>My noble friend refers to Scottish content and production. This is an intriguing question. For a nation with its own devolved institution, I, for one, recognise the importance, having been reared on it, of having news and content that reflects the nation&#146;s sense of itself. If I am allowed a personal observation, one of the things that we are seeing as a catch-up after the devolution agreements is how critical that is to a nation state&#146;s sense of itself.</p>

<a name="90225-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="090225112000078"></a>The question that we are trying to answer is how we can achieve this, and that is rightly under scrutiny. We welcome the close attention that the BBC Trust is giving to ensuring that the BBC is playing its full part in meeting audience demand in Scotland for more content on Scottish topics presented from a Scottish perspective. We agree with the trust that the BBC can significantly increase network production in Scotland in a sustainable way, and we welcome the somewhat more stretching targets that it has adopted. The trust has decided that the BBC should source at least 17 per cent of its network television production under the definition set by Ofcom, and reach an interim target of 12 per cent by 2012. The trust has our full support in encouraging the BBC to press forward as rapidly as possible towards these targets.</p>

<a name="90225-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="090225112000079"></a>In terms of coverage, the trust is rightly challenging the BBC to raise its game further in the provision of news in the nations and regions, including considering additional resourcing, and the trust has asked the  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_284"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column 284</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>BBC management to explore options for expansion in Scottish news and non-news programming to match the needs of a devolved nation. While some of this is clearly work in progress, taken as a whole, it represents progress and we should all encourage and support the BBC Trust in its endeavours to hold the BBC management to account on these questions.</p>

<a name="90225-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="090225112000080"></a>My noble friend also asked about the potential for reclassifying the production arm of SMG plc to independent status. This is something on which I have form and conviction, and in which I am interested; we are exploring this through our work around public service broadcasting in the nations, and I am hopeful that we will have something determinative to say on this issue very soon.</p>

<a name="90225-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="090225112000081"></a>The Government are considering a spectrum of options for the future of public service broadcasting which fall within four broad categories that are not necessarily mutually exclusive. First is an option whereby plurality is provided through a public service content provider that would draw on Channel 4&#146;s strength, but with scale and a recast remit, and specific obligations in relation to the nations, particularly around news provision.</p>

<a name="90225-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="090225112000082"></a>Second is an option whereby existing providers and new entrants provide content through a competitive funding system. Again, there is a question of scale, and this could range from the competitive funding model for current PSB providers or, indeed, as Ofcom raised in its recent review, through a new network model established as a competitive fund offering Scottish-wide television, local television, online provision and radio. The question of whether a competitive fund would have sufficient scale or impact, or could act as a genuine competitor for the BBC, genuinely requires further consideration, not least because of the comparative funding position of the BBC under its current licence-fee settlement and the commercial broadcasters, given their particular commercial position.</p>

<a name="90225-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="090225112000083"></a>The third option is to allow the current PSB system to evolve naturally, without any government intervention, whereby the nations would continue to benefit from the existing obligations on the BBC, ITV and the channel 3 licence holders, as I have already mentioned.</p>

<a name="90225-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="090225112000084"></a>The fourth option is the creation of a wholly new channel or digital network for Scotland. This was also considered by Ofcom in its recent review. While the benefit of having a dedicated channel providing Scottish content would give Scottish viewers news and content that reflected Scottish culture and society, there is no guarantee that such a network would have the reach and access envisaged, given increased audience fragmentation. This option deserves considerably greater work.</p>

<a name="90225-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="090225112000085"></a>Prioritisation of any public funding under any of the options must be carefully considered, especially given the current macroeconomic environment. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Fraser, points out, despite the analytical and political consensus on the final report, there was an interesting absence of answer to the question of where the funding comes from. Given the competing priorities in these public service questions, it is not evident that the &#163;75 million number is one that one can support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="090225112000086"></a>The current framework, whilst it has served the UK well to date, may not serve as well in the new digital future. That is the key question I would like to leave noble Lords with. We are particularly keen to hear from business leaders within the Scottish broadcasting industry, and my right honourable friend the Secretary of State will be discussing this with them at a <I>Digital Britain</I> broadcasting summit in Glasgow in March, where we hope to discuss these options in greater detail.</p>

<a name="90225-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="090225112000087"></a>I am very grateful to noble Lords for their contributions to this debate, and of course welcome their continued input as we move towards deciding the right public service broadcasting framework. We shall continue our work in earnest, which will culminate in the Government&#146;s final report in the summer, where we will have an answer to these and other related questions. I am afraid I cannot answer tonight the questions of the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, specifically on how and what those funding and structural answers will be, as we are in active consultation on those questions, as I have outlined this evening. The key question we all have to have an eye on is how to have a solution for the digital future as well as one that respects our broadcasting past. I thank noble Lords for the debate.</p>

Under the UK Borders Act 2007, PACE applies for immigration officers, but also laid out very clearly in the Act is this clause on detention. It seemed to me that this was as important in this legislation as elsewhere, because detention by those who are not police officers and who do not have police powers is onerous not only on them but on the people whom they are detaining.</p>

<a name="90225-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="090225114000002"></a>It seems more than proper that how people are detained and the terms of detention should be laid out on the face of the Bill. That is why we have put this in. We feel that it should be there to be referred to as part of this Bill and subsequently as part of this Act. The amendment would simply designate the powers of a designated immigration officer or designated customs official as to what they cannot do when they are arresting someone and holding them for three hours, because that is all that they are entitled to do before they pass the person to the police for charging or consideration of charging. The measure was important enough for the 2007 Act; it is certainly important enough for this one. I beg to move.</p>

HMRC officials already have this power and they can detain a person who does not agree to a search and can make an arrest if necessary. Designated UKBA officials will inherit these powers, as it were. However, the differences between their powers of arrest and search when acting in their two different capacities may well cause problems. I can see the argument for aligning the powers between the two roles and I would like to know why there is a need for designated immigration officers to act under different statutory provisions regarding detention and search according to whether they are acting in one role or the other. Will it always be clear to both the designated immigration officer and the individual being searched or detained under which set of powers they are operating? Will the person who is effecting the detention serve notice on the individual to be detained or searched under which set of powers he is acting?</p>

They are linked to the provision that we are making elsewhere in Part 1 to ensure the effective application of PACE and the related codes of practice to the UK Border Agency. The amendments will provide the agency and Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs with the flexibility in the future to use short-term holding facilities to detain persons other than those who are detained under the administrative provisions of the immigration legislation.</p>

<a name="90225-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="090225114000007"></a>The new clause achieves that by amending the definition of a short-term holding facility in Section 147 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. A consequential amendment is also made to the schedule to this Bill. As a result of the amendment, the definition of a short-term holding facility will be,</p>
<ul><a name="090225114000035"></a>&#147;a place used for the detention of detained persons for a period of not more than seven days or for such other period as may be prescribed whether or not it is also used for the detention of other persons for any period&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90225-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="090225114000008"></a>I should stress that these amendments do not impact in any way on the treatment of administrative immigration detainees. The treatment of such persons will continue to be governed by existing arrangements, and the period for which their detention in a short-term holding facility is permitted will be unaffected.</p>

<a name="90225-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="090225114000009"></a>The amendment will simply allow the UK Border Agency and HMRC to use short-term holding facilities to detain persons following arrest where this is in accordance with the provisions that we are making in relation to the application of PACE and the associated codes of practice. I hope that the Committee will agree to it.</p>

The Minister was silent on what a short-term holding facility is. If it is a facility for seven days, surely it cannot be a police cell. Perhaps when the Minister responds he will be kind enough to tell us what is meant by a short-term holding facility, as well as who is in charge of it and what facilities are available to those being detained. Under the Immigration and Asylum Act, the detainees should not be there for longer than three hours if an immigration officer or customs official is in charge. If it is for longer, they should be held by the police. What is the facility that we are talking about? Perhaps the Minister will let us know. Will he also tell us who is in charge of these holding facilities? Is it the police or the agents of the UK Border Agency? May we hear a bit more about it? </p>

Some of the other so-called short-term detentions run into months and years, but I understand that we are not talking about those facilities here. The questions raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, concern matters that we, too, want to know about, but I should also like to know the extent of what we are talking about in relation to these facilities. Are we talking about detention centres outside the UK&#151;for example, at Sangatte near Calais? I echo the questions of the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, about who is in charge and particularly whether this provision applies to places outwith the UK. If it does apply to holding centres in other countries, will they be staffed by UK border staff or will that work be subcontracted to in-country people? Those are my initial questions, although I may want to come back when the Minister has had a chance to answer some of them.</p>

Does it mean that there will be many places in such short-term holding facilities, on top of the existing and considerable number for long-term detention? Is it envisaged, or could there be cases, in which people are transferred from short-term holding to indefinite detention places? The whole thing is obscure and may not be entirely satisfactory.</p>

Those are the sort of places where the seven-day limit applies. Presumably, if the police hold people in cells for a short time before transferring them to immigration removal centres, they are required to operate under the PACE codes of practice. That makes it all the more incongruous that somebody held in that manner can be given the protection

<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="090225114000014"></a>This relates to something that happened to come up this morning in the Home Affairs Sub-Committee, of which I am a member. There is a directive coming down the track from Europe under which unaccompanied minors should not be detained at all. What will the arrangements be in future for them? Have the Government anticipated the legislation coming into force from Europe, with which I believe we are likely to line up? If so, what arrangements will they have for holding unaccompanied minors who are thought to be illegal entrants but cannot be held either in immigration removal centres or short-term holding facilities under this clause?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="090225114000017"></a>May I get back to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, in writing about a European directive on children, as that is quite a complex issue? The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, asked whether this provision applies to holding facilities outside the UK, such as in Sangatte. Clause 53 covers the extent of the Bill: it provides that Clauses 22 and 23 apply only in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. I hope that that answers that question.</p>

If these holding centres are already there, I am not quite sure whether the amendment to the Immigration and Asylum Act is that these powers should be extended to the new customs officials. Is that the point? Secondly, short-term holding facilities are, presumably, limited to three hours and people are then passed from the hands of the immigration officers or the customs revenue officers to the police, for consideration on whether they should be charged. Under PACE or the detention rules, officers can hold people only for three hours before the police are involved. Is it then intended that, if someone is held in those short-term facilities, the police become involved and, if they are held for longer than three hours, they are then held by the police?</p>

I remember one case where a woman who had nowhere to go was found wandering on the road. She was taken into custody by the police, who discovered that she was an illegal entrant. Subsequently, they handed her over to the Immigration Service. There are therefore cases where the police are forced to hold persons who are subject to immigration control pending the arrival of an immigration officer to take them to some more permanent location. It is in those cases where the police cell acts, in the ordinary meaning of the English language, as a short-term holding facility, although it may not be defined as such under the Immigration and Asylum Act. I was trying to satisfy myself that the same provisions that would apply to a short-term holding facility would apply to the police under those circumstances.</p>

That amendment has been resisted. The effect of this amendment to Clause 26 would be that the independent chief inspector would have only an oversight role in respect of those immigration, asylum and nationality functions exercised by the Border and Immigration Agency. The intention underpinning Clause 26, however, is that the chief inspector should oversee the full range of functions to be exercised by the UK Border Agency, including those customs functions for which the agency will have primary responsibility at the border. The UK Border Agency was established in shadow form in April 2008 and, as a result, the Border and Immigration Agency no longer exists. That being so, the independent external scrutiny provided by the chief inspector needs to cover all the functions of the UK Border Agency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="090225115000003"></a>As regards the issue of full protection of all the minor ports, as I said earlier, there is no doubt that the new structure is enabling us to have much greater coverage. In that sense, therefore, we are much more secure. We do not, however, have full cover of all our minor ports. A lot of this is intelligence-based and making maximum utility of what is a far more flexible force because of the measures we have in this Bill. I hope on that basis the noble Baroness will agree to withdraw her amendment.</p>

We are somewhat pleased to note the Government&#146;s response to our amendment with their Amendment 38, but disappointed that they have confined their amendment to the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="90225-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="090225115000021"></a>The Cabinet Office report published in November 2007, <I>Security in a Global Hub,</I> which has already been mentioned several times, remarks that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58"></a><a name="090225115000058"></a>&#147;The drive to push as much border control activity as possible overseas has been a key theme in the development of border management over the past decade&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090225115000047"></a>This objective has meant that immigration powers are exercised increasingly by UKBA officials and private contractors overseas, including at the &#147;juxtaposed controls&#148; where UK officials and private contractors exercise immigration powers at EEA ports with the agreement of the Governments of France and Belgium. As the report says, the use of these powers overseas has significantly expanded since the Home Secretary was given the power in January 2003 to exercise immigration control at European Economic Area ports. However, officers were using these powers overseas before then, such as at Prague airport in 2001.</p>

<a name="90225-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="090225115000022"></a>Although airline liaison officers overseas have the right to stop people boarding flights, it is really at the juxtaposed controls that our wording is to be preferred to that of the Government because at those locations the powers of search, detention, fingerprinting and so on may be exercised by both immigration officers and private contractors. The private contractors may carry out other immigration functions overseas, as I have already mentioned, such as escorting people who are being removed from the UK.</p>

<a name="90225-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="090225115000023"></a>The dossier of allegations in the document <I>Outsourcing Abuse</I> which is currently, as I mentioned earlier, subject to investigation by Dame Nuala O&#146;Loan, includes assaults by private contractor escorts outside the UK. As I mentioned, 3 per cent of the allegations recorded were assaults on aircraft after take-off from the UK, and one can assume that assaults at that point would be less likely to be recorded because of the practical difficulties facing someone who has been removed.</p>

<a name="90225-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="090225115000024"></a>The report states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a><a name="090225115000059"></a>&#147;The authorities appear reluctant to investigate reported assaults which often happen behind closed doors, with no witnesses&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090225115000048"></a>We have already noted in the discussion on Clause 22 the Government&#146;s stated commitment to strong oversight, transparency and accountability of the UKBA. So the absence of jurisdiction for the IPCC to investigate complaints of misconduct by immigration officers and their private contractors exercising immigration functions overseas is a significant omission, only partially repaired by the government amendment.</p>

<a name="90225-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="090225115000025"></a>So, while we are grateful to the Government for having gone some way towards our proposals, we are more concerned than ever to ensure that oversight of what happens outside our borders is placed on the same footing as it is within the UK. The scope for abuse is almost inevitably greater when the chances of detection are lessened, and vulnerable individuals deserve and need the protection that our amendment will afford. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="090225115000027"></a>The Government have also tabled an amendment to Clause 28 and I should like to deal with this first before turning to the amendment proposed by the noble Lord. Clause 28 as introduced would enable the Secretary of State to make regulations allowing the Independent Police Complaints Commission to oversee serious complaints, incidents and conduct matters relating to the provision of contractual services in relation to the discharge of customs functions in England or on behalf of the UK Border Agency. The Government, however, wish to give the IPCC the same oversight role in respect of the provision of contractual services in relation to the discharge of those immigration and asylum enforced functions specified in Section 41(2) of the Police and Justice Act 2006, which the UK Border Agency exercises in England and Wales. It is for this reason that the Government are bringing forward this amendment to Clause 28. The Government feel that the amendment would strengthen the independent oversight arrangements for these functions.</p>

<a name="90225-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="090225115000028"></a>In his Amendment 37, the noble Lord has identified that Clause 28 only secures oversight of contractors exercising customers&#146; functions. As I have explained, the Government will move an amendment to Clause 28 to ensure regulations can secure oversight over contractors exercising both customs functions and functions in relation to immigration and asylum matters. We are therefore agreed on the underlying purpose in relation to the need to cover contractors, but we prefer our slightly simpler amendment on that point.</p>

<a name="90225-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="090225115000029"></a>The amendment proposed by the noble Lord would also extend the oversight of the IPCC to oversee the exercise of specified enforcement functions by officials of the Secretary of State in the UK and overseas. The Government do not believe that the amendment is necessary as officials working at our diplomatic posts overseas do not exercise enforcement powers. At our juxtaposed controls in France and Belgium, UK Border Agency officials are exempt from prosecution under French or Belgian law for acts committed in the UK control zone in the course of their duties. Under the terms of the treaties in place for juxtaposed controls, any complaints are investigated by the authorities of the host state and all evidence gathered is handed over to the relevant authorities in the UK for consideration under UK law.</p>

If it falls short of that, the Minister said he was considering independent oversight of matters that were complained about that did not constitute criminal offences. So that is a step in the right direction, but as the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, said, it does not go far enough, because we are talking not only about juxtaposed controls but about any activity by private contractors that is exercised in pursuance of their immigration powers outside the boundaries of the United Kingdom.</p>

That would apply to the escorts accompanying people being deported from the United Kingdom and it would apply to airline operatives abroad who have been there for a long time&#151;airline liaison officers&#151;or any other official who is located outside the boundaries of the United Kingdom and who is exercising functions on behalf of the Immigration Service.

This bill of rights has a history which goes back to the Belfast agreement&#151;the Good Friday agreement, as it is better known&#151;and to Section 69(7) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. The commissioners explained that the bill of rights is particularly important to them because, in the aftermath of the Troubles which they experienced for so long, they feel that rights, equality of rights and proper treatment are crucial, especially in an atmosphere where distrust quickly arises in the light of difficult issues. They have done some terrific work on the bill, which we should soon be debating in this place, and I hope the Government will give it a fair wind. Meanwhile, however, they have no bill of rights and it is up to us to ensure that any legislation we pass is as fair to Northern Ireland as it is to the rest of the United Kingdom. That brings me to the amendment.</p>

<a name="90225-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="090225115000040"></a>We have concerns that Northern Ireland is being treated somewhat differently. The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission has consistently raised concerns about powers which are properly the role of police officers being delegated to UKBA officers. The commission has concerns about the increasing use and introduction into Northern Ireland of a civilian force that is engaging in police work but which is currently without the same standards, training or accountability as PSNI officers.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_299"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column 299</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90225-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="090225115000041"></a>As the Committee will be aware, there is a particular policing context within Northern Ireland, including contexts for human rights compliance. As I said, trust takes a long time to build up and is easily lost. The role of the police ombudsman in relation to immigration officers is the subject of ongoing reviews. As far as we are aware those reviews have not yet been concluded, and I would be grateful if the Minister could shed any light on the progress.</p>

<a name="90225-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="090225115000042"></a>In 2007, the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, in its response to the consultation on the IPCC oversight of Border and Immigration Agency incidents and complaints, raised concerns that the mechanism for individual complaints to be heard and dealt with, that of the IPCC, did not extend to Northern Ireland. It said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71"></a><a name="090225115000071"></a>&#147;The Commission notes that the oversight of the IPCC does not extend to Northern Ireland and that according to the consultation paper &#145;any cross border complaints will be dealt with under agreements with the relevant authorities in Scotland and Northern Ireland&#146; (&#145;cross border&#146; in this context meaning as between the UK jurisdictions)&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="090225115000049"></a>not, as we usually think of in Ireland, between the north and the south.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72"></a><a name="090225115000072"></a>&#147;The cross border activity of BIA is in fact significant, with individuals routinely being transported from Northern Ireland to Dungavel Removal Centre in Scotland and then on to removal centres in England. The need for agreements with the relevant agency in Northern Ireland therefore is a very real and pressing one&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090225115000050"></a>It is not just a hypothetical issue.</p>

<a name="90225-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="090225115000043"></a>The policing divisions of the Northern Ireland Office were also consulting in 2007 on the recommendations made by the police ombudsman of Northern Ireland. That paper states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_73"></a><a name="090225115000073"></a>&#147;The Police Ombudsman has been asked to take responsibility for the investigation of serious criminal complaints against the staff of the Immigration Service and Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090225115000051"></a>The paper goes on to explain that negotiations were under way to identify the legislative changes necessary to enable the Police Ombudsman to carry out that role. Will the Minister tell the House of progress made in those negotiations?</p>

<a name="90225-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="090225115000044"></a>There seems to be a discrepancy between what is being proposed for the police ombudsman and what has been agreed for the IPCC. The ombudsman&#146;s oversight seems to be restricted to &#147;serious criminal complaints&#148;, implying that only complaints alleging serious crimes committed by immigrations could fall to be investigated by the police ombudsman. Given what the Government have said about ad hoc immigration checks being carried out on the land border, this could raise serious concerns. As there are no proposals in the Bill regarding the oversight of immigration officers in Northern Ireland, we are deeply concerned that there could be a significant period during which protections were afforded to individuals in England and Wales but not in Northern Ireland. I am sure the Minister will agree that that is not a satisfactory situation, and it could potentially engage Article 14 of the ECHR prohibiting discrimination in the enjoyment of Convention rights. I beg to move.</p>

Since she has done so and I cannot be certain that I shall be standing in the Chamber when we reach those amendments, I will ask the Minister one question pertaining to the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, which has been the subject of two exchanges for which I have been present over the past year.</p>

<a name="90225-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="090225117000002"></a>In the first of them, I cannot recall whether the Minister was sitting next to a colleague who was making a Statement or whether he was actually answering questions himself, but the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, and I were engaged in asking, because of the possibility of people who were hostile to this realm entering the United Kingdom by the back door across the border, whether conversations were going on with the Republic of Ireland about strengthening that border. The answer that we received on that occasion was, yes, there were such conversations going on. I recall, in a much more recent exchange, the Minister saying that there were not now conversations going on, which may have been out of context. If he were able to clarify exactly the status of the relationship with the Government in the Republic on that subject, so much the better.</p>

The answer is that we are having ongoing discussions with the Irish about the border, intelligence sharing, risk and things like that. We have been deeply involved in that, not least because of the CTA work. That is continuing.</p>

<a name="90225-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="090225117000004"></a>On the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, the Government are committed to ensuring that consistent and independent oversight is in place throughout the United Kingdom. As such, we fully agree that oversight in Northern Ireland should be provided by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, in line with the oversight provided in England and Wales by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Although the Government have invited the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland to take on this oversight role, I am afraid that discussions with the ombudsman regarding his suggested role are still in the early stages.</p>

<a name="90225-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="090225117000005"></a>Officials have been working with the Northern Ireland Office and it is intended to take this matter forward now in the immigration simplification Bill that is due to be published at the end of this Session. It has been decided not to introduce the changes in this Bill because we want to have those discussions completed and want to build on the initial work and allow enough time for scrutiny and discussion to ensure that we get it right. Until such oversight by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland is introduced, where a complaint involves criminality this will continue to be investigated by the police, whereas for complaints regarding staff misconduct it will be for the border force&#146;s Professional Standards Unit to investigate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="090225117000006"></a>We are proposing that, through the immigration simplification Bill, the police ombudsman would have oversight of serious complaints, incidents and conduct

<a name="90225-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="090225117000007"></a>While oversight of complaints, incidents and misconduct matters in Northern Ireland is of equal importance to the rest of the UK, arrangements to secure sufficient oversight have been initiated more recently than those with the IPCC. When the Government first approached the IPCC in order to secure oversight in England and Wales, activity in Northern Ireland was at a very low level, with officers from England carrying out ad hoc enforcement operations in this area. However, activity has since increased and there is a proposal for a permanent office to be opened in Belfast. On this basis, discussions are progressing with the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland to ensure that adequate oversight is in place.</p>

<a name="90225-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="090225117000008"></a>It is important to note that, although activity has increased in Northern Ireland, it is still relatively low level. For example, I think there are about 18 officers involved in enforcement work there at the moment. I hope that the noble Baroness feels that answers her question enough to be able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

The changes are required as subsections (4) and (5) of Clause 34, which made certain provision in relation to Scotland, are not necessary. On analysis, it has been agreed that the changes that it was envisaged would be made under these clauses would be for reserved purposes and, accordingly, for United Kingdom Ministers.

<p><a name="09022572000003"></a><b><a name="90225-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09022572000194"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> In moving the Unit Trusts (Electronic Communications) Order 2009, I shall also speak to the Open-Ended Investment Companies (Amendment) Regulations 2009.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000004"></a>The Open-Ended Investment Companies (Amendment) Regulations 2009 and the Unit Trusts (Electronic Communications) Order 2009 make provision for the electronic transfer of ownership to units and shares in UK-authorised investment funds. This should permit major efficiency savings and reductions in error rates. I will sketch in some background to these instruments.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000005"></a>The Law of Property Act 1925 in England and Wales and the Statute of Frauds Act of 1695 in Northern Ireland require transfers of title to units and shares in United Kingdom-authorised investment funds to be made in writing. In Scotland, the Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995 has the same effect for assignments of property made in the form of a gift. Authorised investment funds are collective investment vehicles that are authorised by the Financial Services Authority. They can take the form of open-ended investment companies or authorised unit trusts. The two are very similar, the only significant difference being their legal form. About &#163;400 billion is currently held in these funds.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000006"></a>Although paper processes remain a necessary part of some aspects of the investment fund administration process, they also tend to be more expensive and to have higher error rates than purely electronic processes.  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC118"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column GC118</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Indeed, the electronic messaging firm SWIFT estimates that, across the European Union, the additional annual costs generated by using manual rather than fully electronic processes could be as high as &#8364;1 billion. When the further costs driven by the higher error rates associated with manual processing are taken into account, this figure could rise to between &#8364;5 billion and &#8364;10 billion. We therefore believe that the requirements that I have described for a paper-based process in the UK impose significant costs on investment fund managers and their investors.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000007"></a>We estimate that making provision for electronic transfer could bring annual administrative savings for UK fund managers of between &#163;70 million and &#163;290 million. None the less, improvements in efficiency must not come at the expense of maintaining reliable systems that protect the interests of investors. We believe that investor protection will continue to be assured for a number of reasons. First, electronic systems are already a central and reliable part of the financial services architecture. There is, for example, the CREST system for share and bond trading, which holds about 88 per cent of UK shares or, at the retail level, secure systems for internet and telephone banking that are now used significantly by more than 17 million people in the UK. Experience so far has shown that properly designed electronic systems can be equally reliable or, indeed, more reliable than paper-based processes, and that it is right to extend this provision to the fund management industry.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000008"></a>Secondly, under the proposed new rules, the fund manager would retain liability for losses incurred where it acted on instructions that were later shown to have been fraudulent. This mirrors the current position for paper-based instructions and acts to place a strong incentive on fund managers to ensure that they have adequate security procedures in place and to protect investors in the unlikely event of loss through fraud.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000009"></a>Finally, we will require fund managers to take reasonable steps to confirm the identity of the sender of an electronic instruction. For open-ended investment companies, this requirement is contained in the draft instrument. Detailed rules on the operation of authorised unit trusts are included in Financial Services Authority rules, and the new requirement for that type of fund will therefore be imposed in FSA rules. The Investment Management Association has produced guidance for firms on meeting this &#147;reasonable steps&#148; criterion, which it has asked the FSA to approve. The guidance lists the types of electronic communication which can be considered secure and lists precautions which should be taken to verify investors&#146; identity in particular types of transaction.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000010"></a>The proposals have been the subject of a full consultation. Responses to the consultation supported the principle almost unanimously and included helpful feedback, which we have reflected in the proposals before the Committee today, to ensure the effectiveness in property law of transactions made under the proposed new rules.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000011"></a>In line with the feedback from the consultation, we do not propose to make it a requirement for fund managers to accept electronic instructions. Investment funds are distributed by a wide variety of means&#151;via  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC119"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column GC119</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>independent financial advisers or other intermediaries, directly by the fund manager or through a platform&#151;and the appropriate means for accepting investor instructions varies accordingly. We therefore want to maintain the flexibility for managers to act only on paper instructions where that is most appropriate. We expect electronic transfer to be taken up quickly for wholesale fund business and to be adopted more gradually in retail markets.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000012"></a>In conclusion, the reforms can bring substantial efficiency savings for the UK fund management industry, and the safeguards they include will ensure that investor protection is in no way compromised. Accordingly, I commend the order to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="09022572000013"></a><b><a name="90225-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09022572000195"></a>Lord Howard of Rising:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for introducing these two welcome statutory instruments. Indeed, they would have been welcome a year ago. Anyway, he has put forward in his usual fine fashion a number of extremely good reasons for them. It is rather ironic that two instruments allowing for the more efficient and accurate transfer of information should have been held up by inefficiencies and inaccuracies within the Treasury, but such is government.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000014"></a>The statutory instruments are welcome for various reasons which the Minister has already emphasised. The most obvious is that they give the industry the opportunity to make significant savings for a relatively low start-up cost. It is also a good thing that the power is permissive rather than prescriptive. There have been enough fiascos recently around government-contracted IT systems for there to be strong reasons to allow the private sector to go at its own speed. Prescription would not be necessary to achieve a large take-up, as the regulations are both welcome and long awaited by the industry, and are in line with arrangements for other types of financial instruments.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000015"></a>There have been some concerns about the security of the new arrangements, and I am glad to see from the debates in another place on the regulations that liability remains with the fund manager for losses incurred on fraudulent transactions, as it does with paper transactions.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000016"></a>On the whole, the statutory instruments are welcome.</p>

<p><a name="09022572000017"></a><b><a name="90225-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09022572000196"></a>Lord Razzall:</b> I join the noble Lord, Lord Howard of Rising, in welcoming the regulations on the mechanics of transfer of unit trusts and what are called OEICs; I love the way we go into such phrases for these things. There is only one point that I ask the Minister to clarify. It appears from the papers before us that, as the noble Lord, Lord Howard, referred to, one of the consultation outcomes was a separation in regulation between the requirement for a manager to take reasonable steps to verify the identity of the person submitting electronic instructions and the property law provisions providing that a transfer could be effective. In other words, the transfer is effective irrespective of fraud in the transmission of the electronic communication. One important issue here, from the point of view of fund managers, is what the requirement is for managers to take reasonable steps to ensure that the identity of the person submitting the communication has been verified.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000018"></a>I understand that in another place the suggestion was made that if the regulations of the Investment Management Association were adopted by the FSA, and if the fund manager had complied with those requirements as set out in the recommendations of the Investment Management Association, that would constitute taking reasonable steps and provide a defence for the fund manager in relation to an accusation that reasonable steps had not been taken. I would be grateful if the Minister could confirm that that will be the case.</p>

<p><a name="09022572000019"></a><b><a name="90225-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09022572000197"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am grateful to noble Lords for their constructive response to the order, which brings potential benefits in terms of reducing costs. I want to confirm the obvious point emphasised by the noble Lord, Lord Howard, that liability rests with the manager. It is of course the case, as the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, indicated, that we are concerned that liability remains with the fund manager where there are fraudulent instructions, even if it had taken reasonable steps. There is no doubt where the liability will rest. We have checked that out. As the noble Lord rightly says, the Investment Management Association recognised that the FSA rules will confirm that point.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000020"></a>I stand guilty as charged on the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Howard, about a slight slip with regard to dates on the order which caused an element of delay. Even Homer nods on occasion and on this occasion the Treasury did. I apologise to the Committee for the fairly limited delay that occasioned. He is right to draw attention to government inefficiency on the rare occasions when he finds it.</p>

<p><a name="09022572000021"></a><b><a name="90225-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09022572000198"></a>Lord James of Blackheath:</b> I have a short question for the Minister. When the order came to the Merits Committee, my concern was whether there was any safeguard built into the software for this which would in any way prevent what one might call a run on unit trusts arising from a programme sale knock-on, as occurs in the equity market, and whether you could have an artificially created crisis in the unit trusts as a result of sales by more than one party or another creating a programme sale, knocking on into everyone else who holds those investments at that time to create an unnecessary and unwelcome panic sale on an otherwise reasonable investment portfolio.</p>

<p><a name="09022572000022"></a><b><a name="90225-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09022572000199"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord. I wish he had asked his question a little earlier, so that I would not be quite so breathless in my response. It is a very important question. He has identified an issue which would cause the gravest concern if we did not think that we were able to guarantee a provision against that. There are provisions for managers to suspend redemptions in the circumstances which the noble Lord has identified, which would certainly be necessary because the consequences could be disastrous in regard to any particular fund. We could suspend.</p>

<p><a name="09022572000023"></a><b><a name="90225-gc0001.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09022572000202"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> The order has its origins in the Building Societies (Funding) and Mutual Societies (Transfers) Act, which received Royal Assent in 2007. The Act addressed some very important issues and contained three key sections: Section 1 on how building societies are funded, Section 2 on the rights of members in the event of insolvency, and Section 3 on arrangements to facilitate transfers of engagements between different types of mutual organisations. As the Committee will know, the Government laid an implementing order in January this year under Section 3 of the Act, and it is the subject of today&#146;s debate. The first order relates to building societies, and it is significant that the recent merger proposal between the Co-operative and Britannia Building Society cited this order as having made the merger possible.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000024"></a>It is the Government&#146;s intention to lay an implementing order for industrial and provident societies in the near future after further discussions with the sector. However, the Government are not convinced of a case for implementing this in relation to friendly societies as same transfer provisions already apply, whether the transfer of business is to another mutual society or to a company.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000025"></a>The Government welcome this opportunity to update legislation for the mutual sector, and I shall start by explaining why we believe this order merits the support of the Committee. Mutual societies, such as building societies, industrial and provident societies and friendly societies, play a significant role in enhancing financial inclusion and social cohesion and in offering diversity and choice in the financial services sector as well as in contributing to the wider economy. Mutual societies  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC122"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column GC122</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>continue to excel in their respective sectors. Even in the current tough economic climate, the leading best-buy tables for mortgages are populated by building societies. Child trust funds by friendly societies and, of course, co-operatives continue to lead the way in ethical policies putting the concerns of their members and customers first. I am sure the Committee will recognise the widespread public recognition of the virtues of these societies.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000026"></a>Membership of mutual societies now exceeds 30 million with total assets in excess of &#163;400 billion. They are a significant employer in the UK economy as they employ nearly 1 million people and are the mainstay of many communities. Indeed, the mutual form is now widely acknowledged to be a viable alternative to the proprietary company model.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000027"></a>The Government believe that it is all the more important in today&#146;s global economic climate to have a variety of legal forms of business not only to meet the needs and aspirations of their members but to enhance competition within the economy. Under current legislation, the scope for mutual societies to transfer their business is limited. Usually this means that they are permitted to transfer their business to another mutual of the same category only&#151;for example, from building society to building society. Otherwise, they may transfer to a company and become demutualised, leading to a loss of mutual status and membership.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000028"></a>The order will increase the options available to building societies, allowing them to transfer to a subsidiary of another mutual society under a simplified procedure. This will make it possible to retain the business within a group with a mutual ethos as well as to provide for members of the transferring mutual to have rights in the holding mutual. It contains appropriate safeguards not only to protect the rights of members of the transferring mutual but to prevent demutualisation by the back door. It will enable mutual societies to develop strong group structures as an alternative to demutualisation, which will in turn result in a revitalised and self-sustaining sector offering quality services to its members and enhancing competition in the UK economy.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000029"></a>The order has been drafted after extensive consultation with key stakeholders and interested parties, and we have already seen from the press reports just how exciting the sector considers these proposals in the order. I commend it to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="09022572000030"></a><b><a name="90225-gc0001.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09022572000203"></a>Lord Howard of Rising:</b> I thank the Minister for introducing the order. Given that there will have to be shareholder approval before any transfer, we do not object to the order. A number of points were raised in another place, but I shall not waste the time of the Committee by repeating them. They were, on the whole, dealt with by the Minister. However, it would be nice if he could tell the Committee when the order relating to industrial and provident societies will come into effect.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09022572000160"></a>&#147;Following consultation the Treasury does not intend to implement the Act for friendly societies&#148;.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC123"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column GC123</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09022572000153"></a>I was going to ask why. However, I understood the Minister to say that under existing legislation the friendly societies could do what this order sets out for mutual societies. I should be grateful for his confirmation that I understood him correctly.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000032"></a>Secondly, I should welcome a little elaboration about the requirement for urgent implementation of Section 3 of the Act, which of course was the justification for cutting down the consultation period from 12 to eight weeks. Is the Minister saying that this is a result of the current economic climate, or has something not been explained about the urgent implementation?</p>

<a name="90225-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000033"></a>Thirdly, why do the Government believe, in paragraph 8.5, that there is no need,</p>
<ul><a name="09022572000162"></a>&#147;to implement section 1 of the Act in the current economic circumstances&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="09022572000154"></a>I am not sure what &#147;the current economic circumstances&#148; means&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09022572000163"></a>&#147;and will review ... in two years time&#148;?</ul>
<p><a name="09022572000155"></a>Subject to those questions, I am happy to support the order.</p>

<p><a name="09022572000034"></a><b><a name="90225-gc0001.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="09022572000205"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am grateful to both noble Lords for their response to the order. The noble Lord, Lord Howard, is right: the cardinal principle underpinning the order is that shareholder approval is needed for any such action.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000035"></a>I do not have a date for the industrial and provident societies, but it is our intention to make progress on that provision. I shall write to the noble Lord the moment I have additional information on the timing of that.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000036"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Razzall, asked what is urgent about this. I indicated that the Co-operative and Britannia referred to the order for their merger. He is as well&#151;if not better&#151;versed in economics and business affairs as I am. He will be all too well aware that in the current economic situation mutuals have inevitably been enhanced in the public&#146;s perception as regards the safety of their deposits and their ability and eagerness to negotiate business with them. Therefore, anything we can do to strengthen the mutuals sector at this stage is clearly working with a grain of strong public opinion as to their virtues. We also recognise that in a globalised economy many mutuals can look desperately small. That is not necessarily a disadvantage because they can offer good service to the public. However, in a competitive marketplace the pressure will be for them to have the necessary resources to offer the extensive services they need to offer. Within that framework, therefore, the Government are introducing the order. We think that it is very much in the interests of the nation, on the decision of the shareholders in each case, to facilitate improvements in the sector where these are obviously desirable.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000037"></a>What can one say about the general economic crisis without a diatribe that might last a good several hours and strain the resources of the Committee? I am sure that all noble Lords present would participate in that debate with great alacrity and enthusiasm, but it might not be too appropriate to this measure. However, the noble Lord will appreciate that when we use the phrase &#147;current economic circumstances&#148;, we are careful about

The building society model has weathered this storm and enhanced its reputation. All well judged perspectives on the current economic situation would say that the mutuals are to be encouraged and facilitated, which this order does.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000039"></a>The order is being made under the Government Resources and Accounts Act 2000 and is intended to give the Comptroller and Auditor-General public audit responsibility for 26 non-departmental public body companies and non-departmental subsidiary companies. I am of course grateful for the assistance that we received from the National Audit Office, the various sponsor departments and indeed the companies themselves in preparing these provisions.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90225-gc0002.htm"/>


<a name="90225-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000040"></a>This is the first time that the Treasury will be using its powers in the Companies Act 2006 to enable the Comptroller and Auditor-General to audit non-departmental public body companies and non-departmental subsidiary companies. Members of the Committee may recall that, in 2003, the Government implemented key recommendations made by the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, on audit and accountability in central government. In particular, the Government responded to concerns expressed in Parliament by strengthening the statutory powers of the Comptroller and Auditor-General in two ways. First, they made him the statutory auditor of certain non-company NDPBs where he is not already the statutory auditor and, secondly, they gave him greater powers of access to documents held by bodies in receipt of grants or in relation to contracts with organisations of which he is the statutory auditor.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000041"></a>Since then, the Government have ensured that all non-company NDPBs are subject to the Comptroller and Auditor-General&#146;s audit, either through their establishing legislation or through orders under the Government Resources and Accounts Act. The Government also accepted the recommendation of the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, that company NDPBs  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC125"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column GC125</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>should be subject to the Comptroller and Auditor-General&#146;s audit. However, until recently, company law created obstacles to the Comptroller and Auditor-General auditing companies. Provisions in the Companies Act 2006 clear the way for him to do so with effect from the financial year 2008-09. Section 482 of the Companies Act allows non-profit-making companies to be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General under the Government Resources and Accounts Act instead of the normal discipline of statutory company audit.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000042"></a>To take advantage of the exemption, non-profit-making companies must have been designated in an order under the Government Resources and Accounts Act. The purpose of this order, therefore, is to make the companies listed in the Schedule subject to public audit. In order for a company to be included in the order, Section 482(2) of the Companies Act sets out a number of eligibility conditions. These are, first, that the company is non-profit making; secondly, that where the company is a parent company or a subsidiary of a parent company, every group undertaking is non-profit making; and, thirdly, that the balance sheet contains the statement required by Section 475(2) of the Companies Act 2006 that it is exempt from the requirements of Part 16 under Section 482 of the Act. All 26 companies in the order are limited by guarantee. Each has confirmed that it is non-profit making, is not part of a group that contains profit-making companies and is willing to include a statement in its balance sheet to that effect.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000043"></a>Let me say a few words about the position of profit-making NDPB companies. Sections 1226 to 1238 of the Companies Act 2006 create a supervisory regime for the Comptroller and Auditor-General that allows him to carry out statutory company audits. The intention is that he will do so for NDPBs that are profit-making companies or have profit-making subsidiaries. No further legislation is required to give effect to these arrangements since these companies will remain responsible for appointing their own auditors, which is why they do not need to come within the scope of this order. By making non-profit-making companies subject to public audit by the C&amp;AG, the Government are delivering the greater public accountability that the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, recommended for these types of company. I hope that the Committee will welcome that.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000044"></a>In conclusion, as regards the effect on the companies themselves, strictly speaking there was no need to carry out an impact assessment to accompany this order because the costs fall below the &#163;5 million threshold. However, the Government believe that NDPB companies are substantially similar to ordinary executive, non-company NDPBs and giving the C&amp;AG public audit responsibilities for NDPB companies constituted a step change in his responsibilities. It seemed sensible therefore to revisit the assumptions made in the regulatory impact assessment that accompanied the 2003 order, which gave the C&amp;AG audit responsibility for the first batch of, by pure coincidence, 26 non-company executive NDPBs following the Government&#146;s response to the report by the noble Lord, Lord Sharman. The Government thought that this would provide a useful template for the likely impact of the Comptroller and Attorney-General&#146;s audit of NDPB companies.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC126"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column GC126</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90225-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000045"></a>The impact assessment included a survey of the executive NDPBs covered by the 2003 GRAA order. The results of the survey showed that most NDPBs were happy with the C&amp;AG as their auditor. They believed that he provided a professional service and value for money. Also, C&amp;AG audit fees have generally been comparable with private audit firms, partly because many audits have been put out to tender. NDPBs advised the Government that putting audits out to tender enables the C&amp;AG to benefit from best private sector practice. In the Government&#146;s view, the results of the survey showed a positive view of the Comptroller and Auditor-General and his staff and the Government therefore have no hesitation in endorsing the policy that the C&amp;AG should be the auditor of all NDPBs.</p>

<p><a name="09022572000046"></a><b><a name="90225-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09022572000208"></a>Lord James of Blackheath:</b> I have a serious concern with this order, which has been with me since the first day I read it in the Merits Committee. It conflicts with my experience of an NDPB, the New Millennium Experience Company. That company was allowed to trade into an insolvent situation with the deliberate and proactive consent of the Permanent Secretary to the DCMS, who issued an indemnity to the directors of the NDPB to allow them to trade while insolvent. The Sharman report quite specifically said that a company might be non-profit making, but that it must abide by the Insolvency Act 1986. I do not see that message fortified here or any statement made which would preclude another gaffe like the one the Permanent Secretary to the DCMS made at that time. It is an outrageous situation that should not be left in any doubt.</p>

<p><a name="09022572000047"></a><b><a name="90225-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09022572000209"></a>Lord Howard of Rising:</b> I thank the Minister for introducing this order, which I was going to say is relatively uncontroversial. The wind has disappeared a little from my sails, not least because the extension of the Comptroller and Auditor-General&#146;s public audit responsibility was welcomed by the bodies involved.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000156"></a>I have one point: can the Minister confirm whether the change is voluntary? The order states that the &#147;Auditor-General shall audit&#148;, but there are a series of conditions that would make it quite easy to avoid that, if anyone wanted to.</p>

<p><a name="09022572000048"></a><b><a name="90225-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09022572000210"></a>Lord Razzall:</b> I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Howard of Rising, that, in itself, this order is non-controversial. Indeed, far be it from me to be critical of anything that implements the work of my noble friend Lord Sharman. What is controversial is the point touched upon by the noble Lord, Lord James, about what is not in this order. He raised the operation of the insolvency law with regard to non-profit-making companies that are effectively under government control, but I am sure that we could all think of companies that fall within these criteria that are not in the Schedule, particularly in view of the Minister&#146;s remark that where a company is effectively receiving funds from the taxpayer, it is advantageous for it to be audited in the way set out in this order.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000049"></a>On this topic, dare I raise the thorny issue of the BBC? I know it exercised my noble friend Lord Sharman when he was producing his recommendations. It would  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC127"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column GC127</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be fair to say that his wishes with regard to the BBC were not welcomed by it. I do not know whether the Government have any response to that.</p>

<p><a name="09022572000050"></a><b><a name="90225-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09022572000211"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I was delighted when I saw that the noble Lord, Lord James, was present because I thought it would impossible for us to proceed on these issues without the millennium edifice being part of our discussion. I am grateful for the point that he raised. I hope that I will answer it in a moment, after I collect my thoughts.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000051"></a>I thank the two Front Benchers for their general welcome. I confirm to the noble Lord, Lord Howard, that it is compulsory for the NDPBs to be subject to this audit. The noble Lord, Lord Razzall, raised wider issues and said how delighted he was by the point that the noble Lord, Lord James, made. If, by that, he is threatening me by saying that he would otherwise have made it, I shall be even more anxious when he arrives at these Committees than I have been in the past. The noble Lord raised a significant issue, and no one, certainly not me, is going to come close to the expertise of the noble Lord, Lord James, in regard to that development.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000052"></a>I emphasise that ordinary company and insolvency law is not affected by this order. It applies to the C&amp;AG audit only and is very limited in its scope. The noble Lord, Lord Razzall, asked me to follow up the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, and deal with anxieties about the BBC. On occasion, I spend part of my time dealing with anxieties about the BBC, but I had not anticipated it coming within the orbit of this order. The noble Lord will recognise that the particular constitutional structure and answerability of the BBC puts it outside the normal range of NDPBs. If it were not, he, I and all noble Lords would be very anxious about its independence and the role of the trust, the director-general and his staff in preserving it.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000053"></a>I shall have to look again at the anxieties of the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, on this, but quite a bit of water has gone under the bridge in terms of the governance of the BBC since he reported. I am wary of trading on my own ignorance, but I had the enormous pleasure of being involved in the Broadcasting Act, and I cannot remember this issue cropping up in that context. I do not think that there was anxiety in the House, and there was an extensive range of expertise available to us when we discussed the BBC. I see the noble Baroness, Lady Bonham-Carter, in her place, and she played her full part. I do not recall her referring to this dimension. I think that all that was dealt with in the charter review. The noble Lord will have to brush up on that some time and get someone to advise him on the matter. I emphasise that I do not think that the order gives rise to the anxieties that the noble Lord, Lord James, has voiced. Particularly if he lets me know in advance that he is going to raise an issue, I am always careful to let my officials know that we had better be primed to respond to him.</p>

They also extend the eligibility criteria for the additional government payment that is paid to the child trust fund accounts of children in lower-income families.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000057"></a>The child trust fund is a long-term savings and investment account and is an important part of the Government&#146;s savings strategy. It will ensure that every child, regardless of their background, has a financial asset at the age of 18. It will be used to help bring financial education to life as part of the &#147;My Money&#148; programme that is being rolled out in schools. It will bring financial education within the framework of the child&#146;s development, and it will help strengthen the financial capability of both children and adults while promoting positive attitudes towards saving.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000058"></a>All children born since 1 September 2002, who are the subject of a child benefit award, are eligible for the child trust fund, as long as they live in the UK and are not subject to immigration control. The Government provide an initial contribution of &#163;250, and children in lower-income families are entitled to a top-up contribution of a further &#163;250. Children are eligible for this additional payment if their families are entitled to the maximum child tax credit at the time when the child becomes eligible for the CTF. There are special arrangements in place to ensure that children in care, who may not be in a child benefit award, do not miss out on receiving a child trust fund account.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC129"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column GC129</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90225-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000059"></a>After a parent has been awarded child benefit, they are automatically sent a child trust fund voucher, which they can use to open the account of their choice. To date, around three-quarters of parents have used the voucher to open a child trust fund account for their child. However, no child eligible for a child trust fund account will miss out, because HMRC will open an account on behalf of the child if their parents have failed to do so. The Act allows the Treasury to make regulations that provide for further government payments to be made into the accounts of eligible children.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000060"></a>After extensive consultation, the Government published their detailed proposals for the child trust fund in October 2003. Those proposals included an announcement that the Government would make a top-up payment to each child&#146;s child trust fund account as they turn seven years old. The top-up was designed with two main purposes in mind: to increase the value of all children&#146;s accounts, so leaving them with a more substantial asset when they are 18; and to emphasise the child trust fund as a live and relevant example of saving and investment.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000061"></a>Following consultation in 2004 and 2005 on the details of these further payments, the Government announced in Budget 2006 that the age-seven payments would be &#163;250 for every child, with a further &#163;250 for children from lower-income families and children who are in care on their seventh birthday. Eligibility for the age-seven payments will follow similar criteria as for the initial contribution into the account. The universal payment will go to children who are in a child benefit award on their seventh birthday, who live in the UK and who are not subject to immigration controls. The additional payment for children from lower-income families will be paid if the child&#146;s family is entitled to the maximum award for child tax credit during the tax year in which the child&#146;s seventh birthday falls, and all children in care on their seventh birthday will get the universal payment plus an extra &#163;250.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000062"></a>HMRC will arrange for these further age-seven payments to be paid automatically into the child&#146;s account and will write to the child&#146;s family to inform them once the payment has been made. The cost to the Exchequer of making the age-seven payments will be around &#163;250 million per annum, making the total cost of the scheme &#163;510 million by 2012-13.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000063"></a>The draft regulations also amend the eligibility criteria for the additional government payment for children born in lower-income families. Representations were made last summer at the Treasury Select Committee when evidence on the child trust fund was given by the Economic Secretary to the Treasury. The concern was that some people may be missing out on an additional payment because eligibility is based on eligibility to the child tax credit and the rules require families to claim the child tax credit within, broadly, three months of the birth of the child. Mums with, for example, post-natal depression, might not get around to that in time.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000064"></a>We have listened to those concerns and will change the regulations to give individuals more time to qualify for the additional payment. Under the new rules, the   


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC130"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column GC130</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>additional payment will be due as long as a child tax credit claim is made before the CTF voucher expires. This new eligibility period will usually be just over a year from when the child is born. The additional payment will be made automatically by Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs and eligible parents will not have to do anything for their child to receive the additional money. This amendment will apply to children in respect of whom child benefit commenced on or after 6 April 2008.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000065"></a>The annual cost of administering the scheme is &#163;7.2 million, which works out at around &#163;1.80 per child with a child trust fund account. The calculator which can be found on the child trust fund website estimates that for a child born in 2008, who receives nothing other than two government contributions of &#163;500, the final value of the child trust fund account would range from &#163;1,600 to &#163;2,600. For a child born in the same year, but who receives two government contributions of &#163;250 and the maximum annual top-up payment of &#163;1,200 per year, the final value of the child trust fund account would range from &#163;29,000 to &#163;38,000. It is encouraging that, even at this early stage in the life of child trust funds, one in four children received extra contributions into their accounts and the average contribution made in 2007-08 was &#163;279.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000066"></a>In summary, these regulations will provide for a further government payment into the child trust fund account of all eligible children on reaching their seventh birthday and will also extend the period of eligibility for lower-income families to receive the additional payment. With these final values in mind, I fully believe that the benefits far outweigh the costs and that these regulations will help the child trust fund move towards meeting its objectives of ensuring that each child has a financial asset at the age of 18, helping each child to get into the habit of saving, understanding personal finance and teaching them about the benefits of saving. All of those issues mean that I commend these regulations to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="09022572000067"></a><b><a name="90225-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09022572000216"></a>Lord Howard of Rising:</b> I thank the Minister again for introducing the regulations, which have already been discussed in another place. This has led to rather more clarification of the costs and benefits than is contained in the explanatory documents.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000068"></a>Under this Government, personal savings have fallen significantly, possibly because of the example of the Government. The discipline of saving is not easy to instil, especially when the Government themselves make no attempt to avoid impossible levels of debt. Giving children a first-hand experience of the process and benefits of saving may go a little way towards repairing the damage caused by the Government&#146;s example of profligacy.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000069"></a>The debate of 9 February was useful in highlighting the costs and benefits of the scheme. An accurate understanding of how much long-term savings can build up over time is rare. If one accepts that there is a benefit from this scheme, giving children first-hand experience of the satisfaction of seeing a small initial deposit grow slowly but steadily into a significant amount would go some way towards helping them to appreciate the benefit of the principle of saving.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000070"></a>Other lessons may also be learnt; for example, that of the enormous effect that the interest rate can have on savings. It is currently fashionable for those on the government Benches to consider the effect of interest rates only on borrowers, ignoring the plight of pensioners and savers who have seen the return on their carefully stored money falling to nothing while knowing that the inflation that is sure to be coming will make future attacks on the value of their savings. That having been said, we will not oppose the regulations.</p>

<p><a name="09022572000071"></a><b><a name="90225-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09022572000217"></a>Lord Razzall:</b> We on this side of the Committee will certainly not oppose the regulations. Indeed, on the assumption that the Child Trust Funds Act and the child trust funds system remain in place, these are sensible amendments. The noble Lord, Lord Howard of Rising, indicated that there was an extensive debate in another place on this issue, on which we as a party part company from the Tory and Labour coalition. We have consistently taken the view that the best way to get resources into the hands of those from less advantaged backgrounds is not via the child trust fund. We would spend the same money&#151;we might even spend more&#151;in a different way. Notwithstanding the attempt of the noble Lord, Lord Howard, to demonstrate the normal Tory innumeracy on economic matters, this is not the appropriate place to continue that debate. I will just sit down and say that we support these regulations.</p>

<p><a name="09022572000072"></a><b><a name="90225-gc0002.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09022572000218"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> Temptation abounds; I have two invitations to engage in a major economic debate on the Government&#146;s savings strategy. I shall forswear that opportunity.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000073"></a>I heard what the noble Lord, Lord Howard, had to say. Of course, he takes many opportunities to be critical of the Government, and I suppose that this is one. However, his party supports the child trust fund and I know that he sees some, if not all, of the merits, of which I elaborated on four. He will agree with several of them, particularly those about increasing the propensity to save and the increase in financial literacy among young people. He will be four-square behind that. I assume that he wants to put this measure into the context of the dire economic situation using a different strategy: if, like the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, I can identify what that different strategy might be. It might be to lament the drop in interest rates. That is an interesting economic proposition.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000074"></a>I am politician. I understand the concern of the noble Lord, Lord Howard, about savers. Of course, we must be concerned about those on fixed incomes, as the Government are. That is, however, a little different from suggesting that the Government have somehow got their strategy wrong in the present economic circumstances, and that the Bank of England has misjudged the matter in thinking that the economy requires lower interest rates. If the British economy does not require lower interest rates, I wonder what he thinks is going on in the United States of America. We must not indulge in these opportunities. After all, my task is to get extremely benign regulations through. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000076"></a>As the regulations and the order deal with the various national insurance contribution rates and thresholds, it is sensible that we take them both together.

<a name="90225-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000077"></a>I will start with the Social Security (Contributions) (Amendment No. 2) Regulations 2009. After an exchange on one of the other orders earlier this afternoon in which there was a slight mistake leading to delay, I have to confess again that there are two minor typographical errors in the preamble to this instrument. Section 122(1) was inadvertently cited. Section 5(6) should have been cited, and the same is true for the Northern Ireland equivalents. These will of course be corrected when the instruments are made. I crave the indulgence of the Committee for those faults. I am also glad to have noted them at this stage and not to have them pointed out to me by the ever-vigilant noble Lord, Lord Howard.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000078"></a>In the 2007 Budget, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a package of reforms to modernise the tax and benefits system. Part of the package included changes to national insurance contributions to align the upper earnings limit with the level at which higher rate income tax becomes payable from 6 April 2009. The upper earnings limit is being increased from &#163;770 to &#163;844 per week to fulfil this commitment. These regulations also increase the class 1 lower earnings limit from &#163;90 to &#163;95 per week. The lower earnings limit is legislatively linked to the level of the basic state pension and is the level of earnings at which entitlement to contributory benefit begins.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000079"></a>Finally, the regulations increase the class 1 primary and secondary thresholds from &#163;105 to &#163;110 per week, which is broadly in line with prices. Earnings between the primary threshold and the upper earnings limit are liable to main rate employee contributions of 11 per cent. Earnings above the primary threshold are subject to the additional employee rate of 1 per cent. Employers pay contributions at 12.8 per cent on all earnings above the secondary threshold.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC133"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column GC133</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90225-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000080"></a>The Social Security (Contributions) (Re-Rating) Order 2009 sets the NIC rates and thresholds for the self-employed and for those paying voluntary contributions. For the self-employed, it raises the small earnings exception below which the self-employed may claim exemption from paying class 2 contributions. That will rise in April from &#163;4,825 to &#163;5,075 a year, an increase broadly in line with prices. Many people choose to pay these contributions to protect their benefit entitlement. The rate of class 2 contributions for 2009-10 will rise from &#163;2.30 to &#163;2.40 a week, which again is an increase broadly in line with prices.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000081"></a>Also for the self-employed, the draft order sets the profits limits between which main rate class 4 contributions are paid. The lower limit, at which class 4 contributions become due, will increase broadly in line with inflation from &#163;5,435 to &#163;5,715 a year. The upper profits limit will increase to &#163;43,875 for the 2009-10 tax year. This ensures that the self-employed pay main rate class 4 contributions on much the same range of earnings as employees who are liable to class 1 contributions, and is an essential element in making the national insurance system fair for everyone.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000082"></a>The draft order also deals with the weekly rate of voluntary class 3 contributions, which help those with insufficient contribution records in any given tax year to make up a qualifying year for benefit purposes. The rate of class 3 will increase from &#163;8.10 a week to &#163;12.05 a week from April. This is an above-inflation increase and is a consequence of changes made in the Pensions Act 2008 to allow contributors who met certain conditions to pay class 3 contributions outside the existing time limits to improve their basic state pensions. It was made clear when the amendment was introduced that this measure was to be overall cost neutral and that the weekly class 3 contribution rate would therefore be increased accordingly.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000083"></a>The review of contribution rates is accompanied by a report from the Government Actuary detailing the effects of the draft order and regulations, and the draft order uprating benefits laid by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions on the National Insurance Fund. I am pleased to say that there is no expectation that the fund will need a Treasury grant for the 2009-10 tax year.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000084"></a>Northern Ireland has a separate national insurance scheme from Great Britain, but the two schemes are closely co-ordinated and maintain parity of contribution rates. The draft order and regulations therefore cover Great Britain and Northern Ireland. I commend the draft Social Security (Contributions) (Amendment No. 2) Regulations 2009 to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="09022572000085"></a><b><a name="90225-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09022572000221"></a>Lord Howard of Rising:</b> Again, I thank the Minister for tabling these statutory instruments. An interesting part of these amendments is the increase in the level of class 3 voluntary NICs as a result of the victory of the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, during the passage of the Pensions Act 2008. As my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale said then, as welcome as the increased flexibility will no doubt be to those who find it difficult to make up the minimum contributions necessary for a full state pension, contributors will be paying for it. The timing  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC134"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column GC134</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the increase is also unfortunate. At a time when unemployment is rising, the Government are increasing the cost of employment.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000086"></a>In carrying out his work, the Government Actuary, Mr Trevor Llanwarne, used an earnings growth figure of 3.2 per cent for 2009-10. The Treasury has forecast 2.7 per cent growth for the same year. Both forecasts are thought to be wildly optimistic by most commentators. How would more pessimistic assumptions affect the calculations?</p>

<a name="90225-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000087"></a>Similarly, unemployment levels have also changed since the Pre-Budget Report. These will affect the use of the fund. Will the Minister comment on whether the surpluses in the fund will be sufficient to cope with these dramatic variables? The surplus is currently used to subsidise the National Health Service and other government spending. Would using the surplus to fill the gaps that I have identified have such a significant impact on government revenues that there could be other consequences, such as a tax increase?</p>

<p><a name="09022572000088"></a><b><a name="90225-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09022572000222"></a>Baroness Thomas of Winchester:</b> I seem to have drawn the short straw among my colleagues for participating in this annual ritual to approve these two social security orders. In preparation, I had the pleasure of reading the Government Actuary&#146;s report for the first time. It is an impressive document, if largely incomprehensible to an amateur in the field such as me. As we have heard, the good news is that the balance in the National Insurance Fund is in surplus, is well over the recommended one-sixth of annual benefit expenditure, and will therefore need no Treasury grant this year. However, are the assumptions made about unemployment and benefit payments on track, or does the Minister think that they are far too optimistic?</p>

<a name="90225-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000089"></a>The Government in general seem to be surprised at the speed at which the country has hurtled into deep recession. I see that the Actuary has used the same assumptions of employment and unemployment levels as the Treasury did in the Pre-Budget Report on 24 November last year, and that worries me. After all, the Chancellor predicted growth in the second half of this year, but this has now been revised downwards. It was also predicted that the economy would contract by between 0.75 per cent and 1.25 per cent, but this was also wildly optimistic; I use the same phrase as the noble Lord, Lord Howard of Rising. What are we to make of the assumptions in the report now? Perhaps the Minister would enlighten us.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000090"></a>The actual upratings are, of course, welcome. But no one should think that the benefit system is generous, as many people are now finding out who may have paid contributions for many years and who may now feel cheated that the jobseeker&#146;s allowance is so low. There are several groups about whom we should be greatly concerned. The first is pensioners who do not take up their entitlement not just to pension credit, but also to housing benefit and council tax benefit. This group has grown in the past 10 years, according to the Rowntree report <I>Monitoring </I><I>P</I><I>overty and </I><I>S</I><I>ocial </I><I>E</I><I>xclusion</I>. In fact, pensioners are being hit from all directions at the moment, because those with modest savings are finding that their income has plummeted due to very low interest rates. The Government should redouble  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC135"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column GC135</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>their efforts to make sure that pensioners who need it at least receive pension credit rather than go hungry and cold, which is almost certainly happening at the moment.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000091"></a>The second group is working-age adults in low-income working families. This group is set to rise, with only low-income jobs available in many areas. The third group concerns the number of children in working families needing tax credits to avoid low income. The Rowntree report states that this increasing need for tax credits is the key to why the Government have missed their child poverty targets.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000092"></a>Another alarming statistic is that the proportion of all low-income households paying full council tax has risen by a third over the past 10 years to 60 per cent; so much for the popular view that the country is full of benefit scroungers. In parenthesis, it is worth noting that the authors of the Rowntree report say that, as far as child poverty is concerned, the much-repeated mantra of work being the best route out of poverty is not necessarily the case. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09022572000161"></a>&#147;Rather, there needs to be an understanding of the problems that work can cause as well as the benefits that it provides&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09022572000157"></a>Amen to that, I say.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000093"></a>It is perhaps unfair for me to ask the Minister a couple of questions, as he is not the Minister who deals with social security benefits. However, I shall not be deterred. No debate about benefits should fail to ask where the benefit simplification project now stands. There is no doubt that many millions of pounds in benefits are not being claimed because of confusion about entitlements and complex application processes.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000094"></a>Finally, there is worrying evidence that some new benefit claimants, such as lone parents looking for work, are having difficulty in accessing crisis loans from the Social Fund, such is the burden on Jobcentre Plus offices at the moment. Is the Minister confident that enough trained staff are in place at these vital offices who understand the system that they are trying to administer?</p>

<p><a name="09022572000095"></a><b><a name="90225-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09022572000223"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am grateful to both noble Lords who have spoken. As the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, was kind enough to indicate, I do not normally respond for the Government on these complex and challenging issues. It will become evident to the Committee that I have an obviously limited ability to deal with some of the very detailed issues. I want to deal with the more general issues first, if I may, if only to respond to the broad challenges.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000096"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howard, predictably identified that the current economic crisis is having a deleterious effect on public finances, on the estimates of growth in the economy and on the consequences for government expenditure. I think that the Committee is well aware of the attendant difficulties, and the noble Lord is right that the assumptions about growth that were made in the Government Actuary&#146;s report were based on all the information and experience at the time, which were linked to the PBR in 2008.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000097"></a>The GAD report recognised that assumptions are not necessarily borne out in practice. Indeed, section 8 of the report allows for divergences from the assumptions  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC136"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column GC136</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that have been made. The noble Lord, Lord Howard, is well aware that divergences will inevitably occur. He does not have too long to wait before the next Budget from my right honourable friend the Chancellor, when the figures for growth will take account of the changed circumstances. It might help the noble Lord to know that, if earnings decrease by 1 per cent over 2008-09, there will be a reduction in receipts of &#163;2.48 billion&#151;an illustrative figure of the difficulties that attend the seriousness of the situation that we all face.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000098"></a>I therefore cannot make assumptions at this point about my right honourable friend&#146;s Budget by telling the noble Lord, Lord Howard, what the effects on health and education will be if the surplus is eroded by the loss of resources that are needed to sustain it at its predicted level. He will have to bide his time. After all, he is a patient man, and he has to wait only a matter of weeks for the Budget, when all will be revealed. He will be able to develop his perspective on what is good for the nation at that time. I have no doubt that a very high percentage of what is good for the nation will be criticism of the Government rather than an effective alternative, but we will wait and see. I will not prejudge the noble Lord on that, and I look forward to the debates that we will have at that time.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000099"></a>I am concerned about the issues which the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, has introduced to the debate. She may well have been in the House this afternoon when the Government were being berated for the amount of money that was being spent by government quangos on communication. She identifies absolutely clearly that new people are becoming unemployed or dependent on benefits for the first time. They need information, which someone must provide. That is a cost on a communication budget. Inevitably, therefore, I am a little loath to take criticism of government expenditure. I fully appreciate her point about effective communication on entitlement, which is very important. Only the other day, the Government emphasised the extent to which we were directing ourselves to ensuring that families and individuals who are entitled to benefits should have effective communication on those matters. I accept the point that the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, made in detail about low-income families. She mentioned costs, and she will know that certain costs are decreasing.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000100"></a>I have to take the jibes of the noble Lord, Lord Howard, about the return on investments. That is, of course, an issue for many people on fixed incomes. By the same token, however, inflation is plummeting in certain crucial areas, some of them absolutely critical to the very categories of people that we are addressing.

I understand her anxieties on these points. We will have to return to them. They are part of the general issues of necessary expenditure

In some cases, that means the service being provided by a third party. The three existing contracting-out orders covering highways functions allow authorities to delegate the listed statutory functions to a third-party operator. We now propose to build on this by including more functions, mainly related to street works, in this new order. At the same time, we are consolidating all the highway functions that can be contracted out into this new order.</p>

<p><a name="09022572000104"></a>It is important that authorities manage any contracts placed effectively so that they achieve best value and deliver an effective service.

The utility companies have been vociferous in their lobbying of the House of Lords and the Government to achieve advantage for themselves over other users of the highway. I am concerned to know that the arrangements here have been properly discussed with other users of the highway, such as bus users, whose journeys to work are considerably lengthened by the roadworks undertaken under the highway functions. How much consultation have the Government done with other road users? Have they listened entirely to the views of the contracting industry? What pressure has been brought on the utility companies to work on the parts of the road that they are using? For example, I was in Hereford last weekend, and on Friday, a large part of the ring road was cordoned off for some highway purpose. It was causing enormous traffic congestion, but at 11 o&#146;clock in the morning, there was no sign of any activity within the cordoned-off area. How much urgency do the Government attach to getting work done and to making sure that the statutory undertakers have assembled all the equipment needed to carry out the works before the highway is disturbed, and that they work long hours to make the highway good again for the benefit of road users?</p>

<a name="90225-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000107"></a>Contracting out these responsibilities to contractors who may be digging up roads seems to be asking the poacher to be the gamekeeper. I would like to know that the utmost vigour is exercised by local authorities, which have highway management powers, to ensure that works are carried out in the most expeditious fashion. I took the trouble to speak to some bus companies, and I can assure the Minister that certain works are carried out in a most inefficient way, involving lots of sets of traffic lights, huge traffic congestion and complete disruption of public services. I will be grateful for his reply.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000110"></a>This is a modest consolidating order. It takes vast chunks of activity that are already contracted out and puts them together. The number of additional powers it introduces is quite small. The essence of the order is our view about the relationship between government and local government. Ultimately, we give powers to local government, whose responsibility it is to discharge them effectively. The order does not require local government to contract out these services. But it is a permissive order: if in the interest of value for money local authorities wish to contract out these services, they may. They are accountable to the electorate to discharge these services in an appropriate way. I cannot believe that they would get into the poacher/gamekeeper situation. Indeed, if there were any area of squeal in this order, it would come from utilities concerned

Will he tell us whether any redress is available, either to bus companies or to residents, other than complaint to their local authority? It seems to me that a local authority strapped for cash is probably likely to let everybody suffer. We know the utilities are often irresponsible in declaring an emergency to gain access to the highway. I am sure that these emergencies are not always what they are declared to be.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000114"></a>The purpose of this order is to prescribe the amount of financial deposit that can be requested from an alleged offender by the police or by an examiner from the Department for Transport&#146;s Vehicle and Operator Services Agency in respect of a fixed penalty offence or an intended court prosecution.</p>

For brevity, I shall call this group of alleged offenders &#147;non-UK-resident offenders&#148;, although the scheme will apply to those who are resident in the UK but who do not have a satisfactory address, such as those offenders who do not have a fixed address.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90225-gc0004.htm"/>


<a name="90225-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000116"></a>The point is that UK-resident road traffic offenders are already liable to receive a fixed penalty, or, in Scotland, a conditional offer, or face court prosecution in respect of a road traffic offence. If they fail to pay the fixed penalty or a court-imposed fine, enforcement action can be, and is, taken against them. The same is not currently true in respect of non-UK-resident offenders, because there is no mechanism for enforcing the payment of fixed penalties or court fines outside the UK. However, in future there will be because once all the relevant provisions of the Road Safety Act are in force and implemented, the enforcement agencies will already have collected the appropriate amount as a deposit, in advance.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000117"></a>Although the principle of collecting payments at the roadside in respect of road traffic offences is novel in Britain, it has been in place elsewhere throughout Europe for many years. Its implementation in Britain will increase the effectiveness of our enforcement policy. To tackle the high levels of non-compliance, we have provided VOSA with an extra &#163;24 million over the next three years to help it to boost further the levels of roadside enforcement activity. This extra expenditure, together with the order, will not only give VOSA an increased capability to detect offences, but an effective means of penalising all those so detected, whether resident in the UK or not.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000118"></a>The fixed penalty offences in respect of which deposits can be requested are set out in the schedules to the order. A complete list of the offences to which the scheme applies, which includes the majority of road traffic offences that are subject to summary court proceedings, is set out in the related statutory instruments. The details of the circumstances in which a financial penalty deposit can be requested and the details of how such a deposit is subsequently to be processed are also set out in those instruments.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000119"></a>The order says that, in the case of an offence for which the offender has been given a fixed penalty notice or, in Scotland, a conditional offer, the deposit amount that can be requested is the same as the level of the relevant fixed penalty, which may be &#163;30, &#163;60, &#163;120 or &#163;200. In the case of an offence that is to be prosecuted in court, the prescribed deposit amount is &#163;300.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000120"></a>The way in which the scheme works in respect of fixed penalties and conditional offers is that, at the end of the 28-day period, if the non-UK-resident offender has not elected to have a court hearing in respect of the fixed penalty or conditional offer, the deposit is converted into payment of the fixed penalty. If a court hearing is elected in respect of the fixed penalty or conditional offer, the deposit will continue to be held until the outcome of the proceedings.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000121"></a>In circumstances where a case is taken to court, the financial penalty deposit will be used in payment of any court fine, leaving any balance to be refunded to

If the alleged offender is acquitted or not prosecuted within 12 months, or convicted but not fined, the deposit is refunded.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000122"></a>The purpose of prescribing the appropriate amounts is to put the non-UK-resident offender in the same effective position as a UK-resident offender. In summary, the net effect of this order is to ensure that non-UK-resident offenders end up paying fixed penalties and court fines in respect of road traffic offences. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09022572000123"></a><b><a name="90225-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09022572000235"></a>Earl Attlee:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation of the order. The order has been rather long in gestation since the Road Traffic Act was passed, but this is a new departure for the UK, although not for Europe, as explained by the Minister. It is really aimed at foreign lorry drivers, who have been particularly difficult to deal with. The order gives rise to several questions. I fully appreciate that there are several negative orders behind this order, which give all the detail.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000124"></a>What if the person who cannot give a reliable UK address has no money or means of paying a deposit and his vehicle has had to be removed, probably as part of a statutory removal process and as a result of an accident? It is no good immobilising his vehicle, because it has already been taken away, and it may be of very limited or even negative value, after the cost of recovery has been taken into consideration. The offence may be relatively minor and may not warrant custody. How will VOSA officials or the police persuade the driver to part with the deposit in those circumstances?</p>

<a name="90225-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000125"></a>Almost by definition, Travellers often cannot provide a satisfactory UK address. I take it that they will be vulnerable to pay any deposit, because otherwise the order would be discriminatory against foreign drivers. What is to stop Travellers being required to pay a deposit several times in one day, once in each county through which they pass, as part of a process of victimisation?</p>

<a name="90225-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000126"></a>Will it be possible to pay the deposit by credit card, or, if the mobile technology for paying by credit card is not available, to be accompanied by an official to an automatic teller machine to draw some cash&#151;the driver may have plenty of money on his credit card but not the required amount of money in cash&#151;or will the vehicle be immediately immobilised if the driver does not have the cash, which is a bit harsh? How will it work in practice?</p>

<a name="90225-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000127"></a>How will a driver demonstrate a satisfactory UK address? Does he need to have something in writing, such as a driving licence or a utility bill, or will it be enough to convince the officials that he has a UK address, perhaps by knowing the registered address of the keeper of the vehicle and when he acquired the vehicle?</p>

<a name="90225-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000128"></a>I note that the maximum cumulative amount of the financial deposit is &#163;900. It is obviously sensible to have some limit, but how does this provision compare with the arrangements in other EU countries? I thought that the on-the-spot fines in the rest of Europe were considerably higher.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000129"></a>Touch wood, but I have never had any penalty points on my licence; I have been careful to avoid them. To me, they are a significant deterrent, especially with a totting-up procedure that could lead to the loss  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC142"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column GC142</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of my driving licence. However, my fear is that a foreign driver&#146;s licence will not be endorsable or at risk under these procedures, so it will not be a particularly effective deterrent. The deposits will be seen simply as a cost of operation in the UK.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000130"></a>My most serious concern is the apparently very low level of deposits. If I drive in a bus lane in London, apparently I will pick up a penalty of &#163;120 for what might be a momentary error or misjudgment. It certainly would not be a safety issue; it would simply be a bit anti-social to drive in a bus lane. I do not support doing so, but it is a minor matter. Yet it still picks up a &#163;120 fixed penalty. If, for example, a foreign lorry driver uses a vehicle that is in a dangerous condition, contrary to Section 40A of the Road Traffic Act 1988, the deposit required is only &#163;60. However, if a UK lorry driver is convicted of that offence or pays a fixed penalty twice in a given period, he will lose his licence under the Road Safety Act. In short, a UK driver will pick up an endorsement and a fine or fixed penalty, while a foreign driver will have to pay only the deposit, which might be turned into a fixed penalty.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000131"></a>If the matter is too serious to be dealt with by fixed penalty and has to go to court, the deposit is set at &#163;300, as the Minister explained. The Explanatory Notes say that that amount has been determined by looking at the average fines imposed by the courts. However, this is seriously flawed. A large proportion of UK road traffic offenders are very young and of limited means. That depresses the level of the average fine imposed. The lorry driver must by law be over 21, and is probably over 25. The operator may be responsible for the offence rather than the driver, but legally the driver must have considerable financial resources to be able to operate the goods vehicle. Will the Minister say what is the average fine levied on a UK goods vehicle operator in respect of his vehicle operations? If he does not know, perhaps he will write to me because this is probably a bit of a surprise question. I suspect that the average fine imposed is considerably more than &#163;300. I welcome the order as a first step to solving a tricky problem, but we need to monitor the effect closely, and I look forward to the post-implementation review mentioned in the Explanatory Notes at paragraph 12.2.</p>

<p><a name="09022572000132"></a><b><a name="90225-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09022572000236"></a>Lord Bradshaw:</b> We, too, welcome this long overdue system of equalising the penalties faced by foreign lorry drivers. I take what the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, has said, but this is aimed mainly at HGV drivers who have been using our roads free of charge and then flout the law. Through Questions asked by my noble friend Lord Roberts of Llandudno, I have established that in north Wales many thousands of lorries flout these regulations each year. It is not a trivial problem. It goes to the heart of fair competition and is very unsafe. The Minister may recall that a Portuguese lorry driver was sent to prison two weeks ago&#151;not for long enough, I believe&#151;because his lorry ran into the back of a car carrying a family of six, including four children. That is the sort of unsafe behaviour we are trying to deal with here.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000133"></a>Many of my questions have already been asked by the noble Earl, Lord Attlee. Under the new order, the quoted fines in courts are too low for the reason given  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC143"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column GC143</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by the noble Earl. I am talking about fines imposed on lorry drivers, not fines imposed on motorists who have done something fairly trivial in towns. I believe that the penalties have to be proportionate. Perhaps the Minister will reflect on the fact that if a lorry is unavailable for a day&#146;s work as a result of being immobilised, the penalty to the owner and/or the driver will be far more significant than any fine that might be imposed. Several hundred pounds of revenue will be lost each day the lorry is off the road.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000134"></a>How will the fine be paid? It has to be paid, otherwise the system will fall into disrepute. How are people who consistently and flagrantly breach the law to be dealt with? If the Minister goes back through Questions I have asked, he will find that some Irish drivers have been stopped, fined and prohibited as many as 10 times in a year. I would like to think that if the offence for which we are prosecuting people is repeated, there is a mechanism by which the gravity of the offence might be taken into account. We can dwell on the niceties of affecting the haulier or the driver, but people are being killed and seriously injured as a result of the fact that these regulations have not yet been introduced.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000135"></a>Finally, I turn to mobilisation, a nice term that I presume means clamping. There is talk about a fee for clamping, but there is no talk about a fee for unclamping. An officer might have to travel some distance, perhaps at night, at the expiry of the period of rest that the driver has to take, when the driver has adjusted his load or when he has put the mechanism defect right. I believe that the penalty for release should at least reflect in full the costs associated with the offence.</p>

We have a pretty unsatisfactory situation; this is a good first step compared with where we are; and we intend to learn. The &#163;300 is an average and it may well suffer from the defects pointed out by noble Lords. The commitment to a post-implementation review will, we hope, address that. We are getting there; we are starting to do something; and starting to learn.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000137"></a>We have the problem of what to do about multiple offences by foreign drivers. These measures do not, as I understand them&#151;I shall write to noble Lords on this&#151;increase the powers to address multiple offences. The effect of the relevant provisions of the Road Safety Act is to enable a record of those penalty points to be created so that we can start to build up a picture of multiple offences by foreign drivers. We will use that to enable further consideration of the development of this policy in the future. We are alive to the multiple offence point, but I accept that these instruments do not address the point directly.</p>

<p><a name="09022572000138"></a><b><a name="90225-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09022572000238"></a>Lord Bradshaw:</b> Bearing in mind that someone will not receive any penalty points because he is a foreigner and the fact that the Irish road safety authority does not do anything about it, despite staff having been seconded to that authority, what confidence can we have that that will be effective?</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC144"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column GC144</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09022572000139"></a><b><a name="90225-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09022572000239"></a>Lord Tunnicliffe:</b> The noble Lord is asking for a perfect system. I have already admitted that we do not have a perfect system. We are talking about getting this off the ground. We will continue to report offences to member states in which the vehicle originates. In addition, if a foreign lorry driver accumulates more than 12 penalty points in the UK, his UK driving record will show that and he will no longer be able to drive in the UK. We have a system, but I do not know how many people it catches. I believe we are going down the road that you desire.</p>

<p><a name="09022572000140"></a><b><a name="90225-gc0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09022572000240"></a>Earl Attlee:</b> The Minister said something very interesting about recording the penalty points imposed on a foreign lorry driver. To an extent, it deals with some of my concerns and those of the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw. Where will that information be recorded? Will it be recorded by the DVLA?</p>

<p><a name="09022572000141"></a><b><a name="90225-gc0004.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09022572000241"></a>Lord Tunnicliffe:</b> The answer is the DVLA database. We are making progress. To develop the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, the serious offences issue is significant. Clearly, if the offence is extraditable&#151;I believe that is where there is a penalty of more than one year&#146;s imprisonment&#151;the police can take those powers. If the offence is such that an individual is taken into custody, some powers are available. Nevertheless, it is an area where we shall have to continue to develop policy. We take the point.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000142"></a>The important point is that many of the offences we are talking of do not allow the vehicle to move. The real impact on this is the powers under this set of instruments which allow the immobilisation of the vehicle. If it is overloaded or unroadworthy or the driver has worked excess hours prohibiting further movement, there may be some discretion exercised to move the vehicle to a safer place. That aside, it will be immobilised until the issue is remedied. That is pretty serious stuff for an operator, as has been said. That will hit not only the driver, but also the capability. I believe we have made some progress there. The fee prescribed for the removal of an immobilisation device is set at &#163;80. That level has been set following consultation with the police through ACPO.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000143"></a>I am sorry that it has taken so long to respond to the points raised by the noble Earl, Lord Attlee. I have spoken to officials on the point, which is complex. There has been a great deal of consultation and I have been convinced that it needed this amount of time. They felt that it was important to get right the technology that sits behind the systems and the agencies. They made a convincing case for the time and the consultation.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000144"></a>Travellers clearly would come under these rules. One should remember that the provisions are mostly about vehicles being fit to be driven and about loads and so on. They are the sort of offences in which, when detected, the vehicle cannot be moved, so the vehicle cannot go anywhere to pick up multiple offences. Not only does the deposit have to be paid before the vehicle can be moved, but the offence must be remedied in some form or other.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000145"></a>I have a wonderfully elaborate set of words here on the methods of payment. What it really boils down to is that you can use cash or credit cards. VOSA people  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC145"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column GC145</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will be looking for a chip and pin approach. Other bodies, as they extend, will develop systems. There is a clear intention to make this a practical piece of legislation.</p>

<p><a name="09022572000146"></a><b><a name="90225-gc0004.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09022572000242"></a>Earl Attlee:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. This is an important point. We are not too worried about foreign lorry drivers. Can the Minister assure me that a motorist will not have his vehicle clamped and immobilised if he has a credit card that works? Will the motorist be taken from where the vehicle is, go with the official to a cash point, draw some money out and then pay the fixed penalty? We do not want a motorist to find himself clamped and have his vehicle immobilised, with all the attendant inconvenience, simply because he does not have the required amount of cash in his pocket, when he can go to a cash machine with his credit card and the official and draw the appropriate amount of money out of the cash machine.</p>

<p><a name="09022572000147"></a><b><a name="90225-gc0004.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09022572000243"></a>Lord Tunnicliffe:</b> I understand that, given the way in which the instrument is drafted, it would be up to the officer on the spot to make that judgment. We do not want this to be a silly system. Therefore, we will be encouraging agencies to make considered and sensible decisions about that sort of thing. If it is reasonably practical, the trick is that they will be able to say, &#147;Yes, we will take your card&#148;, or whatever. I always back away from making absolute assurances because there is bound to be a case somewhere where it does not work. We are trying to make this a workable system.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000148"></a>On the point about a vehicle that crashes and so on, that really will be at the discretion of the police. The  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC146"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column GC146</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>first objective in those circumstances is to make the road safe and to move the vehicle as required. The noble Lord is right; if the vehicle is a write-off, we are beyond the scheme and people once again will be trying to do what the most practical thing.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000149"></a>We believe that the &#163;900 is roughly comparable with overseas schemes. Once again, this is very much the first stage and we want to see how it works. I have touched on penalty points for foreign licences. We are sensitive to this, but we can only do so much.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000150"></a>A point was made about whether a &#163;30 fixed penalty is properly comparable with a bus-lane fine of &#163;120. I am very pleased that the noble Lord offends on neither base. I seek to offend on neither base as well. However, these instruments do not address that particular balance, so I can go no further on that.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000151"></a>The most powerful point is nothing to do with the order. It is clear that if a vehicle is in a dangerous condition, is loading or the driver is fatigued, which are the key things that we worry about with these people, the vehicle will not be able to operate until the issue is remedied. That will be a powerful, positive factor in improving road safety in the United Kingdom and addressing some people&#146;s real fear that some foreign operators flagrantly flout the law. There are quite a lot of devices to stop that.</p>

<a name="90225-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09022572000152"></a>I am delighted that both noble Lords welcome the order in principle. There will be a review after we have experience of its implementation.</p>

<p><a name="09022572000158"></a><I>Motion agreed</I><I>.</I></p>

<p><a name="09022572000159"></a><I>Committee adjourned at 5.41 pm</I>.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="09022579000003"></a><b><a name="90225-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09022579000037"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Baroness Taylor of Bolton):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Bob Ainsworth) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90225-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="09022579000004"></a>My right honourable friend the then Secretary of State for Defence&#146;s Statement on 16 June 2008 (<I>Official Report</I> col. 677-678) referred to the decision to withdraw the Harrier force and replace it with an equivalent force of Tornado GR4s by spring 2009 to Kandahar airfield.  Delays in construction of the necessary supporting infrastructure and our current estimate of the time required to complete the Tornado urgent operational requirement (UOR) enhancements mean that the Tornado GR4s will now deploy in summer 2009.  We expect delivery of the UORs in advance of completion of the infrastructure project and will keep both programmes under constant review to ensure completion as quickly as possible.  In the interim, joint force Harrier will continue to contribute to the provision of close air support to UK and Allied Forces in southern Afghanistan; 1 (Fighter) Squadron will therefore replace IV (Army Co-operation) Squadron in mid-April.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="09022579000008"></a><b><a name="90225-wms0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="09022579000039"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Bach):</b> The Justice and Home Affairs Council is due to be held on 26 and 27 February 2009 in Brussels. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary (Jacqui Smith), the Scottish Solicitor General (Frank Mulholland) and I, intend to attend on behalf of the United Kingdom. As the provisional agenda stands, the following items will be discussed.</p>

<a name="90225-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="09022579000009"></a>During the mixed committee with Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Lichtenstein, Ministers will be asked to adopt council conclusions on the second generation of the Schengen information system.  These reflect discussions at the informal Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council in January on action required  


<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS22"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column WS22</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in light of an analysis which identified problems with the central system. The conclusions set a direction for the central SISII project, and include a set of criteria against which the SISII-based scenario and the alternative scenario, based on a SIS I platform, will be assessed.  They call for a decision regarding the future of the project to be taken by June 2009 at the latest.</p>

<a name="90225-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="09022579000010"></a>The presidency will present to the mixed committee the current state of play on the implementation of regulation establishing the visa information system (VIS).  The UK does not participate in the VIS.  The presidency will also report on the outcome of the Swiss air borders evaluation which took place on 9 to 13 February. Provided that the air borders evaluation does not throw up any shortcomings and is fully compliant with the Schengen acquis, Switzerland will be able to abolish checks on persons at its air borders on 29 March 2009.</p>

<a name="90225-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="09022579000011"></a>The council will then exchange initial views on a new proposal from the Commission for a regulation establishing a European asylum support office. The aim of the office will be to co-ordinate practical co-operation on asylum between member states.  The UK will have three months to decide whether to opt-in to this proposal. </p>

<a name="90225-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="09022579000012"></a>The presidency will present the recent report by the Commission on the implementation of the Free Movement Directive (2004/38/EC) by all member states. The UK strongly supports correct implementation of free movement rights and also welcomes the Commission&#146;s undertaking to provide effective guidelines on abuse of free movement.</p>

<a name="90225-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="09022579000013"></a>The council will discuss key issues around combating illegal immigration in the Mediterranean. This arises out of migration pact discussions.  Four countries are calling for greater EU support in managing illegal migration flows through this region. The Government recognise the significance of these flows and support strong EU co-operation on this issue.</p>

<a name="90225-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="09022579000014"></a>The council will discuss the situation of Iraqi refugees informed by council conclusions agreed on 27 and 28 November. The UK has already committed to resettling 1,000 Iraqi refugees during 2008-10 (financial years) and does not have capacity to include additional spaces. This has been communicated to the council. The UK will encourage other EU member states to set up their own resettlement programmes and will offer technical support based on our longstanding experience.</p>

<a name="90225-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="09022579000015"></a>The council will have a discussion over lunch on the appointment of the new Europol director. The United Kingdom will push for adoption of the unanimous recommendation of the Europol Management Board that the UK candidate was the most suitable for appointment.</p>

<a name="90225-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="09022579000016"></a>The presidency will seek a steer from the council on various aspects of the proposed framework decision in conflicts of jurisdiction in criminal matters. The proposal sets out a mechanism at Union level to prevent potential conflicts of jurisdiction in criminal proceedings and determine the most appropriate jurisdiction in cases where more than one member state could potentially exercise jurisdiction over the same case.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="2" year="2009" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS23"></a><b>25 Feb 2009 : Column WS23</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90225-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="09022579000017"></a>The presidency will ask the council to adopt a negotiating mandate for a mutual legal assistance agreement between the EU and Japan. The Government are happy with the mandate in its current format. A key priority for the UK is to ensure the inclusion of videoconferencing to give testimony.</p>

<a name="90225-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="09022579000018"></a>The presidency will update the council about the implementation of the European e-justice action plan, which was approved by the council in November 2008. The Government welcome the presidency&#146;s commitment to the e-justice action plan and support the development of a more detailed roadmap to ensure proper implementation of projects such as the e-justice portal and videoconferencing.</p>

<a name="90225-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="09022579000019"></a>Under any other business, the council will discuss any potential role of the EU in the closure of Guantanamo while the Commission will present an outline of a report by Judge Jean-Louis Bruguière on the processing of member states&#146; personal data by the US (Treasury Department) for counterterrorism purposes.  The council will also have a discussion on the EU anti-drug policy, originally planned for the informal JHA Council in January.  This will enable the UK to emphasise the continued necessity of EU action in tackling cocaine trafficking through West Africa.  Greece is expected to highlight the third Global Forum on Migration and Development taking place in early November in Athens. The chosen overall theme is integrating migration policies in development strategies for the benefit of all. The UK is (as in previous years) a member of the Steering Group for the Athens Forum and will in that capacity help oversee and shape preparations. </p>

<a name="90225-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="09022579000020"></a>The presidency is expected to inform the council on the state of play of the negotiations with the European Parliament on the proposal for an amending directive on ship-source pollution and on the introduction of penalties for infringements. The UK supports the directive and is keen to see a successful passage in the European Parliament. Germany will provide information on the International Tribunal for Law of the Sea based in Hamburg. Finally, Sweden is expected to raise the issue of transparency as a tool for strengthening citizens&#146; trust in the European institutions.</p>

<a name="09022579000028"></a><b><a name="90225-wms0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09022579000041"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Andy Burnham) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90225-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="09022579000029"></a>I am pleased to be able to announce to the House the creation of a unique fundraising partnership for elite sport. The partnership brings together, for the first time ever, UK Sport, the British Olympic Association and the British Paralympic Association to raise funds for elite sport, along with the London Organising Committee of the London Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG). All the partners have today agreed a formal heads of agreement to pool their collective rights to help raise additional funds for elite sport in the run-up to London 2012 and beyond. This follows on from the challenge I set UK Sport last December to put in place a new partnership within government to develop our private fundraising effort.</p>

<a name="90225-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="09022579000030"></a>Building on our Medal Hopes scheme, the partners have assembled an enhanced package of rights for sale as an official LOCOG activation programme. This will offer sponsors rights to branding, access and events surrounding our Olympic and Paralympic sports. The scheme will allow businesses to be associated with the success of all Olympic athletes, and all Olympic sports, through the UK Sport&#146;s World Class Performance Programme&#151;rights that no other sponsorship deal can deliver. This is why I believe, despite the challenging current economic conditions, the scheme has great potential for success. There will also be opportunities for regional and local companies, and individual patrons, to get involved in supporting our athletes.</p>

<a name="90225-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="09022579000031"></a>In the 2006 Budget Statement, the Government announced a &#163;600 million package for the remaining three years of the Beijing cycle and for the London cycle, comprising &#163;200 million of Exchequer funding matched by &#163;100 million of private sector investment, and supported by &#163;300 million of lottery investment.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="09022579000032"></a>Last December, I announced a record public sector funding settlement when I allocated a total of &#163;550 million of public funds&#151;an additional &#163;50 million&#151;to UK Sport to fund its elite programme. This consisted of additional Exchequer funding of &#163;29 million to UK Sport over the four years to 2012; plus a projected uplift in lottery income of &#163;21 million.</p>

<a name="90225-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="09022579000033"></a>This meant that for the London cycle, the elite sport system will receive &#163;304 million, the highest level of public funding ever made available over a four-year Olympic/Paralympic cycle. UK Sport confirmed that this funding package enabled it to set a target to attain a place in the top four in the Olympic Games, and second place in the Paralympic Games in 2012&#151;aiming to win more medals in more sports than in Beijing.</p>

<a name="90225-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="09022579000034"></a>I was clear that this new funding was the limit of public investment in elite sport, with any further funding having to come from our private fundraising initiative. Since last summer, we have been working with Fast Track Ltd and UK Sport in developing the Medal Hopes sponsorship package and this will now be subsumed within the new wider fundraising scheme.</p>

<a name="90225-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="09022579000035"></a>However, my aim has not only been to keep the full fundraising ambition in play but also to establish a commercial funding structure to continue raising funds for elite sport beyond 2012. Funding has moved from lottery money for Sydney and Athens, to Exchequer and lottery money for Beijing, and now Exchequer, lottery and private money for London. I consider this mixed-economy funding for elite sport to be the right long-term approach.</p>

<a name="90225-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="09022579000036"></a>The creation of a unique fundraising partnership involving the wider Olympic family and the establishment of a third funding stream from the private sector will form a permanent legacy of the London Games. Both these measures, along with the record amount of public funding I have secured, leaves elite sport with the best possible opportunity for a secure and successful future.</p>

<a name="90225w0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a><a name="09022592000009"></a>Under the recapitalisation scheme announced on 8 October 2008, the Government invested &#163;19.97 billion in RBS and &#163;16.96 billion in Lloyds TSB/HBOS.

Since its creation in 2000, WRAP has provided &#163;50.7 million through its grant funding programme on direct interventions such as increasing the capacity of a particular market or supporting new markets for recyclable materials.</p>

<a name="90225w0003.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_248"></a><a name="09022592000276"></a>Specific examples include:</p>
&#163;2 million to support the creation of the first UK plants to deliver closed loop recycling of waste plastics back into material for food packaging with a capacity of 35,000 tonnes per year; and&#163;17 million to a company to enable an extra 321,000 tonnes of recovered newspapers and magazines to be recycled each year. This led to all UK-sourced newsprint being made from 100 per cent recycled paper.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_249"></a><a name="09022592000277"></a>Alongside this support for reprocessing in the UK, and since a large share of the world's manufacturing base is overseas, it makes sense for the UK to help supply export markets with recyclable raw material, and so reduce the carbon impact of using virgin raw materials in their place.</p>
