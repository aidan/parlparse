<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>That it be an instruction to the Committee of the Whole House to which the House of Lords Reform Bill has been committed that they consider the Bill in the following order:</p>
</ul>

<a name="111021-0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="11102143000002"></a>Clauses 10 to 19, Clauses 1 to 9.</p>

<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="11102143000003"></a><b><a name="111021-0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="11102143001001"></a>Lord Steel of Aikwood:</b> My Lords, I find it difficult to recall that this Bill was first debated in this House four years ago in July 2007. I cannot help feeling that it is time we got on with it. We have a great opportunity today to proceed with the Committee stage.</p>

<a name="111021-0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="11102143000004"></a>The reason for the Motion is that I have agreed  to withdraw Part 1 of the Bill-that is, Clauses 1 to 9 -dealing with the statutory appointments commission. There are two reasons for doing so-one of principle and one of practicality. The one of principle is simply this: that I would like to attract as supporters of the Bill both those who think that the Bill is necessary and sufficient and, to quote my noble friend Lord Norton, those who think it is necessary but wholly insufficient. We will in due course get to a point where the House has to choose, in the Government's own paper, between an 80 per cent elected House and a 100 per cent elected House. The position on this side of the House is that we, the Liberal Democrats, support 100 per cent and the Conservative Party supports 80 per cent. If that view were to prevail, then of course the provisions for a statutory appointments commission are already in draft in the Government's own Bill and, in the mean time, we can retain our confidence in the non-statutory Appointments Commission under the noble Lord, Lord Jay. That is the point of principle.</p>

<a name="111021-0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="11102143000005"></a>The point of practicality is that one can see on the Order Paper that, of the 160 amendments the Bill has attracted, three-quarters of them are to the section of the Bill on the appointments commission. I submit that we would be wasting our time on a Friday debating endless amendments to a part of the Bill that we do not propose to proceed with. That is why it makes sense to change the order of the debate so that we can proceed immediately with the three principal issues of the Bill: first, the hereditary by-elections; secondly, retirement from the House; and, thirdly, removing serious law breakers. I believe that by 3 o'clock, with good will and with the overwhelming view of the House, we can pass the Bill to Report stage and satisfy also the demands of the Constitution Committee of the other place. I beg to move.</p>

One of the great discussions we need on the reform of your Lordships' House is not on the matter of election-we will leave that aside for the moment-but on how an appointment to the House can be made. An attempt was made with the so-called people's Peers to establish a commission to decide which people, other than politicians, might be elected to this House. It is not for me to judge whether or not that is a success. The suggestion is that a number of people-appointed by who?-should have the final decision on who should be appointed to this House. Is it another super-quango?</p>

<a name="111021-0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="11102143000007"></a>All these issues have to be discussed and it is not good enough, I am sorry to say to the noble Lord, to go this far with the Bill-and it has been in gestation far longer than the four years he has mentioned-and then say, "Well we can just abandon Part 1". It is a real mistake. We need to debate the issue thoroughly in every aspect if we are to proceed properly.</p>

<a name="11102143000008"></a><b><a name="111021-0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="11102143001003"></a>Lord Trefgarne:</b> My Lords, I do not agree with the Motion proposed by my noble friend Lord Steel for different reasons. My first reason is that he tabled the Motion to re-order the consideration of the amendments only last night. We have not, therefore, had a chance  to consider the implications of what he proposes. If we were to remove Clauses 1 to 9 of the Bill, as he proposes, there will be consequential amendments to the rest of the Bill which have not been considered, much less tabled, today.</p>

<a name="111021-0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="11102143000009"></a>The noble Lord referred also to a number of the merits of the remaining parts of the Bill. I do not want to go into detail arguing about that now-my views, for example, on the by-elections are well known. However, if I may say so to my noble friend, it is on the verge of discourtesy to table this Motion so late in the proceedings of the Bill and then invite your Lordships to agree to it straightaway.</p>

<a name="111021-0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="11102143000010"></a>My noble friend also said that the Bill has been under consideration for a long time. He did not explain the position clearly. The fact is that this Bill has been rejected three times in the past-or at least has not secured passage through Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="11102143000011"></a><b><a name="111021-0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="11102143001004"></a>Lord Hughes of Woodside:</b> My Lords, I am very interested in what the noble Lord has to say. Unfortunately, when he turned his back to speak to his noble friend, none of us could hear him.</p>

<a name="111021-0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="11102143000013"></a>My noble friend Lord Steel referred to the history of this matter. He said that this Bill had been under consideration since 2007. That is not quite correct. Different versions, slightly different versions or even identical versions of the Bill have indeed been considered but have not secured parliamentary approval. We are considering a new Bill in this Session, which I hope will end up in the same way as the previous ones.</p>

<a name="111021-0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="11102143000014"></a>My principal objection to the Motion is that it was tabled so late and that we therefore have a Marshalled List which is back to front. I hope, therefore, that my noble friend will not persist with his Motion.</p>

<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="11102143000015"></a><b><a name="111021-0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="11102143001006"></a>Viscount Astor:</b> My Lords, my noble friend Lord Steel says that he has withdrawn Clauses 1 to 9 but, of course, on the Order Paper they are there to be debated. Would not the proper way to proceed be for the noble Lord to take the Bill in the order that it is written and move that Clauses 1 to 9 not stand part of the Bill?</p>

<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="11102143000016"></a><b><a name="111021-0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="11102143001007"></a>Lord Wills:</b> My Lords, I understand the concerns that have been expressed already today about the new approach of the noble Lord, Lord Steel. However, like him, I think the time has come to get on with the Bill.</p>

<a name="111021-0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="11102143000017"></a>This was not always my position. When I was the Minister responsible for constitutional reform in the previous Government, that Government's view-as I believe this Government's view is today-was that the Bill is a distraction, perhaps even a deliberate distraction, from the main business of establishing a wholly or mainly elected House of Lords. I still want to see  such radical reform but I fear that this Government's approach to securing it has doomed its prospects for the foreseeable future. We should therefore get on with this worthwhile Bill.</p>

<a name="111021-0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="11102143000018"></a>I had hoped that the Government would have noticed that the most astute opponents of reform of this place-such as my noble friend Lord Grocott and many other noble Lords who are in their place today-have zeroed in on one particular issue as the justification for their opposition: that is, the relationship between the House of Commons and an elected House of Lords. As I have said many times, although I still want to see a wholly elected House of Lords, this is a legitimate concern. There is no question but that there are real issues here and the Government have refused to address them, waving them aside with some airy, unsubstantiated assertions and assumptions.</p>

<a name="111021-0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="11102143000019"></a>It is not inevitable that an elected House of Lords would lead to legislative gridlock but it needs further consideration. Unless the Government show more effort in addressing these concerns, I fear that the prospects for an elected Chamber are doomed-at least for this Parliament and probably well beyond. Therefore, I believe that we should go along with what the noble Lord, Lord Steel, is proposing today. We should address and embrace the more limited but none the less extremely worthwhile reforms embedded in this Bill and, in his words again, get on with it.</p>

I had not really paid proper attention to this Bill in its previous three incarnations, mainly because I thought that we were going to see something through from the Government and that this was basically a side-show that would go away. Yet it does not seem to be doing that, which is worrying me. It is my experience of House of Lords reform that it flounders regularly. That is why 92 hereditary Peers were left here: to give an incentive for further  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_454"></a><b>21 Oct 2011 : Column 454</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>reform. I am quite certain that if that incentive is removed, as is proposed under this Bill, we will eventually die out and end up with a wholly appointed House by default in a few years' time, because further reform will flounder and they will just say that this is what we should have.</p>

<a name="111021-0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="11102143000021"></a>All we have done is to use a backdoor method of circumventing the possible will of another place, if it really wants to have an elected House. This is a hugely dangerous Bill; it is a clever way around ensuring that certain people manage to maintain their seats here. My purpose is to make sure that there is proper reform and that I am removed, but democratically. The whole point, and this is why I oppose this Motion, is that if we end up with an appointed House under this Bill, the appointments commission is absolutely key to the future composition of this House. That commission will probably end up with the great and good sitting on it, and they tend to put people on who are like themselves and who will tend to believe that the sometime excesses of the bureaucracy and the Executive just need a little tweaking to get them right.</p>

<a name="111021-0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="11102143000022"></a>That is very dangerous because we will see the mavericks disappear from this House steadily over  the years, as they die out. We will probably no longer see another Michael Onslow-the late Earl Onslow- or people like that whom we need in this House, or somewhere in Parliament, in order to point out the errors of our ways from time to time when we all pat ourselves on the back for being wise and having great wisdom. The commission is key to it and I am not happy with the idea of an independent Appointments Commission as it is currently constituted, because you will not end up with something that our grandchildren like. This almost needs to be tackled very much upfront so that we can shape the future composition of the Lords, if we are to go down this route, in a way that is sensible and gives us back some independence. By the way, can I recommend the Cross Benches? It is wonderful sitting here because you can look both sides beadily in the eye without having to turn around and not address the House.</p>

I then find that my noble friend Lord Steel has used another device. Your Lordships will recall that in Committee on an earlier form of the Bill he introduced an amendment at the last minute, which he called a device. This time, he has introduced a Motion. He did not have the courtesy to tell me about it, yet he knew I had amendments down on the Order Paper. If he had discussed it with me, it would at least have been a courtesy. We would have disagreed but I would have been able to prepare for today in a different manner than I have.</p>

<a name="111021-0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="11102143000024"></a>I say seriously to the House that to accept this Motion is a very bad precedent for this House to do on a Private Member's Bill. The only time that a Private Member's Bill should have a Motion of this type is when it is unanimous and this is clearly not unanimous. All I am doing is repeating what I said in an earlier debate in your Lordships' House. It is not the first time I have said this. If your Lordships refer  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_455"></a><b>21 Oct 2011 : Column 455</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to <I>Hansard</I> on 21 January this year, I said exactly the same thing to the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, when he introduced his navigation aids Bill. The noble Lord did not produce a Motion but said, when reading out his speech on Second Reading, "I'm going to delete these clauses". I think that he was going to delete seven out of the eight clauses. He also did not have the courtesy to talk to me about it first, although my name was on the speakers list. What I said to the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, I also say to my noble friend Lord Steel:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="11102143000461"></a>"I fear that this is an abuse of the House. Perhaps he should do the right thing, withdraw this Bill and bring forward"-</p>

<p><a name="11102143000444"></a>this was to the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley-</p>
<ul><a name="11102143000610"></a>"for Second Reading a Bill that he actually intends to pursue through the House".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/1/11; col. 617.]</ul>
<p><a name="11102143000445"></a>I then went on about the amendments but the principle is exactly the same. If my noble friend Lord Steel does not now want an appointments commission-I will come onto that in a minute-he can quite easily withdraw this Bill. If he had come to me and asked, "Will you give me a very quick Second Reading on a revised Bill without the appointments commission?", we could have looked at that and then we would not have had this Motion. This is a very bad precedent on a Private Member's Bill.</p>

<a name="111021-0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="11102143000025"></a>There is another difficulty which my noble friend Lord Trefgarne raised: that I have consequential amendments, as does the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, which start in Part 1 and have consequences in the rest of the Bill. Those consequential amendments have now become pre-sequential amendments. That is not going to lead to a sensible debate; that will make it extremely difficult.</p>

<a name="111021-0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="11102143000026"></a>I then come to the real reason why the noble Lord is moving this Motion. It is not for the convenience of your Lordships but to remove the egg on the face of Mr Clegg. Those are not my words; those are the words which my noble friend Lord Steel used on 4 June, which your Lordships can find on the <I>Guardian</I> blog website. My noble friend said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="11102143000462"></a>"There is a growing body of opinion within my party that we have to save Clegg from having egg on his face and this scheme"-</p>

<p><a name="11102143000446"></a>that is, the scheme relating to reform of the House of Lords-</p>
<ul><a name="11102143000611"></a>"is not fit to fly".</ul>
<p><a name="11102143000027"></a>My noble friend wants to remove the statutory appointments commission. However, the extraordinary thing is that on 24 March 2010 my same noble friend moved an amendment to the Motion at Second Reading of a Bill introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Bach, with the words,</p>
<ul><a name="11102143000612"></a>"but this House regrets the omission from Part 5 of the Bill of a statutory Appointments Commission".</ul>
<a name="111021-0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="11102143000028"></a>I know my noble friend has changed his mind as to whether this House should be elected. He started off, when he was leader of the Liberal Party, wanting an elected House. He then decided that an elected House would not work so he now wants to retain the House in its present form. My noble friend wanted an appointments commission. He regretted that with a Motion; he now does not want an appointments commission. I am concerned about the reputation of my noble friend, who is a great friend of mine. He

I remember that when the potential president John Kerry stood for election, he was known as "flip-flop Kerry". I should hate a similar title to be given to my noble friend. For that reason, I will oppose the Motion.</p>

Surely we must get on with this. It is ludicrous that at present Members of this House have no power to resign permanently. We have far too many Peers in the House already. Surely, for the limited but significant improvements that Parts 2 and 3 of the Bill will provide, we should get on with it today, recognising that there is great dissent in all four quarters of the House over the issue of election or appointment. In any event, the Richard committee is looking at this. There seems to be no good argument against the Motion. I understand the disappointment of some who have spoken about the fact that we will not be dealing with amendments on the appointments commission. However, that is highly contentious. Surely we can get on with it now.</p>

My only criticism is that the Bill should be called the "Improvement to the House of Lords Bill". It seeks, in practical and concise terms, to put right certain anomalies, which in some instances bring this House into ridicule in the outside world. We can go on talking in here but it is the perception outside that matters. With the greatest respect, many of the amendments tabled for discussion today-some are very good and solid-concern the reform of the House of Lords. They have nothing to do with this Bill, which is crafted to get us through the difficulties that we have had to date. Therefore, I urge noble lords to support the Motion.</p>

What he seeks to do as a Private Member in charge of this Bill, having listened to colleagues in all parts of the House, is to produce something that is more acceptable to most of them than his previous Bill was. What he proposes in the Motion that he has moved this morning will enable us to move on, as the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, has said, to substantive discussions on those parts of the Bill on which there is, I detect, a fairly general consensus in this House. We are all in the debt of the noble Lord, Lord Steel. We should thank him for what he has done and support his proposal.</p>

I have been accused of opposing all kinds of House of Lords reform simply because the hereditary Peers will in due course come to the end of their time, but that is not my position. As a matter of fact, I am not opposed in principle to House of Lords reform; indeed, I am not opposed in principle to what is proposed in the government draft Bill being considered by the Joint Select Committee chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Richard. When and if full reform is achieved, the hereditary Peers will of course come to the end of their time.</p>

<a name="111021-0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="11102143000045"></a>This Bill-the part of it that we are now to consider first-includes ending the by-elections. The by-elections which were agreed by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, and my noble friend, now the Marquess of Salisbury, secured the passage of the 1999 Act. Had those changes not been agreed that Bill would not have been passed-or at least it could have been passed only with the provisions of the Parliament Act, which I do not think that anyone was considering at the time. My noble friend's Bill therefore seeks to undermine and destroy a clear and categorical undertaking that the by-elections would remain in place until full reform was achieved. This Bill is by no means full reform. Indeed, removing the clauses on the Appointments Commission, as my noble friend now proposes, further removes the Bill from any possibility of being described as House of Lords reform. As one noble Lord said in our previous debate, this was House of Lords improvement. It is hardly that. Above all, it undermines a clear and categorical undertaking given at the time of the passage of the 1999 Act and which has been repeated and agreed by numerous Ministers in almost every Administration since that time.</p>

As my noble friend Lord Trefgarne said, a committee chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Richard, is looking at the reform of your Lordships' House. We wish that well. When one looks at the Bill that is now proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Steel, one can only assume that he has had an indication that House of Lords reform will not happen in this Parliament and that this Bill is a way of achieving partial reform instead. That is enormously disappointing, because those of us who are in favour of House of Lords reform do not want any Government to use this Bill as an excuse for reform not to happen. Will the noble Lord address that issue when he winds up on this clause?</p>

I want to make it clear that the reason why my name is added to those who oppose Clause 10 has to do with a wider purpose which relates to Part 1. Therefore, I dissent entirely from the arguments that have been made so far on the clause stand part debate.</p>

I say that on a straight point of principle because in 1999 many of us who disapproved of much of the House of Lords Act 1999 were assured that 92 hereditary Peers would remain in this House until there was a major reform of the House of Lords. Clearly, this Bill does not satisfy that criterion. When we last debated this last year, my noble friend Lord Steel argued that it did. He said that he had the support of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, who was the Lord Chancellor in 1999, who had said that this Bill met the criteria that he had in mind for the second phase of reform of the House of Lords. However, my noble friend Lord Strathclyde pointed out that, notwithstanding that, it would have been unlikely that an agreement such as was reached in 1999 would have been reached with my noble friend had he known that this Bill would have constituted the desired reform.</p>

<a name="111021-0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="11102143000063"></a>Things have changed since then, because my noble friend Lord Steel has changed his mind about the Appointments Commission. There is a misunderstanding about the Appointments Commission. In a couple of conversations that I had during the Division, people who voted for my noble friend's Motion were of the opinion that the Appointments Commission would not be discussed. It will. It is in the Bill. There are amendments to it. Regardless of whether it comes first or last, it will still be discussed. If my noble friend succeeds in removing Part 1, which covers the Appointments Commission, this will certainly not be a Bill to reform the House of Lords. That goes quite against the 1999 agreement. We agreed to that important principle-with hindsight, some of us against our better judgment; I should not have agreed; I should have continued to fight the cause of a proper reform of the House of Lords, a full reform to an elected Chamber, which is what I support. A number of very good working hereditary Peers left this House on an agreement. That agreement will be breached today if the clause is removed from the Bill. To me, that is totally unacceptable.</p>

With great respect to them, I do not think that it really is a point of principle, but even if it is, there is a more important point of principle: a principle that we were reminded of a little earlier by the noble Viscount, Lord Tenby. We need to consider the reputation of this House. I speak as someone who holds individual hereditary Peers in enormous respect and personal affection. I recognise the quality of the work that they do as working Peers in this House, but I believe that the people of this country cannot see a rational justification

It is 12 years since that agreement was made. In the interests of the reputation of this House, we need to reconsider the position. That is why the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, has been entirely right to include the provisions in  the Bill.</p>

<a name="111021-0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="11102143000065"></a>I also note that the Bill would treat hereditary Peers who are Members of this House with the respect and courtesy that is proper. There is no suggestion that they should all be swept away in one fell swoop. The proposition is that over time, as nature takes its course, the hereditary Peers would disappear from the legislature. That is a decent, practical and proper way to proceed. I very much hope that the House will agree with the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood.</p>

It is perfectly true that we are now in this position by the consent of a large number of our former noble friends-they are still our noble friends but they are no longer Members of this House-on the strict understanding that the rearguard would remain until a satisfactory position had been reached. That is a point of principle. The noble Lord, Lord Howarth, said very nice things about hereditary Peers, but fine words butter few Peers. We are here on an honourable understanding built on the understanding of many others who served this House for a very long time.</p>

<a name="111021-0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="11102143000067"></a>Why, therefore, do I support the Bill-as I do with a heavy heart? It seems to me that the real basic principle is not to do with undertakings that we have been given or the perception of the British public at the present time, it is the protection of the British people from their future Governments down the generations to come. The House of Commons, for various reasons, is now on occasion firmly in the grip of the Government of the day. We saw that very clearly in 2003. I would love to expand on that, but your Lordships want to get on.</p>

<a name="111021-0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="11102143000068"></a>The same circumstances would automatically arise if this were to be an elected House. We have to try to find a means by which an acceptable House remains without being replaced by an elected House. Reform is necessary, but it must not be a House made up of people who can be removed by the Whips of any governing party at their whim by deselection. That being so, we have to find something that is workable and acceptable. It seems to me quite possible that my noble friend Lord Trefgarne's heroic efforts to forge something acceptable from the draft Bill at present before his Committee may fail. What emerges may not be acceptable; in fact I very much doubt that it will. That being so, the search will be on, if time permits, for something else. If that something else is already here and working, there is a good chance that it will last. Therefore, I have to swallow my pride in the past and my affection for the present and leave my loyalty to the British people and to this sad but necessary device.</p>

We face a specific set of proposals from my noble friend Lord Steel of Aikwood and supported by many colleagues across the House. Since Second Reading, we have had many expressions of support for Clause 10 and for the Bill generally. It is important to remind your Lordships that they have come from all parts of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="11102143000070"></a>I read the two-day debate in June on the White Paper and draft Bill, during which a whole range of views was expressed about this Bill as being the right way forward in the transitional period. This is not an exclusive list, but support came from the noble Baronesses, Lady Boothroyd, Lady Noakes, Lady Taylor of Bolton and Lady Royall of Blaisdon, the noble Lords, Lord Wakeham, Lord Bilimoria, Lord Low of Dalston, Lord Faulkner of Worcester, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, Lord MacGregor of Pulham Market, Lord Elder, Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, Lord Cobbold, Lord Howarth of Newport, Lord Lucas, Lord Mackenzie of Framwellgate, Lord Stewartby, Lord Foulkes of Cumnock, Lord Gilbert and Lord Lyell, together with the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, the noble Marquess, Lord Lothian, and the noble Earl, Lord Glasgow. There was a great range of support to make progress along the lines proposed by my noble friend and included in the clause. I, therefore, want to address the question that Clause 10 stand part.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="11102143000071"></a>The raft of amendments, not just on the first nine clauses, but indeed latter clauses, suggests that the consensus that I thought was emerging for my noble friend's Bill does not get support right across the House. That has been apparent even from the early discussions today. It would seem to be that only a very small minority, given the overwhelming vote that we had a few minutes ago, wants to hold up the Bill. Clearly, some amendments are aimed at more radical change. Some are probing and foreshadowing discussion of the Government's Bill. Others are equally clearly intended to sabotage any chance of making simple but necessary changes envisaged by my noble friend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="11102143000072"></a>Before any other Members of your Lordships' House suggest that we have plenty of time and that it is a long time before we will see any proposals from the Joint Committee-I see many distinguished members of the Joint Committee here today, and I am proud to be a member of it-I should tell the House that we are making progress. Our proceedings have been in public, so I am not betraying any secrets. There is a determination to do serious work on the Bill. I can give, legitimately and properly, a progress report. We have sat in public and have taken evidence from the Minister responsible, the honourable Mark Harper MP. Despite the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Wills, expressed earlier, and indeed the noble Lord Elton just now, we will do the job that a Joint Committee is asked to do, on behalf of your Lordships' House and the other place, to give real practical scrutiny to the proposals. We have recently decided that we should be aiming our work programme at the planned out date of February 2012. We have specifically refused to adopt prematurely a defeatist attitude.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="11102143000073"></a>That therefore means that we should try to make progress, as indicated by the vote this morning. In these circumstances, I suggest that, shorn of the more controversial and complicated appointments sections covered in Clauses 1 to 9, as my noble friend said, we can today make real progress on a useful transitional measure for the next three years until the planned first very limited tranche of new entrants-elected, appointed, or possibly just elected-in 2015. Perhaps I should remind your Lordships that the very explicit statement in the White Paper from the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, supported by other members of the Cabinet, was that they were both,</p>
<ul><a name="11102143000613"></a>"fully committed to holding the first elections to the reformed House of Lords in 2015".</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="11102143000074"></a>Today the reputation of your Lordships' House as being supremely capable of constructive scrutiny is once again in question. Other legislation currently before us raises those issues, too. If today proves to be just another long-winded defence of inherited patronage as a basis for the membership of this legislature, I suggest that there will be important inhabitants of the other place at the other end of the Building-not least the business managers, whom I used to have to deal with, so I know what they are like-who may well conclude that the sooner the Government's Bill is enacted the better. Our reputation for getting on with our business in a business-like way is once again before us and we should do so today.</p>

That is not the only occasion when that has happened. I did not vote because I could not possibly support the Motion but I could not oppose it either, because it was an opportunity for a relevant discussion of some importance and I was not prepared to deny that. I do not sit on these Benches and not vote as a rule, but this was a very difficult situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="11102143000078"></a>On this question, which is an agreement, it must be kept until a substantial reform is before the House.

The 92 hereditary Peers will be here for many years. When most of us are dead there will still be hereditary Peers. As Keynes said:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="11102143000080"></a>This is a generous Bill. We cannot go slower than saying that we will suspend by-elections. It is a pity that the noble Marquess is not here today. He made  a very clever arrangement in 1999 and got sacked by Mr William Hague as leader of the Conservative Peers for his efforts. An agreement made in 1999 cannot surely apply for all time until there is a substantial change, which some people are sceptical about coming any time soon. Does the noble Lord really think that that gives people a veto, as it were, to interpret this for the foreseeable future?</p>

It was not an agreement for all time, if the noble Lord will accept that, but an agreement until a certain event took place, which was a substantive amendment of the constitution. That was the agreement. Forgive me for saying this as I do not want to contradict the noble Lord, but I can assure him and a lot of other Members of the House that this was not an agreement for all time.</p>

The general public give very little thought to what this House does. Because the media think that Parliament consists entirely of another place, they do not hear very much about what we do and therefore do not think about us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="11102143000083"></a>Much is continually being said about the ludicrousness of the hereditary Peers' elections. It is said that they bring us into disrepute. I do not deny that. However, the principal thing that is ludicrous about the elections is that the electorate is only the hereditary Peers. In the case of Labour and Liberal Democrat elections, two or three Peers vote for many more candidates. That could be simply remedied by making the electorate all the Peers in the party. With hindsight, I believe that is how it should have been.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="11102143000084"></a>When stage 2 of the reform of this House has been enacted and comes into force, the 92 should be prepared to go. If any or all of them are offered life baronetcies by the Government, it should be up to them whether they accept them. As I have said before, for us hereditary Peers to be party to abolishing the elections would stick in my gullet. It is tantamount to saying to our erstwhile colleagues, who were so meanly and cavalierly sacked in 1999, and whose only hope of either getting back themselves or ensuring that their heirs did was to be elected: "I'm all right, Jack, and as far as you're concerned, hard cheese".

There are many parliamentary democracies that elect both Houses, under different systems. There are mechanisms by which one can make sure that it is not a complete disaster.

You do not have the authority to change laws because you are not elected in a democracy". They will remove the residual powers of the House of Lords to alter legislation.

What worries me-I know that it worries other noble Lords-is that there are 170 people in the current parliamentary party in the House of Commons who have an appointment in the Executive. Which way round is it? Is Parliament setting the rules for the Executive, or is the Executive tail wagging the dog?

I must say to the noble Lady  that yesterday I had the privilege of speaking with 20 Chevening scholars from India, the brightest and the best of the Indian subcontinent, and when we talked about the composition of this House, they simply did not understand why we still have hereditary Peers. When we have things such as the Arab spring and we are nurturing the new democracies in the Middle East, to still retain the election of hereditary Peers does not seem logical or proper.

First, hereditary Peers who are sitting in this House are in no sense discriminated against as a result of Clause 10. Secondly, it is perfectly obvious that the arrangement for by-elections was always intended to be an interim one. The mistake, in a sense, was not  to have had it ending at the end of that Parliament or, conceivably, the following Parliament because it was intended to make use of the reservoir of experience which we had, needed and wanted to keep. We have done it extremely successfully. Least there should have been a too rapid decline, there was an arrangement for temporary topping up.</p>

The problem with your Lordships is that you have very little knowledge of Standing Orders or precedents within the House. I am an elected hereditary Peer under an Act of Parliament, as are others. It has been quite convenient for people over a long period of time to drop the word "elected", but it was an election.

<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="11102143000105"></a>I did not really approve of the election process, but I have to admit I was wrong because the quality of the people who have come into this House as a result of those elections is very high. They have a great knowledge, and they make a great contribution. They become what your Lordships will understand to be working Peers although, as I have pointed out in this House on previous occasions, there is no such thing as a working Peer. A Peer sits here not with a job, other than the 10 who are paid, but with a duty and a responsibility. Certain hereditary elements put upon you a greater feeling of duty. Of course I am here because my grandfather was Postmaster-General. It does not matter; that was the way, indirectly, when my father died, but all my family have been in public life. Those of us who have been in public life have a feeling of duty which overwhelms everything else. I do not approve of the Steel Bill. I believe that we should still wait for the government proposals, and I will support all those proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="11102143000106"></a>If anyone goes on saying that I am not elected, I am far more legitimate than those people appointed by patronage. At the moment, we have an overwhelming number of people who do not know each other, do not know the rules and do not know what to do. We should be asking what the House of Lords as it is today should be doing in the community and what initiatives it should be taking, instead of squabbling among ourselves about the future. We have a major economic crisis, we have a whole range of problems and within this House we have an amazing collection of people who do not know each other's abilities. As noble Lords may know, I have a background on every Peer. You could not assemble these 830 or 840 people, but we fail again to understand communication. Half of them do not have PCs, and we are in a world of electronic communication. I believe this debate should go on. I would regard the Steel Bill as a White Paper or a Steel paper. When I first met the noble Lord, Lord Steel, on the Council of Europe many years ago, he tried to persuade me to become a Liberal, partly because of my grandfather. I think the noble Lord he has done a good job. He is quite a crafty worker, and this is a bit of good craftsmanship, but it is too crafty by half.</p>

Back in 1999, the House consisted of some 700 hereditary Peers and 560 or  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_471"></a><b>21 Oct 2011 : Column 471</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>thereabouts life Peers plus the Bishops and the Law Lords, so the vast majority were hereditary Peers. When the Government Bill came forward, it was to remove all those hereditary Peers, each and every one, all the 700. Never in history, surely, was there a Government seeking to remove more than half of one of the Chambers of Parliament by legislation, but the hereditary Peers recognised that there was a case to be made and in the end an arrangement was reached between, as we have heard, my noble friend, now the Marquess of Salisbury, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg. The hereditary Peers did not have to be persuaded by that argument, but they were. The result was that that Bill passed.</p>

<a name="111021-0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="11102143000108"></a>Had that agreement not been reached, the Bill would almost certainly not have passed. Indeed, there were a good many life Peers who were not in favour of it. I believe it would not have passed although it could, no doubt, have been forced through with the Parliament Act. However, there is room for more than one respectable view about whether that was possible. The deal that was then done, the arrangements that were agreed between my noble friend and the noble and learned Lord were to the effect that 90 hereditary Peers would remain, re-elected as necessary as they passed on, and two hereditary Peers-the two great officers of state-would come ex officio, so to speak. That was the arrangement, and the arrangement was to remain in place until House of Lords reform was complete. By no stretch of the imagination does this Bill represent complete House of Lords reform. Therefore, in accordance with the undertaking then reached, this clause ought not to be included, and I hope my noble friend Lord Steel will not insist upon it.</p>

<p><a name="11102143000448"></a>It was passed by overwhelming majorities in both Houses of Parliament on the amendment put forward by the late Lord Weatherill. For my own part, I lent that agreement my assent, although I was not a Member of your Lordships' House, and I therefore consider myself bound in honour.</p>

<a name="111021-0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="11102143000115"></a>Why was that agreement made? That has been very clearly expressed. It was made to enable the Labour Government to achieve a long-standing aspiration of the Labour Party to reform your Lordships' House, and I think that most people in your Lordships' House believe that this House is better as a result, although it is arguable whether the Bill would have passed without the Parliament Act had that agreement not been made. It was assented to by the majority of the Peers then in the House, 666 of whom then left the House to enable that legislation to take place, on the legitimate expectation that we would be proceed to-to use the term that was used then-stage two.</p>

<a name="111021-0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="11102143000116"></a>Stage two is not defined, and when things are not defined, inconveniences arise, but no one suggested that stage two should be election, or necessarily appointment, or a mixed House. However, everyone in both Houses of Parliament agreed at that time that we would proceed towards stage two. So far as I am concerned, the Bill before us is, as has been said today, in no sense stage two. Stage two could be any of the things I have described, but we have not reached that point, so in those terms I-I cannot speak for others-consider the agreement that was entered into as binding in honour.</p>

<a name="111021-0001.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="11102143000117"></a>I might say to the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, that the nature of the elections can certainly be described by some as being odd. At the time, the Conservative Party and the representatives of the Cross Benches proposed in talks that the arrangements should not be as they are now but should be more akin to a representative peerage and more like some of the other results. Representatives of the Labour Government at that time insisted on the present arrangement, and we, for our part, agreed to that. It was all part of the give and take of the agreement, and we live with the compromise.</p>

It does not escape my notice that the end result of this clause, if passed, would be, albeit over time, that an all-appointed House of Lords would come into being.

I notice a congruity between the many supporters of this legislation and support for the end of an all-appointed House. That would not escape the notice of the country or indeed of another place, and we cannot agree that stage two is an all-appointed House by passing this Bill.</p>

I thought that he was well answered by my noble friend Lord Elton in a very honest speech as a hereditary Peer saying why we should now move on. Frankly, looking back at <I>Hansard</I>, perhaps I may quote one or two phrases from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, who was then the Lord Chancellor. He said:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="11102143000128"></a>That was 12 years ago. I do not think that anyone in the House at that time, and I was there, ever thought that 12 years later we would still be holding these by-elections. That is the point which Clause 10 seeks to address. We are now further on. We have had many by-elections. No one is suggesting that we get rid of hereditary Peers or that those who came in by by-elections are less worthy than anyone else.

But, frankly, when a Labour or Lib Dem hereditary Peer dies, the numbers are ridiculous. I do not see that in the 21st century we can possibly stand up and say that people become Members of the British Parliament by heredity and election by three or four people. It is simply nonsense. In order to bring that nonsense to an end, Clause 10 should stand part of the Bill.</p>

Now that the final ethnic cleansing of hereditary Peers that started in 1999 is going to take place, in my view it is appropriate that this House should no longer be called the House of Lords. The question is: when is a suitable date to make the change? Why should it be called the House of Lords when a section of Peers have been refused entry to it? It is absolutely fine as long as a number of hereditary Peers are here, but as a result of the vote it is now clear that the 1999 agreement has been shredded, and in due course the number of hereditary Peers will drop to zero. The purpose of this amendment is to take account of that situation-</p>

The House of Lords will not be representative of all the Peers. I know that my noble friend is very keen to get rid of the hereditary Peers. After achieving that goal, it is quite right that the name of the House should change. That is the reason for the amendment. The question is: when is a suitable time for that to take place? I have suggested 1 January 2020, but of course I am open to suggestions. There might actually be a book as to who is going to be the last hereditary Peer to sit in the House of Lords. Let us hope that, long before that, we have a fully elected House of Lords and that it can then properly change its name. But as I believe the majority of Peers in this House wish to retain an appointed, unelected, undemocratic system, I think it is appropriate that the name of this Chamber should change. I beg to move.</p>

Wrecking amendments are not a formal part of the machinery of this House, but one recognises what one sees.

It may well be that some of us are going to relearn the process of wasting time in order to avoid a Bill being passed. As the noble Lord says, that may be the motive behind all these amendments. But I do not consider it right for him to say that this is a wrecking amendment.</p>

<a name="111021-0001.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="11102143000141"></a>How can an amendment to change the name of this House in 2020 possibly be a wrecking amendment? It may not be an amendment that will find favour with many people, but it is certainly not a wrecking amendment. But as far as tactics are concerned, it does this House no good for Members to cast aspersions on the motives of other Members. I am sure that all of us who have views on this Bill have good motives. Earlier today the noble Lord, Lord Steel, was accused of being discourteous in withdrawing Clauses 1 to 9. He was not being discourteous; he was using the well-known political ploy of keeping your opponents guessing. There is nothing wrong in that. So let us not start chucking motives around.</p>

Irrelevant of the date, when the royal commission headed by the noble Lord, Lord Wakeham, sat, I made a written proposal. Included in that proposal was a suggestion that the House should in due course change its name, if we were to have an elected House, to precisely that-a senate. That is what other countries have for their upper Chamber, and it seemed a very sensible way. It also has classical connotations. By no means can this constitute a wrecking amendment; it is merely a suggestion, and I think that it is rather a good one. I hope that it will come to pass. I find myself in agreement with the noble Lord, Lord Steel.</p>

It has been put in to enable a debate to take place. Whether people agree with it or not, it does nothing to further the remaining clauses of the Bill, of which this House seems to be in total support.

Senedd in Welsh means a "law-making Assembly". If we were to become an English law-making Assembly, it does not seem to me suitable.

In previous discussions, the main reason given for removing hereditary Peers at this point was that the public thought that it was an anachronism, that it looked silly and they did not understand what it was about, and all that sort of stuff. If it is about public image, I recommend that we should change the name of our upper House to senate, which is universally understood globally and is taught in politics lessons. That would be the perfectly logical thing to do to pair with getting rid of hereditary Peers. What amuses me is that those who are very keen to get rid of hereditary Peers because it taints this House are also very keen to hang on to the title. I really do not understand that; it is just not consistent and logical.</p>

<a name="111021-0001.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="11102143000150"></a>The other point that I would make is that in all my points that I am arguing, I am arguing against my continued presence in this House much more effectively than if we put this Bill through, whereby I would roll on until I died, with luck-whereas actually I am trying to force an earlier departure by getting a proper democratic assembly. When we go democratic, it will be easier to understand if it is called a senate. Whatever happens, renaming it as a senate would be much clearer and would give a much better image of the House to the public.</p>

I listened particularly carefully to the noble Lord, Lord Wright of Richmond, since your former Permanent Secretary is always somebody you listen to with great care, although one might not always agree with a former Permanent Secretary, or even from time to time with a Permanent Secretary. I tabled this amendment because I wanted to look at the situation that the noble Lord, Lord Steel, mentioned when he intervened. He agreed with me that the name needs to change, but do not let us do it now-let us wait for the government Bill. That is my argument about the Steel Bill-let us wait for the government Bill.

We are now not considering that amendment because we have, apparently, deferred consideration of the earlier part of the Bill.

I had looked forward to the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, explaining how he arrived at the magic figure of 15 years. That 15 years is in the Government Bill, all the Government White Papers and so on. What is magical about 15 years? No one has explained it. I make the rather acid comment about the possible lifestyle of 15-year senators-or Peers or whatever-appointed: they will have five years to learn the job, five years to do the job and five years to look for a job.</p>

<p><a name="11102143000451"></a>I support the clause in principle. For noble Lords who are no longer able to attend your Lordships' House, it seems to be sensible. However, my amendment concerns the clause which says that the House of Lords may,</p>
<ul><a name="11102143000615"></a>"by Standing Order make provision for a member to be excluded",</ul>
<p><a name="11102143000452"></a>and then, by application, come back. There are Members of your Lordships' House who perhaps get appointed to some important government post abroad, or for some reason are doing something so that they may or may not be able to attend. We certainly do not want to lose them.</p>

<a name="111021-0001.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="11102143000182"></a>In the Bill, the reason is deemed to be "sufficient merit" for subsection (1) not to apply. My amendment leaves out "sufficient" and inserts "reasonable". Your Lordships' House has always been governed by reason and reasonableness. There should not be arguments in the future as to whether something is or is not of "sufficient merit". Who is to say, if a Member of your Lordships' House is appointed an ambassador or a high commissioner abroad, as has happened in the past, whether that country being regarded as important is "sufficient"? If they are sent to be governor of Gibraltar, is that regarded as not "sufficient"? We should have a test that is based on a choice of words with which I would hope your Lordships feel more comfortable. That is why I inserted the word "reasonable". I beg to move.</p>

However, as some of your Lordships may have read in the recent leaders, there has been some pretty unfavourable comment about how the House is behaving and working. Many of your Lordships have complained that there are far too many Peers, so the proposal that my noble friend and I have made is that there should be a retirement age of 75. Yes, we are undoubtedly going to lose some expertise from time to time, but the average age of this House is 69 according to the noble Lord, Lord Tyler. I do not know of any other institution or corporate body where the average age is 69. I have now been here for 40 years, and I am still below the average age of the House. To me, that is an absolute nonsense. It has worked very well, I have enjoyed it and I am extremely grateful. However, in 2011, it is not a terribly good way. If the average age of the House is 69, it should be made younger.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="11102143000191"></a>My noble friend Lord Trefgarne and I have therefore tabled the amendment. It refers to the 75th birthday; I am open to arguments for 70 or even perhaps 80. But we should at least have this debate, which is really important because it will reduce the size of the House which has been a cause of concern to so many people. I beg to move.</p>

I am not going to suggest that we accept the amendment for the simple reason that the clauses that we have now passed put the matter in the hands of the Government. We have given statutory authority in accordance with the recommendation, which I am holding in my hand, from the all-party committee under the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral. Perhaps I may quote from that. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a><a name="11102143000485"></a>"On the evidence of our extensive consultations, we are confident that there is a broad consensus in the House in support of a provision to enable members voluntarily to leave the House permanently, in order that the overall size of the House may be reduced as soon as possible. We hope that this broad consensus might now be taken as the starting point for a way forward ... we are advised that legislation would, strictly speaking, be necessary to override the entitlement to a Writ of Summons".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="11102143000193"></a>I am with my noble friend in his intent, but it is not right to try to prescribe today, in the course of a Committee stage, what the age should be. We should leave that to the Government and the consensus which the committee of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, suggested exists. If the Bill goes through, we will have given the Government the statutory authority. It will then be up to the Government by statutory instrument to come back to the House and produce a scheme which will enable the numbers in the House to be reduced. We should not do it in this arbitrary manner now.</p>

At present, most of the judicial appointments-I think virtually all of them, including magistrates-have to retire at age 70. I do not think that there is any proposal that that younger age would be acceptable as far as your Lordships are concerned. Indeed, in answer to a question from me the other day, the noble Lord, Lord McNally, the Minister for Justice, said that this matter might be reconsidered in legislation next year. I happen to think that 75 would be a good age for magistrates, for judges of all the different courts and Members of your Lordships' House to retire. The amendment has some merit and some force and I hope that your Lordships will agree to it.</p>

We have to be very careful in setting a limit. I declare an interest, being over 75, as one could say, "Well, he would say that, wouldn't he?" On the other hand, it is worth remembering that a respected demographer has recently told us that the person who is going to live to 150 has already been born. We have to take into account the fact that the pensionable age is now much higher than it was and that there is still a lot of life left in a lot of people who are aged 75. I agree that we need to reduce the numbers in the House, but this is not the way to go about it. There are other avenues to pursue to reduce the size of the House. I would be very wary of depriving it of the benefit of having some great experts. Under the proposal, when they had passed 75, they would not be invited to return in the subsequent Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="11102143000199"></a>Seventy-five might not be the right age. I am not entirely sure what the retirement age for High Court judges is, but a retirement age, be it 70 or 75, would seem to be one possible solution. The noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, declaring an interest, was against that. Other alternatives have been promoted in the past; for example, when your Lordships have sat here for 15 or 30 years, they should also be retired. I declare my interest in that that would affect me, so, quite naturally, I am thoroughly against the proposal. However, it is for this House to consider this matter very carefully. It is also for my noble friend on the Front Bench and the Leader of the Opposition to come before your Lordships and say what the main political parties in this country feel that they can do about the size of this Chamber. We know that there is going to be long-term reform, but we really ought to address the issue beforehand because it is important.</p>

It is worth recalling that, since the noble Viscount spoke of the Chinese People's Republic, I do not know of any other upper Chamber where there happens to be such a limit. If one is going to go down a different route, perhaps the noble Viscount might consider it a good idea if we limited the number of new creations.

The list goes on and on. To deprive the country of the accumulated wisdom of people such as that would be about the most foolish thing that we could do. Let us find some other mechanism. As has quite rightly been said, we are ageing now. An age limit might fall foul of the Equality Act, because we have removed the retirement age elsewhere-we are forcing companies in the corporate world to keep people for as long as those people wish to stay there. Why on earth are we operating in the opposite way? If we are finding it difficult, we should not be doing special legislation for Parliament. Let us keep our wisdom.</p>

By virtue of the ludicrous formula in that agreement, the House has to reflect the voting in the previous election. If we were to take the last election as an example, there would be 1,100 in this House if we did not get rid of anybody. The getting rid of somebody is not to do with age but with this ridiculous formula. In order to reduce the size of the House you may as well say, "Let us get rid of people by lot", or, "Let us get rid of everyone whose surname begins with L, M, N, O or P".

Part of his thought process was that what keeps people alive for a long age is using their brains and being active. This we have looked at in dealing with the older population. If there was an attempt to introduce an age of 75 it would mean many Peers leaving this House-I shall not give your Lordships today the scary number, from my figures, of how many would go but it is quite considerable-and we would probably be leading them to an earlier death than would otherwise be the case.</p>

There are 375, or thereabouts, places on our various committees and, although some sit infrequently and can be sat on by people who sit on committees that meet every week, that does not take account of government Ministers or the various other party Front Benchers. They amount to another 60, minimum. So you are getting quite near 500.

<p><a name="11102143000456"></a>That is clear from the debate that we have had. There is always something wrong with the amendment that is put forward. There must be other amendments and a different way of doing things. The noble Earl, Lord Erroll, said that we must find another mechanism. I have put forward a mechanism and it has not received any great support but there is not another mechanism. We are therefore going to be faced with this continual problem of an increase in the size of the House, and of the active House.</p>

<a name="111021-0001.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="11102143000227"></a>I will, again, be referring in due course to some leaders that have been written in the papers recently about how this House works. I have increasingly come to the conclusion that in their writings my noble friends Lord Steel and Lord Tyler are both right, for what is this House designed to do? We have not discussed that. We are talking about reforming a system that is creaking at the seams without looking ahead to ask, "What should a second Chamber do?". It would not be this House of Lords but having got what a second Chamber should be doing, you then work out how it is composed. I see my noble friend Lord Norton of Louth nodding. It is very unusual that we agree on reform of the House of Lords but this is one of those rare moments that one cherishes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="11102143000228"></a>We are, again, putting the cart before the horse. Clearly, age is a non-runner. I accept that but it has been extremely worth while because at least my noble friend Lord Trefgarne and I have put forward a proposal to be discussed. I hope that other noble Lords will put forward different proposals, because there is no doubt that something needs to be done.</p>

By the clauses that we have just passed, we are saying to the Government, "Take this report up. Get on with it and let's reduce the numbers". That is the right way to do it.</p>

As I said to him earlier, that is not going to work because the only way you are going to get retirement from this House is to have a financial inducement, and I do not think that that will ever be acceptable, particularly in the present financial circumstances. For a House comprising Peers who are not paid but merely receive expenses, to be paid to leave is not acceptable. It was not acceptable for the hereditary Peers and it is not acceptable for the life Peers.</p>

This is not the case. I have some experience of this. The number of committees is driven by the fact that legislation is becoming increasingly complex, particularly the scrutiny of European legislation, and, unfortunately, by the quality of the form in which legislation comes from the other place often being very poor. Your Lordships have a duty to scrutinise properly. It is not quite right to say that we create committees to make jobs for the boys and girls. We do it because there is a genuine need for better scrutiny.</p>

There is no doubt that, as a result of the reforms in another place, there is less scrutiny there than there used to be and we have to do more. However, there are other committees that have grown since I was first here. It is a bit of both. The noble Lord is absolutely right that the complexity of legislation, particularly European legislation as it has come in, has needed committees. However, my figure of 300 is merely taken from the Government's proposals. We will come back to that but we must get on.</p>

The answer to the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, is that the Hunt committee said that this should be done without adding to the budget of the House of Lords, so that it would save public expenditure. The committee argued it very carefully. What has been implemented in the mean time is simply voluntary resignation, of which only two Members have taken advantage. The recommendation of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, has not been implemented and it ought to be implemented, or at least considered now in some depth.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="11102143000492"></a>"Conviction of serious criminal offence".</p>

<p><a name="11102143000457"></a>I have stated before that I do not like this clause and I do not like it for two reasons. One argument advanced in favour of the clause is that the provision is the same as that which applies in another place. However, I do not think that we should necessarily follow the provisions of another place. We are a different House and we are composed differently. It is right that we should make different rules, if necessary.</p>

<a name="111021-0001.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="11102143000249"></a>I have previously mentioned my second reason for disliking the clause. When a person has served a sentence they should no longer be penalised for having committed the offence in question. When I was Minister for Prisons the principle was clear. The courts meted out sentences but, when they had been served, that  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_496"></a><b>21 Oct 2011 : Column 496</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was the end of it. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, is not in his place but I hope that there are some lawyers present who will support my remarks. Therefore, in principle I have serious concerns about Part 4. I completely understand what my noble friend is trying to do but I consider that the provision goes against the principles of British justice.</p>

<a name="111021-0001.htm_para81"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="11102143000250"></a>The term "more than one year" in the Bill is too short a timescale and would catch too many trivial offences. Therefore, my Amendment 130 suggests a timescale of five years rather than one year. There is a certain benefit to be had from permitting Peers who have been convicted and sentenced to prison to come back to the House after they have served their sentence. Lord Kagan used to sit on the Labour Benches, having spent a little time at Her Majesty's Pleasure. He came back and gave useful insights into that experience which assisted our consideration of criminal justice Bills. My amendment seeks to improve the Bill and explore the justification of my noble friend Lord Steel for the one-year period. I beg to move.</p>

I am simply bringing this House into line with the other House. It has long been the practice in the elected House that anyone sentenced to a year's imprisonment is automatically expelled. It seems to me that that should apply across Parliament as a whole. That is the only rationale for the measure. My noble friend has tabled two later starred amendments. I am minded to consider these very carefully because I think that he has a point there which we could carry forward to Report stage, if we get to it. However, we should resist Amendments 130 and 131 as they would make the provisions for this House different from those of the other place, and I do not see any case for that.</p>

However, it may be for the convenience of your Lordships if I speak to it at the same time. I think that three noble Lords who attend this House have served time during Her Majesty's pleasure and that two are either in prison or have been there recently. There are a few over the years who perhaps should have been there. There are quite a few I would have liked to have sent there but could not find a decent enough reason. Be that as it may, the point of my amendment is to make the situation rather similar to what the noble Lord, Lord Steel, says applies to the House of Commons. I absolutely agree that if you are in prison you should not attend your Lordships' House. If you are in prison I do not see how you can attend your Lordships' House unless there is some day-release policy of which I am not aware.</p>

I try to avoid the trap of politicians falling into the pointless anecdote, but perhaps I will mention one concerning Lord Kagan. When he reappeared in your Lordships' House, he came to the tea room and sat down. We all looked slightly embarrassed and wondered what to say. The late Lord Marsh turned to him and said, "I hope that your time in prison was not too bad", to which Lord Kagan said, "I've only been in prison twice. The first was a concentration camp during the war and the second was here. I have to tell you that British prisons are much nicer places". After that, we were all silent for quite a long time.</p>

Although I realise that this is a Private Member's Bill, I know that the government Benches believe in giving people a second change. That is commendable in many ways and I certainly believe in the rehabilitation of offenders. I also recognise that although we are one Parliament we are two Houses, each of which has rules and regulations. However, in this instance, it is absolutely right that we bring our own procedures into line with the House of Commons. While I believe in the rehabilitation of offenders, we must bear in mind that we are legislators and make laws. When one has broken a law to such an extent that one receives a prison sentence, it is right and proper that for a period of five years one should no longer have the privilege of making laws.</p>

It is appropriate that the terms and conditions for both Houses should be the same.</p>

They would probably give us insights that we would not otherwise have. Things can go on in certain institutions that we would not otherwise know about. That could be useful experience.

However, there was a case quite recently when a noble Lord was convicted and sentenced to a rather long sentence which was rapidly reduced on appeal to a much shorter sentence. That noble Lord quickly returned to your Lordships' House. Where sentences change rapidly on appeal, that should act in the favour of the noble Lord concerned. What does my noble friend think about that?</p>

How would my noble friend deal with that? Some very worthy Members of this House may be on business abroad who happen to have said things in this House that their hosts do not like and who take the opportunity to incarcerate them as a result.</p>

That one comes after another 31 amendments, after the  31 groups on the sheet. He is also concerned about Amendment 75, which is five amendments after that-in other words, 67 amendments on. Ambition is splendid and it may be that moving with great speed another list has to be issued. We shall see.</p>

In order to be helpful to my noble friend Lord Steel, and given what he said, I shall not move Amendments 132 and 133. This should speed up the process.

He offered me a lovely olive branch by saying, "Yes, I rather like your amendment, we can discuss it". However, he will take away the whole point of the amendment later in the proceedings. If he will discuss with me whether it should be one year or more -perhaps two, three, four or five-and we can talk about the clause, I will not move my Amendments 132 and 133.

My recollection is that some past legislation excluded convictions under the Road Traffic Acts from the penalties that would otherwise apply. Perhaps that would be appropriate in the case of this legislation. I would need guidance on whether it is possible to sentence people under the Road Traffic Acts for the longer sentences that we are anticipating-longer than those that normally apply in magistrates' courts. Perhaps my noble friend on the Front Bench-or even my noble friend Lord Steel-can offer me some guidance on that. Occasionally, people commit serious as opposed to minor offences under the Road Traffic Acts. I would be interested to know whether that situation would apply to this legislation.</p>

I think we are the only Members of a second Chamber in any democratic country in the world who do not have the right to vote in general elections. It seems to me that there is a point of principle here. Many of us campaign in elections. I have window bills up in my house, and yet I am not allowed to vote for reasons that have disappeared in the mists of history and which make no logical sense today. It would not be compulsory. Those Members of this House who feel that they should not vote would have the right not to go to the polling station, but people in history have died for the right to vote. It has been a fundamental principle in many countries in the world. I feel very deeply when I am not allowed to vote on election day, even though I take an active part in campaigning for the candidate or candidates of my choice. The proposition is very simple. It will not change anything fundamental but will give us the right on polling day to exercise a democratic right. For those people who say that we are in the legislature and therefore we have other chances, the point of voting is to choose or influence the Government of this country.

We are the only ones excluded, apart from various others. We are not allowed to vote on money Bills here, and nor are we allowed to vote for the very people who are putting them through and deciding upon them in another place. Logically, I think we should.

That is because the amendment refers to referendums. I believe that a change in the constitution, such as this Bill proposes, should be  the subject of a referendum. We are getting more and more used to referendums as part of our political landscape. The Local Government Act 2000 provided for the holding of referendums to enable electors of individual local authorities to express their preferences for the type of executive arrangements within their council. The 2001 Regional Assemblies (Preparation) Bill also allowed for the holding of referendums.</p>

<a name="111021-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="11102143000307"></a>The House is currently considering the Localism Bill, which has a huge number of Liberal Democrat amendments-I can see my noble friend Lord Steel nodding, whether in sadness or pleasure I am not certain. Under Schedule 6 to the two tomes of that Bill one sees a huge amount about "Council tax referendums: further amendments". A referendum was also agreed in Section 6-headed, "Decisions requiring approval by Act and by referendum"-of the European Union Act 2011, which my noble friend Lord Howell of Guildford took through. Earlier this year there was also, of course, the referendum on the alternative vote system, with the quite remarkable and wonderful result that it was not agreed. We are getting increasingly used to referendums.</p>

<a name="111021-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="11102143000308"></a>This is a constitutional Bill of some importance. The most important bit is the one we have agreed which will break the 1999 agreement on the succession of hereditary Peers until a further reform of the House of Lords takes place. If this Bill is important enough to break that agreement then it is important enough to prompt a referendum.</p>

<a name="111021-0002.htm_para10"></a>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a><a name="11102143000505"></a>"Her Majesty must by Order in Council, on the advice of the Prime Minister, cause a referendum to be held".</p>

<p><a name="11102143000458"></a>We then move on to the schedule and the consequential amendments. The schedule comes after Clause 19 and sets out the details of the referendum. I have to admit that I have copied this from the referendum amendment put forward for the Scotland Bill, which is also before your Lordships' House. But I have proposed amendments to my amendment to take into account the fact that we would have a Joint Committee. We have not yet discussed the Joint Committee. The purpose of bringing it in-which I had hoped we would discuss earlier today-is that the Government proposing doing so in their draft  


<notus-date day="21" month="10" year="2011" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_507"></a><b>21 Oct 2011 : Column 507</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>reform Bill, which is in front of the Joint Committee of both Houses. We are caught up in a mess as a result of the rearrangement this morning because the amendments to my amendment concern something that we have not yet discussed. In view of what my noble friend Lord Shutt said, perhaps it would be wise for me not to move the amendments to my amendment until we have discussed the Joint Committee. However, I think that this is a cack-handed way of trying to discuss legislation. It is impossible to do it rationally.</p>

<a name="111021-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="11102143000310"></a>I shall take noble Lords quickly through the schedule. There is, of course, the "Entitlement to vote", which I hope does not cause any problems. We then deal with the conduct of the referendum and the "Referendum question and statement". That is an important part of the schedule because the Order in Council,</p>
<ul><a name="11102143000616"></a>"must specify the question to be included".</ul>
<p><a name="11102143000459"></a>We then come to the date of the referendum, and following that the "Referendum period", which must be determined by the Order in Council. We then have "Combination of polls", the encouragement of voting and the "Provision of information to voters". It is important that one provides the correct information. Indeed, my noble friend Lord Steel probably knows more about referendums than I do, but my noble friend Lord Norton of Louth is probably the man to check that I have all of this right and to his satisfaction. The schedule goes on to deal with "Referendum material" and "Funding and accounts". It deals with legal challenges to the referendum because they could well take place, followed by the "Supplementary" and "Interpretation" provisions. That in brief is the schedule before us. The principle of this is that there should be a referendum when it comes to constitutional reform. I beg to move.</p>

But I have to say to my noble friend that I do not think that that is the case, and I really do not think that it justifies a referendum.</p>

<a name="111021-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="11102143000312"></a>The more interesting issue here is that we do not know whether the committee looking into reform of the House of Lords is going to be able to keep to its timetable, or indeed whether the Government will produce a Bill for the reform of the House of Lords in this Parliament. It may be that they will wait until the next Parliament under whatever Government they are-I assume it will be a Conservative Government-and it is quite likely, if that is the case, that both major parties and indeed the Lib Dems will set out in their manifestos that they favour a wholly or largely elected second Chamber. If all three parties have that in their manifestos, there really is no chance for the country to have a view on it, because there will be no basis on which to have an alternative view on whether this House should be elected or appointed. It is not as if one can choose to say of one party, "I'll vote for that because they put it forward". In that case a referendum might be very worthwhile in deciding whether this nation really wants an elected second Chamber, with all the effect that that will have on another place and the way we manage the constitution of this country.</p>

I am wholly opposed to Amendments 138 and 141 for the simple reason that the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, has enumerated. Earlier someone said that this Bill should not be called the House of Lords Reform Bill, but the "House of Lords Improvement Bill". I could even rename it the "House of Lords Housekeeping Bill". What we are dealing with are three housekeeping matters internal to the House: the question of the election of hereditary Peers, the question of retirement and the question of removing those who commit serious offences. These are matters within the operation of the House and are not at all suitable for a referendum. So I am totally opposed to these provisions.</p>

It is, indeed, a housekeeping Bill. But I am delighted that the noble Viscount agrees with the policy of my party, which is that there should be a referendum on any Bill that comes out of the Joint Committee, which will certainly be a profound constitutional change. In that case, I am certainly in favour of a referendum; in relation to the current Bill, I am opposed.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, will recall that we were both joint treasurers of the Conservative Group for Europe when the European referendum took place. I ended up having to raise very substantial amounts of money because, although the referendum went through, it was very difficult to explain to people what this European lark was all about. In general, people were slightly anti-European. The Labour Party was totally anti-European; when the referendum said that we should go into the EU, it refused to send a delegation to the European Parliament.</p>

<a name="111021-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="11102143000316"></a>My concern about these matters is that it is very difficult to explain things. I speak in my capacity as a member of the Information Committee. We have a major problem, even though we have the outreach programme, in explaining to the outside world what we actually do. It is easier to explain it to young children than it is to those of teenage or later years. I shall use my grandson as an example. He sums it up very brilliantly, by saying that we work at Big Ben and we make rules. That is easier for people to understand-but what does the House of Lords do? In the outreach programme, when you talk to different people, it is very difficult because they all think that we are a bunch of old fogies who do nothing but sit on our backsides and drink tea. This explanation of what we do is very important if a referendum comes up. At the moment, if you were to have another referendum on the EU, you might have some very interesting results. So I am totally opposed to introducing to this Bill the referendum concept at this stage.</p>

It is a modest Bill, which would certainly perplex any electorate if put to it for a referendum.</p>

<a name="111021-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="11102143000318"></a>The point made by the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, is entirely different. I have never been a fan of the referendum; indeed, I did not want a referendum in 1975, and made that view quite plain in another place at the time. But we had it, and you cannot uninvent things. We have reached the situation in this country where we have had referenda on a number of major constitutional issues. We had them over devolution; we had one, which I thought was wholly unnecessary, earlier this year about alternative voting. But if you argue that alternative voting is of sufficient importance constitutionally to merit a referendum, you cannot argue that the abolition of a House of Parliament and its replacement by something totally different-because that is what it would be about-is not a fit subject for a referendum. So if by chance there is a proposal that we should have this House replaced by an elected one, there is an unanswerable case for a referendum, particularly if, as my noble friend indicated, the three major parties subscribe to that general ideal in their manifestos. We know that, whatever was said in the manifestos last time, there are a significant number of Liberal Democrats who are unhappy about the concept of an elected House. There is a very much larger number of Labour voters and Members who are unhappy about an elected House, and there is an overwhelming number of Conservative Peers and a very large number-we do not know how many-of Conservative Members of Parliament who are against it. If the hierarchies and leaders of the three parties put this forward in manifestos, that would be all the more reason for a referendum. That would be on the significant and central issue of whether this House was to be replaced by something different.</p>

<a name="111021-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="11102143000319"></a>Here, I slightly disagree with my noble friend Lord Selsdon. I believe that the people of this country are sufficiently mature and adult to understand if they are being asked to have an assembly of 300 paid, elected party politicians to replace what they have in this House at the moment. If they decide to go down that route, having had the issues thoroughly debated and explained, I would be very sad but so be it. That would certainly be the right subject for a referendum. The noble Baroness's party is right to have that at the heart of its manifesto commitments on this particular issue. I urge my noble friend Lord Selsdon not to press his amendment as far as the Bill is concerned.</p>

It is his amendment.</p>

I thought that that was a major constitutional change and deserved to be put to the House. Sadly, that was not carried. I agree with my noble friend Lord Astor that this is not an appropriate measure for this particular Bill.

They were not all in agreement. My main point is in response to my noble friend Lord Caithness's argument that this is a major constitutional change so should be subject to a referendum. If the Bill constitutes major constitutional change which should be subject to a referendum then we are perfectly entitled to regard it as stage 2 of Lords reform and his objection to getting rid of the by-election option completely falls.</p>

If the noble Lord takes out the removal of the hereditary Peers, then it is not stage 2 of Lords reform. The removal of the hereditary Peers, which breaks a crucial agreement, means that it becomes a major reform. It would be implementing the terms of the 1999 agreement. I have absolutely no doubt that we will talk about this a lot more in the future.</p>

He has expressed some serious concerns about having an elected House. I do not fear that. I agree with the noble Earl, Lord Erroll. It is interesting that once again the hereditary Peers are more reforming than most other noble Lords. That takes me back to the days of my noble friend Lord Carrington, who in 1968 got the agreement of the basically hereditary House to change the way that we operated. That was turned round in the House of Commons. Had that proposal been agreed, I would not have been here for 40 years, nor would my noble friends Lord Selsdon and Lord Trefgarne. I would have missed it by one year and I am the third longest-serving Member of the House speaking today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="11102143000327"></a>Clearly, this amendment does not receive any support at all. That surprises me. If we are allowed a referendum on a decision under the provisions of Article 31(3) of the Treaty on European Union, which permits the adoption of qualified majority, we ought to have a referendum on constitutional change. However, I agree with all those who have said that there must be a referendum on the Government's Bill. I think I said that when we discussed it in your Lordships' House. I am happy to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="111021-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="11102143000329"></a>It would appear that a referendum has not found favour with your Lordships, in respect of this Bill at least, although I agree with my noble friend Lord Caithness that it might well be a good thing to include it in the House of Lords reform Bill being considered by the joint Select Committee. That is for the committee to decide and recommend, and for the future, not for the present.</p>

<a name="111021-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="11102143000330"></a>Simply delaying the introduction of the Bill until after a general election has a similar but rather less profound effect on public consideration of the merits of the proposal, as my noble friend Lord Caithness has said. Following the earlier discussion, the Bill will see the beginning of the end for the hereditary Peers. That may not find favour with the Opposition-I cannot say that for sure-but let us give them the opportunity to say. Accordingly, I propose that the Bill should not come into force until after the first general election following its passage. I beg to move.</p>

The most important part of the Bill that we have been discussing all day, as far as this House is concerned, is getting the numbers down. If we postpone this until after the election, we will sit here with this overcrowded House until after 2015. That is not the will of the House, and I therefore reject the amendment.</p>

I agree with my noble friend that the size of the House and the need to reduce the numbers are important matters. However, the view that we came to in earlier discussions was that what is proposed in the Bill goes a very short way in that direction. We need much more significant proposals for reducing the numbers if that is what we wish to do. My noble friend rejected the idea of an age limit; that did not find favour with him or many others of your Lordships. I suggest that the numbers can be dealt with through something other than the provisions of the Bill, which are not particularly effective in that regard. It is not therefore right to say that we are unreasonably delaying the reduction in numbers.</p>

Although the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, and I take diametrically opposed views on the composition of a future House, we both recognise that there are certain urgent housekeeping duties that should be put into effect in this present House. That is all that my noble friend Lord Steel is seeking to do. To delay it until after the next general election would be an absolute nonsense. We would either then be having the first elections, or we would have nearly another four years of the imperfections which we are currently seeking to put right.</p>

In other words, they have three months in which to come forward with a statutory instrument.

The amendment dealt with that but there are also about 116 amendments dealing with the appointments commission. It is not my wish that we should proceed with those but my noble friends Lord Caithness and Lord Trefgarne have every right, if they wish to, to start the proceedings on 116 amendments and keep us here until 3 o'clock. I appeal to their sense of the mood of the House and the votes that have already been made and to accept that that will not get us anywhere; it would simply mean that the Bill would be talked out. That would be a tragedy because, as I say, we have done good work today. It has been a good humoured debate and I would appeal to them to allow us to move to delete Clauses 1 to 9 of the Bill and we can all go home early.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Steel, thinks that we have done good work because we have done what he wanted us to do. However, for those of us who were thoroughly opposed to Parts 2, 3 and 4 of the Bill, we have done a day's really bad work and it might be quite nice to start working on an appointments commission, which we badly need.

I have to say that we wonder every day whether we have had a good day in this Chamber. It really rather depends which side of the Chamber one is sitting on. Today, I wholeheartedly agree with the noble Lord, Lord Steel, that we have had a good day. The housekeeping matters that we have discussed and agreed upon are extremely important for the working of this House-important for our internal workings, but also in reputational terms for this House.

However, I think I am also right in saying, although it does not say this on the notice of today's business, that this is a provisional grouping and that it is open to anyone to move the amendment where it actually falls in the Bill. In which case, one can perhaps then take Amendment 163 at the end but, in order to get to that, one would need to deal with the matters which are ahead of it.</p>

My noble friends Lord Trefgarne and Lord Caithness have tabled a series of amendments because they are unhappy about the appointments commission. My noble friend Lord Steel wishes to delete all of those clauses, so in that sense there is no difference between us. We have dealt with housekeeping matters. The votes this morning indicated that there was a broad consensus across the House, with all parties and the Cross Benches wanting to see these matters of housekeeping addressed, and addressed expeditiously.</p>

We can then come back on Report and Third Reading, where my noble friend Lord Steel has already indicated that he is more than willing to take on board a number of the important points that have been made by colleagues in all parts of the House. We will then have done what we should rightly do, which is to put our own House in order, which is what this Bill seeks to do.</p>

Therefore, I very much hope that, in the spirit of geniality that has prevailed for most of this debate, we can now draw our proceedings to a conclusion and come back on Report at a fairly early date.</p>

I am not sure that the noble Lord, Lord Cormack, was here at the start when I made a statement about one of the dangers of this. I have heard it said that these are just transitional provisions many times before. It is exactly what was said in 1998 about the 1999 Act, in 1911 and so on. This may not end up being transitional. This could in the end be a long-term Act that stays in place

The end result of this, over the next decade or two, would be a fully appointed House, which is not the wish expressed by a democratic vote of the other place. Therefore, through the backdoor, we have not done what was expected. The hereditary Peers, who were left here to ensure that further democratic reform took place-as was decided in the debates back in 1998-will be got rid of without getting what was desired, which is democratic reform. The problem with that is, if there is no further movement, we will end up with an appointments commission which is not fit for purpose for the future.</p>

We might, through the vagaries of the parliamentary process, end up with this measure being in place for much longer than we expect, in which case it has to have the "i"s dotted and the "t"s crossed. This is very good as a transitional measure at the moment as regards the independent appointments commission, but it has to be improved and tidied up if it is going to stand the test of time over a couple of decades. We need to sort that out. We should not just push this through and say that we are doing a brief tidying-up exercise. That is a sloppy way to legislate. Certainly, if I were a director of a company and behaved like this as regards company governance, I would be fired.</p>

It is not the case that nothing else is happening. The Government have put forward a draft Bill that proposes a much more comprehensive scheme of reform. There is now a Joint Committee sitting on that which has held its first two sessions. That includes the proposal for a statutory appointments committee, so things are moving on a much broader and more comprehensive front. I have carefully noted that a number of the hereditaries who have spoken in this debate have declared their passionate enthusiasm for an 80 per cent or 100 per cent elected House.

That was a little unfair but that is all in the game of politics, and I accept it. He will know that there are also other amendments. The noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, my noble friend Lord Astor and the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, who is not in his place, have tabled amendments. It is therefore not up to my noble friend Lord Trefgarne and me to decide that we can suddenly say, "I give way to the noble Lord, Lord Steel". I repeat that the noble Lord should have discussed his proposal with me previously because I have done a huge amount of work on the first part of the Bill up to Clause 10. I spent many hours preparing these amendments and it is an absolute abuse of any Member of your Lordships' House to be treated in such a way. It is quite wrong.</p>

<a name="111021-0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="11102143000393"></a>I have amendments on not just the appointments commission but I have an amendment to create a Joint Committee on a House of Lords appointments commission. Such a proposal is in the Government's draft Bill and is highly relevant. I want a statutory appointments commission and I am now being denied a chance to debate it-or I am being pressurised by my noble friend Lord Steel not to debate it. However, it is hugely important that we have a statutory commission. As I said right at the beginning, it was my noble friend Lord Steel who wanted a statutory appointments commission. It was he who moved an amendment to the Bill of the noble Lord, Lord Bach, regretting that there was not to be a statutory appointments commission. Now it does not suit my noble friend to have an appointments commission in the Bill because he is so keen to get the rest of it through.</p>

<a name="111021-0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="11102143000394"></a>My noble friend had another opportunity; he could quite legitimately have withdrawn the Bill and introduced another Bill with no provision for a statutory appointments commission. That would have been the right and proper thing to do. The fact is that he quite deliberately did not do that. He deliberately moved a Motion that has made it extremely difficult for us to have a sensible discussion on a lot of the amendments. I do not know what the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, my noble friend Lord Astor or the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, think about their amendments. Having done all the work, I should actually like to get on and discuss my amendments. However, I understand that I am in a minority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="11102143000395"></a>Nevertheless, there is an important principle here. Just because one is in a minority in this House  does not mean that one does not have the right to move amendments, and one should not be unduly

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="11102143000396"></a>Had it been the other way round at the beginning, and the statutory appointments commission had been right at the end, the noble Lord would have had a more valid case. He could have said: "We have got so far, but we are going to hit the magic hour of three o'clock. Don't let's discuss any more". That would be much more logical. I cannot decide alone. For a start, Amendment 1 is important. It contains a purpose clause. It is indeed the clause that the noble Lord, Lord Steel, introduced himself the last time that we discussed this. If he wanted it then, surely he wants it now. These are not matters that can be dismissed lightly. Without the approval of other noble Lords, I cannot make a decision for them. We shall see how we proceed, but I beg to withdraw Amendment 142.</p>

If we say that all the amendments are withdrawn and that we should leave them until Report, there are two issues. First, if Amendment 163 is then voted through, none of the amendments will qualify for Report. Part 1 will not be there any more. If it has been removed from the Long Title, I do not think that Part 1 can exist. Therefore, as none of the amendments can be debated on Report, it is a cunning way of getting rid of them by the back door. Secondly, there will be a very lengthy Report stage.</p>

We will not be rubberstamping something today and in so doing, preclude debate on issues that the noble Earl feels should be debated. It is very simple. We will have a Report stage that will be slightly longer, as with the Localism Bill. We are dealing with it in a tidy and seemly manner. We are anticipating nothing; we are pre-empting nothing.

Would it not be better to adjourn the Committee now and find another comparatively short occasion on which we could complete the Committee stage and thereafter proceed to Report stage in the normal manner?

I am afraid that the noble Lord, Lord Cormack, does not understand that some of our procedures here, although they look the same, are slightly different from those in the other place. The rules for Committee and Report and what you can do at Third Reading matter. If you introduce an amendment for the first time on Report, as the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, said, you can speak to it only once. That does not cause too much trouble: you can get round it with clever interventions. The problem comes if there is something of fairly major consequence that you wish to approach in a different way, because you may not be able to introduce your amendment at Third Reading. There are rules about the similarity of amendments at Report stage. It is far more flexible in Committee and on Report. Our procedures are designed that way. Third Reading is supposed to be only a tidying up operation to address a few little drafting mistakes, although the Government have tended to extend the definition for their own purposes in the past. For us, certainly on a Private Member's Bill, I am quite sure that that latitude would not be permitted by the procedures of the House, so it is very dangerous to postpone to Report stage.</p>

I would have hoped that we would withdraw all these clauses. I will discuss with my noble friends things that they may wish to put back in. I will not move Amendment 163, so it will remain in the Long Title. Noble Lords might wish to put something in on Report on the appointments commission. They might want, for example, to bring it into line with the Government's proposals. I have no idea. But that option is still open to them. It is not true that we cannot debate it. If we leave the Long Title as it is, it will be. As I have said, I will not move Amendment 163 when we get to it. I suggest that we withdraw those clauses and have Not-Content to the clause stand part.</p>

<a name="111021-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="11102141000004"></a>An extraordinary meeting of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council will be held in Brussels on 22 October 2011.</p>

<a name="111021-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="11102141000005"></a>Finance Ministers will discuss preparation of the 23 October European Council.</p>

<a name="111021-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="11102141000006"></a>The current draft European Council conclusions include language on:</p>
 economic policy: growth; energy, research and innovation; investment; economic governance; the European semester; financial regulation; ratification of the European Financial Stability Facility; and external trade; preparation for the Cannes G20 summit; climate change; and foreign policy. 
<a name="111021-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="11102141000007"></a>ECOFIN is likely to focus its attention on the situation in the euro area. I will continue to emphasise the importance of the euro area delivering a truly comprehensive solution to the situation in the euro area, which ring-fences vulnerable euro area countries, recapitalises Europe's banks and resolves uncertainty about Greece, ahead of the G20 summit in Cannes on 3 and 4 November.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="11102141000026"></a>Employment: Work Programme</h2>
<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="11102141000008"></a><b><a name="111021-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="11102141000023"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord Freud):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Chris Grayling) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="111021-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="11102141000009"></a>From 24 October 2011 employment and support allowance claimants eligible to volunteer for the Work Programme will be referred to a Work Programme information session. These claimants include those in the work-related activity group, with a work capability assessment prognosis greater than six months. Other claimants eligible to volunteer for the Work Programme who are not subject to work-related activity can opt to attend an information session, such as those in the support group.</p>

<a name="111021-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="11102141000010"></a>This change seeks to make claimants aware of the opportunities on offer from Work Programme providers. It also gives providers greater ability to reach individual claimants who may not be aware of the support they can access, and helps providers to manage their resources more effectively.</p>

<a name="111021-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="11102141000011"></a>We will introduce these information sessions on a phased basis, beginning on 24 October 2011 in the East Midlands (contract package area 2), with national coverage by the end of November 2011.</p>

<a name="111021-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="11102141000012"></a>We are not prescribing how the sessions should be carried out but providers will have to give the Government clear details about their marketing plans for information sessions (for example, timings, individual or group sessions, and group sizes). Additionally, these information sessions will encourage partnership working between Jobcentre Plus and providers at a local level.</p>

<a name="111021-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="11102141000013"></a>We want claimants to engage with their provider on a voluntary basis. In exceptional circumstances, where a claimant refuses to engage without good reason, the personal adviser can require them to attend an information session.</p>

<a name="111021-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="11102141000014"></a>When a claimant decides to volunteer for the Work Programme, they will be participating in it for up to two years, so providers have a real chance to address the serious disadvantages some of our claimants face in the labour market.</p>

<a name="111021-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="11102141000015"></a>When claimants have attended their information session they will follow up with their Jobcentre Plus personal adviser to agree next steps.</p>

<a name="111021-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="11102141000017"></a>I am publishing today a joint Department of  Health and Ministry of Justice response to the public  consultation on an offender personality disorder pathway implementation plan, which was completed on 17 May 2011.</p>

<a name="111021-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="11102141000018"></a>The consultation set out the Government's plans to reshape services, interventions and treatments for offenders with severe personality disorders. There were 91 responses to the consultation almost all of which supported the proposed approach.</p>

<a name="111021-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="11102141000019"></a>The Government will now begin to take forward the pathway approach, which will enable the complex needs of high risk offenders to be addressed more effectively. We will start to decommission the dangerous and severe personality disorder (DSPD) pilot sites in the NHS, the first being the unit based in Broadmoor high secure psychiatric hospital. The patients currently being held in these facilities will continue to be treated in the level of security necessary for the risk they present and no individual will be moved to a lower level of security as a result of these changes. Professional judgments on an individual's appropriate level of security will continue to be made as part of the normal assessment arrangements.</p>

<a name="111021-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="11102141000020"></a>The new pathway will enable the complex needs of high risk offenders to be addressed more effectively. Interventions and treatment will be provided earlier and in the most suitable locations, additional support will be given to those who have completed programmes and ongoing supervision will be enhanced. These plans

We most recently raised our concerns about the harassment of journalists with the Iranian Charge d'Affaires in London on 12 October. The EU Foreign Affairs Council also condemned Iranian repression of journalists on 10 October, and announced additional sanctions against Iranian officials responsible for serious human rights abuses.</p>

EROs will also be required to take all necessary steps for the purpose of ensuring that, so far as reasonably practicable, the persons who are entitled to be registered in a register (and no others) are registered in it.

However, as the UK power sector is part of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS) which has placed a cap on emissions, any carbon savings achieved in the UK power sector have to be netted off by lower carbon abatement elsewhere in the EU-ETS.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_14"></a><a name="11102142000029"></a>The extent of carbon savings is dependent upon the assumed generation mix, which is dependent upon  a range of factors, including fossil fuel and carbon prices, the economics of electricity generation, technological progress, and policies pursued (including those designed to meet climate change targets) . DECC models different generation scenarios in order to develop policy, rather than forecasting a specific generation mix. The net carbon savings will depend on the scenario used.</p>

<a name="111021w0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_15"></a><a name="11102142000030"></a>For example, in DECC's recently published <I>Updated Energy Projections</I> central baseline scenario, 411 TWh of electricity is estimated to be supplied from wind (onshore and offshore) in the next 10 years (2011-20). If we assume this displaces generation from the marginal plant<sup>1</sup> it translates to 15MtCO2 net carbon savings. In this scenario, there is no new nuclear forecast until 2022. This scenario does not include the impacts of any proposed electricity market reform measures.</p>

<a name="111021w0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_16"></a><a name="11102142000031"></a>By contrast, under the central scenario commissioned by DECC from the consultancy Redpoint (to inform the electricity market reform White Paper and including EMR policy options), 445TWh of electricity is supplied from wind and 38TWh of electricity from new nuclear in the next 10 years (2011-20).

This grant would be paid to Basildon District Council after the clearance operation has been completed and upon receipt of a statement of expenditure on costs incurred. The Home Office has agreed to provide contingency funding up to a maximum of £4.65 million should the costs of the policing operation exceed the level at which the costs are able to be managed by the police force from within their existing resources. This is in line with the approach taken to providing support to any force facing exceptional or unforeseen pressures that would otherwise threaten their financial stability. The Government's decisions to contribute towards Basildon District Council's costs and policing costs relating to the clearance of unauthorised pitches at Dale Farm were made under the normal processes for considering such payments, which includes consideration of any legal and financial issues. We have found no record of Basildon District Council's having shared with Her Majesty's Government any legal advice in relation to the clearance of unauthorised pitches at Dale Farm.</p>
