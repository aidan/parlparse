National Grid is responsible for ensuring adequate and reliable network capacity and for carrying out the residual electricity balancing activity. The electricity network has been well over 99.99 per cent reliable in recent years and National Grid indicates that for the summer and coming winter demand should be met in full in all but the most extreme circumstances.</p>

Does he agree that at least 10 years are likely to elapse before large new generating capacity, whether nuclear or other, to replace the present ageing capacity can come into operation and that the major impact of the recently announced renewable energy strategy will also occur at about the same time? Is it not a fact that most of the Government&#146;s energy policy declarations have been of a long-term nature? In those circumstances, is there not a case for an urgent review of short-term electricity prospects, with a view to the maintenance of security of supply and the avoidance of any further system failures?</p>

Significant new generation capacity is already being delivered. By 2010, 8 gigawatts of new capacity presently under construction should be available. There is already consent for 2.5 gigawatts more and there are outstanding applications for consent for almost another 4.5 gigawatts. That amounts to 15 gigawatts, which is equivalent to around 20 per cent of current generation capacity. Of course, I understand the problems that the noble Lord mentioned, which the Government are addressing.</p>

What will fill that 40 per cent gap? Even if we start building nuclear tomorrow morning, it is too late now for us to fill the gap with nuclear. There is talk of more gas, although the Russians are tricky suppliers. The idea that wind farms can fill the gap is totally unrealistic. What will fill the gap to prevent real power cuts and electricity rationing?</p>

Indeed, by 2020, our electricity generating system will need to be larger than at present in order to provide back-up for wind generation. However, the central scenario of the renewable energy strategy, which I had hoped that the party opposite would support, sees an investment of around 30 gigawatts of new renewable capacity and a further 17 gigawatts of new conventional capacity. I am sorry that the party opposite seems to have turned its head against any new coal-fired power stations because, as part of the mix, it is essential that we should consider having some of those, too.</p>

That is the way in which at least 78 more enlightened countries now enjoy a reliable grid and lighter winter evenings. Where is the statistical proof that the darker evenings policy, which his Government and the Opposition have pursued since 1971, has reduced by one iota the winter peak load, household electric bills, road deaths or the grid&#146;s ever increasing carbon footprint?</p>

We have also helped Sudan, with an extra &#163;40 million contributed to the UN common humanitarian plan.

That mess needs to be cleared up before the Olympics. One such mess is South Kensington Underground station. Transport for London seems to speak with two voices; one is that of property development, which says that we have to build a Shangri-La over the top of the station; the other is the operating side, which says that we have to clean the whole thing up. Can we please issue guidance to Transport for London, saying that it should forget Shangri-La, clean up the mess in South Kensington Underground station and get it operational in time for the Olympics?</p>

I understand that South Kensington station has been the subject of protracted disputation over several years. My current understanding is that London Underground Ltd wishes and needs to upgrade the station and therefore an improvements programme is being prepared, which is scheduled to start towards the end of 2009. The programme is likely to comprise the partial enlargement of the ticket hall; the provision of step-free access, such as lifts for those with a mobility impairment; the

I also understand that it is consulting on wider redevelopment outside and above ground, involving part of the station building, which is grade 2 listed. That consultation is being undertaken in conjunction with the local Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.</p>

There was originally a major plan of new cycle routes and walkways to the Stratford Olympics. Is that still there and will it be retained?</p>

We are happy with how the transport plan is progressing. My understanding is that in 2012 there will be 10 railway lines, with one train every 15 seconds serving the Olympic Park. That is 240 trains an hour, making Stratford one of the best-connected locations in the world. That gives a flavour of how people will travel to the Olympic Games.</p>

The families of these casualties are entitled to ask whether lives are being lost because of a chronic shortage of helicopters, leading to the use of high-risk vehicles on the ground. Does the Minister not recognise that the Government&#146;s decision in 2004 to cut the helicopter budget by &#163;1.4 billion was absolutely inexcusable? These young men and women who engage on our behalf in a vicious war in Afghanistan deserve maximum support. What are the Government&#146;s plans to provide them urgently with more airframes, more pilots and more local ground support?</p>

He is right that there have been a significant number of deaths recently. That is regretted by the whole House. He is not right to suggest that there is a link between the ground vehicles that we have and the helicopters, in terms of who will be transporting people in these circumstances. We have to have a range of transport available and commanders on the ground have to judge, in difficult circumstances, what is the most appropriate vehicle and whether it is appropriate for people to be moved in helicopters. Helicopters cannot be used for all types of movement. They would not be the appropriate means of transport for people engaged in patrols or dealing with local communities. Such decisions have to be taken on the ground. We are supplying more helicopter flying hours than ever before; there has been a 30 per cent increase in them since March 2007.</p>

We have put a lot of money into personal and vehicle protection, and, as I have just mentioned, we have increased helicopter flying hours in Afghanistan by over 33 per cent. We are investing &#163;6 billion in helicopters over the next 10 years, which is &#163;1 billion more than was anticipated when we last looked at the figures in 2006.

<p><a name="08070255000389"></a>In fact, the Bill gives the Government an unlimited power to increase the income on which ordinary national insurance contributions are payable with only the minimal constraint of an affirmative resolution. My amendments are designed to ensure that the Bill sticks to its original stated purpose: the simplification of the thresholds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="08070255000116"></a>Under the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, the Government can set the upper earnings threshold&#151;the point at which employees stop paying ordinary national insurance contributions&#151;at an amount between six and a half and seven and a half times the primary threshold, which is the point at which ordinary national insurance contributions begin.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="08070255000117"></a>The Government&#146;s policy, as set out by the Prime Minister in his last Budget as Chancellor in April 2007, is to continue to align the primary threshold with the personal allowance for tax purposes and to align the upper earnings limit with the point at which higher rate tax is paid. This would create a neat symmetry between income tax and national insurance and should be easier for tax and national insurance payers to understand. We do not object to the policy, even though it means that the Government are able to hike the upper earnings limit way above inflation and, in so doing, raise a large amount&#151;around &#163;1.5 billion a year&#151;from middle-income earners.</p>

<a name="80702-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="08070255000118"></a>Noble Lords will recall that the April 2007 Budget had a package of changes to income tax and national insurance tax, including the abolition of the 10p rate of tax. The further changes, which the Chancellor announced in late April in the face of the Crewe  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_244"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column 244</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by-election defeat and a Back-Bench revolt in another place, mess about with the convergence of the income tax and national insurance thresholds. The personal allowance is now &#163;600 above the primary threshold, so that national insurance contributions are paid on that amount even through no income tax is paid. The higher-rate threshold has been moved down by &#163;600, although that means that the higher-rate threshold is now closer to the upper earnings limit.</p>

<a name="80702-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="08070255000119"></a>The Chancellor has said that these changes to the income tax thresholds are for this year only. We on these Benches simply do not understand how that can happen, since more than 13 million families would be affected, mostly adversely, by the reversal of this year&#146;s changes. However, we are told to wait for this year&#146;s Pre-Budget Report to find out how the Government will achieve this.</p>

<a name="80702-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="08070255000120"></a>The Government have been even less clear about what that means for harmonisation with national insurance thresholds, but they have restated their commitment to harmonisation. The amendments allow the Government to achieve harmonisation next year at whatever levels the Chancellor sets in the PBR. That is what they said that they wanted when the Bill was introduced.</p>

<a name="80702-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="08070255000121"></a>The Government said that they needed the Bill to remove the limit on the upper earnings limit by reference to a multiple of the primary threshold, so that they could achieve the harmonisation of the upper earnings limit with the higher rate threshold for tax purposes. Recent history shows that in the face of political difficulties the Government will abandon harmonisation whenever it suits them. There is a legitimate question about whether the Government have the will to achieve harmonisation. The amendments give the Government the benefit of the doubt; but in so doing we do not believe that it is appropriate or reasonable for a constraint at the top end of the national insurance thresholds to be removed for all time, subject only to the affirmative resolution procedure.</p>

<a name="80702-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08070255000122"></a>That leaves workers open to the ultimate stealth tax of national insurance contributions being raised at 11 per cent on all earned income. I remind the House that this is not fanciful; it was mainstream Labour Party policy until the mid-1990s. Let me put it in context. The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, received a Written Answer on 21 May to a Question about the revenues that would be generated by the removal of the upper earnings limit. The Answer can be found at col. <I>WA</I><I></I><I>204</I><I></I>of <I>Hansard</I> of that day. Noble Lords might like to take a deep breath before hearing that the Bill would allow the Government to raise &#163;8.5 billion in extra class 1 national insurance contributions. That is the equivalent of nearly 3p on the basic rate of tax, or raising all the personal allowances and the basic rate limit by about 15 per cent.</p>

<a name="80702-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08070255000123"></a>My amendments do not stop the Government dispensing with the 6.5 to 7.5 times formula for next year. They can complete the convergence that they have planned. But from 2010-11, we have taken the Government at their word in wanting to harmonise the thresholds and then keep them in step. The amendments would mean that the upper earnings limit after 2009-10 would keep pace with the higher rate threshold for tax purposes. That threshold is  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_245"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column 245</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>uprated each year by RPI, by what is known as the Rooker-Wise process, named after an amendment moved successfully by the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, when he was in another place. An uprating order in conformity with Amendment No. 2 would do exactly the same thing for the upper earnings limit.</p>

<a name="80702-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08070255000124"></a>If the Government wanted to raise the amount by even more than RPI, which they may want to do from time to time, for example, because they want to raise the overall limits and thresholds in income tax and wish to harmonise at a higher level, they would have to bring forward a one-clause or two-clause Bill prior to the start of the tax year. As I explained in Committee, there would be plenty of time for that after the Pre-Budget Report, which each autumn announces all the rates and thresholds for the following tax year. However, such a procedure would clearly be the exception rather than the rule, since the higher rate threshold would generally follow the Rooker-Wise uprating path.</p>

<a name="80702-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08070255000125"></a>I moved a beta version of the amendments in Grand Committee. The Minister pointed out that it would be over-egging the pudding to have had a largely automatic uprating process as well as the affirmative procedure and, as I promised him in Grand Committee, I have removed the latter. The Minister also helpfully pointed out that my Committee amendment would have meant rather too many one-clause Bills because of the mismatch between the weekly basis of national insurance contributions and annual tax allowances. So I have added a step three to the calculation, which is set out in Amendment No. 2.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80702-0003.htm"/>


<a name="80702-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08070255000126"></a>I have modelled the impact of varying rates of inflation and varying levels of income tax thresholds. If the Treasury wants to set the upper earnings limit at one-52nd of the higher rate threshold, rounded to the nearest pound, the amount that is produced by steps one and two of my amendment would need to be altered at most by an extra &#163;2 up or down. Two pounds will in fact be the exception as there would generally be an adjustment of nothing or plus or minus &#163;1. I also tested out the position if the Treasury wanted to round the one-52nd calculation up by one to the nearest &#163;1, which is perhaps a more natural stance for the Treasury. That produces no requirement to reduce the amount arrived at in step 2 at all and at most a &#163;2 upward increase would be required. Hence step 3 of Amendment No. 2 gives the Secretary of State power to alter the amount arrived at in step 1&#151;which is RPI indexation rounded up to the nearest pound&#151;by up to &#163;2 for the purposes of harmonisation. I believe that this gives the Government all the powers they need to avoid unnecessary legislation while allowing them to fulfil their aims of simplification.</p>

<a name="80702-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08070255000127"></a>Most importantly, my amendment would protect National Insurance payers from a Government running short of budgetary options and being tempted by the opportunity that this Bill would otherwise present. I beg to move.</p>

What the amendments seek to address is an important principle, which is that you should not be able to make a significant change to tax or national insurance without  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_246"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column 246</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>primary legislation. As the noble Baroness has said, if this Bill goes through unamended, it will be possible for the Government to make a tax raid of &#163;8.5 billion without requiring primary legislation to implement it. That seems to us to be an unacceptable basis on which to proceed.</p>

<a name="80702-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08070255000129"></a>The Government argue that we are being too squeamish and that parliamentary scrutiny is adequate&#151;or would be adequate even in those circumstances&#151;because the Government would have to introduce an affirmative resolution statutory instrument to implement the change. Our contention is that a statutory instrument does not give adequate parliamentary scrutiny for a change of this nature. Those who have participated in statutory instrument debates know that they are of a different type from normal debates on the Floor of the House except in very rare circumstances. The possibility of amending a statutory instrument is nil. The possibility of overturning a statutory instrument is extremely small. Incidentally, if one should attempt to do so, the Government always make the case that it is a constitutional outrage that one should try to do it. Frankly, therefore, we do not believe that the argument that the statutory instrument is a sufficient safeguard in terms of Parliament&#146;s rights and powers is adequate.</p>

<a name="80702-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08070255000130"></a>If one takes that view, how can one constrain the Government? The noble Baroness has come forward with a relatively straightforward approach. In some respects it mirrors the Rooker-Wise amendments and we are extremely sorry that we do not have the benefit of the advice of the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, this afternoon as to whether he thinks this would be an appropriate addition to the Rooker-Wise principle. However, it is a straightforward way of proceeding. Why would the Government object to it?</p>

<a name="80702-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="08070255000131"></a>The principal arguments advanced by the Government are essentially practical. No doubt they have technical issues about the drafting of the amendment, but the practical argument they advance, which has some substance, is that, because national insurance is collected on a weekly rather than an annual basis, and because for that purpose you have to legislate for changes in national insurance before rather than during the year in which the changes come into effect, you run into huge problems because you will not have time to legislate for changes in cases where the threshold is going up by more than the rate of inflation before the end of February, when the national insurance changes have to come in.</p>

<a name="80702-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="08070255000132"></a>This is not an insuperable problem: there are at least two ways round it. First, the Chancellor could announce changes for the following year&#146;s Budget, as he did last year. Noble Lords will remember that he did that with the abolition of the 10p rate&#151;he just did it a year early. You could announce that in a Budget in, say, March and the legislation for national insurance for the following tax year could be introduced in, or around the same time as, the Finance Bill for the first year. The second option, as currently happens anyway, would be simply to announce it at the time of the Pre-Budget Report, leaving aside the problem of ridiculously late Queen&#146;s Speeches. If we had the Pre-Budget Report after the Queen&#146;s Speech, a Bill could

It could be argued that taking a Bill through its normal stages in both Houses takes quite a long time. However, given that the kind of Bill that we are talking about would be relatively rare, that it would have probably no more than one or two clauses and that the likelihood of your Lordships&#146; House seeking significantly to change the threshold rate for what is in effect a tax is small, it would be perfectly possible to concertina parliamentary scrutiny of such a Bill into three months&#151;November, December and January&#151;without too much difficulty. I do not believe that this is an insuperable problem.</p>

<a name="80702-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08070255000133"></a>When we discussed this in Committee, the Minister said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="08070255000405"></a>&#147;Programming Bills into the system is often not that easy, particularly with the competing priorities that always confront Governments&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08070255000390"></a>It is not necessarily easy but nobody said that life was easy. This would probably be a relatively infrequent occurrence, and I am sure that the Chancellor would be able to persuade the Legislative Programme Committee to include such a Bill. The Minister raised a second objection about parliamentary scrutiny. He said that this,</p>
<ul><a name="08070255000451"></a>&#147;would amount to a huge increase in parliamentary oversight&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 9/6/08; col. GC 117.]</ul>
<p><a name="08070255000391"></a>That is a good basis on which to proceed. We are therefore happy to support the amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08070255000135"></a>The Government are in a great fiscal hole and the temptation to use the increase in the national insurance threshold is going to be almost irresistible for the Chancellor.

<a name="80702-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08070255000136"></a>National insurance contributions are one of the great frauds perpetrated on the people of this country. They are called national insurance contributions but they are in fact a tax by any other name, and their impact is as a tax. It is commendable that the Government have gone down the road of simplification. The reduction in the basic rate of income tax to 20p and the abolition of the 10p band was a great step forward in terms of simplification. It all went wrong, of course, because they did not raise the threshold to the level of the 10p band and as a result the Government are in their current difficulties, including those that arise because of the lack of cash. I would be prepared to wager quite a lot that two things will happen between now and the end of the year: first, we will have a new Chancellor of the Exchequer and, secondly, his successor will increase the national insurance threshold in order to get the cash to achieve that purpose. The Government&#146;s declared  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_248"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column 248</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>policy, which they abandoned, was to align the rates of national insurance and income tax; that was a good simplification measure in that it made life easier for employers and those responsible for calculating what used to be called stoppages from people&#146;s pay.</p>

<a name="80702-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08070255000137"></a>It is, however, a bit of a halfway house. The real prize is to integrate national insurance and tax and have a universal taxation system. There are great problems with that because of the impact on pensioners. I can also see that that would present great political difficulties for any Government. However, with the best will in the world, the Government&#146;s credentials as committed simplifiers are getting a little worn, not least because the Chancellor&#146;s predecessor, the Prime Minister, seemed reluctant to stick to a policy and pursue it with a degree of confidence and predictability which would make life easier for the business community. All the arguments that the Minister made against this at an earlier stage of the Bill, to which my noble friend referred, particularly those about national insurance being paid weekly and so on, are for integration in the long term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08070255000138"></a>I support my noble friend. These amendments are an important protection. I cannot for the life of me imagine why any Government would wish to resist them unless there is a hidden agenda to raise the burden of taxation, which, at the moment, would be catastrophic for the many families up and down the land who are already struggling to pay their bills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="08070255000140"></a>I shall start by making a few general comments to pick up on some of the points. The noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, talked about the current UK tax burden, but in every year since 1997 and throughout the forecast period of the previous Budget the tax-to-GDP ratio has been well below the peaks reached in the mid-1980s.</p>

<a name="80702-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="08070255000141"></a>The noble Baroness said that this was represented as being part of a simplification package. Indeed, that is exactly what it is; it was not a tax-raising measure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="08070255000144"></a>Just to put it clearly on the record, the proposal to align the national insurance rate was part of a simplification package which, as we know, dealt with the 10p rate of income tax. It reduced the basic rate of income tax from 22p to 20p; it increased the upper earnings limit for national insurance by &#163;75 a week above indexation; it raised the aligned higher-rate threshold and upper earnings limit by &#163;800 a year above indexation; it raised personal allowances for  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_249"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column 249</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>pensioners by &#163;1,180; it raised the threshold of the working tax credit by &#163;1,200; and it increased the threshold of working tax credit to make work pay. The net cost of that to the Exchequer was &#163;2.2 billion, before the additional cost that ensued as a result of the increased personal allowance.</p>

<a name="80702-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="08070255000145"></a>The noble Baroness said that she did not disagree with the policy, and I believe that was echoed by the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth. I welcome those comments, but if you do not disagree with the policy then you achieve it by one of two ways or a combination of them: either you raise the upper earnings limit for national insurance contributions or you reduce the limit of the basic rate of tax. You cannot do it any other way. One way or another, if the noble Baroness supports this policy, I presume that she is saying that she would have done the same sort of thing.</p>

<a name="80702-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="08070255000146"></a>I shall come on to the issue of stealth taxes in a moment but perhaps I may go back to the specifics of the amendment. As has been explained, its objective is to allow the UEL to be aligned with the higher-rate tax threshold for income tax for the 2009-10 tax year announced in the Budget. Perhaps I can confirm that, as I think that the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, said that we had abandoned that principle. The Government remain committed in principle to aligning more closely the income tax personal allowance with the national insurance primary threshold and the national insurance contributions system to improve fairness and coherence, reduce administrative burdens and make them easier to understand. We await further announcements from the Chancellor at the PBR, but that remains the policy.</p>

<a name="80702-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="08070255000147"></a>The amendment goes on to propose the insertion of new Section 5A into the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act to apply for 2010-11 and subsequent years. The new Section 5A would allow the upper earnings limit to be increased by RPI and rounded up to the nearest pound. The UEL could then be adjusted by an amount not exceeding &#163;2 for the purposes of aligning the annualised upper earnings limit with the sum of the personal allowance and the basic rate limit under Sections 20 and 35 of the Income Tax Act 2007 for the tax year. This would provide a maximum adjustment of &#163;106 in any tax year. I have not done the same calculations as the noble Baroness has on the range in which that threshold works, but I accept what she says.</p>

<a name="80702-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="08070255000148"></a>I should like, first, to address the main difficulty with the amendment. I think that it was brushed aside by the noble Lord, Lord Newby, but it is real. Under this formula, from 2010-11 the UEL can be raised only by up to an increase related to the RPI and only if the personal allowance and basic rate limit are correspondingly increased by the RPI. A difficulty would arise should the Chancellor decide that it would be appropriate for the personal allowance and/or basic rate limit to be changed by a figure other than the change in the RPI, and other than that automatically allowed under the Rooker-Wise convention&#151;I hesitate to say this in the absence of my noble friend, and I hope that he does not read the record, but I think that that convention should more strictly be called the Rooker-Wise-Lawson convention&#151;and to make the necessary changes through the Finance Bill. If such a

<a name="80702-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08070255000149"></a>The second major difficulty with the amendment is one of timing. NICs regulations have to be in place for the start of the tax year because contributions are paid on an earnings-period basis. However, if the tax thresholds were increased by more than the RPI through a Finance Bill, they would have not received Royal Assent until after the NICs UEL regulations were needed. In some circumstances, you might change the whole budgetary process and try to do that a year or two in advance, but as a practical, ongoing basis for dealing with fiscal policy I do not think that that is realistic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08070255000150"></a>Even if the first difficulty could be overcome, a further NICs Bill would be needed to deliver the sought-after alignment. As changes to social security legislation require programme Bills, it is unlikely that a slot for a Bill could be found at such short notice or that it would complete its passage through Parliament in time for the regulations to be in place for the start of the following tax year so as to enable employers to make deductions of NICs at the new level.</p>

<a name="80702-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08070255000151"></a>In my view, it would not be a sensible use of limited parliamentary time to have a short NICs Bill every time we wanted to change the UEL by less or more than the RPI. As I have explained, the rounding rule in step 3 of proposed new Section 5A could provide insufficient flexibility. I do not believe that it would be a sensible use of limited parliamentary time to have a NICs programme Bill every time we wanted to make that change. If such a restriction had been in existence over the past 20 years, it would have necessitated a further two NICs Bills between 1997 and the 2007 Budget and a further seven NICs Bills in the 10 years preceding 1997 when either the personal allowance or the basic rate limit was increased by either less or more than the RPI.</p>

<a name="80702-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="08070255000152"></a>I am bound to say to the noble Baroness and her colleagues who accuse us of stealth taxes that those were serial freezes of the basic rate limit and the personal allowance. The basic rate limit was frozen in 1991, 1992-93, 1993-94 and 1994-95. It was overindexed in 1996-97, which coincided with an election, but over that 10-year period adopting this formulation would have required seven programme Bills, so there are practical difficulties to be faced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="08070255000153"></a>I will touch on some minor technical flaws, which could readily be put right. The first is that the amendment requires the Secretary of State for the DWP to determine the level of adjustment; it would have to be the Treasury. In addition, the Budget resolution that moves the basic rate limit is in Section 10(5) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and not Section 20. Those flaws could be fixed.</p>

<a name="80702-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="08070255000154"></a>I would also like to return to the rounding formula in step 3. As I mentioned earlier, that allows the UEL to be adjusted by an amount not exceeding &#163;2 for the purposes of aligning the annualised upper earnings limit with the sum of the personal allowance and basic rate limit, meaning an adjustment of &#163;106 at the maximum. As no provision has been made to uprate  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_251"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column 251</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the &#163;2 amount, it will inevitably lead to a reduction in the flexibility of setting the UEL over time and primary legislation will be needed to amend it. Coupled with proposed new Section 5A, the requirement for affirmative procedures on regulations for setting the upper earnings limit amounts to a huge increase in parliamentary oversight.</p>

<a name="80702-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08070255000155"></a>If affirmative resolutions are brushed aside as having no significance, why are we as a Government often pressed to change a negative process into an affirmative one when debating Bills? The scare story is that the Delegated Powers Committee spends a lot of time looking at these things yet we brush it aside, and that this is about the potential to raise &#163;8.5 billion without proper parliamentary scrutiny. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, said that these debates were not routine, except in rare circumstances. If the Government were attempting to raise such money in the way that the noble Lord suggested, do you seriously not think that the House would vote down that proposition? Of course it would. There is protection built in.</p>

<a name="80702-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08070255000156"></a>I do not see that that the change proposed in the Bill should give anyone cause for concern in terms of parliamentary scrutiny. The House always considers extremely carefully affirmative resolutions that come before it. The Delegated Powers Committee has expressed no concerns about the powers in the Bill. That committee is diligent in the way that it goes about its work. We are frequently on the receiving end of its recommendations. It made no adverse comment on the powers.</p>

<a name="80702-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08070255000157"></a>The Chancellor has said that he will return to the tax and NIC rates and limits for future years in the PBR. The commitment remains to align the UEL with the level at which higher rate tax becomes payable. In the context of the Government&#146;s commitment to aligning the UEL with the higher rate tax threshold, the amendments do not work because they could lead to misalignment which would require a further NIC programme Bill. I therefore urge, without any great prospect, the noble Baroness and the noble Lord not to press their amendments.</p>

I thank the noble Lord, Lord Newby, for his support for the amendments. What he said put a lie to the practical issues that the Minister raised about how difficult it would be to bring forward legislation on a short-term basis. We do not see that as a huge issue. The PBR is not tied to the Queen&#146;s Speech. It often comes early, as it did last year. There is plenty of time for a Bill to get through. The Minister said that the Bill had to be programmed, but who programmes Bills? The Government do, and it is easy for them to do so. The Minister said that historically there would have been a requirement for several Bills. Having indexation on the face of the Bill may provide an incentive for Government not to go through the performance of trying to mess around with the levels each and every year. When the Chancellor wants to realign income tax and national insurance, a special Bill would have to be brought forward. If that alignment were reasonable, I am sure that both Houses would co-operate with Government in seeing that through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08070255000159"></a>My noble friend Lord Forsyth, whom I thank for his support, pointed out that the real problem with this Bill is the irresistible temptation that it provides the Government to do away with or to increase significantly the upper earnings limit and thereby raise large amounts of what is in fact taxation, but which we have to call income tax. He is quite right to say that it is a form of fraud. This latest increase raises, as I said, &#163;1.5 billion. It will go into the National Insurance Fund, which is already in surplus because national insurance contributions have been raised by an amount greater than needed for the purposes of the fund.</p>

<a name="80702-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08070255000160"></a>We do not see the affirmative procedure as providing anything like the protection of primary legislation for those who pay national insurance. The amendments are entirely reasonable because they give no limit to what the Government can do next year. The Government can realign as they want next year. I have been entirely reasonable in giving the Government headway to do the alignment and then to let indexation kick in and protect national insurance payers after that.</p>

But I make no complaint: with a bit of luck we can speed up a bit through the rest of the day. Under Clause 55, when an employee is sacked because the employer has leant on him in one direction or another about auto-enrolment, that will be unfair dismissal. That is a summary of the clause as I understand it.</p>

<a name="80702-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="08070255000177"></a>I have tabled a simple, probing amendment. It would seem that subsections (1)(a) and (b) of proposed new Section 104D of the Employment Rights Act 1996 are in direct contradiction to subsection (2)(a). They appear to say that a requirement that does not apply in favour of an employee could be enforced as if it were. It is quite possible that I have totally misread this clause. If I have, I have no doubt that the Minister will explain how and why. I beg to move.</p>

Clause 55 provides a new day-one employment right for employees not to be unfairly dismissed on grounds related to membership of a qualifying pension scheme. This protection will cover circumstances in which employees are dismissed for claiming entitlements to save in a qualifying workplace pension as a result of the new employer duties introduced under our reform. As with existing unfair dismissal rights, we want that protection to extend to employees who are dismissed for making a claim to such an entitlement, even if it is an incorrect claim, provided that it is made in good faith. That is what proposed new Section 104D(2) of the Employment Rights Act, as inserted by Clause 55, would do.</p>

<a name="80702-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="08070255000179"></a>The noble Lord&#146;s amendment would remove the provision, which would mean that employees would not be able to claim unfair dismissal in relation to the new duties in certain circumstances. For example, an employee earning below the qualifying earnings band, who was dismissed for asking his or her employer automatically to enrol them into a qualifying scheme, would not be able to claim unfair dismissal. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, will agree that this effect would not be desirable.</p>

<a name="80702-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="08070255000180"></a>Government Amendment No. 109A is a drafting amendment that puts right an inconsistency in the wording of proposed new Section 104D of the Employment Rights Act, as inserted by Clause 55(2). The amendment clarifies that it is a Chapter 1 requirement and that its enforcement should be referred to rather than rights. That makes the approach in Clause 55 consistent with the approach in Clause 53. I therefore would ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="08070255000188"></a>The noble Baroness said: This part of the Bill deals with advice. Clearly, it is necessary that people who are involved in securing their pension entitlement should have access to good advice. Indeed, the clause lists the various types of people who could be approached for advice. I want to add to this list a person appointed by The Pensions Advisory Service because I would like to draw attention to a really rather remarkable advisory service.</p>

<a name="80702-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08070255000189"></a>The service was established originally some 20 years ago as a charity. I was involved from its inception until last year, when my term of office came to an end. The intention was to set up a countrywide network of professionally trained people who would be prepared to offer free advice to individuals. It has operated on that basis ever since. These professionally qualified individuals consist in the main of people who have retired from working in the pensions and financial services industry, often on quite good pensions themselves, and want to give something back by utilising their professional qualifications to assist their fellow citizens.</p>

<a name="80702-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08070255000190"></a>The service has operated in that way for a long time. It has ceased to be the charitable organisation it once was; for quite some time it received funding via the Occupational Pensions Board and then via OPRA. It now receives financial assistance via the DWP, although we were very keen to ensure that when we came under the aegis of the DWP we nevertheless maintained our independence.</p>

<a name="80702-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08070255000191"></a>The Pensions Advisory Service is, as I said, a countrywide set-up of independently qualified people who are willing to give their services free to individuals and do so on a very successful basis. I therefore think it would be a good idea if this suggestion were to be written into the Bill. It may be said that it can be done via regulations, which is perfectly true. However, now that the service comes under the aegis of the DWP and its status is formally recognised, it would be a good idea if this proposal could be written into the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

I agree that, where a case of employment law goes to the employment tribunals, advice must be given before the complainant goes to such a tribunal. Since we are talking about pensions in this case, that advice should be given by someone with relevant experience. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Turner. However, I wonder whether this matter is not covered in subsection (6), which provides that a person is a relevant adviser if they work at an advice centre or, under paragraph (d), if they are,</p>
<ul><a name="08070255000452"></a>&#147;a person of a description specified in an order made by the Secretary of State&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08070255000392"></a>Either of those could apply, but I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, that this matter is so vital that it should be expressed in the Bill. I therefore support her.</p>

I hesitated about whether to speak. Although in the context of the Thoresen review this is only one of many areas in which advice may be needed, it seems that identifying TPAS by name may give a signal&#151;it is not a word that I like to use&#151;that TPAS is an appropriate body, agency or resource for other and wider areas of financial information and advice. In that context, it would be helpful if the Minister could give a positive answer.</p>

I thank other noble Lords, too, for their contributions. Before I discuss the amendment, let me acknowledge the valuable role that TPAS plays in providing information and guidance to members of the public on a wide range of pension-related issues. It helps thousands of people each year and is successful in helping to resolve issues that are brought to it. My noble friend has given long and distinguished service in that cause, as my noble friend Lady Hollis is now doing.</p>

<a name="80702-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08070255000196"></a>The amendment is to Clause 56, which specifies the conditions regulating compromise agreements under the Act. Under them, it is possible for employer and worker to agree to limit or exclude the employer duties or individual rights arising from these reforms. This is possible only in very limited circumstances relating to conciliation proceedings. One of the conditions is that an individual must have received advice from a relevant independent adviser on the terms and effect of the proposed agreement and on the ability to pursue their rights before an employment tribunal. The Bill lists at Clause 56(6) the types of person who can act as a relevant independent adviser. This includes qualified lawyers and certified trade union officials. The amendment

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80702-0005.htm"/>


<a name="80702-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="08070255000197"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, spotted, it is quite possible that TPAS advisers may already be covered by the existing provision at subsection (6)(c), which includes as a relevant independent adviser somebody who,</p>
<ul><a name="08070255000453"></a>&#147;works at an advice centre (whether as an employee or a volunteer) and has been certified in writing by the centre as competent to give advice and authorised to do so on behalf of the centre&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08070255000393"></a>However, if, as we suspect, subsection (6)(c) is not sufficient to cover a person appointed by TPAS for this function, it would nevertheless be possible to add them to the list of independent advisers under the order-making power in subsection (6)(d), which authorises the Secretary of State to allow a person of a description specified to act as an independent adviser.</p>

<a name="80702-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="08070255000198"></a>In considering whether persons appointed by TPAS should fulfil this role, we would need to assess whether they had sufficient knowledge and experience of employment law in addition to their pensions expertise. We will have to discuss that in detail with TPAS. We are planning to commission an independent review of TPAS this summer, which will consider how TPAS&#146;s role might change as a consequence of the 2012 pension reforms. The results of that review should prove helpful in the context of whether to use the order-making power in this clause. Therefore, while I appreciate the thrust of my noble friend&#146;s intentions, I believe that the amendment is unnecessary. TPAS-appointed advisers may already be able to act as independent advisers for the purpose of Clause 56, under subsection (6)(c) or, more likely, added to the list under the order-making power in subsection (6)(d). Whether it might be more appropriate for the order-making power in subsection (6)(d) to be used in this way would be best considered once this high-level review of TPAS&#146;s role in the reforms is concluded.</p>

<a name="80702-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="08070255000199"></a>To return to my opening remarks, TPAS advisers already play a vital role and it is likely that that role will become even more important in future. We recognise and value their expertise in the field of pensions advice and look forward to exploring with them how their role will develop to fit the landscape that we are creating in these reforms. I acknowledge that that does not amount to accepting the amendment in the Bill, but I hope that the tenor of my remarks indicates how highly we value TPAS, which we feel should have a role in that connection in future. I urge my noble friend to withdraw the amendment on the basis of those comments.</p>

Anyone who had half an idea of the new personal accounts scheme&#151;and there are precious few of those&#151;would come to this Bill expecting to find something that said &#147;personal accounts&#148;. They would be mystified because they would find nothing. Instead, the rather anodyne provisions of Chapter 4 and Schedule 1 are entitled &#147;Power to establish a pension scheme&#148;, as if it were any old pension scheme and not one that is destined to be the recipient of billions of pounds of pensions contributions each year. However, we shall not let the apparent blandness of the Bill deter us from probing the way in which the new personal accounts pension scheme will work.</p>

<a name="80702-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="08070255000207"></a>Amendment No. 110A concerns subsection (1) of Clause 58. Under that subsection, the Secretary of State &#147;may&#148; establish a personal accounts pension scheme. My amendment replaces this permission with the requirement &#147;shall&#148;. We often debate may/shall amendments, but this is not a mere debating point. I believe that it goes to the heart of the Government&#146;s intentions about automatic enrolment.</p>

<a name="80702-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="08070255000208"></a>Under Clause 3, employers &#147;must&#148; make arrangements whereby relevant jobholders become active members of an automatic enrolment scheme. Many employers do not have pension schemes at all, especially if one disregards stakeholder arrangements, many of which were never used. However, this auto-enrolment is the primary focus of the Bill. Most employers have schemes that do not currently provide for automatic enrolment and do not comply with the qualifying earnings test; we have already discussed those issues in Committee.</p>

<a name="80702-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="08070255000209"></a>If employers do not make changes to their existing schemes, they will need access to the default personal accounts scheme. Therefore, it is something of a surprise to find that the Secretary of State has the option of whether or not to set up a pension scheme under Clause 58. If he does not do so, the Bill&#146;s aims will be thwarted. More important, the employer duties in the rest of this part of the Bill will be in a dangerous form of limbo. Employers might have to comply with something that is impossible because no personal account pension scheme has been set up. I cannot believe that the drafting of this Bill, as it stands, is reasonable. It does not live out the clear policy intentions laid out by the Government in their various White Papers.

<a name="08070255000211"></a><a name="80702-0005.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80702-0005.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08070255001167"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I thank the noble Baroness for the amendment. I hope to satisfy both noble Lords as to why the Bill is drafted as it is. As the noble Baroness has said, we have now reached Chapter 4 of the Bill, which sets out the legislative framework for establishing personal accounts, one of the cornerstones of the reform package proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Turner.</p>

<a name="80702-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08070255000212"></a>The Pensions Commission proposes the establishment of a low-cost simple pension scheme for low to moderate earners who are currently without access to a pension. Last year&#146;s Pensions Act established the delivery authority that is to be charged with building this scheme. This year&#146;s Bill provides the legal basis on which the scheme will be built. The scheme will be set up as a trust-based occupational scheme. It will be run by a sole corporate trustee, constituted as an NDPB. This provides accountability both to the Secretary of State and to Parliament. The Bill sets out the framework; the detail of the scheme will be set out in the scheme order, which will be secondary legislation. Further detail will be set out in the non-statutory scheme rules. We intend to consult on the draft order and the rules on the scheme, which will give all interested stakeholders the opportunity to comment well before the scheme is up and running.</p>

<a name="80702-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="08070255000213"></a>Clause 58 gives the Secretary of State the power to establish a pension scheme, ensuring in particular that the scheme is treated as established under a trust. The amendment in the name of the noble Baroness would impose a duty on the Secretary of State to set up the scheme, rather than provide a power to do so. I sympathise with the need for clarity around the Government&#146;s intentions to establish this scheme. Let me be absolutely clear, as was my honourable friend Mike O&#146;Brien in the other place. We will use this power to create the personal accounts scheme and it will be a defined contribution occupational pension scheme.</p>

<a name="80702-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08070255000214"></a>However, the wording of this clause reflects the view of those drafting the legislation on how best to construct a power that provides for our desired approach of creating the scheme by developing a scheme order that is analogous to a trust deed. The details of the scheme will be set out in the scheme order. It may be either desirable or necessary, sometime in the future, for the Government to amend the scheme order. In accordance with the apparently tried and tested provisions of the Interpretation Act 1978, we will be able to use the power in Clause 58(1), as currently drafted, to do so.</p>

<a name="80702-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="08070255000215"></a>By converting that to a duty, the amendment would&#151;in drafting terms&#151;remove that opportunity, unless we drafted a further power. It would mean that this clause no longer allowed for an amending order, should that need arise. I draw noble Lords&#146; attention to the fact that if an amending order were to proceed, it would be subject to Clause 32 of the Bill and would require the consent of the trustees. A duty would not, apparently, work in the same way as a power. There cannot be a duty that would require the Secretary of State to amend the order, whether that was needed or not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="08070255000216"></a>I hope that that rather technical drafting point will allay noble Lords&#146; concerns. I also hope that the noble Baroness will accept my reassurances that we will use this power to establish the scheme and that the permissive drafting is there to allow for future changes only. On that basis, I hope that she will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The point that I am trying to make is that, if we have a power for the Secretary of State, that power not only enables the Secretary of State to set up the scheme under the order as proposed at the start of proceedings, but can be used subsequently to bring forward the further order, subject to the safeguards in the Bill. We received legal advice that we could not do that in the same way if the power were a duty. That is the reason. I cannot believe that noble Lords would think that we had any intent other than to proceed as we have made absolutely clear. We have a lot of political capital invested in this, apart from the aspirations of millions of people who deserve an entitlement to a decent pension.</p>

I agree that what the Minister said is gobbledegook. I am a plain sort of person; I believe that Bills should say what the Government mean them to say. If the Government say that they are going to set up a pension scheme in order to deliver personal accounts, the Bill should say that they will&#151;whether it is &#147;shall&#148; or &#147;will&#148;. The Government&#146;s argument is that they want to use the power to do two kinds of things: to set the scheme up and later to amend it. That may well be the case, but we should be clear in the Bill that the Government must set up this pension scheme, otherwise the employer duty in Clause 3 is either meaningless or impossible to comply with, which would be unacceptable. The Government could make a further amendment for powers if they wanted to.</p>

I have explained that we have the power rather than a duty because of the ability to make changes subsequently. I really do not see why this is giving rise to such concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08070255000226"></a>The noble Baroness said: The Minister will be relieved to know that, for today, this is a probing amendment. The amendment would insert two new subsections into Clause 58, and it is designed to tease out the timing of the introduction of personal accounts.</p>

<a name="80702-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="08070255000227"></a>An amendment addressing timing was tabled by my honourable friends in another place following a less than confident interview given by the chief executive of the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority&#151;PADA&#151;in which he said about the achievability of 2012:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a><a name="08070255000438"></a>&#147;The honest answer is that I don&#146;t know&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08070255000394"></a>Doubtless, the DWP has by now told him that honesty is not what he is paid for. That interview was around six months ago. It appears from statements made on the Bill in another place by the Minister&#146;s right honourable friend Mr O&#146;Brien that, since then, the chief executive, Mr Tim Jones, has prepared a report on implementation. Mr O&#146;Brien said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="08070255000439"></a>&#147;He now has a credible set of plans that are consistent with starting to deliver the scheme from 2012&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 22/4/08; col. 1205.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08070255000395"></a>At that stage the Minister refused to release Mr Jones&#146;s report, although about a month later 10 pages of double-spaced waffle were placed in the House of Commons Library. I do not know whether that was meant to reassure Parliament but it gave little meaningful information and no reassurance whatsoever.</p>

<a name="80702-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="08070255000228"></a>The Minister in another place was particularly interesting on what 2012 actually meant. Most people had assumed that 2012 meant April 2012, which is the date I have included in my amendment, because to implement the scheme other than at the same time as the tax and national insurance years begin would be pretty difficult, not to mention chaotic. The transitional costs on employers would jump up from the &#163;350 million that the DWP has estimated for implementation because it would be extremely difficult to do it at any other point during the year.</p>

<ul><a name="08070255000454"></a>&#147;the plan is to start to deliver in the course of 2012. The scheme will not suddenly appear on one day in 2012 and all be in one place&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 22/4/08; col. 1207.]</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08070255000230"></a>The report from PADA deposited in May is similarly vague in referring to a &#147;launch in 2012&#148;. These are weasel words. They can easily encompass getting the scheme into its preparatory stages&#151;issuing documentation and the like&#151;but not being open for business in the sense of being able to accept contributions. That is what we mean by a scheme being in operation. I hope today the Minister will be much more specific about the start date and I have a number of specific questions for him. When will the first contributions be accepted? Is there any possibility of a start date other than the beginning of a tax year? Is there a precise project plan with timelines which lead to full implementation in 2012 and, if not, what will be delivered and when? I should say that the pretty little diagram on page 8 of the PADA document is not what I am talking about. Are robust project management arrangements in place? Has the Office for Government Commerce vetted the plans and, if so, what has it found? Is there a risk register for the project and, if so, will that be made available to Parliament? Why is it not possible to share the detailed planning arrangements with Parliament? I hope the Minister is not going to get out his usual fig leaf of commercial confidentiality to hide behind.</p>

<a name="80702-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08070255000231"></a>I could go on with my questions but the Minister knows what is needed to inform those outside his department who need to know what will be delivered by PADA. He does not need to hide behind formulae devised by his officials&#151;he just needs to tell us how it is.</p>

<a name="80702-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08070255000232"></a>My amendment first requires that the scheme is capable of operation by 1 April 2012. I accept that &#147;capable of operation&#148; can have a multitude of meanings but the Minister knows what I mean by this and it is not a mere launch. The second subsection says that, if the Secretary of State thinks that he will be unable to comply with that date, he should lay a report before Parliament setting out the reasons for the delay and the date that he expects the scheme to be established and operating. It is important that employers and others have some certainty about what timescales they are intended to be operational within. The proposed new subsection also requires the Secretary of State to say what he intends to do to promote pension savings prior to the introduction of personal accounts. This is important because for every year that pension savings are deferred, especially for younger workers, there is a big impact on the amount realised at the end of the period or going into decumulation. There are options open to the Secretary of State to explore here.</p>

<a name="80702-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08070255000233"></a>The introduction of personal accounts is a major project carrying significant implementation risks which need to be managed. We have considerable doubts about the Government&#146;s ability to deliver major projects, and that applies to the Government&#146;s quangos as much as to the Government themselves.</p>

<a name="80702-0006.htm_para4"></a>

However, I am a little concerned about proposed new subsection (1A), although I may have misread it. There are slight echoes of the amendment on which we have just voted. If we say that a scheme,</p>
<ul><a name="08070255000455"></a>&#147;must be established and capable of operation not later than 1st April 2012&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08070255000396"></a>which we all want, what happens if, for understandable reasons, we miss that date? Are we then in the position, if we agree to the amendment, that the whole thing falls away? Perhaps I misunderstand it but that is my worry. I support proposed new subsection (1B) but I am concerned about proposed new subsection (1A) because if there is a delay we do not want to lose the whole scheme.</p>

Also, challenging the Government&#146;s honesty in this is entirely unfair.</p>

<a name="80702-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="08070255000237"></a>This amendment would place in the Bill a deadline for implementation of 1 April 2012 for what could be the largest occupational pension scheme in the UK. After Tim Jones was appointed, he took the sensible approach of carrying out a review of the plans that he inherited to satisfy himself that they were deliverable. The review was completed at the end of March and Tim Jones has made it clear that he has a credible set of plans that are consistent with delivery of the scheme from 2012. Following the review, a copy of <I>A Report on the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority&#146;s Plan for Delivery</I> was placed in the Library of the House. Notwithstanding the noble Baroness&#146;s comments, that was an attempt to take stock of where we are and the timeframe for delivery.</p>

<a name="80702-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="08070255000238"></a>Our intention has always been to introduce the reforms from 2012 and that is still the case. However, we are still four years away from the go-live date of a complex programme delivering groundbreaking reforms. So clearly we cannot say that there are no uncertainties, risks or events around the corner that may change how we see things. A fixed implementation date, particularly one that is so precise&#151;to the day&#151;for this scheme would allow no flexibility should unforeseen events lead us to reassess our approach to implementation. While we firmly believe that there is no reason why we will change our approach, we do not think that a fixed date would be prudent.</p>

<a name="80702-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="08070255000239"></a>This amendment also places a requirement for a report to be laid before Parliament in the event that the implementation date appears to be unachievable. The requirement does not seem to negate the requirement in the amendment to establish the scheme&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, focused on that point. We do not believe that this is necessary, as progress towards implementation will be subject to scrutiny on an ongoing basis and there will be numerous opportunities for stakeholders, including Parliament, to input and review progress. For example, the delivery authority will produce  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_268"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column 268</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>an annual report and accounts setting out its progress over the past year. This will be laid in the Library of the House. In addition, it will produce a business plan, setting out its objectives and priorities for the forthcoming year. Both of these documents will be available on the authority&#146;s website and therefore open to scrutiny by everyone. As part of continued stakeholder engagement, we aim to set out our plans for the employer duty in the autumn before going on to publish draft regulations in the spring of 2009. We will also consult on a draft scheme order and rules in the spring of 2009.</p>

<a name="80702-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="08070255000240"></a>I was going to say that I would hope that the noble Baroness is reassured by that response, but from what has happened to date, I doubt whether she is. I say to both the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, that Tim Jones and Paul Myners have invited opposition Members to discuss the details of their plans. I do not know whether noble Lords have taken that opportunity yet, but I would certainly urge them to do so. Indeed, Paul Myners turned up at a meeting of noble Lords but I think that only the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, was there. It is not helpful to place fine details of the project on the record at this time when procurement has not yet commenced. We must appreciate that there are commercial sensitivities around this.</p>

<a name="80702-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="08070255000241"></a>The noble Baroness asked some specific questions about whether we have committed to 1 April as a start date. The answer to that is, no, we have not. As Mike O&#146;Brien said in another place, that may well be the right date to start, but the commitment is in 2012. In any event, from provisions that we have previously discussed, we would see a phased introduction of the auto-enrolment duty which would potentially impact on personal accounts as well. It may well be the right date; it may be the date that it does happen; but we have not committed to it in any way. The noble Baroness asked whether there are project plans. I am sure there are project plans. There will be business plans and the framework agreement between PADA and the DWP will require targets, a plan to be set down and an annual report.</p>

<a name="80702-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08070255000242"></a>This is a major project to change fundamentally the pensions landscape. The enabling savings retirement programme covers the implementation of personal accounts, the introduction of automatic enrolment, the mandatory employer contribution and the communications to support these reforms. Tim Jones&#146;s report sets outs the key stats which PADA needs to undertake before the reforms can be introduced. The first step is going through government approval processes before the procurement process can begin. Part of that is the passing of this legislation. Before these approvals can be obtained the funding strategy needs to be developed. The secondary legislation also needs to be developed and passed. We intend to consult on a draft order, as I said earlier, in the spring of 2009. Subject to approvals, PADA is intending to issue an OJEU advertisement in January 2009 for the main procurement exercise. Estimates that the time suppliers will need to put in place the necessary capabilities to deliver such a scheme are subject to negotiation during the procurement exercise. The suppliers will then need to design, build and test systems before they can be implemented.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08070255000243"></a>These are major reforms and it is important that we get them right. However, as we have said repeatedly, it is our intention to introduce the reforms from 2012 and this is still the case. I understand the desire of noble Lords to have as much detailed information as possible but they must understand precisely where we are on this exercise. I would urge them to talk to Paul Myners and Tim Jones and get this directly from those who have the responsibility.</p>

Their agent is PADA; if it does not do the job properly then they can sack the people who work there. It is not for opposition Members to inquire of the staff of quangos&#151;that really is not how life is supposed to work. The Minister said that he thought that there were detailed project plans, which I found extremely unspecific. I asked whether there were detailed project plans and I did not get a specific answer. I was hoping to follow up my query by asking to see them. Is there any reason why detailed project plans cannot be made available to Parliament?</p>

The noble Baroness may not want to talk to these individuals directly, but that is her choice. PADA is an NDPB. It will have a framework agreement which needs to be revised once the new powers of PADA come into being after the Bill is passed. That will require a business plan, annual reporting and a report on PADA&#146;s progress under the responsibilities imposed on it. That will be in the public domain and will be available on an annual basis. All that is quite normal; it is how these processes work. The noble Baroness keeps asking to go along and look at the books and at every plan that is being developed, but I am not sure that that is necessarily the role of politicians, the Government or the Opposition. Again, I urge the noble Baroness to talk to PADA. I am sure that it will explain in some detail where it has got to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08070255000248"></a>The Minister referred to phased auto-enrolment, but that cannot even begin unless the personal accounts scheme is up and running because there is no sensible way of phasing other than having the whole scheme operational. It seems to me that the Minister is hoping that PADA will deliver. He refers to annual reports and accounts being available to Parliament but those will not say anything about delivery; we know that.

<a name="80702-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08070255000252"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendment No. 110DA. These amendments concern the audit arrangements for the new personal accounts pension scheme. They have been suggested by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, an organisation with which the Minister and I are both familiar.</p>

<a name="80702-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08070255000253"></a>The problem that the amendments seek to address is that the legislation relevant to trust-based occupational pension schemes has an audit requirement by virtue of Section 41 of the Pensions Act 1995 which is impractical to operate without amendment for personal accounts. The current audit rules require a pension scheme auditor to state whether in his opinion contributions have been paid in all material respects with the payment schedule. This encompasses both accuracy of payment and timeliness but is very difficult, not to say impossible, to achieve and is certainly costly in terms of audit fees for complex pension schemes with many employers involved, as this will be.</p>

<a name="80702-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08070255000254"></a>This is not a new problem; it arose in connection with stakeholder accounts. Eventually, some sort of compromise was reached so that the audit report was replaced by a report by reporting accountants&#151;which, as the Minister will be aware, is not the same thing as an audit&#151;on the trustees&#146; statement in relation to controls. The amendments are designed to get to the same point for personal accounts. Amendment No. 1l0BA removes the need for an auditor&#146;s statement about contributions under Section 41 of the 1995 Act. Amendment No. 110DA specifies what will be in its place; namely, a trustee&#146;s statement about systems and controls and then a reporting accountant&#146;s report on the design and operation of those systems.</p>

<a name="80702-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08070255000255"></a>This was debated in another place and the Minister there made some sympathetic noises but these did not go so far as to accept the concerns expressed by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. Hence; we have been asked to table these amendments again in your Lordships&#146; House. In another place the Minister appeared to accept that auditors will find it difficult to give a clean audit opinion on contributions where the contributions are paid by a myriad of employers, many of them very small. But the Minister clearly did not grasp that in seeking what  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_271"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column 271</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>he called &#147;proper accounting&#148; and accounts which are not &#147;unduly qualified&#148;&#151;I do not know what either of those terms means&#151;there is only one realistic option, which is a systems-based approach. We are back to the best being the enemy of the good and to the DWP&#146;s granular approach to implementation.</p>

<a name="80702-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08070255000256"></a>I hope that the Minister&#146;s own background and experience will allow him to see that a conventional audit report as envisaged for single employer schemes simply does not translate into something like the personal accounts scheme. &#147;Audit&#148; is the wrong concept or, alternatively, it is one which is both over-engineered and destined to end in mechanical failure.</p>

<a name="80702-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08070255000257"></a>I would not regard it as right to leave this issue to regulations. It took a long time for the accounting profession to sort out the issue in connection with stakeholder pensions and it would not be right for us to let personal accounts go ahead without proper reporting arrangements in place. There is a manifest problem in trying to retrofit the personal accounts concept into the existing law for trust-based schemes. We should recognise that now and on the face of the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

As the noble Baroness said, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales&#151;a fine body, if I may say so&#151;raised the issue with officials. I am grateful to the institute for its help in ensuring that we get the shape of our legislation right. The amendments relate to the application of regulations under Section 41 of the Pensions Act 1995 to the personal accounts scheme. In short, current regulations under that section require an auditor to state that he or she is satisfied to a high level of detail about contributions made by each employer into the scheme. The requirement from the auditor&#146;s statement about all contributions to the personal accounts scheme will be costly and difficult to compile due to the sheer number of employers and workers participating in the scheme. An auditor may be unable to satisfy himself that contributions had been paid properly and may have to qualify the accounts and the audit will be of relatively little benefit to members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08070255000259"></a>The principle of proper accounting is paramount, but it is true that this scheme will be of a different scale and type from other schemes, for which the provisions in the Pensions Act 1995 were primarily designed. We have been considering the matter with the delivery authority and have concluded that the approach that the ICAEW suggests is the right one. I am pleased to give an assurance that the scheme will not need to apply the provisions made under Section 41 of the 1995 Act.</p>

<a name="80702-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08070255000260"></a>I can also confirm that no amendment to the Bill is necessary as we already possess the legal powers to achieve the objective of the amendment, either by regulations under Section 41 of the Pensions Act 1995, under Clause 116 of the Bill, or within the scheme order. In agreeing that the scheme should not need to apply the auditing requirements, we also agree that we need alternative assurance arrangements based on the principles of openness, accountability and probity.

I believe that the intention of Amendment No. 110DA is a good starting point from which PADA can consider the detail, although I was surprised to see that it reads &#147;may&#148; rather than &#147;must&#148;. The detailed planning work has not yet been carried out, so it is too soon for us to agree to the final audit arrangements now.</p>

<a name="80702-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="08070255000261"></a>Fortunately there is no need for primary legislation to stipulate the assurance arrangements as the Bill&#146;s current drafting allows the scheme order to set out the arrangements. The scheme order and the rules will be the subject of full consultation next spring. I hope that my assurances on the scheme audit and the robustness of the financial controls are sufficient for the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Clause 58(12) contains various matters which the rules of the pension scheme must not contain; namely, its object and purpose, trustee appointments or removals, meetings, committees and exclusion of liability. I can see why this Bill, with the order creating the pension corporation, will set up the current view of how those things should work, but over time we will find that the Bill is deficient in some respects and that some things specified for good reasons at the outset will no longer have any relevance or, worse, actually create problems. However, I can see no reason for the Bill to face permanent restrictions on the ability of the pension scheme to evolve over time through rules. Surely it should not be necessary for the Secretary of State to be involved in every new order on things such as the appointment of trustees or committees. Amendment No. 110C, therefore, deletes subsection (12) in the interests of the long-term efficiency of the operation of the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08070255000266"></a>Clause 59(4) is slightly different. Under Clause 59, an order may allow the trustee, rather than the Secretary of State, to make rules, but subsection (4) allows the Secretary of State to impose a lot of restrictions and conditions on their exercise. Our fundamental position is that the Secretary of State should not micromanage the affairs of the new pension scheme. We hope that the trustee corporation will be chaired by a person of substance and that the other trustees will similarly be highly competent and respected. We think that they should be left to make up their own mind about rules. Why does the Secretary of State have to have the power to set up conditions and prohibitions? Amendment

These two amendments would streamline the Bill and enhance the standing of the trustees, both of which are good things which I hope the Minister can support. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="08070255000268"></a>Our intention has always been to allow the trustee as much independence as possible to run the scheme within the parameters of the order and rules and in the best interests of members. None the less we must ensure that the scheme meets the intentions of the wider reforms and, as the scheme is being set up to fulfil a public policy objective, it is right that there should be some limits on the trustee&#146;s powers set by the settlor, the role which is being undertaken by the Secretary of State. As settlor, the Secretary of State has a duty to set out, for example, the purpose of the scheme and the appointment of trustees. Those are of such significance that they must be included in the order and not the rules. The scheme order will in effect be akin to a trust deed in other occupational pension schemes and, like trustees of those other schemes, the trustee will not be able to change the provisions in that instrument. The scheme rules will be non-statutory, so the scheme order can provide for them to be amended by the trustee.</p>

<a name="80702-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08070255000269"></a>Amendments Nos. 110C and 110D will allow the trustee to alter the fundamentals of the scheme through changes to the scheme rules. Amendment No. 110C removes the list of key aspects of the scheme which we believe should be set out in the order. Amendment No. 110D would remove the Secretary of State&#146;s power to place limits through the order on the trustee&#146;s ability to make rules. We think it important to have limits around what aspects of the scheme the trustee corporation can change and how the trustees can make changes to the rules. For example, we do not think that provision about the process of appointing or removing trustees should be a matter for the trustees themselves. Clearly, the trustees are involved in making appointments, but the rights under which they can do that should not be subject to change by them.</p>

At this stage, we do not have precise details of

<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08070255000273"></a>On the amendments that I mainly expect to speak to today, I will raise a number of issues that probe the role of the Secretary of State and the trustee corporation. We need to take an overall view on whether the balance of the ongoing involvement of the Secretary of State veers toward micromanagement, and whether that is inappropriate. On reading the Bill, my initial view is that the DWP&#146;s officials have gone overboard, as usual, in finding so many nooks and crannies of the trustee corporation for the Government to be involved in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08070255000284"></a>The noble Baroness said: Under Clause 60, there are to be panels of employers and members. We fully support that but find it difficult to understand why, since the effect of Clause 60(2) is that there should be these panels, the Secretary of State cannot just leave it to the trustees to get on with operating them. What ongoing interest will the Secretary of State have in determining the composition and functions of the panels? Surely that is the natural territory of the trustees, so my amendment is designed to remove the Secretary of State from the details of those panels. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_105"></a>
<a name="08070255000285"></a><a name="80702-0007.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80702-0007.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08070255001189"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> We anticipate that the membership of the personal accounts schemes will be very large, numbering in the millions, with members coming from a diverse range of jobs and backgrounds. We also anticipate that there will be many thousands of participating employers with no connection by trade or size. The size and diversity of membership presents the trustee corporation with a unique task in communicating with scheme members and participating employers. However, we firmly believe that the representation of these members and employers is vital to the scheme&#146;s success. That is why we have placed an obligation on the trustee to consult members and employers about the operation, development and amendment of the scheme.</p>

<a name="80702-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08070255000286"></a>Furthermore, we have placed a requirement in the Bill for the trustee to set up panels to represent members and participating employers. These panels will have to be consulted by the trustee prior to any proposed changes to the order and rules. Setting up the panels to ensure proper member and employer representation is clearly not an easy task, and we have asked PADA to consider the options for their functions and composition. PADA has yet to reach its conclusions, but is considering similar panels operated by the Financial Services Authority and has met officials from pension scheme organisations such as Unite. Even when PADA makes its recommendation, we want the order to set out only the higher level composition and functions, which will leave the trustee and the panels with the flexibility to develop the roles of the panels once the scheme is fully functioning.</p>

<a name="80702-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08070255000287"></a>The amendment allows only the trustee corporation to determine the composition and functions of the panels. That would mean that the panels could be realised only after the scheme order came into force and following trustee recruitment. While it is possible to grant the trustee sole discretion as the clause is now written, we believe it is appropriate for the Secretary of State to set the basic parameters in the scheme order. Personal accounts are being introduced as part of public policy changes affecting millions of individuals, many of whom have had little prior involvement with pensions. For this reason, there is considerable interest from the pensions industry and consumer organisations about how members will be encouraged to engage with the scheme. By setting the composition and functions of the panels in the order, stakeholders and Parliament will be able to have their say on the vital question of how members should be represented. We hope to publish the order on the rules consultation next spring.

This is another area where the question is whether the Secretary of State&#146;s role is correct or too intrusive. For every involvement of the Secretary of State, somewhere in the Department for Work and Pensions there will be one or more job descriptions which include that aspect of involvement. One of the things we are concerned about is that we not only create a bureaucracy in the new trustee corporation but leave lots of pegs under which bureaucracy can thrive in Whitehall, which would not be the right outcome. I will consider that in the overall context. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08070255000292"></a>The noble Baroness said: Clause 60(4) states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a><a name="08070255000446"></a>&#147;The functions of the members&#146; panel may include nominating individuals to be members of the trustee corporation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08070255000399"></a>I am not sure why the Bill needs to say that, because I thought that subsection (3) was wide enough to allow that. We obviously support members being on the panels, although we hope that the trustee board does not become packed with special interest members flying under the broad banner of members&#146; interests. Given that the Government have chosen to put this in the Bill, the question is naturally raised as to why there is no mention of the employers&#146; panel nominating individuals to be members of the trustee corporation.</p>

<a name="80702-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08070255000293"></a>In another place, Mr O&#146;Brien, the Pensions Minister, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a><a name="08070255000447"></a>&#147;Employers should not be represented on that board, because the trustees are all there to represent members&#146; interests&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Pensions Bill Committee, 31/1/08; col. 320.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08070255000400"></a>That rang alarm bells with me. We fully accept that the main duty of the trustees will be to work in the interests of members, but that duty cannot be seen in isolation. If the way in which trustees conduct themselves is contrary to employers&#146; interests, that can only store up problems for the personal accounts scheme overall.</p>

<a name="80702-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="08070255000294"></a>When employers set up their own trust-based pension schemes, whether for DB or DC purposes, they draw up the documentation that sets out the various rights and obligations of the employers and the trustees. To my knowledge, that usually, if not always, includes the power of the employer to appoint some of the trustees. Of course, the trustees are there to act in the interests of the members, like all trustees, but they provide a conduit for the views of the employer. That occasionally causes difficulties in practice, but, overall, it provides many benefits to the efficient working of those schemes. I do not know a single employer with those arrangements who would want to operate in any other way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08070255000295"></a>Of course, the personal accounts scheme is different. It is the default scheme and the voice of the employer at the trustee board will be less specific in nature than is found in an employer&#146;s own scheme&#151;but so, too, will be the voice of the member. Both will be represented by representative groups. It seems to me that if something needs to be raised about how issues may affect employers versus employees, it is best that that is played out at the trustee board, rather than to have some key players in the whole success of this scheme being excluded. I believe that it should be possible for employers&#146; representatives to be on the trustee board and that the use of the panels as the nominating mechanism is useful. I hope that the Minister will share my view that a trustee board that excluded the voice of the employer in its entirety would be likely to work against the overall success of the personal accounts scheme. I hope, therefore, that he will accept my amendment. I beg to move.</p>

The Bill requires the trustee to establish members&#146; and employers&#146; panels to ensure that the trustee corporation is informed of the concerns of these groups. This amendment would give the employers&#146; panel the right to nominate members to the corporate trustee in the same way as the members&#146; panel can. While the personal accounts scheme will emulate existing occupational pension schemes, it will be unique in scale. The members will be drawn from many thousands of employers and it is likely that many of these members will not have saved in a pension before, which is why it is particularly important that the members of personal accounts should feel a sense of ownership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="08070255000297"></a>All individuals who form the corporate trustee will have the core obligation to act in the members&#146; best interest, rather than to represent any particular interest groups. It will not be possible for the trustee to meet the duty of acting in the members&#146; best interest without taking account of the employers&#146; concerns. It is the employers&#146; panel role to ensure that it has the information to do this.</p>

<a name="80702-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08070255000298"></a>It may be helpful to point out the different role of the employer in the personal accounts scheme. In a typical occupational pension scheme, the participating employer would set up the scheme. The personal accounts scheme is being set up specifically for those employers who do not currently offer access to a workplace pension. If an employer chooses to use the personal accounts scheme, he will not be involved in the running of the scheme. The main focus for employers using the personal accounts scheme will be its efficient administration. If an individual employer has any concerns or problems with the administration of the scheme, he can raise this with the administrator or through the employer panel.</p>

<a name="80702-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08070255000299"></a>The role of the employer panel will be important; the panel will ensure that the views of the wide range and diverse nature of employers using the personal accounts scheme are heard. Ultimately, however, the members are the beneficiaries of the scheme, so they should have a greater stake in how it is run. It is for this reason that we have given only the members&#146; panel

This is a DC scheme, whereas all the assumptions about employer contribution and activity are based on models of a DB scheme where the employer has set up the scheme and is actively contributing but is also expected to honour the pension promise, underpinned by the PPF. This is a DC scheme, in which the disinvestment risk and, to some extent, the investment risk, is carried by the members. The amount of risk carried by the employers is non-existent. Clearly their views matter and will be picked up by an employers&#146; panel, but I cannot see the place for employers in a money purchase scheme; it has nothing to do with employers apart from their contributions, which are laid down by statute.</p>

I should like the Government to think again about whether it is the right answer to exclude employer representatives from the panel. The experience of existing employment-based provision suggests that this is fundamentally a good process. It sometimes causes difficulties but, overall, it allows a forum in which issues can be raised. I hope that the Government are prepared to look at this again. I am not seeking to put forward an employer-dominant case; I am just concerned about the efficiency of the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="08070255000313"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak intermittently also to the other amendments in this group, but I reserve the right to respond to the noble Baroness when she develops her arguments. This is a probing amendment which will, I hope, provoke us to spend a moment or two discussing the adequacy of personal account pots. I am sure that the amendment is technically deficient; I am not sure that it is even technically necessary, as my noble friend the Minister may tell the Committee.</p>

<a name="80702-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08070255000314"></a>The point of personal accounts is to ensure that low-paid workers&#151;poorer women in particular&#151;are encouraged to save for their retirement, but some of them may have a pay-to-save debate, which is an issue that we have explored under previous amendments. I have in mind the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, on advice, and Amendment No. 89 of the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, on means-testing reviews. Therefore, such workers need, as I hope your Lordships may agree, a full basic state pension as well as much state second pension as possible. However it is important above all that the personal account pot is as large as possible. Only that will securely float savers off, and allow them to stay off, pension credit.</p>

<a name="80702-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="08070255000315"></a>If the Committee will bear with me, I shall give some figures so that they may be recorded in <I>Hansard</I>&#151;I am sure that your Lordships are already familiar with them. Over 40 years, a woman on median earnings of around &#163;21,000 will build a pot of around &#163;190,000, or about &#163;14,000 a year on a level annuity&#151;half of that on an indexed annuity. I am grateful to the IMA for these figures. On half of median earnings over 40 years&#151;&#163;11,000&#151;that pot will be &#163;65,000, or &#163;5,000 a year on a level annuity and about half that on an indexed annuity. Now we come to the risky area: over 20 years, if a woman starts saving at 45 and stops at 65, the woman on median earnings will retire with a pot of &#163;45,000, or &#163;3,500 on a level annuity and &#163;1,750 on an indexed annuity. If she has half of median earnings&#151;that is the woman whom personal accounts should seek to help in particular&#151;is working from 45 to 65 and paying into a personal account pot, she gets a pot of &#163;16,000, or &#163;1,200 a year on a level annuity and &#163;600 a year on an indexed annuity, possibly within the range of trivial commutation depending on how it is developed.</p>

<a name="80702-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="08070255000316"></a>A pot of &#163;16,000, 20 years&#146; saving and trivial commutation is much higher than the cut-off point for pension credit, an issue to which we shall return on a much later amendment. However, I think that your Lordships can already see where the rocks are. Over and beyond issues of housing benefit and its tapers, the problem is for older women who are low paid, who save for a limited period and as a result have pots which may interlock them with a pension credit system depending effectively on the income of any second person in the household. If their partner or husband has a generous pension, they will not come within pension credit; if they do not or if they are solo, they will.</p>

<a name="80702-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="08070255000317"></a>If some women a little above the trivial commutation figure take a level annuity, they will probably be free of pension credit in opening years but increasingly dependent on it in later years. If they take an indexed annuity, which they probably will not, they will need less pension credit but need it earlier. If they do the sums, they may decide not to save.</p>

<a name="80702-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="08070255000318"></a>So the answer, I repeat, is to help them to build a bigger pot. It is absolutely key; it is the only decent, affordable and deliverable way in which to make it worth saving. That is why, as I understand it, I am opposed to the amendments in the names of noble Lords opposite, Amendments Nos. 111A and 111B, which appear to ban the possibility of an employer seeking to contribute more than 3 per cent. If the employer wishes to contribute more than that&#151;because after all, if it was a conventional DC scheme, he would pay in 6 per cent on average&#151;why should he not? It would not only be a decent thing to do, given the current state of DC schemes, but it would allow the pot to build. We can perhaps argue that point more fully in a moment. We can look at the trivial commutation level under a later amendment.</p>

<a name="80702-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="08070255000319"></a>We can look, as a way in which to build a bigger pot, at unisex annuities, so that women get a better return from their pot, as I am sure the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, will argue later. They can shop around for a better return, as the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott,  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_281"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column 281</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>has argued. All these are ways in which to help get better value from the pot and possibly to disassociate that pot from interaction with means-tested benefits. Above all&#151;and this refers to a previous amendment that I moved, to which I will almost certainly return&#151;we need to look at removing the &#163;5,000 threshold. If we did that, we would double the pots of women on half-median earnings and transform the situation; they would go from &#163;16,000 to &#163;32,000 at a stroke.</p>

<a name="80702-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08070255000320"></a>For poorer women, possibly the single most important issue in the Bill that we will address is the ability for them, if they choose, to come into a pension scheme at nil earnings if they were already in it and then have a matching contribution. It is the only sure way in which they choose to build a bigger pot and ensure that it pays to save. If noble Lords opposite agree, as I am sure they do, and are concerned, as I am sure they are, about the worries of means-tested benefits, they should really help us to build bigger pots, and not seek to press amendments that cap the pot size. If they do, they lock poorer, older women into means-tested benefits.</p>

<a name="80702-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08070255000321"></a>This amendment tackles the problem in a different way&#151;and in a way that is frankly less satisfactory than the way I would like to see. It would increase the contributions paid in particular years, which could be done by exceeding the contribution cap in any one year by &#163;3,600, adding a right to transfer up to &#163;10,000, say, from a small inheritance or a lump sum from divorce pension sharing, or by including small, stranded sums. That is something that I want to raise under the next amendment from the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, or the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale. None of us wants to recycle money from existing schemes and destabilise them, but sometimes people acquire small, stranded pots and it would be useful for them to corral them into their personal accounts.</p>

<a name="80702-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08070255000322"></a>Another way is to allow people to pay in for missing years, which is what this amendment does. My noble friend may argue, and he may be right, that that should not be necessary. In practice the limit of &#163;3,600 caps you at some &#163;40,000 a year. In practice a woman on half-median earnings will contribute &#163;1,000 a year and, on median earnings, &#163;2,000 a year; simply upping their own regular contributions beyond that minimum would help but it would not attract additional employer contributions, especially if a subsequent amendment were to have any support in the House.</p>

<a name="80702-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08070255000323"></a>The other way in which to bring new money into what was clearly not drawn from the existing scheme is to allow contributions to make good missing previous years. That seems to me an innocent way forward to deal with this problem. I refer to those years in which people did not pay into a pension at all because they were not in work, they had children or were looking after an older person. Of course, they might have continued while not in work, but financial pressures may have interrupted their contributions. But several years later, possibly because they had a small inheritance or possibly a pension-sharing lump sum on divorce, they acquire a lump sum of &#163;10,000 or &#163;15,000, and they can see that they have missed the five previous years. This amendment would allow them the financial head space to put the whole sum in rather than having to drip-feed it in over later years between what they  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_282"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column 282</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>should pay in under the 8 per cent and the maximum cap available. That drip-feeding lowers their investment returns.</p>

<a name="80702-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08070255000324"></a>It is a modest amendment, a probing amendment and not a very satisfactory amendment. It is one of several ways in which we could, I hope, help lower-paid women to build up their pots. If we do not help women to do that, the pay-to-save argument, the fear of mis-selling and issues of advice about whether women should or should not auto-enrol will loom ever larger as 2012 approaches. I hope my noble friend will pay serious attention to the reasons behind an amendment such as this. I beg to move.</p>

I have some sympathy with the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis. She has helpfully clarified that she was referring only to employee, or individuals&#146;, contributions, and that did not carry any sense of backdating employer matching for any purpose. That is fine. My concerns are practical rather than theoretical. The amendment will involve considerable additional complexity for personal accounts, which would then have to track records of contributions year by year. That record could extend for up to 50 years if somebody started contributing at the age of 16 and stopped when they were somewhere in their sixties, or possibly even older. This Bill allows contributions up to the age of 75, so I will change that to 60 years or more.</p>

<a name="80702-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="08070255000328"></a>Anybody who knows anything about NIRS2, the system for recording NI contributions, as I am sure the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, does, will know that recording, maintaining and holding details of contributions over these very long periods is neither easy nor cheap. I have a very real concern about the additional burden that the amendment would place on the implementation of this scheme, particularly in the design phase. From what I understand about their attitude, those running PADA would run a mile from that complexity. I am also concerned about the cost of doing this, and the impact on the cost limit that we were aiming at. This was set at 0.3 per cent or 0.5 per cent; we will come to that in due course. That limit is already under some stress. Those difficulties of both complexity and cost pressure are real. At heart, the amendment is sensible, but the practicalities may be very difficult to cope with.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="08070255000329"></a>My amendments in this group address the broad theme of not allowing personal account schemes to crowd out private pension provision. In that respect, it  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_283"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column 283</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>addresses some of the issues raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, when she spoke to her amendment. We are concerned, as are such organisations as the Association of British Insurers, that the personal account scheme will become a vortex, sucking in all manner of pension contributions and other savings so that, at the end of the day, existing pension and savings-product providers will find it difficult to compete.</p>

<a name="80702-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="08070255000330"></a>To be clear, we stand for healthy competition, but competition from a state and statute-backed backed pension provider may not be healthy if that becomes the default repository for all long-term savings from large swathes of the population. That will, in turn, weaken the UK&#146;s financial services industry, a major contributor to our economic growth. We interfere in this sector at our peril. We agree with the Government&#151;and, probably, with all sides of the House&#151;about the need for greater pensions saving. We are not apart from the noble Baroness on that. We certainly support the creation of the personal accounts scheme if it can be delivered. Our support is tempered by the need not to create some kind of nationalised industry, which brings unfair competition to private-sector providers.</p>

<a name="80702-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="08070255000331"></a>Let me deal with some of my amendments. Amendment No. 111A explicitly states that employers should not contribute more than the 3 per cent that the scheme is based on. The noble Baroness is shaking her head, but let me explain. The rationale for this is that personal accounts should be a default scheme for those employers who want to contribute the minimum. If they want to contribute more, they should research something like group personal pension schemes, to allow them to contribute higher amounts to a workplace-based pension scheme for themselves. We must not let the personal account scheme crowd out people who want more than the default, and should therefore go out into the market to find other options for their employees.</p>

Why should they go out into the market?

If they choose to do more for their employees, we must not discourage that. At the same time, we do not wish to divert pension savings from pension providers that are part of the backbone of our financial services industry. There is a great danger that this scheme, in the way that it is set up, will become a magnet, attracting all forms of additional contributions from all over the place. Some will be from employers and some from employees; we will come to that. That is the reason. My amendment does not preclude higher employee contributions, which is what the amendment of the noble Baroness was about. It is a default scheme, where employers contribute the minimum and that is it. If employers want to do more, they should be out in the marketplace.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_284"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column 284</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80702-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08070255000334"></a>Amendment No. 111B is designed to place in the Bill what we understand to be the Government&#146;s policy; namely, that there will be a maximum contribution level of &#163;3,600 for any employee in any year. I have provided that this should be uprated in the same way as the earnings band under Clause 13. It is logical that the band should be increased; that should be provided. The &#163;3,600 limit allows contributions to rise above the minimum allowed by the band, but not by such a huge amount that it would start to displace private sector provision. The earlier proposal for a &#163;5,000 limit, as the Minister will be aware, generated considerable opposition from the pensions industry, which remains concerned about the Government&#146;s intention. The Government have said that it is their policy. If that is the case, they should be prepared to place it in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80702-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08070255000335"></a>Amendment No. 111C deletes subsection (3) of Clause 61, which allows the Secretary of State to prescribe an amount for top-up payments to be made by a member. The noble Baroness wants this subsection to be made mandatory. We believe that the Bill should specify an annual amount for contributions to the scheme, but the scheme should not get into the general investment business. Staying with the power, in Committee in another place, the Minister sometimes talked about a &#163;10,000 limit under subsection (3) and sometimes about a higher limit, and even a lifetime limit. On Second Reading, the Minister said that the Government wanted flexibility, both in the amount of top-ups and for the period from which they will be allowed. I am not sure what the Government&#146;s policy is. We have heard many figures and the traditional reference to flexibility. Could the Minister provide more clarity on that?</p>

<a name="80702-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="08070255000336"></a>We believe that the personal account scheme is fundamentally about annual contributions to pensions, to build up savings for retirement. It is not designed to be an all-purpose investment vehicle. There should be no possibility of the Bill turning it into that. As I have mentioned, this will be a nationalised undertaking. All past evidence is that when nationalised industries compete in competitive markets, they operate relatively badly. However, when there are market imperfections, which there could be if we are not very careful with the Bill, they tend to clean up. That would be a very serious problem if the personal accounts scheme achieves that by trading from its position as a government-backed organisation with no effective capital market disciplines constraining it.</p>

<a name="80702-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="08070255000337"></a>There is also a question of whether members will properly understand any ability to deposit additional money into the personal account scheme. Such payments will not attract any employer contribution&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, made that clear&#151;and may attract tax relief; and, if fair competition rules the day, would not get tax relief. Again, the Government have not said what their position is in relation to additional payments.</p>

<a name="80702-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08070255000338"></a>Both issues are vital to an understanding of whether it is a good deal to invest in the personal account scheme. The problem is that members could easily be misled by the general information provided by personal accounts. They could be misled into thinking that their additional contributions could produce the same

<a name="80702-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08070255000339"></a>The API has pointed out that top ups could be made in an advice-free zone if the personal account scheme was allowed to take them, and that members are very likely to make investment mistakes. Does anyone really want to get into the sort of mis-selling scandal that could be involved? The Government will have set up and be standing behind the personal account pension scheme, so we can expect mis-selling problems to end up, ultimately, on the Government&#146;s door step.</p>

<a name="80702-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08070255000340"></a>The Government may well think, as I am sure will the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, that Amendment No. 111C, in removing the power in proposed subsection (3), is too hash. If so, the Government should come off the fence and say what they intend to do and argue that on the basis of an amendment to place in the Bill whatever limits and constraints there are. A debate can then be had, in particular with those in the pension provisions industry, about the impact of that on existing providers, on the future flows of investment money and the impact on the financial services industry generally.</p>

I say at the outset that I agree with a great deal of what my noble friend Lady Hollis said in moving her amendment. The briefing caused me to give notice of my opposition to the whole of Clause 61, but that was simply a way of being able to say what I have to say about the clause. The problem is that there is not enough flexibility. There should be flexibility for individuals to put extra money into their personal accounts when they can, perhaps when they receive a small inheritance, there is a divorce settlement, when some kind of investment matures, or perhaps with some saving through something like an ISA.</p>

<a name="80702-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="08070255000342"></a>The argument for allowing such additional contributions is that personal accounts will build up to a significant pension only if employees contribute throughout their working lives. Not everybody can or is willing and able to do that. In particular, that may not apply in the case of older workers who will start to save for a pension for the first time when personal accounts commence in 2012. Moreover, there are the working patterns of many women, to which my noble friend Lady Hollis has devoted quite a lot of time. They are much more likely to have breaks in pensionable employment due to child rearing and caring responsibilities, to work part-time or to be in low-paid employment that does not give them the opportunity to build up significant savings for retirement.</p>

<a name="80702-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="08070255000343"></a>Anyone who has missed out on the opportunity to contribute may want to catch up later in their working life. It would be sensible to encourage this and to increase personal responsibility, which has always been a key government objective in the Bill as in other respects. It seems odd that the new system should forbid extra contributions of a size that would probably not make much sense if invested elsewhere in a separate private pension. People in the target market, with no

<a name="80702-0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="08070255000344"></a>As indicated earlier by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, I suppose that there is the possibility of unlooked-for competition with private investment business. On the other hand, the sort of people for whom this Bill is intended to provide benefits are not liable to be tempted into other investments if they are putting their pension investment into this scheme. It is intended, as everyone has said from the beginning, for people who are not well paid and who otherwise would not have any occupational pension provision except through the personal accounts scheme. If the scheme does not allow them sufficient flexibility to contribute, when can they contribute so that when they actually retire they have a pension entitlement that enables them to lead a reasonable life? They will be forced on to the benefit scheme, as indicated by my noble friend Lady Hollis. I hope that the Minister will consider carefully what has been said about the possibility of allowing extra payments in order to make absolutely certain that when people retire they have adequate retirement benefit.</p>

In fact there is a big disadvantage in that, having put it in, you can get out only 25 per cent as cash; the rest you have to take as an annuity. So it is a restriction and it may not be advisable to lead people to think that that is where they should put their money. Has the noble Baroness thought about that?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="08070255000347"></a>While I have some sympathy with what the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, has been saying, I think that her amendments promote inflexibility in personal accounts for the reason she outlined. Amendment No. 111B fixes in primary legislation the amount of the annual contribution limit at &#163;3,600, which will mean that it is very difficult to vary it. The strict annual limit of &#163;3,600 per year, uprated from 2005 prices, is very inflexible, given the Government&#146;s other pension reforms, which have swept away and tidied up so many other pension rules. I understand that this annual limit is the result of consensus built up following the report of my noble friend Lord Turner. Were it not for that, I would be attempted to suggest no upper limit at all.</p>

<a name="80702-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="08070255000348"></a>I do not think that this provision would crowd out the other schemes that the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, talked about because it is targeted at a group of people who currently tend not to save at all and tend not to get involved in a private pension scheme. It is a bit like the levelling-down argument; I do not feel that this would damage the industry and I certainly would not wish to do so. I feel that it will not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="08070255000349"></a>Amendments Nos. 112A to 112C seek to set in statute what the Minister has already committed to&#151;that transfers in and out should not be permitted before 2017. I have more sympathy with those amendments, given the consensus that personal accounts should be given a period of time to get established before we consider whether transfers in or out should be permitted. However, what happens if PADA or the wider pensions industry realises that some kind of flexibility is needed before 2017? It will not be possible to make that happen without another DWP Bill, and even then it would take a lot of time. For instance, this Bill will be in Parliament for almost a whole year before it gets Royal Assent. As <I>Which? </I>has already pointed out, one type of transfer into personal accounts will already be permitted: the unvested money when someone leaves an occupational scheme before reaching the end of the vesting period, usually two years. Meanwhile, the other place&#151;especially a member of the noble Baroness&#146;s party, John Greenway MP&#151;has grappled with the thought that some people may have a legitimate reason for transferring funds out of personal accounts prior to 2017; migrant workers returning home, for example.</p>

<a name="80702-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="08070255000350"></a>I do not like inflexibility. The object of my amendment is to build greater flexibility into the contribution limits of personal accounts. It is a probing amendment. I am not sure that the wording &#147;must&#148; is the best way to achieve this and accept that some work needs doing on it. However, the point is that we want people to save more. The contribution limits for personal accounts do not seem to encourage this on a voluntary basis.</p>

<a name="80702-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="08070255000351"></a>I understand the Minister&#146;s desire for simplicity. I also understand PADA's desire to be able to market a simple low-cost scheme to personal account members. The 4-3-1 idea outlined by Tim Jones is a form of &#147;BOGOF&#148;: buy one, get one free. If the employee contributes 4 per cent, the employer must contribute at least 3 per cent and tax relief tops it up with another 1 per cent. My amendment would not confuse that message of simplicity, as that message relates to those who are auto-enrolled into personal accounts and will be getting an employer contribution. My amendment would apply to those who made contributions voluntarily, who would not necessarily have an employer contribution. I should like to see greater flexibility there.</p>

<a name="80702-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="08070255000352"></a>Specifically, the amendment would require the Government to prescribe additional contribution limits into personal accounts in addition to an annual contribution limit. Rather than &#147;may&#148;, they &#147;must&#148; do so; as I said, the wording needs some attention. The sort of additional limits I had in mind are a lifetime lump-sum limit, or a higher contribution limit in the first year; another would be to enable missed contributions to be made up at a later date, tying in with the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, which seeks to do just that.</p>

I know that the Minister is sympathetic, too&#151;he indicated as much at the briefing session on the Bill that I hosted for Peers prior to Second Reading. More to the point, the Government's White Paper  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_288"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column 288</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>actually suggested a &#163;10,000 limit in year 1. Perhaps the existing ISA vehicle could be used for this purpose in the two years leading to the &#147;go-live date&#148;&#151;that is, from April 2010.</p>

<a name="80702-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="08070255000354"></a>The Government should also examine the feasibility of establishing a lifetime limit in addition to the annual limit to allow consumers to pay in lump sums, such as an inheritance, redundancy payments or bonuses, or to make up missed annual contributions&#151;the subject of the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis. This sum could be around &#163;50,000 across a member's lifetime. If this is not acceptable to the Minister, then I would agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, that personal account members should be able to, as her amendment says,</p>
<ul><a name="08070255000457"></a>&#147;make good the shortfall where contributions fell below the maximum amount in a preceding tax year or years&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80702-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="08070255000355"></a>My simple amendment would be consistent with the Treasury's publicly stated desire for pension saving to be flexible. I could not put it better than HM Treasury itself when it concluded, in its review of pension tax simplification in 2003, that,</p>
<ul><a name="08070255000458"></a>&#147;those on modest earnings who leave their pension savings late will not find that they are restricted in the amount of extra contributions they can make each year&#148;.</ul>

As the noble Baronesses, Lady Hollis and Lady Turner, have explained, this would particularly help women with broken work records in one year to top up their contributions as their circumstances improved in the next. It would also help older workers who will not start to save for a pension until 2012 and who will need all the help they can get to build up a significant pension by the time they retire. Neither should we forget what could be another group: those who have not been pensioned yet and leave it comparatively late to start saving for a pension because of debt problems at the start of their working lives. This last group may be graduates with student debt, whose earnings are generally expected to be quite high&#151;but that will not necessarily apply to all graduates or all people with large debt problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="08070255000361"></a>Last week, we heard about the Government's plans to help women gain salary equality with men. Bravo for that, but in other fields there is clearly a long way to go before financial equality between the sexes is achieved. Women need the Government to understand how difficult it is for many of them regularly to put enough money by for a pension and why flexibility in the annual contribution limit for personal accounts is desirable, so that they have the option of making good a shortfall if their circumstances change.</p>

The noble Baroness talked about the fears of the Association of British Insurers and the industry about what I think she called a vortex, sucking in all manner of pension contributions. Frankly, if only anything could suck in more contributions from all around. Saving in this country has collapsed in the first quarter to 1 per cent of income. We should be very careful about restricting any vehicle that is efficient, low-cost and targeted to lower income people. As my noble friend Lady Thomas said, we do not really support limits as restrictive as they are here. It is a pretty open question whether there should be any limits at all on contributions into personal accounts, because we are desperately keen to encourage saving and we favour maximum consumer choice.</p>

As we have heard, there is the extra complication for people of doing so, but part of the argument is that personal accounts are low-cost and efficient. ISAs are quite expensive. The whole point of personal accounts is that it is a low-cost, straightforward scheme. Also, people, perhaps particularly women,

</ul>
<p><a name="08070255000403"></a>and that two of the main companies have put up the charges from 0.4 per cent a year to 0.75 per cent and from 0.37 per cent to 0.67 per cent respectively. This is where people have moved on, have small pots left in old schemes and are in a sense trapped in those schemes. It is perfectly reasonable and it is a good competitive position that if they are being squeezed in that way and if they want to do so, they should be able to take the money out and put it into personal accounts. The insurance industry should not worry so much. Personal accounts are here to help. They maximise consumer choice and they will particularly help low-paid people and women with broken records who are not saving for a pension. We should be much more positive about them.</p>

I remind noble Lords of the report on personal accounts by the Work and Pensions Select Committee in another place, which was very much encouraging last year a more open and less restrictive attitude. I will not read them out, but there were responses from the Government at that stage looking at additional contributions and additional flexibility, and I would be interested to know where the Government&#146;s thoughts have got to on that. We are very much in favour of opening things up and de-restricting. Heaven knows any form of pension saving in this country must be made as easy as possible.</p>

To deal with the question asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, about where transfers fit in, a ban on transfers into personal accounts, subject to the exceptions, will be in the scheme order, and transfers out will be prohibited under Clause 111.

The majority of stakeholders agree that a balance has been struck between, on the one hand, focusing personal accounts on the moderate to low earners and not impinging on good-quality existing provision and, on the other hand, making sure that personal accounts can cater to the needs of their members. We are committed to an annual limit of &#163;3,600, but based on 2005 earnings, which will be uprated in line with earnings to 2012 and beyond. This gives assurance to pension providers that personal accounts cannot take the place of existing products but will enable saving beyond the minimum for the majority of personal accounts.</p>

The pension industry is concerned about the level of that and indeed is content with &#163;3,600 uprated in line with earnings. There is a lack of clarity. Would the Minister not consider putting this&#151;with the appropriate formulation so that it calibrates itself correctly&#151;on the face of the Bill?</p>

The &#163;3,600 figure has been around now for a while. I know it started at &#163;5,000, there was a big debate around it and there is still discussion about a one-off &#163;10,000 contribution and a lifetime limit. I will come to that. The &#163;3,600 has, however, been around for some time. We are committed to it. I believe stakeholders know where we stand. I cannot believe there is any misunderstanding out there. If there is, we are always happy to seek to clarify and to confirm the Government&#146;s position. We have, however, been very clear on that for a long while.</p>

<a name="80702-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="08070255000377"></a>The &#163;3,600 limit gives assurance to pension providers. Personal accounts, as I said, cannot take the place of existing products but will enable saving beyond the minimum for the majority of personal account members. Even somebody earning above the upper limit of the earnings band would receive about &#163;840 per year in employer contributions and, coupled with the employee contribution including tax relief, this would increase to &#163;2,240. This leaves ample headroom for both employers and employees to contribute more if they so choose. My noble friend Lady Hollis talked about someone on half median earnings with contributions of &#163;1,000, which leaves considerably greater headroom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="08070255000378"></a>I will now turn to the amendments on Clause 61. Amendments Nos. 111, 111C and 112 all addressed the issue of a lifetime contribution limit. We considered the concept of allowing a further limit to run alongside

Consequently we have allowed for a discretionary power on the face of the Bill. Allowing for saving beyond the annual limit has merits, as my noble friend Lady Hollis and the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, have described, as have others. Such a facility may help women and others who take career breaks to undertake caring responsibilities who may wish to make additional contributions in later years to compensate for this shortfall. We are still considering this facility but we need to bear in mind the need to avoid additional bells and whistles when the scheme is introduced. Each additional design feature will add costs, which will be paid for by the scheme members. It is also important to remember, as I said earlier, that the annual limit provides considerable scope anyway for one-off payments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="08070255000379"></a>The Personal Accounts Delivery Authority has provided us with detailed advice on the cost and operational complexity of introducing a lifetime lump-sum facility. We are considering its advice carefully and will make our decision in due course. Amendments Nos. 111, 111C and 112 would pre-empt this decision and limit flexibility to return to this important issue at a later stage&#151;for example, as part of our 2017 review&#151;on the basis of further evidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="08070255000380"></a>Amendment No. 111A aims to fix a maximum level of employer contributions into the personal accounts scheme and Amendment No. 111B seeks to put the annual contribution limit on the face of the Bill. There is a general requirement for employers using occupational money purchase schemes, including the personal accounts scheme, to contribute at least 3 per cent of employees&#146; qualifying earnings. Amendment No. 111A would set the level of the employer&#146;s contribution for the personal accounts scheme at 3 per cent, effectively prohibiting employers from paying more should they wish. That is the import of the contribution of the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="08070255000381"></a>I do not believe we should obstruct employers who want to use personal accounts and to contribute over 3 per cent. We should be doing all we can to encourage both employers and employees to contribute more to pensions saving if they are able to do so. The Bill will help preserve existing provision but I cannot accept that we would need to unfairly restrict employers who wanted to use the personal accounts scheme to achieve this aim.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="08070255000382"></a>Amendment No. 111B would put the annual contribution limit on the face of the Bill, adjusted annually, taking into account the changes in average earnings in the same manner as the qualifying earnings band. As I have just said, we have been clear that we intend to set the contribution limit at &#163;3,600 in 2005 earnings terms and have reached a broad consensus with our stakeholders that this is the appropriate level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="08070255000383"></a>We fully expect to uprate the annual contribution limit in line with changes to average earnings on an ongoing basis, but we must remember that this is a unique feature in an occupational pension scheme. It

<a name="80702-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="08070255000384"></a>Details about how the annual contribution limit will work will be set out in the scheme order. PADA and the DWP are working jointly on developing the content of the scheme order and non-legislative rules for a public consultation in March 2009. We believe that our approach to Clause 61 and the annual contribution limit is the right one. Stakeholders believe that a sensible balance has been struck.</p>

<a name="80702-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08070255000385"></a>My noble friend Lady Hollis stressed the point about doing what we can to help people build bigger pots. That must be right. There is some headroom within the existing limit which will go some way&#151;for lower earners quite a considerable way&#151;towards her objective.</p>

<a name="80702-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="08070255000386"></a>What has struck me since my involvement in the Bill&#151;a lot of the consensus was created and driven before I ever got involved&#151;is that a number of stakeholders have said, &#147;We have not quite got what we want from this. We would like it to be better from our point of view in this direction or in a different direction&#148;. Stakeholders have been prepared to sign up to the consensus and to try to make this work on the basis that it is a consensus.</p>

<a name="80702-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="08070255000387"></a>In terms of a lifetime limit and possible one-off contributions, we have sought advice from PADA. That advice has now been received by my colleague Mike O&#146;Brien, the Minister of State, and there will be consideration of that in due course. We are also committed to reviewing these matters together with issues of transfers in and out of schemes in 2017. The flexibility in the clause, therefore, is important in that respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="08070255000388"></a>In having disappointed everyone who has spoken today, I hope that I can at least escape with the proviso that I think we are in a place that will work, but some challenges and important issues have still been raised in this debate. I collectively ask everyone not to press their amendments.</p>

This is one of many ways in which to do that; I am sure that we will revisit some of the other ways. I am grateful for the contributions of all noble Lords, irrespective&#151;as with unisex annuities&#151;of gender.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="08070264000002"></a>I want to comment on Amendment No. 111A, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, which is grouped with my amendment. She emphasised several times that personal accounts involved a default scheme. I am sure that she is aware that if a woman on half median earnings of &#163;11,000&#151;she is the figure whom we are seeking to help&#151;were in an average DC scheme, the employer would pay, on average, 6 per cent on the whole of her earnings from &#163;0 to &#163;11,000. In a personal account, half that would be paid on half of her earnings. Effectively, 1.5 per cent would be paid; that is all.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_295"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column 295</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="08070264000003"></a>Some employers, especially micro-employers, might not want to go into the market to set up a separate fund; they are currently paying, for someone earning &#163;11,000 a year, &#163;3 a week. The noble Baroness&#146;s amendment would force them into paying perhaps &#163;5 a week&#151;&#163;2 extra. They would be forced into the inconvenience, the hassle, the cost, the trouble and the inflexibility of going into the marketplace when they do not want to for the sake of &#163;2 a week. I cannot believe that the noble Baroness, who is always so concerned to remind us of the burdens on business, is opposed to all burdens on business except where the employer might seek to avoid such a burden with a personal account by paying a contribution for an employee that is over the minimum. At that point, the noble Baroness would impose on the business the burden of going for a market option that it may not wish to seek. I find that, if I may say so, an extraordinary volte-face from the noble Baroness. It appears that she is so concerned with the meta-language of what may happen to the stability of bigger funds&#151;I accept that&#151;that she is willing to impose burdens of that size on micro-employers for &#163;2 a week; she cannot regard that, on reflection, as reasonable.</p>

<a name="80702-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="08070264000004"></a>The noble Baroness made some entirely valid comments on my amendment about NIRS2 and tracking. With personal accounts, we must, by definition, track in the contributions. We will therefore know, by definition, the years for which contributions have not been made. I do not see a problem; if you know that you are contributing from, say, 2015 to 2019, and you contribute again from 2022, by definition you know that between 2019 and 2022 you have not been contributing; the records will show that. The headspace is there and is available to be filled. NIRS2 was different.</p>

Unless there is a need to know the annual build-up of the contributions within the personal accounts scheme, why would that scheme need the kind of architecture that allows this detailed tracking, year by year, which is maintained, as I outlined, for up to 60 years? Once the money is in, within a certain limit&#151;I refer to those years for which there might be corrections&#151;there will be no need for the personal accounts scheme to have that detailed history of how it was built up, because it would just be in an allocated pot that was accumulating. The history will be history and of no relevance. That I why I believe that additional burdens will be put on to PADA.</p>

I would be amazed if companies did not think it wise to keep those records. The noble Baroness may be right&#151;I defer to her greater expertise on this&#151;but it would be very rash indeed not to keep records to track, if only to avoid possible arguments about the size of the pot, the investments made and any access to following benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="08070264000007"></a>The problem with NIRS2 was not about tracking the records but the fact that NIRS2, as I know to my bitter experience, failed to notify people of their deficient contributions.

<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="08070264000008"></a>Finally, my noble friend cheered me up slightly when he said that it was perfectly reasonable that these things were under review. He talked about the need to keep this simple and not to make PADA&#146;s job more difficult. However, he should consider the fact that flexibility is not the opposite of simplicity; it is the opposite of inflexibility and rigidity. The requirement down the years would be to revisit something because not enough headspace was built in in the first place. I am sure that my noble friend is well aware of that.

<a name="80702-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="08070264000016"></a>Transfers are rather like top-ups in that it is not absolutely clear that it will be right for people to transfer money out of existing pension rights in other schemes and into the personal accounts scheme. The Minister will be aware that there is a concern in the pensions-providing industry that personal accounts will suck in money and that the scheme could advertise itself as sucking in all these additional pension pots.

What is the Government&#146;s view of timing in this regard? Will there be a review ahead of 2017 to allow transfers potentially from 2017, or a review after five years of operation of the scheme, leading to transfers possibly being allowed from perhaps 2019? That would be an important piece of information. I should be grateful for the Minister&#146;s latest view on the Government&#146;s position on transfers. I beg to move.</p>

It has been raised by TPAS, whose 25th anniversary noble Lords have referred to, and I suspect that it may be a concern for many noble Lords. We may explore it more fully on Amendment No. 134ZB. It involves the issue of stranded pots and the capacity to transfer them in.</p>

<a name="80702-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="08070264000019"></a>I am batting beyond my technical range here; I hope that noble Lords will forgive me if I am mistaken, but I believe that what I am saying is accurate. Let us assume that an employee in her 50s joins a personal account in 2012 and, over the next five years, puts in the maximum, which comes, in today&#146;s prices, to &#163;18,000. I agree that that is unlikely but it is possible. That sum could not be trivially commuted; she would be forced to annuitise it. Let us suppose that that employee already has two small personal pots, each in personal pensions, of &#163;2,000 each. If those two small pots were based on occupational pensions, with an employer contribution or whatever, the 2008 Budget would allow her, as I understand it, to trivially commute them in addition to her &#163;18,000 coming in from her personal account. In other words, they can essentially be ignored.</p>

<a name="80702-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="08070264000020"></a>However, if her two small personal pensions are not occupational, but personal pensions, she cannot trivially commute them; she cannot annuitise them, because they are too small and, with the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment, she cannot transfer them into her personal account. Those two &#163;2,000 pots are completely lost; they are stranded in no-man&#146;s land. She already has savings of &#163;18,000 in her personal account. She has an additional &#163;4,000. If those pots are in an occupational pension she can get at them, but if they are in a personal pension she cannot and they are totally lost. I understand that to be the case; if it is, frankly, something has to be done about it.</p>

<a name="80702-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="08070264000021"></a>We can discuss this again when we get to the amendment on trivial commutation, but I am giving warning now, because I think that it is one circumstance in which problems might arise. Another circumstance is pension sharing on divorce; you may end up with a sum where the existing pension fund does not want to retain the split but the fund has nowhere else much to go. There may be cases like that where those sums need to be able to come into personal accounts. Whether that is effected through the code of practice or guidance&#151;it does not necessarily have to be done on the face of the Bill&#151;or through regulations, there is a bundle of such issues almost hiding under the stones, which we will uncover as we go through the Bill.</p>

<a name="80702-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="08070264000022"></a>This is the issue that most grieves me. I raised it at the TPAS reception dinner last night. The chief executive of PADA and several financial advisers said that it is a real problem. I am persuaded that we should do something about it. That may not be today. My noble friend may not yet have sufficient answers; I recognise that this is primarily a matter for HMRC rather than DWP. However, I hope that noble Lords will agree with me that we cannot tolerate a situation in which modest savings are left stranded, not belonging to anybody, and just fall back to the general scheme members. Those modest savings will have been lost to somebody for whom every penny counts.</p>

These are what some people call &#147;zombie pots&#148;. Many people to whom one talks, particularly those who are not well off, have little pots&#151;&#163;2,000 here, &#163;3,000 there. They are hardly worth the bother and people do not know what to do with them. I talked earlier about how insurance companies are putting up charges and, similarly, this is not very economic for them. It seems to me that, for the reasons that we discussed in the debate on the last group of amendments, it must make sense to have a relaxed attitude towards letting people consolidate their little pots into personal accounts.</p>

<a name="80702-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08070264000024"></a>I cannot for the life of me see why the insurance industry is so worried about this. If it is giving a good, cost-effective service to these people already, it should not worry. It would just be offering consumer choice. From the point of view of PADA, I do not see that this is bells and whistles. To be able to have a number of small pots coming in will, by definition, reduce your cost base because you will have a higher average pot and economies of scale. For the same reasons and principles that we were talking about on the last group, we oppose these amendments and are in favour of people having maximum flexibility to bring these little pots in.</p>

I believe that we have made quite clear our commitment to banning pension transfers into and out of the personal accounts scheme. Our rationale for banning the transfers of pension funds to and from personal accounts, as with the contribution limit that we have just been discussing, is to minimise the impact on the market caused by the scheme&#146;s introduction in 2012 and to ensure that the scheme remains focused on the target market of low to moderate earners. Furthermore, the transfer ban is designed to promote simplicity for employers, individuals and the personal accounts scheme, as transfers can involve complex financial decisions and processes for all parties.</p>

<a name="80702-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="08070264000026"></a>Our policy on transfers was widely supported by our stakeholders. However, as always, we must allow the scope for some exceptions. First, we propose that there will be two exceptions to the prohibition on transfers into personal accounts. These relate to pre-vested pension rights and pension credits on divorce. These are tightly defined circumstances and we do not believe that these exceptions will dilute the focus on the target market or have a significant impact on the financial services industry. We will set out the detail of the ban on the transfer of pension funds into personal accounts in the scheme order, as I explained earlier. We plan to prohibit transfers out of personal accounts under Clause 111 of the Bill and we intend to amend the rules in the existing legislation, the Pension Schemes Act 1993, to prevent members from transferring out of the personal accounts scheme.</p>

<a name="80702-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="08070264000027"></a>We recognise that the transfer-out ban could complicate the decumulation arrangements for individuals over 55 who may want to aggregate all their pension pots in

My noble friend Lady Hollis and the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, in particular, have touched on this. Making an exception for stranded pots is a further area that we want to consider in some detail before we introduce the transfer-out regulations. We will look at that seriously. PADA and DWP are currently working jointly on developing the likely content and approach of the secondary legislation, the scheme order, and non-legislative scheme rules for a public consultation in March 2009.</p>

<a name="80702-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="08070264000028"></a>Amendments Nos. 112A and 112B would place a blanket ban on all transfers, in and out, until 2017. I have some sympathy with the idea of a bedding-in period, effectively allowing the personal accounts scheme and the existing industry to adjust before 2017, when transfers may again be permitted. Indeed, our commitment to a ban on transfers and a subsequent review in 2017 will achieve this. However, as I have explained, we cannot support the idea of a blanket ban. It is important that we allow limited scope for a number of closely defined transfers that will benefit scheme members but will not impact adversely on the pensions market.</p>

<a name="80702-0010.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="08070264000029"></a>Even in the short time between establishing personal accounts and the 2017 review we do not believe that it makes sense to prevent, for example, transfers of pension shares on divorce into personal accounts. We will keep the position on transfers under review as the personal accounts scheme evolves and the wider market impacts become better understood. The 2017 review will address this issue specifically.</p>

<a name="80702-0010.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="08070264000030"></a>In response to the question put by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, the current proposition is that the review will take place in 2017. It will decide what will happen to the ban: whether it will be lifted and within what timescale. I hope that the noble Baroness is reassured by my iteration of our commitment to limit transfers in all but an extremely limited range of cases and I ask her to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="08070269000004"></a>The noble Baroness said: We are still in Clause 61 but this is a slightly different point. Amendment No. 112C proposes to repeal subsection (5) of Clause 61. We have just been discussing what restrictions on personal accounts, if any, should be placed in the Bill.

<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="08070269000005"></a>This amendment is different and subsection (5) is a completely different part of the clause. It is predicated on there being limits and restrictions of some nature set under the order-making powers. However, subsection (5) allows the Secretary of State to repeal the section and

The only parliamentary control on this section would be the affirmative procedure, which we have already had the pleasure of discussing today, and I shall not repeat the views of these Benches on the efficacy of that procedure.</p>

<a name="80702-0010.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="08070269000006"></a>We can obviously have a healthy debate, as we have partly had today, about what sorts of limits are appropriate for this scheme, bearing in mind the different desires of different groups of individuals and businesses. However, it is difficult to see whether there would be any circumstances in which the Secretary of State would give up the power to set limits and restrictions, thereby allowing the personal accounts scheme to extend beyond its target market without any reference to Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="08070269000007"></a>The personal accounts scheme will be a public body operating with huge financial clout. The way that it operates could create market imperfections and we believe that it would be irresponsible of the Government to dispense with their ability to set limits. If it were ever determined that the personal accounts pension scheme should be allowed to set its own rules as to what moneys it would accept and on what terms, that would be tantamount to giving it licence to demolish the private sector pensions industry.</p>

<a name="80702-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="08070269000008"></a>The Minister may well say that the Competition Commission and the Office of Fair Trading are well placed to handle such issues, but there really is no reason why the Government should create a body which might turn into an unconstrained near-monopoly. The Government have a duty to ensure that their quango does not act in that way; hence, they need to retain the full powers in Clause 61 and there should be no possibility of them not having those powers to exercise.</p>

<a name="80702-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="08070269000009"></a>If the Government ever thought that it was appropriate for the personal accounts pension scheme to operate without limits&#151;we find it very difficult to see how that position could ever be reached unless, by then, the personal accounts pension scheme had swallowed up all private sector savings&#151;we do not believe that it would be right for this mechanism to be achieved by way of an affirmative instrument. Instead, it would be right to come back to Parliament by way of primary legislation at whatever opportunity presented itself so that at that point Parliament could consider on the normal basis whether it was right for the Government to give up their powers. I look forward to hearing from the Minister whether he has any good reason for including the power in subsection (5). I beg to move.</p>

I put it to the Minister that you can always set very high limits if you want. The Secretary of State can say that the limit is &#163;1 million&#151;you can have any limit you want. Therefore, I find it very odd to set out the contribution limits and then to say, &#147;But we may just blow this whole thing up after all&#148;. So, like the noble Baroness, I cannot see that this subsection is appropriate and I support the amendment.</p>

We have made our position on these measures clear in various publications and statements, and the contribution limit has been extensively debated here today and in the other place.</p>

<a name="80702-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="08070269000012"></a>As is said, our policy on the contribution limits has been widely discussed and there is broad consensus with our stakeholders about the &#163;3,600 level for the annual contribution limit. As part of this consensus, it has been widely acknowledged that there is a need to review the policy at some point after implementation. That is why we are committed to having a review in 2017 of two of the features of the scheme: the contribution limit and the prohibition of transfers to and from the scheme. That has been agreed by the Secretary of State and announced in previous publications. The review will enable the Government to assess whether these measures have been successful in promoting market stability as intended without detriment to individuals within the scheme.</p>

<a name="80702-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="08070269000013"></a>Following the review, and if the review evidence clearly indicates that the contribution limit should be abolished, the Secretary of State may decide to remove the requirement to have a contribution limit in the personal accounts scheme. Clause 61 allows the Secretary of State to do just that. Of course, if the review evidence indicates that the limits should remain, the Secretary of State is not required to use this power and the limits can remain and be adjusted as necessary.</p>

In other words, should the 2017 review find conclusively that a contribution limit was not necessary&#151;for example, if it found that the limit was hampering saving and was not needed to maintain market stability&#151;it would be difficult to remove the requirement to have a limit. Personal accounts would then be required to operate a limit until a suitable opportunity to amend primary legislation arose.</p>

<a name="80702-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="08070269000015"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness accepts my assurance that the Secretary of State will exercise this power only in such circumstances as I have described. I should add that Parliament will be able to debate fully the exercise of the power, which uses the affirmative procedure. I hope that that goes some way towards addressing the noble Baroness&#146;s concerns and that she understands that the purpose of the power is to allow the Secretary of State to act on the findings of the 2017 review, should it be required. I hope that that is clear but I see that it may not be and that some questions may be coming my way.</p>

I found the Minister&#146;s response a little troubling. He said that a review would be held in 2017 and that it would review the limits, which is an issue for Clause 61, together with transfers, which, as he established earlier,  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_302"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column 302</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are not an issue for Clause 61. Therefore, the issue of transfers is on one side; we are talking about limits, and in particular the limit under subsection (1).</p>

<a name="80702-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="08070269000017"></a>My point is that, even if the Government carried out a review in 2017&#151;an idea that we support&#151;they could never realistically come to the conclusion that they should write their power out of the Act. I completely accept that they could use their power to set much higher limits if they were satisfied that no market imperfection was caused and that there was genuine consumer demand for it, but I think it is very unwise for the Secretary of State to say, &#147;I&#146;ll never ever need that power again&#148;, because what the Government find in 2017 may not be what they find at some later date.</p>

<a name="80702-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="08070269000018"></a>This will be a state-backed pension scheme and therefore we have to bear in mind that it will be a bit of a brute in financial importance terms, given the sheer volumes of money flowing through it. It is not responsible of the Government even to have a power to repeal the need to place limits, and therefore I hope that the Minister will look carefully at this again. It would be unsatisfactory to leave subsection (5) in the clause because it would be difficult to conceive of any situation where a Secretary of State could satisfy himself that for all time there should be no power to set the limits as described in this clause&#151;that is, not only the annual limit but also the possibility of setting additional amounts under subsection (3). I do not know whether the Minister would like to add anything to what he has already said.</p>

The noble Baroness is taking an interesting position in that she is seeking to encourage the Secretary of State to stay involved and hang on to power. That is not what we usually hear from her. It may well be the case that the review in 2017 will say that there should be some relaxation to the limit, as that is what the evidence points to, but that there is no conclusive evidence that it needs to be abandoned for all time, in which case the Secretary of State does not need to operate under Clause 61(5). Quite how he would operate in those circumstances, given the vote that took place earlier, which abrogated our power to bring forward orders under these schemes, is another matter. Perhaps I should not press that point too far.</p>

<a name="80702-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="08070269000020"></a>The noble Baroness makes a reasonable point. If at that juncture there is not sufficient evidence to say that there should never be contribution limits, it may not be a wise use of the power, but it might be clear at that point that that position is taken. Having a contribution limit at whatever level imposes a cost on the scheme and on members, because it has to be implemented, policed and compliant, even if we are at a fairly high level. I do not see why the noble Baroness should be too troubled, but it is important that there is the facility to lift those contribution limits if they are not impacting adversely on the market and if they are restricting the right of the people at whom the schemes are aimed to save more fully.</p>

Having created that large state-backed financial institution with significant market power because of its size, its access to marketing budgets and so on, the Secretary of State should always retain the power to restrain the uncompetitive use of the financial muscle of that body, notwithstanding that there might be a review of limits because different limits might not be destructive to markets. We are not quite having a meeting of minds and we will not do so today, but the Minister will not tempt me to test the opinion of the House today.

But we believe that it is wrong in principle that the Secretary of State should foist a large number of members of the corporation on a new chairman. Accordingly, Amendment No. 112D proposes that the Secretary of State must consult the chairman about appointments of other members. The chairman must be able to work with his members and it is dangerous if he has no say whatever in their selection. This is good practice and I hope that there would not be any other procedure that could conceivably be followed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="08070269000032"></a>Amendment No. 112G restricts the initial period in which appointments will be made by the Secretary of State to 12 months. I can see in the build-up period of the trustees, that it would not be appropriate for a small number to appoint the rest but we must not let that unusual power last for too long. In fact, 12 months may be too generous an allowance for the task of building the board. But the point of my amendment is that the time should be finite and on the face of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="08070269000033"></a>Amendment No. 112P amends paragraph 5 which allows the Secretary of State to remove members from office. I can see no need for this provision after the initial period. The circumstances listed in paragraph 5 are perfectly well handled by the corporation itself on an ongoing basis. I could see that the Secretary of State might have a reserve power if he came to the conclusion that the board overall was not fulfilling its remit, but there is no such targeted power in the Bill and the power in paragraph 5 is simply inappropriate on an ongoing basis to deal with the board&#146;s composition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="08070269000034"></a>Lastly, Amendment No. 112R amends paragraph 7(l), under which it is up to the Secretary of State to determine pay. My amendment says that it is the corporation, after consultation with the Secretary of State, which will set pay. I see that the Secretary of State should have a formal role in consenting, but there is no need for him to get involved in pay matters. His civil servants have no expertise in pay, especially in the specialised area of running a pension trustee corporation, and there is no point in filling up their days with such matters. The Minister will have to talk a good story to justify the Secretary of State&#146;s paws remaining over the pension trustee corporation. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="08070269000037"></a>First, I should explain that all the appointments in the initial period will be ministerial and so must be made in accordance with the guidance issued by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments. This guidance ensures that appointments to public office follow a fair, open and transparent process. We want the trustee corporation to be given as much freedom as is reasonable for a public body, to get on with the job of running the scheme. So, from the end of the initial period, the trustee corporation will be responsible for recruiting its own members as and when vacancies arise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="08070269000038"></a>Amendment No. 112D requires the Secretary of State and the corporation itself to consult with the chair of the corporation when making appointments. During the initial period, the Secretary of State will consult with any previously appointed members of the trustee corporation on new appointments. This membership would include the chair of the corporation. As a sole corporate trustee, all members of the trustee corporation will have an equal voice and equal weight in decision-making. Each member is a valued participant in the administration of the scheme. The chair does not have a greater say than other members, a distinction from the role of chair that one would often see.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08070269000039"></a>When responsibility passes to the corporation, it is important that the corporation as a whole satisfies itself of the suitability of the potential appointee. This would, of course, automatically include the chair of the corporation.</p>

At this point we do not have all the detail for the preparation of the recruitment timetable. The delivery authority will advise us on this process in due course. We need to consider advice before making a final decision. There may be good operational reasons for it to be longer than 12 months, but equally it may be less. Our intention is that the initial period will not be any longer than is absolutely necessary, and in any event will end at the latest by the time the scheme opens for business in 2012.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="08070269000041"></a>Amendment No. 112P relates to the ability of the Secretary of State to remove a member of the trustee corporation from office. As the sponsor of a public body, the Secretary of State has a responsibility not only to the public, but to Parliament. The ultimate responsibility, to ensure that the provisions agreed by Parliament are carried out via the corporation, remains with the Secretary of State. Therefore, it is right that the Secretary of State must be able to assure himself and, if necessary, Parliament that the members of the trustee corporation remain suitable for their position of trust and responsibility. This is not a power to be used lightly. Although the power seems wide, it would be used only in exceptional circumstances. It is usual practice to include this power in legislation when establishing a non-departmental public body.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="08070269000042"></a>Amendment No. 112R would remove the Secretary of State&#146;s ability to determine the level of remuneration of members of the trustee corporation. Although he would have to be consulted, no consent would be required. It is normal practice for the Secretary of

The Secretary of State himself may not be particularly well versed in market rates, but he would take appropriate advice. The funding for the trustee corporation, including trustee remuneration, will come from charges to the scheme members. So although the corporation will be self-financing, the Secretary of State will retain an interest as Minister for the sponsoring department and the settlor of the scheme.</p>

<a name="80702-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="08070269000043"></a>This amendment would, in effect, leave the trustee corporation to determine its own levels of remuneration. That would be a highly unusual situation and one that could open the members of the trustee corporation to accusations of feathering their own nests. We of course doubt that this would happen but, in such an important matter, even the appearance of preferential treatment would be damaging. I hope that has been helpful to the noble Baroness. I have explained each of the points about which she had concerns and I hope she feels able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

I found the Minister's response to Amendment No. 112D a little perplexing&#151;that the chairman would have no greater say than the other members, which is unlike a normal corporation. A chairman in any situation has responsibilities to bring the organisation together, to manage business, to ensure that the board is effective and so on. That is why the chairman should be the person who has a say in the appointment of members. That is normal commercial practice. I think it is the practice in the non-profit sector and it is the practice in the majority of the public sector. I am mystified by what the Minister has said.

<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="08070269000048"></a>On the other issues raised by my amendments, the Minister basically said he had no idea for how long we needed an initial period, which is what we are pretty used to in some of the responses on the personal accounts scheme. We might get tired of hearing that. On the removal of members and their remuneration, the Minister has repeated the fact that the Secretary of State wants to keep a hold on those things because it is a public body. We will think about that further, but for the moment I believe I have flagged up the fact that my serious concern is with the Government&#146;s concept of what a chair of this organisation will do, which means they may go out and recruit the wrong kind of person.

<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="08070269000056"></a>They say a week is a long time in politics; even a day seems a long time in the Middle East. On the one hand, we have cause for optimism in the discussions between Syria and Israel, brokered by Turkey; between Hamas and Israel, initiated by Egypt; between Hezbollah and Israel, brokered by Germany; and those between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas&#151;a bewildering series of simultaneous initiatives. On the other hand, we have Hamas continuing to arm itself and maintaining its rhetoric of death and destruction for Israel; Syria  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_308"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column 308</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and Iran increasing their hold on Lebanon through support of Hezbollah with thousand upon thousand of increasingly sophisticated rockets; Israel maintaining a severe grip on the West Bank; and Iran spouting destruction for Israel, while building its nuclear capability. Even today we have the terrible news of a lone Palestinian running amok in Jerusalem with a bulldozer and killing several Israelis who were going about their business.</p>

<a name="80702-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="08070269000057"></a>All those have a bearing on how we consider the talks between Israel and the Palestinians and I will comment, rather briefly I am afraid, on some of them. First, the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, brokered by Egypt, did not happen overnight. It must have taken many months of secret negotiation, but it is clear that this is a ceasefire and not a peace agreement. Many, in Israel at least, are quite unconvinced that it will last while Hamas remains committed to Israel's destruction. But let us be thankful for small mercies: the residents of Sderot can begin to emerge from their cellars as there is a lull in the perpetual rain of rockets to which they have been subjected for the past couple of years, and the civilians of Gaza can breathe more easily as Israel refrains from responding. Of course, this may be seen simply as a lull or as the beginning of a beginning of a process. Certainly when Israel withdrew from Gaza it was not to start a war but to start a peace.</p>

<a name="80702-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="08070269000058"></a>Is there anything that the UK Government can usefully do to help Egypt in this endeavour? I ask the Minister whether we can offer support and perhaps technical assistance for the efforts to prevent the smuggling of arms from Egypt into Gaza and for the release of Corporal Shalit. Can we also take advantage of the extremely valuable role Egypt can play in the negotiations between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority? Palestinian unity would make it rather simpler for them and the Israelis to negotiate. Then there is Hezbollah; even there, indirect discussions brokered by Germany have seen some softening, with prisoner exchanges for Israeli soldiers&#151;we still do not know if they are alive or dead&#151;and even the Shebaa farms appear to be on the agenda.</p>

<a name="80702-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="08070269000059"></a>However, the most significant talks of all are those sponsored by Turkey between Syria and Israel. Syria holds the key and vital opportunities must not be allowed to slip there: we in the UK can play an important role. Syria is closely allied with Iran in many ways, but while Iran is ideologically and theologically driven to destroy Israel, Syria is rather more pragmatic. President Assad is under pressure to improve the parlous economic difficulties his country faces. Neither his own position nor that of his minority ruling Alawi sect is entirely secure. He would gain considerable clout internally if he were to regain the Golan Heights. That is on the table, but would come at a price: a peace treaty with Israel, the cessation of support for terrorist groups in Lebanon and Gaza and a reduction in ties with Iran&#151;a set of tall orders indeed.</p>

<a name="80702-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="08070269000060"></a>The Golan alone is unlikely to be enough for Syria to accept Israel&#146;s terms, yet Israel by itself has little else it could offer. That is where the international community must come in. We should consider what incentives we can provide and what aid, trade and  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_309"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column 309</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>legitimacy we can offer in an effort to bring it back to a pro-western stance. Here, we should begin by trying to persuade the USA to drop its resistance to discussions with Syria. Heavens, if Israel, which has most to fear, can talk to Syria, surely the US can.</p>

<a name="80702-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="08070269000061"></a>The potential dividends are large. An agreement with Syria would see a reduction of its support for Hezbollah and allow Lebanon a little more breathing space. That would, in turn, make relations between Israel and Lebanon, which have not been historic enemies, much more normal. Hamas in Gaza would receive less military support and its leadership in Damascus would be removed&#151;there is already talk of that, incidentally&#151;which would, in turn, encourage Hamas to engage more constructively with the Palestinian Authority and hence with Israel. Here, we should again enlist the support of Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Their voices are rather more likely to be listened to and their aims, in this at least, coincide with our own. What discussions are the Government having with the USA to persuade them to take an interest, and with the other Middle East countries in taking this forward?</p>

<a name="80702-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="08070269000062"></a>On the negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis, their two leaders, both very weak domestically, have been meeting frequently. Perhaps much more significantly, their negotiating teams have been deeply engaged in closely guarded discussions for months. Both sides have much to gain from a successful outcome, but both will have to make sacrifices, which have captured the attentions of those at extreme ends of the political spectrum on both sides. They will have to be faced and dealt with. Meanwhile, the details are, no doubt, being worked on; water supplies, roads and routes, security measures and so on. Yet it is already clear what overall shape the likely outcome will have.</p>

<a name="80702-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="08070269000063"></a>It is likely to include Israel&#146;s withdrawal from over 96 per cent of the West Bank and the dismantling of all but two of the settlement towns heavily embedded in the Jerusalem suburbs, with some geographic compensation elsewhere&#151;the only settlements, incidentally, where some Israeli building is allowed in the West Bank&#151;and the handing over of east Jerusalem to the PA. All those have already been mooted by Mr Olmert; in return, the Palestinians will have to ensure the security of the West Bank and temper their desire for the right of return of the three generations of Palestinians from pre-1948 Palestine, a demand which would see the end of Israel as Israel.</p>

<a name="80702-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="08070269000064"></a>Neither side gets all it wants, and there is resistance, but one feasible way through that depends on the fact that 70 per cent of Israelis and a similar proportion of Palestinians seem strongly in favour of a two-state solution. Certainly, that is clear if the 650,000 members of the organisation One Voice, in equal numbers of Israelis and Palestinians, are anything to go by. If the plan was announced and followed by the dissolution of parliaments on both sides and elections called on the basis of that plan, I suspect that it would be strongly supported. Of course, Hamas as well as the right in Israel would go wild, but the vote will be against them by a population sick and tired of war and killing, and they are likely to be isolated. Iran would be incensed, but there is nothing new there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="08070269000065"></a>Some would say that this is an unrealistic and wildly optimistic view of one possible outcome, but here in the UK we need to be straining every muscle to support whatever agreement is reached. We should resist the temptation to offer criticism of one or other party&#151;usually Israel, I am afraid. That has absolutely no impact and makes us even easier to ignore. Instead of futile and counterproductive activities, such as the academic boycotts sponsored by the University and College Union, we should be seeking avenues for increased collaboration between the UK and the Middle East, especially at a time when leaders in the region are talking ever more to each other.</p>

Finally, what support will my noble friend give to Israel and the Palestinians as they come to announce the results of their discussion and can he expand, in particular, on the aid so desperately needed by the Palestinians, which hangs so tantalizingly on a successful outcome?</p>

I am horrified, once again, by events in Jerusalem today and send my sincere condolences to the people involved. I was horrified, too, by the treatment of Mohammed Omer, a prize-winning journalist, who had briefed parliamentarians here this week before attempting to go home to Gaza, only to be beaten unconscious at the Allenby Bridge while an official from the Dutch embassy, who had facilitated his visit, was waiting for him. I am horrified by the rockets from Gaza terrorising Israelis, by the suicide bombers, by the helicopter gunships on their deadly missions, the monstrous security wall, the

<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="08070273000004"></a>I do not condone or understand the relentless expansion of the settlements on Palestinian land in defiance of the Geneva Conventions. I do not condone, but have tried to understand, the failure of the international community&#151;despite strong words of criticism&#151;to take action against Israel. I am beginning to understand the power of the Israel lobby, active here as well as in the USA, with AIPAC, the Friends of Israel and the Board of Deputies. They take vindictive actions against people who oppose and criticise the lobby, getting them removed from positions that they hold and preventing them from speaking&#151;even on unrelated subjects in my case. I understand their methods. I have many examples. They make constant accusations of anti-Semitism when no such sentiment exists to silence Israel&#146;s critics. If Israel is not persuaded to obey UN resolutions, and especially to start dismantling the settlements in the West Bank, anti-Semitism will again stalk Europe. Israel will never have peace and the world will never be free of terrorism unless this problem is resolved first. Attacks on Afghanistan and Iraq&#151;and Iran next&#151;are not the answer. They have created more terrorism. The answer is a peaceful and just settlement for Israel and the Palestinians, and Israel holds most of the cards.</p>

First, will he confirm HMG&#146;s continuing support for the quartet's search for a two-state solution to the Palestinian problem and can he assure the House that HMG will not allow the French initiative for a Mediterranean union&#151;admirable though that may be&#151;to divert attention from this absolute priority?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="08070273000006"></a>Secondly, will he confirm HMG's support for the indirect dialogue between the Israelis and the Syrians taking place in Istanbul? On a recent visit to Syria, I detected some doubt among Syrian officials and Ministers about whether HMG, or indeed the United States Government, were fully in support of this very brave initiative on both sides.

<a name="80702-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="08070273000009"></a>I shall make two observations. First, peace building is a complex and long-term process. Extreme patience&#151;if that is not a contradiction in terms&#151;is necessary. It means being inclusive and involving everybody who can possibly be involved in the process among the immediate parties and people in the region. It is not a matter of limiting talks to the people with whom it is easier to talk. It is a matter of bringing into the talks the people with whom it is difficult to talk. That is why the Hamas dimension is so important and why it is so naive to suppose that there is a homogenous position within it rather than pluralism, which we should be building on.</p>

<a name="80702-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="08070273000010"></a>Secondly, we must give people a stake in wanting peace to continue. That means that the terrible economic and social suffering that is the truth of Gaza and the West Bank at the moment has to be overcome. There is a direct link between the economic and social priorities and the priorities of the political dimension.</p>

<a name="80702-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="08070273000011"></a>It is time that we all got back to understanding why the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the principles of international law are so important. If any situation demonstrated that we must think of people primarily as people, not as one ethnic group or another, it is the Middle East.</p>

In its short lifetime, Israel has faced Arab armies and cries of &#147;Kill the Jews&#148;. More rockets have fallen on its towns and villages than descended on London in World War 2. Israel is never going to capitulate to that or to the shrill screams of the Iranian President. More Jews&#151;over 800,000&#151;were obliged to leave Arab lands and settle in Israel than Palestinians left beleaguered Israel. Of course, Israel has made grievous mistakes: the increase in settlements and the innocent Arabs killed or maimed&#151;although they were deliberately rendered vulnerable by Hamas. The invasion of the Lebanon is yet another example of ineptitude. Faced by potential extinction, tragedies occur.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="08070273000013"></a>The struggle between Israel and Hamas has been exported. In many of our universities, Jewish students have been savagely attacked simply because they are Jews. Dialogue has been replaced by violence. However, there are rays of hope. Let us hope that the ceasefire between Israelis and Arabs can become more durable and that the talks with Abbas can be worth while. An Israeli body preaches that Jewish and Arab landowners can live in peace. Some 77 per cent of Arabs want to continue to live in Israel; 66 per cent of Israeli Jews want Arab children to be taught in Jewish schools and 69 per cent of them support a two-state solution. There are tremendous hurdles in the way of peace, but there is still a viable way ahead.</p>

First, have they urged moderate Arabs not simply to sit on the fence but to influence the Palestinian Authority by supporting it financially and encouraging it to involve itself seriously in dialogue? Secondly, do Her Majesty's Government think that today&#146;s horrific incident in Jerusalem will encourage Israelis to find work for and to intermingle with the Palestinians?

The Annapolis process is vital as an opportunity that must be grasped fully, as the consequences of failure could be dire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="08070273000016"></a>On recent visits to Israel and the West Bank, and I have made many of them, I have met leaders on both sides. They all seem to believe that 2008 is a make-or-break year, so Her Majesty&#146;s Government must continue to play whatever part it is possible for them and us to play in a positive process. I welcome the financial support pledged by our Government at the donors&#146; conference for Palestinian economic development in Paris last December in support of a two-state solution. It is now vital that Her Majesty's Government and the wider international community help to sustain that momentum towards a lasting solution. I am sure that Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas agree. They meet twice a month and their negotiating teams come together regularly to discuss final-status issues. We must support, help and accelerate those negotiations. The alternative to talking is a return to the terrible violence that ended the peace process at Camp David in 2000, which we saw today and a little of which we perhaps heard a moment or two ago.</p>

<a name="80702-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="08070273000017"></a>The truce with Hamas is welcome and especially necessary for the people of Sderot and Gaza. But Hamas must remain outside the mainstream peace talks while it fails to recognise Israel and its right to exist and to fulfil the quartet&#146;s other guiding principles. Every effort must continue speedily to recognise the goal of an Israel that is free from daily threats of terror, with secure borders, alongside a viable and fully functioning Palestinian state. That is what the overwhelming majority of Israelis and Palestinians crave and deserve and I hope that it will soon become a reality.</p>

The West should put its weight behind the Arab League peace initiative, which was first proposed in 2003. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, that the West and Her Majesty&#146;s Government should back up the efforts of Egypt, Turkey, Qatar and Germany in mediating distinct aspects of the limping peace process.

Both Israelis and Palestinians are guilty, which is why so many of us, including OneVoice, are doing all that we can to bring young people of both communities together. There is a piece of graffiti that horribly and poignantly highlights this demonisation. I have seen it on the West Bank and I see it throughout Europe. It is the sign of the Star of David, followed by an equals sign, followed by a swastika. Its message is clear: by a perversity of logic, it is deemed that Israel, which was created by the victims of the Nazis, has become the new Nazi state.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="08070273000021"></a>The same mindset equally demonises Israel as being an apartheid state. Apartheid in South Africa was the legalised removal of most rights from all non-white people. That is not Israel. Indeed, the opposite is true. Within its borders, Israel has an Arab minority of more than 1 million citizens, who comprise 20 per cent of the population. All Israeli Arabs and Druze have full voting rights. Eleven Arabs are vocal members of the Knesset; the Minister without portfolio is an Arab; so, too, is the Deputy Speaker. An Arab holds a seat on the Supreme Court. It is odd&#151;is it not?&#151;that in Britain, where we have more than 2 million Muslims, very few hold such high offices of state. But in Israel they do. Arabs can attend any university in Israel. They comprise 20 per cent of the student population at the University of Haifa. Israeli Arabs can eat at any restaurant they choose, go to any cinema they want or fall in love with any person they like and marry whomever they choose. Does that sound like an apartheid state? I do not think so.</p>

I am a proud Zionist, who is filled with even more pride at Israel&#146;s celebration of its 60th birthday. Israel is a vibrant society. It is completely democratic and desires peace more than anything else. If only its neighbours wanted peace, and believed in the sanctity of life and in democracy, then peace could be achieved. I welcome the Government&#146;s efforts to achieve this objective, but Iran casts a giant shadow over the entire civilised world. It would help enormously if it would stop supplying arms and know-how to Hezbollah and Hamas.

We must remember that Israel took in nearly 1 million Jews who were kicked out of Arab countries. Israel believes that the refugees belong to the neighbouring countries and not to Israel.

Perhaps the recent ceasefire brokered by Egypt, which came into effect two weeks ago, is of more immediate importance, because there is now a pressing need to ease the blockade on Gaza as soon as possible to alleviate the dreadful humanitarian suffering there, with people being denied medicines and fuel.</p>

I fully recognise that that is a two-edged sword, but I understand that Libya is to raise this issue at the UN Security Council in an attempt to seek a resolution on the subject. But the UK, the US and France are opposing the text.

My noble friend Lord Turnberg himself is active in arranging exchanges of Israeli and Palestinian medical students. Schools are being run with equal numbers of Israeli and Palestinian children.

<a name="08070273000036"></a><a name="80702-0013.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80702-0013.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08070273000097"></a>Lord Alderdice:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, who secured this debate, started us off with a thoughtful and wise speech, thereby encouraging the considerable interests in your Lordships&#146; House to respond in a reflective way. We owe him a debt for that. The number of noble Lords who wished to participate and the passion with which they did so show the interest that there is in this place and the concern not only for Israelis and Palestinians but for the wider impact on the whole region and, indeed, the wider world.</p>

<a name="80702-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="08070273000037"></a>In the short time available to me, there are a few specific issues that I wish to raise with the Minister. The first was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Judd. He pointed out effectively that while you can have a political process among those who broadly agree on principle, a peace process must in essence involve those who have the most profound, deep and even violently expressed disagreements. Therefore, any process that is not inclusive and does not bring to the talks those who are responsible for at least some of the violence cannot truly, in the end, be a peace process.</p>

<a name="80702-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="08070273000038"></a>Of course, there has to be a recognition that military solutions of any kind will not resolve the problem. That is why, interestingly, in speaking with some Iraqi parliamentarians recently, the Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, Mr Martin McGuinness, made it clear that they would end up talking with each other. The only question was whether it would be in one year, five years or 10 years. He said that it was his experience that there was no military solution either for the British Government or for the IRA. I take the same view, with regard not just to Iraq but to the region that we are discussing tonight. In the end, those involved will talk with one another. The question is: how many lives will be lost and how much more destruction will take place before then?</p>

<a name="80702-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="08070273000039"></a>The issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Wright of Richmond, is relevant. There was a time when the impression was given that Her Majesty&#146;s Government were supportive of all talks; then it seemed that we would not accept and would exclude Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran and Syria. Have the Government moved? Are they really committed to these kinds of engagements? It is possible to show support by explaining the painful process that Her Majesty&#146;s Government went through as they found a need, in the end, to engage with the IRA and the loyalist paramilitaries. They said that they would never engage with them but, for the cause of peace, they had to. That, perhaps, would be a real measure of support to Israelis and Palestinians in their profoundly difficult task.</p>

I also congratulate the many noble Lords who took part and managed to keep within the time limit in a quite remarkable way. That is worthy of note.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_318"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column 318</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80702-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="08070273000041"></a>There was a considerable advantage in having a time limit, which the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice&#151;whose contribution I enjoyed&#151;might recognise. I refer to the term &#147;whataboutery&#148;. We used it in Northern Ireland about people who wanted to get into a debate about who did what to whom, when, who was right and who was wrong. There is no doubt that there is even more whataboutery available to people who wish to get involved with regard to the Middle East than even we experienced. I congratulate noble Lords on having a degree of restraint with regard to whataboutery tonight.</p>

<a name="80702-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="08070273000042"></a>The key point that noble Lords came back to again and again was that there is a talks process in existence. A number of people were pessimistic about the talks process when it began; it seemed a forlorn hope. But, as noble Lords said, there have been significant developments. We have seen a ceasefire from Hamas, brokered by Egypt, and there are contacts taking place with Syria, facilitated by Turkey. It is significant to see two of the major powers in the region, in terms of size, population and power, involved positively. It is a pity that the third comparable power, Iran, is not involved and is not making a positive contribution. It could make a positive contribution.</p>

<a name="80702-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="08070273000043"></a>I do not want to get involved in a discussion about the contacts, the distinction between contacts and talks and the question of whether people are being included or excluded. The key question is whether people are in a position to make a contribution, whether they are in the same ballpark, whether they will engage in serious discussions or whether discussions with them would send the wrong signals. That is a different issue entirely.</p>

<a name="80702-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="08070273000044"></a>I had the pleasure of being at a conference in Jordan recently. It enjoyed wide participation and a good range of contributions. What stuck in my mind was a sentence from Shimon Peres, who addressed the conference. He of course said that he would not discuss the talks, except to say that in all practical matters they were close to agreement, but that the emotional matters had become heavier and more difficult. That is worth reflecting on; one could see practical matters being resolved. That view coincides with what many people have thought&#151;that a deal is there to be made if people are able to make it, but what holds them back is that it would involve huge emotional shifts. For the Palestinians, it would mean the acceptance of a Jewish state; for the Israelis, it would mean the division of the state and the division of the city to which they are so strongly attached. Those are of equal weight.</p>

<a name="80702-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="08070273000045"></a>I hope that the Israelis and Palestinians will be able to overcome those emotional problems. I hope that the wider Arab community will support the Palestinians. I know that there is plenty of support in some elements within Israel for what is to be done and I hope that Her Majesty's Government are supportive of this. I fear that the problem, spelt out for us by noble Lord, Lord Bew, in the previous short debate on this subject, is the hatred that exists. That reinforces the emotional problems and difficulties. We all hope that they will be overcome and we look forward to hearing from the Minister what Her Majesty&#146;s Government are able to contribute to the process.</p>

<a name="08070273000046"></a><a name="80702-0013.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="80702-0013.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08070273000099"></a>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Malloch-Brown):</b> My Lords, I join those who have thanked my noble friend Lord Turnberg for tabling this Question. I assure everybody in the House that the Middle East peace process continues to be a high priority for this Government as well as a topic of great interest to this House. The UK remains committed to a comprehensive peace in the Middle East.</p>

<a name="80702-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="08070273000047"></a>I thought that the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, was going to suggest that we apply a two-minute rule to peacemaking in the Middle East because it would perhaps have produced a result in Ireland, too. I look forward to the noble Lords, Lord Alderdice and Lord Trimble, proposing as a lesson from Northern Ireland time limits on peacemaking, because we have, after all, been working at a Middle East solution for a very long time and recognise that huge obstacles remain to be overcome. However, recent events have also shown that progress can sometimes be made quickly where there is the political will.</p>

<a name="80702-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="08070273000048"></a>Listening to the contributions this evening, I was struck by the need for all of us to be realistic about the role of Her Majesty's Government. We have a role which comes from our history and knowledge of the region, from our diplomatic energy and from the values that we apply. It comes, too, from the interest taken in this House as well as in another place and by so many Britons whatever their political persuasion. Nevertheless, despite deep yearning on all sides for peace in the Middle East, we must recognise that we are not a front-line player, but a supporter of the quartet and the friends of peace on both sides of this dispute. We can play a role in providing diplomatic support and suggestions as to creative means for moving issues forward; we can, as is being seen in Gaza, help generate and stimulate private sector activity; we can support security sector reform. However, we are dependent on our ability to work with the quartet, with our EU partners and with other friends and allies.</p>

<a name="80702-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="08070273000049"></a>That is one reason why we were encouraged by the Annapolis conference. Not only did it see substantial political movement from both sides but it recreated a framework where people of good will could press to move things forward. We saw President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert commit to fortnightly meetings. We saw them both restate their commitment to the road-map obligations, which means improving Palestinian security but also a freeze on Israeli settlements. The US undertook to monitor this process as the country best placed with both sides to play that role. All parties agreed to seek to conclude negotiations by the end of 2008. The conference was a signal of renewed international commitment to the peace process. It was remarkable for a particularly strong Arab attendance. I say in response to the question of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, that the moderate Arabs were there in force.</p>

<a name="80702-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="08070273000050"></a>We are deeply committed to supporting these peace negotiations. The Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister have been engaged. Both have spoken regularly to the key actors involved. The Foreign Secretary visited the region on 8 and 9 June, which was his second visit this year. Both he and the Prime Minister  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_320"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column 320</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have been very clear in their message: we support the Annapolis process and expect all parties to fulfil their road-map obligations as part of it. I therefore repeat for the noble Lord, Lord Wright, and others that this means Israel must freeze all settlement activities and that the Palestinians must work hard to improve their security sector.</p>

<a name="80702-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="08070273000051"></a>London has supported that in every way in which it is able. We were the stage for discussions on the political process. On 2 May, the Government hosted the ad hoc liaison committee meeting of major donors to the Palestinian Authority. The quartet also met on the same occasion, as did the Arab quartet. The Foreign Secretary met key figures involved in the process, offering our support.</p>

<a name="80702-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="08070273000052"></a>One area in which we can make a particularly significant contribution is support for the Palestinian economy, because if there is to be a two-state solution, we must have a viable Palestinian economic as well as political state. Economic and social development in the Occupied Territories remains a cornerstone of the Government&#146;s approach. We have committed to helping the Palestinian Authority through very difficult economic times. We continue to do all we can to support Prime Minister Fayyad&#146;s Government, who have the necessary experience to implement difficult and far-reaching reforms that will create the viable Palestinian state that is necessary if peace is to be sustainable. In December last year, the international community pledged, as noble Lords know, a remarkable $7.7 billion at the Paris donor conference in support of Prime Minister Fayyad&#146;s plan. The UK has committed &#163;243 million in support of the Palestinian Authority over three years, linked to political progress, which represents a substantial increase in the Government&#146;s assistance.</p>

<a name="80702-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="08070273000053"></a>While we recognise that the private sector is stunted by the Israeli occupation, we felt that more could be done. There must be a viable private sector. Investors need to be drawn in early if we are to create the right climate for the private sector that will underpin the Palestinian state. Therefore, in May, the UK co-sponsored with the United States the Palestinian Investment Conference, held in Bethlehem. The Prime Minister spoke at a curtain-raiser earlier in the month with Tony Blair and Prime Minister Fayyad. Investment agreements worth &#163;70 million were initialled. That saw more than 500 Arab businessmen and 100 Gaza businessmen enter Bethlehem, which sends an extraordinary signal.</p>

<a name="80702-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="08070273000054"></a>The third crucial element to progress between the Israelis and Palestinians is Palestinian security. One of the key obligations set out in the road map, Palestinian security, is vital. The UK has long been at the forefront of supporting reform of the Palestinian security sector. In June, Germany hosted an important conference in Berlin to galvanise support in this area. The UK announced that it will spend &#163;2.7 million in 2008 on security sector reform and has set aside more for the next three years to improve civil justice and public prosecution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="08070273000055"></a>The EU also has a role in training the Palestinian civil police. The UK has been a long-standing contributor to the European police mission in the Occupied Territories. We provide three officers to the mission and have  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_321"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column 321</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>allocated &#163;1.2 million of our funding to support Palestinian policing needs in 2008. We also support the US co-ordinator, General Dayton, in his effort to reform the Palestinian national security forces. The Palestinians are serious about security reform, which is absolutely critical to achieving peace. We will continue to provide all the support that we can for the will of the Palestinians to progress in this area.</p>

<a name="80702-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="08070273000056"></a>The Foreign Secretary has been consistently clear that we should not forget about Gaza. Progress there is fundamental to easing the suffering both in Gaza itself and in southern Israel. I pay tribute not just to the One Voice youth movement but to all other civil society groups which try to find ways of building peace between the two communities. I assure the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, that far from their being just noise and things to make us all feel good, they build to a critical mass and a tipping point towards peace.</p>

<a name="80702-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="08070273000057"></a>I turn to the improvements which have been referred to this evening. The products of old fashioned diplomacy matter, too. In this respect, the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas is a very welcome development. The Foreign Secretary spoke to the Egyptian Foreign Minister, Aboul Gheit, and I saw him yesterday in Sharm el-Sheikh. We both commended him on Egypt&#146;s painstaking work to conclude this agreement. It is good news that the ceasefire has held so far, and it is vital that all sides do their utmost to keep to their commitments because, as was said, while it is just a ceasefire, a ceasefire precedes the building of trust and hence broader peace. Hamas and other militant groups must stop firing rockets into Israel, and Israel must work to reopen the crossings into Gaza. Equally, this agreement must be only a first step. When any Palestinian returning home is the subject of the kind of beating to which the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, referred earlier, we must condemn it. I ask her for details of that incident, so that we can look further into it.</p>

<a name="80702-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="08070273000058"></a>The ceasefire presents an important opportunity to fully reopen the crossings between Gaza and Israel. That is crucial to addressing the dire humanitarian situation inside the country. We will press for industrial diesel and everything else to be let in as quickly as possible.</p>

<a name="80702-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="08070273000059"></a>I shall say a word on the Israel-Syria talks, a subject raised by the noble Lord, Lord Wright, and others. Peace between Israel and Syria would obviously have the potential to transform the broader Middle East peacemaking process. Therefore, let me be unequivocal in saying that we welcome the current peace talks between Syria and Israel, and commend Turkey for its mediation efforts. We see these talks as an important step forward and a way of building confidence in the region. Ultimately, Syria and the Golan Heights must be part of a comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israel conflict. This is why it also made sense for Syria to attend the Annapolis peace conference.</p>

<a name="80702-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="08070273000060"></a>However, as has been said tonight, we equally recognise that a peace deal between Israel and Syria is not easily reached. We have made it clear to Syria on a number of occasions that a fundamental shift in its regional behaviour is required if part of the international community is to reach out to it more broadly. That means that Syria should move to normalise relations  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_322"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column 322</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with Lebanon, including exchanging embassies and demarcating borders. It means that Syria should cease its support for Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, as well as for Hezbollah, which continues with Syria&#146;s acquiescence to transfer arms through Syrian territory to Lebanon. Perhaps most importantly for the UK&#146;s own security, Syria should tackle al-Qaeda head-on.</p>

<a name="80702-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="08070273000061"></a>What has happened in recent weeks on the Syrian front and on the Israel-Hamas front show that when there is ingenuity of diplomacy and commitment by both sides, progress can be made. Therefore I too, in commending the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, again for introducing the debate, am proud that we can all take stock of the situation better than when we last addressed it in this House.</p>

I say &#147;in some way&#148; not to be deliberately vague, but because the personal account scheme is unlike other occupational pension schemes. It will not have a sponsoring employer, or even a group of sponsoring employers. The personal account scheme is expected to have millions of members who work for many thousands of different employers. This puts the scheme in a unique situation with regard to contact with the scheme&#146;s membership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="08070277000008"></a>Turning to Amendments Nos. 112F and 112H, tabled by the noble Baroness, PADA has been set the task of designing the process for interaction between the trustee corporation and the scheme members, and the process for trustee recruitment. Until we receive PADA&#146;s advice on these processes, we will not know if we can simply amend Clause 242&#151;or regulations under it&#151;to include the trustee corporation, or whether we need to design a bespoke solution, such as nomination via the members&#146; panel, which we would set out in the scheme order. This is our reason for using the word &#147;may&#148; rather than &#147;must&#148; in both this paragraph of Schedule 1 and in Clause 60(4). We need this flexibility. When we have all the relevant advice and information, we will make the appropriate decision based on it. As I have previously said, the trustee corporation is the sole corporate trustee and it must act in the best interests of the scheme members, within the terms of the trust. They cannot have special interest groups to represent.</p>

<a name="80702-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="08070277000009"></a>In relation to the specific number of prospective members, under trust law, as I am sure noble Lords are aware, a trustee&#146;s most important job is to protect the interests of beneficiaries under the trust. In this case, those interests are the pension savings of the scheme members. A trustee should not be directly required to act in anyone else&#146;s interests. Prospective members are, of course, important to the trustee corporation and the future viability of the scheme. For this reason, the trustee corporation will work with members and participating employers, through the panels, to ensure that the scheme is running smoothly and that any issues are resolved. In this way, we will make the scheme as attractive as we can both to new employers and members, within the limits set down. I hope I have indicated that, in principle, we are entirely at one with the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, but the steps of setting up the scheme are such that the way we have put it in the Bill so far is the right way forward to achieve the principle of Clause 242.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="08070277000014"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendment No. 112K. Paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 deals with conflicts of interest. My amendments are not addressed to the need for members to avoid conflicts of interest, but to the Secretary of State&#146;s ongoing involvement. He is not only involved in appointing someone who does not have a conflict of interest, but has to keep an eye on this &#147;from time to time&#148;. That is, under the terms of this Bill, the Secretary of State has both an initial and an ongoing requirement to monitor the status of members of the corporation, outside the initial period, even if he has not appointed them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="08070277000015"></a>I do not understand the need for this or the need to create within the Department for Work and Pensions the mechanism to monitor&#151;on behalf of the Secretary of State&#151;conflicts of interest within the trustee corporation. My amendments remove the Secretary of State from the process once the initial period has passed. The responsibility would then be with the trustee corporation, which is as it should be. That is what happens in organisations such as boards; they have to ensure that conflicts of interest do not get in the way of business, and that important ones do not exist. My amendments seek to take the Secretary of State out of the process because it would be impractical&#151;or, indeed, involve too much public sector, Civil Service effort&#151;to comply with this after the initial phase. I beg to move.</p>

I would like to take this opportunity to explain our reasoning for both the Secretary of State&#146;s and the corporation's continuing role in conflicts of interest.</p>

<a name="80702-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="08070277000017"></a>As has been discussed, we know that appointments to the trustee corporation in the &#147;initial period&#148; will be made by the Secretary of State. After this period, the trustee corporation itself will be responsible for making appointments. Clearly, it is important, bearing in mind the responsibility they will have for investing the contributions of scheme members, that there are sufficient checks on whether any conflicts of interest exist among members of the trustee corporation.</p>

<a name="80702-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="08070277000018"></a>The corporation itself will have an interest in potential conflicts of interest for the individuals who are members of the corporation, whether or not the appointment is an initial or a later one. They must act together in scheme members&#146; best interests, but a conflict of interest for an individual member could restrict their ability to carry out that legal duty.</p>

<a name="80702-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="08070277000019"></a>Equally, even though the Secretary of State will not have a responsibility for appointments beyond the initial period, he will always retain a level of responsibility as &#147;settlor&#148; of the scheme. Following this, the trustee corporation, as a public body, will always be accountable through the Secretary of State to Parliament. Given the accountability of both the trustee corporation and the Secretary of State for the scheme, it is right that both should have power to ensure that there is nothing which could compromise the integrity or reputation of the trustee corporation.</p>

<a name="80702-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="08070277000020"></a>I am bound to say to the noble Baroness that I do not see any of these involving great processes of administration, but I think that they are important safeguards, both in the public interest and for the corporation. I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I do not see this as being an unduly onerous or time-consuming event. It is more likely to be relevant if issues arise in the public domain because of the conduct of one individual or another. It may be that the corporation itself, undertaking its duties, will swap conflicts of interest which need to be communicated to the Secretary of State. That would be one route.

The Bill sets out two circumstances in which it is assumed that a person will not be taken to have a conflict of interest for those reasons alone&#151;first, if a person has been working on behalf of the Government in relation to pensions and, secondly, if a person has been a trustee or manager of a pension scheme. However, this is not an exhaustive list. The amendment seeks to add to the list individuals who worked for the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority but, as I have just said, the list is not exhaustive and therefore working for or being a member of the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority would not automatically disqualify somebody from being a member of the trustee corporation on the grounds of conflict of interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="08070277000039"></a>A member or member of staff of the delivery authority could, like anyone else, apply for appointment to the trustee corporation. They would be considered, like anyone else, as part of the recruitment process and this would include considering whether there were any conflicts of interest. The delivery authority will be advising Government on the recruitment process for individual members of the trustee corporation, but decisions about who to appoint in the initial period will be for the Secretary of State. It is worth noting that the trustee corporation will be a completely different organisation from the delivery authority and that very different skills are required to design a pension scheme compared to those required for running one as a

It seems to me that this is a rather short period for something as complex as the personal accounts pension scheme. We all know that boards need to be refreshed, but the Bill proposes a shorter period than is generally used in the listed company sector, where norms do exist. In practice in the listed company sector, we are finding that the norm is lengthening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="08070277000046"></a>There was considerable dissatisfaction with slavish adherence to what appeared to be the rule in the Financial Reporting Council&#146;s corporate governance statement of a maximum of three times three years, which was driven by independence. The FRC looked at that rule last year and emphasised that a person could continue beyond nine years, provided that a board was satisfied with independence. Many boards made representations that they were being deprived of some of their most useful talent&#151;those who understood the business&#151;because the corporate governance rulebook made it difficult for them to do anything else. That has now changed and there is an acceptance that independence is the criterion and not some silly time period that is used to define it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="08070277000047"></a>Will the Minister explain how the policy of creating an effective personal accounts scheme is served by removing members of the trustee corporation in a period that is less than is emerging practice in the corporate sector, at a time when those people, given the complexity of personal accounts, may well be&#151;not in all cases&#151;at their most useful? I beg to move.</p>

It sets the period of appointment of a member, or the chair, of the corporation at no more than four years and prevents someone being reappointed more than once. In other words, no one can serve for more than eight years. The amendment would entirely remove those limits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="08070277000049"></a>In responding to this amendment, I should first explain that we intend appointments to the corporation, which will be a non-departmental public body, to follow the principles in the code of practice of the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments&#151;the OCPA. This code suggests that it is in the public interest to limit the length of appointments made by Ministers to be no longer than a total of 10 years to encourage new blood and new ideas, and to give other people an opportunity to serve on a public body. Of course, in the case of the trustee corporation, appointments after the initial period will be made not by Ministers but by the corporation.</p>

<a name="80702-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="08070277000050"></a>The good practice of limiting the term of appointment should be included in this Bill for several reasons. First, it will continue the practice begun by the Secretary of State, who will make the initial appointments to this NDPB in accordance with the principles of the OCPA. Secondly, as the scheme is being set up to fulfil a public policy objective, it will be appropriate for members of the corporation charged with running that scheme to follow the good practice of the OCPA. Thirdly, beyond the initial stage, the members of the trustee corporation collectively will be making appointments. This amendment could therefore effectively allow them to appoint themselves for unlimited periods, or might result in different members being appointed for different periods. Clearly, this could lead to unfairness and accusations of unfair treatment, and we simply cannot take that risk.</p>

<a name="80702-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="08070277000051"></a>The most effective blend of members of the trustee corporation will be a mix of fresh faces, new ideas, experience, pensions expertise and corporate memory. The appointment periods set out in the Bill will ensure that such a blend can exist. Furthermore, I believe that the limits on the period of appointments that we have chosen match the responsibilities of the trustee corporation, while remaining well within the maximum proposed in the guidelines of the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments. Setting a reasonable limit on the periods of appointment will strike a good balance between the independence of the members of the trustee corporation and the good practice of the OCPA.</p>

<a name="80702-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="08070277000052"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness is reassured about the reasons for these limits and I ask her to withdraw the amendment.</p>

That is not, in my view, a reason to have an absolute ban on anybody under any circumstances going on for more than eight years. It seems to me that the sort of background he was giving about balance of corporate memory, experience and so on&#151;I speak from experience of many pension fund boards&#151;is that in some circumstances it is right that people should be able to go on longer. To move from suggestions in a code to an absolute ban does not seem proportionate. I do not think an absolute ban is sensible.</p>

There might be a general guidance if this was within the discretion of the Secretary of State, and that may be one way forward.

However, the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, is very valid. The Government have taken an advisory limit and turned it into a lower absolute maximum. That advisory limit is already higher than the figure that the Government have drafted into the Bill and our experience&#151;especially from pension boards, of which the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, has much experience, and certainly from corporate life generally&#151;is that this is likely to constrain rather than assist in operating this properly.</p>

<a name="80702-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="08070282000005"></a>I would think that the Government would want to avoid having to get rid of a damn good member who really knew the personal accounts scheme backwards, knew the legislation and had all the relationships, was still young, vital and whatever because eight years had come up. That is not how good organisations operate. I had hoped that the Minister might be able to take this away and think about it. In the long-term interests of creating an effective board, the Government need to provide a little more flexibility. I take the point that the Minister made about having levers. It may be that a higher overall limit, which can then be communicated in advisory terms between the Secretary of State and the board informally, would serve the needs of the pension accounts trustee corporation better than what the Government have currently drafted.</p>

</ul>
<a name="80702-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="08070282000013"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendment No. 112T. Both amendments concern an audit committee for the trustee corporation.</p>

<a name="80702-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="08070282000014"></a>This ought to be uncontroversial. The Minister knows that when I say that, I am heading for a small disagreement with him. When we get to Clause 74 we will find that the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority will be setting up a non-executive committee which, inter alia, will keep an eye on PADA&#146;s internal financial controls in securing the proper conduct of its financial affairs. That is what audit committees very broadly do&#151;throughout the corporate world, and pretty much the public sector as well. Why is there no equivalent for the trustee corporation?</p>

<a name="80702-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="08070282000015"></a>Of course, the corporation will be comprised of non-executives, and so a group delineated in the way that is being set up for PADA would be inappropriate. However, it should still be necessary&#151;indeed, it should be vital&#151;for an organisation such as the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority to have an audit committee. Internal financial controls are obviously important in any organisation but this one will have huge sums of money related to a very large number of transactions, which in turn will relate to a very large number of individuals. The controls need to operate effectively not only at the level of the whole corporation but also at the level of the individual; clearly, they need to operate so that an individual&#146;s pension entitlement is correctly calculated.</p>

<a name="80702-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="08070282000016"></a>Therefore, Amendment No. 112S alters paragraph 9 of Schedule 1 so that the power to establish committees is modified. There would have to be a committee looking at financial controls. Amendment No. 112T adds an annual reporting requirement to paragraph 17, and the work of the committee that I have just described should be included in the annual report. That is standard practice and also mirrors what PADA will be doing by virtue of Clause 74. I hope that the Minister will agree that this is a no-brainer. I beg to move.</p>

The trustee corporation will receive all members&#146; contributions. Most will be invested on members&#146; behalf but of course there will be a charge for running costs&#151;direct costs such as salaries and lease of premises, and indirect costs such as external contracts. Therefore, the trustee corporation is accountable to the scheme members for how their money is invested and in relation to whether the charges are reasonable and proportionate. As with all pension schemes, this scheme will produce an annual report and accounts, which will be audited and published. We discussed this audit when debating Clause 58.</p>

<a name="80702-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="08070282000018"></a>The trustee corporation is being set up as a non-departmental public body. This places an additional requirement on it, as its accounts, setting out moneys received from charges and what it has spent on running the scheme, have to be independently audited by the National Audit Office and laid before Parliament.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_332"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column 332</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="08070282000019"></a>Although the two sets of accounts are separate, they are so closely linked that it is inconceivable that one can be looked at without examination of the other. Whether the scheme accounts will form an annex to the NDPB accounts or whether it will be the other way round is a detail yet to be decided. However, I can say that the scheme members and Members of Parliament will see both sets of accounts.</p>

<a name="80702-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="08070282000020"></a>As an NDPB, the way in which the trustee corporation operates will be set out in a framework document. This will follow the guidance for all NDPBs issued by Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury and the Cabinet Office. In particular, the framework document will follow the Treasury guidance, <I>Managing Public Money</I>. It will specify how the NDPB must account for any money received; it will set out management and financial responsibilities; and it will clarify internal and external audit arrangements. It will also set out requirements for reporting to the department, including on financial performance. These requirements make it absolutely clear that the corporation will be obliged to make robust arrangements for internal financial control.</p>

<a name="80702-0015.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="08070282000021"></a>I now move on to the amendments. As the noble Baroness explained, Amendment No. 112S would require the trustee corporation to establish a committee to review the corporation&#146;s internal financial controls, and Amendment No. 112T would require such an internal audit committee to produce an annual report. At this stage, before the detailed workings of the trustee corporation are fully developed, it would seem premature to specify that that should be done through a committee, although it may well be the right way forward. While that is a standard responsibility of non-executive directors on a board, the role of such a board is not absolutely comparable with the role of the members of the trustee corporation. Those members may choose to create a committee but they may prefer some other way, and at this juncture I cannot see a reason to tie their hands in relation to such matters.</p>

<a name="80702-0015.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="08070282000022"></a>NDPBs are already required to produce an annual report and accounts and to lay them before Parliament. The accounts would normally include an audit report.</p>

<a name="80702-0015.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="08070282000023"></a>Given the framework in existence for NDPBs, we would prefer not to prescribe further the way in which the trustee corporation should assure itself about internal financial control. However, I acknowledge that the noble Baroness has raised important matters and the committee as outlined may well be the appropriate way to proceed in due course, but it is simply that we would not particularly want to tie the hands of the NDPB at this juncture.</p>

There is no other way known in corporate life&#151;I use &#147;corporate&#148; as a broad term encompassing public, private and voluntary sectors.

<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="08070282000032"></a>Under paragraph 18 of Schedule 1 the Secretary of State may provide financial assistance to the trustee corporation in the form of grants, loans, guarantees or indemnities and the Secretary of State may set the conditions for such assistance. An identical power is provided for PADA in Clause 72. These provisions clearly allow the Secretary of State to provide money to underpin the personal accounts scheme as grants or on other non-commercial terms. That has caused considerable consternation among the pensions provider bodies, which will be competing with the personal accounts scheme, as they can see unfair competition written all over the Bill. Bodies such as the ABI want there to be no public subsidy for the trustee corporation and are concerned at the amount of grant-aided expenditure that PADA is racking up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="08070282000033"></a>My amendments do not go as far as that. There may be expenses that, on public policy grounds should be met by the public purse but, if that is the case, there needs to be transparency about why those costs should be subsidised. The default position is that finance should be made available on commercial terms. That is, in most cases there will be a requirement for market interest and repayment terms. My Amendments Nos. 112U and 112V seek to achieve this for the trustee corporation, and Amendment No. 113P does so for PADA. They are not in exactly the same form, which is my fault, but could easily be harmonised for Report and the idea behind the amendments is the same. During the course of the Bill, I do not believe we can settle exactly how finance should be made available to the trustee corporation or to PADA. We believe that there should be a presumption that finance should be available only on commercial terms. As I have said, I have accepted that the reality is that some subsidy may well be necessary.</p>

<a name="80702-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="08070282000034"></a>My amendments allow Parliament a modest involvement in agreeing whether finance is to be provided on a subsidised basis in future by requiring the Secretary of State to make a report to the House setting out why he needs to provide finance on a non-commercial basis. There is no other parliamentary procedure involved, but it is about transparency. As well as transparency to Parliament, it would allow other bodies, such as the National Association of Pension Funds, which has raised this issue with us, to scrutinise the reasons for subsidy and make representations if it feels that the subsidy is likely to cause an unfair advantage for the personal accounts scheme.</p>

<a name="80702-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="08070282000035"></a>At present, the only information that will be available on funding from the pension corporation or PADA will come out when the annual accounts come out, which, as the Minister will be aware, could be 15 to 18 months after financial assistance has actually been given. We believe that that time period is too long in the context of the kind of transparency that should be available about such an important issue. I hope that the Minister will agree.

I wish the noble Baroness more luck in getting something here, but I do not think she will. Even she accepts that there is a public policy argument for a certain amount of public help.

<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="08070282000038"></a>The Government are clear in their intent that the scheme should be self-financing in the long run. That means its set-up and operational costs being recouped from members&#146; charges. However, in the scheme&#146;s early years, there will be a gap between its costs and revenues. The delivery authority is currently developing a strategy to bridge that gap. I am sure noble Lords will agree that we should not underestimate the complexity of this task.</p>

<a name="80702-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a><a name="08070282000039"></a>The personal accounts scheme will be unlike any other scheme. It will be the largest occupational scheme in the UK, with possibly 4 million to 7 million active members; it will interact with nearly 1 million employers; it will be specifically targeted on a part of the market which existing providers find uneconomic to serve; and it will be required to admit anyone eligible to join, irrespective of whether the revenue they might bring will cover the cost of their account.</p>

<a name="80702-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="08070282000040"></a>The scheme&#146;s funding strategy will need to reflect these unique features, as well meeting the guiding principles which the Government have set out. These principles are that the strategy should deliver low charges for members, be based on our intention that the scheme is self-financing in the long run and delivered at nil cost to taxpayers, be commercially viable, not provide the scheme with an unfair advantage, and comply with European rules on state aid. I hope this brief overview of how the scheme&#146;s funding strategy will be developed and the principles it will be based on has been useful. I will now move on to the amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="08070282000041"></a>Given the size and complexity of the task that PADA faces, it is important that legislation should enable the authority to carry out its work and explore all options available. We must avoid ruling out options at this stage that could later prove to be in the best interests of members. These amendments would limit the options by requiring that financial assistance to both the authority and the trustee corporation should, in the first instance, be on commercial terms. I should make it clear that, in resisting this amendment, we are in no way setting our face against commercial funding of the scheme. Funding from commercial providers or from Government on commercial terms are options under consideration. Legislation should not, however, make commercial terms the overriding objective of the funding solution. As I have said, the scheme&#146;s funding strategy will need to balance a range of factors.</p>

<a name="80702-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="08070282000042"></a>It should also be remembered that the authority will continue to incur costs in relation to activities, such as providing advice to the Secretary of State, that it is not appropriate to pass on to scheme members through charges or to expect to be funded commercially. Indeed, Amendments Nos. 112V and 113P appear to recognise that there are circumstances where commercial funding would not be appropriate, but require a detailed report to the other place before other funding can be put in place. Transparency is a key issue. I agree that there is a need for transparency once decisions have been taken and hope to reassure the noble Baroness that such transparency will exist.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="08070282000043"></a>As non-departmental public bodies, the authority and the trustee corporation will have to publish annual reports and accounts that will be placed before Parliament. The receipt of funding, from whichever sources and on whatever terms, will be made clear in these documents, subject to the need to protect any commercial negotiations occurring at the time. In addition, my department will provide information on funding within supply estimates, which are laid before Parliament each year for approval. As noble Lords will be aware, supply estimates are the means by which the Government seek authority from Parliament for their own spending each year. They reflect resource and capital spending plan provisions for the financial year to which they relate, as well as showing the total net resource figures for the two prior financial years.</p>

<a name="80702-0016.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="08070282000044"></a>Government funding will be reflected in the Department for Work and Pensions estimates; grant in aid funding is included within the sub-headline catching all DWP grant in aid payments to its non-departmental public bodies. The actual figure for grant in aid to PADA is shown separately under notes to the estimate, and if a loan is provided by the DWP it will be shown separately from grant in aid&#151;in the same sub-headline, but as capital rather than resource. Figures presented in the main estimates at the beginning of the year are, of course, subject to changes as plans develop; those changes would be reflected in subsequent supplementary estimates.</p>

<a name="80702-0016.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a><a name="08070282000045"></a>The authority&#146;s annual accounts will provide information on each year&#146;s funding sources and the expenditure incurred against that funding. The financial statements within those accounts will comply with the accounting and disclosure requirements detailed in the Government&#146;s financial reporting manual and any accounts direction issued by the department. The trustee corporation will also have to comply with these requirements inasmuch as it comes within the classification of bodies to which the manual applies. Details on the layout of the accounts are still under discussion, but we expect that funding from grant in aid and loans from whatever source will be separately visible within the accounts. Additionally, within PADA&#146;s operating cost statement we would expect expenditure to be recovered from future scheme charges, which will be reported separately from expenditure that will not be recovered.</p>

<a name="80702-0016.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a><a name="08070282000046"></a>I hope that this explanation will reassure the noble Baroness both that the Government have no intention of unfairly advantaging the scheme through the funding approach&#151;and of the importance of retaining flexibility at this stage&#151;and that the basis for funding the scheme will be made clear to Parliament through existing reporting arrangements; I suggest that those would be pretty robust. The noble Baroness says that accounts sometimes take a little while to be produced and signed off but, notwithstanding that, I suggest that the detail that will be within them and in the department&#146;s estimates&#151;showing what it is funding, and how&#151;is a robust series of indicators on how the scheme is being funded. That should satisfy her on transparency.</p>

I suspect that there are definitions that I could lift from, for example, the National Loans Fund that would probably meet the point I am trying to make because I do not think the DWP would ever do anything as exotic as the kind of arrangements that are sometimes used to fund political parties&#151;not, of course, my own.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_388"></a><a name="08070282000048"></a>The key issue is transparency, which is what my amendments are directed at, because they involve no other parliamentary processes, as I made clear. I understand that there will be information in the annual accounts, but I do not think that is appropriate. If a transaction takes place in April 2008, I would not find out about it until, perhaps, July 2009 if the accounts were out very quickly, and quite possibly July 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_392"></a><a name="08070282000055"></a>The noble Baroness said: We are coming to the end of Schedule 1. I shall move Amendment No. 112W and speak to Amendments Nos. 112WA, 112X and 113Q. These amendments concern charges made by the trustee corporation for the personal accounts scheme and they are designed to ensure that the costs of the trustee corporation are fully recovered in charges. They are linked to the group of amendments that we have just debated, which sought to eliminate or constrain subsidy flowing into the personal accounts scheme. This group of amendments concentrates on charges rather than financing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_393"></a><a name="08070282000056"></a>Amendment No. 112W would amend paragraph 19 of Schedule 1 so that the trustee corporation must make charges in connection with the exercise of its functions. The current paragraph 19 is merely permissive and I could not see why that should remain. Amendment No. 112WA would ensure that the charges were sufficient, taking one year with another, to cover its costs. I am not seeking to get into the philosophy of charging. I am aware that PADA has issued a document on how charges should be made for the personal accounts scheme. My amendments are much more modest because they are designed to ensure that charges will be made  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_338"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column 338</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to cover all the costs over time. I fully accept that initially it will be necessary to spread costs over a number of years&#151;I hope not too many&#151;but the aim has to be to cover costs with income, taking one year with another.</p>

<a name="80702-0016.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a><a name="08070282000057"></a>Amendments Nos. 112X and 113Q deal with the costs that are being incurred in the preparatory phase, which are currently being incurred by PADA. My amendments would ensure that the costs are passed on to the trustee corporation and then recovered. The Government and PADA have been vague about this. I understand that PADA expects to spend some &#163;36 million in the current financial year, but it is hiding behind commercial confidentiality and has refused to give any estimate of the costs that it will incur on setting up the personal accounts scheme within that total amount. I accept that it will be doing things other than simply setting up the personal accounts scheme, but this is a very real problem. If we do not get further information from PADA on how those costs are made up&#151;I am hopeful that there will be some progress on this&#151;we may want to revisit the issue of making more information available from PADA to Parliament on the ongoing emerging costs of the personal accounts scheme. There are precedents for that for other major schemes that have been introduced in the public sector. For today, my key point is that my amendment would require PADA to account separately for the costs related to setting up and operating the personal accounts scheme and not simply to write them off.</p>

<a name="80702-0016.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a><a name="08070282000058"></a>Amendment No. 113Q states that PADA must separately identify these costs and then charge them to the personal accounts pension scheme once it has been established. Amendment No. 112X picks that up by stating:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_63"></a><a name="08070282000117"></a>&#147;The trustee corporation must make arrangements to recover these costs&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80702-0016.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a><a name="08070282000059"></a>As we debated on the previous group of amendments, we share the industry&#146;s concern that public money could be used to subsidise the personal accounts scheme. In the early years, when the upfront costs are being borne by PADA, it would be easy for these costs to slip from public view&#151;government accounting rather helps that to happen&#151;but they could be an important element of the overall costs of the scheme. Indeed, they will form the bulk of the costs that need to be recovered over a period. We must not let government accounting rules just write them off. It is important that they are kept in view and are included properly within the overall costs of the scheme to be recovered by charges. I hope that the Minister will see that these amendments are reasonable in the circumstances. I beg to move.</p>

I hope that it is clear from our earlier debate that our intention is for the personal accounts scheme to be self-financing in the long term, such that its costs will be met from membership charges. Paragraph 19 of Schedule 1 simply enables the trustee corporation to fulfil this policy aim by allowing it to charge to the scheme any costs that it incurs in relation to the exercise of its functions. Amendment No. 112W would require, rather than allow, the corporation to  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_339"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column 339</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>charge the scheme for the costs that I have just outlined. However, given the clarity of our intention that the scheme should be self-financing, I do not see the need to go beyond the clause&#146;s current wording.</p>

<a name="80702-0016.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a><a name="08070282000061"></a>Although the scheme will be self-financing in the long run, there will inevitably be a period during its early years when its income from membership charges will be insufficient to recover its costs, as the noble Baroness acknowledged. This stems from the fact that it will have to bear set-up costs before it can open its doors to members and that it will need some time after that before its revenues grow to a sufficient scale.</p>

<a name="80702-0016.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a><a name="08070282000062"></a>It is not clear whether the purpose of Amendment No. 112WA is to ensure that the scheme would not have an operating deficit for more than two years running. If so, this could lead to unreasonably high charges for members in the early years of the scheme. It could adversely affect members&#146; income at retirement and potentially lead to high levels of opt-out at the very time when we will most need to establish the confidence of a group of people, many of whom will be saving in a pension for the first time.</p>

<a name="80702-0016.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a><a name="08070282000063"></a>It is vital that we give the delivery authority the time and flexibility that it needs to develop a funding strategy that achieves the best balance between the scheme&#146;s initial level of charges and the time that it takes for the scheme to become wholly self-financing. I hope that it is also clear that one of our guiding principles in developing the scheme&#146;s funding strategy will be to ensure that the scheme is not unfairly advantaged. This means requiring the delivery authority to identify the costs that it incurs in relation to implementing the scheme and charging them to the trustee corporation so that they are recouped through members&#146; charges.</p>

<a name="80702-0016.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a><a name="08070282000064"></a>I therefore find myself agreeing with the principle that appears to lie behind Amendments Nos. 112X and 113Q, which is that any costs incurred by PADA in relation to the establishment of the scheme should be recouped from the scheme through member charges. However, just as it seems fair that members should meet the costs of establishing the scheme, it would be unfair to ask them to meet those costs that do not directly relate to it, particularly those costs arising from the delivery authority&#146;s continuing role in providing advice on the commercial and operational implications of the Government&#146;s reform programme.</p>

<a name="80702-0016.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a><a name="08070282000065"></a>I do not think that it is the amendment&#146;s intention to pass such non-scheme costs on to members, but it is important to be clear about such matters. However, my response to the amendment is to make it clear that primary legislation is not required to achieve the noble Baroness&#146;s aims. Instead, we will place a requirement on the delivery authority to separately identify costs relating to the set-up of the scheme through the framework document that exists between my department and the authority. That document describes the respective duties, roles and relationships between the delivery authority and my department, and will be updated to reflect PADA&#146;s expanded role. The framework document will be in the public domain, with copies placed in the Libraries of both Houses and on the authority&#146;s website.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_402"></a><a name="08070282000066"></a>A lot has been said about whether the Government intend to put the scheme at a commercial advantage through a subsidy. However, less has been said about the commercial disadvantages that it will face due to the policy goals that we are asking it to meet. As well as being restricted to a particular segment of the market, it will have a public service obligation to accept into the scheme workers whom the current market finds commercially unviable. This means that the scheme will have to provide accounts to individuals where it will not recover the costs of doing so. In the long term, the scheme&#146;s scale will enable it to do this as part of its normal business while delivering low charges to members and being self-financing, but in the short term, prior to achieving this scale, the obligation could make it more challenging to bridge the mismatch between early years costs and revenues.</p>

<a name="80702-0016.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a><a name="08070282000067"></a>These obligations may ultimately mean a short-term level of charges that undermines both the scheme&#146;s policy goals and its ability to build the scale that it needs to be viable in the long term. If this is the case, it would be reasonable for the Government to consider whether it was in the public interest to compensate the scheme in some way for the burdens placed on it. This concept is recognised in European state aid rules, whose purpose is to prevent anti-competitive behaviour, while recognising that there may be cases when it is right to compensate a body for performing a public service obligation. These rules are very explicit: it is possible for the state to recognise only the cost of imposing a public service obligation; it is not possible to go any further. In other words, it is possible to ensure only that the personal accounts scheme is not disadvantaged by its public service obligation; it is not possible to tilt the playing field in its favour, nor would we want to do so. We do not yet know whether any such support will be necessary. The authority needs to complete its work on scheme design and scheme cost and engage in dialogue with potential suppliers before the parameters of scheme financing are known in detail.</p>

<p><a name="08070282000111"></a>on the basis that it meant that the corporation had to break even over two years. &#147;Taking one year with another&#148; is a standard phrase in dealing with corporations that need to break even over a period. I thought that I had been using it for 30-plus years, but I did not check it when I drafted it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_411"></a><a name="08070282000081"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is a simple, probing amendment that would delete Clause 66(1)(b), which states that the trustee corporation&#146;s powers include,</p>

<p><a name="08070282000112"></a>Will the Minister explain how other enactments give the trustee corporation functions and what they are?

The overriding function of the trustee corporation will be to run the personal accounts scheme in the best interests of the scheme members. The power to establish the scheme is in Clause 58, which sets out that it will be established by order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_412"></a><a name="08070282000083"></a>The order will be the equivalent of a normal occupational pension scheme&#146;s trust deed and will set out most of the trustee&#146;s functions or give a power for the functions to be set out in the scheme rules.The scheme order will be in secondary legislation and subject to both public consultation and parliamentary scrutiny</p>

<a name="80702-0017.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a><a name="08070282000084"></a>However, although the order will contain most of the trustee corporation&#146;s functions, it cannot contain them all. For instance, the corporation will, in line with other occupational pension schemes, have to abide by existing pensions and tax legislation&#151;for example, in relation to tax registration and accounting, paying scheme benefits and, importantly, to oversight by the Pensions Regulator.</p>

<a name="80702-0017.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a><a name="08070282000085"></a>Furthermore, the trustee corporation is being set up as an NDPB, so, beside the general functions given to it in Schedule 1, it also has duties in relation to a public body that are contained in other legislation. I asked what those other functions might be. Other functions not listed in the order could relate to its being an NDPB, so it will have to fulfil duties of all public bodies; for example, complying with the Freedom of Information Act and fulfilling gender equality issues.Carrying out those duties will not be at odds with its duty to run the scheme; they are simply the duties that all NDPBs have to carry out in addition to their main duties and functions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_415"></a><a name="08070282000086"></a>The amendment would remove Clause 66(1)(b). However, I understand that it is a probing amendment, so I shall not comment further on it. I do not believe that the noble Baroness meant to impose those restrictions. If the amendment were to be pressed, it would also cast doubt on the extent to which the trustee&#146;s functions could arise other than from the Bill. As I have explained, it is important that its functions can include those arising from other pensions and tax legislation, although in all cases they will, and must, remain only such functions as relate to the scheme. I hope that that has put the matter in context.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_418"></a><a name="08070282000091"></a>Amendment No. 112Z deletes Clause 66(3)(b). The trustee corporation will have billions of pounds of pension contributions swelling its coffers, so why should it ever need to borrow money? Amendment No. 112ZA deletes subsection (4) of the clause and Amendment No. 112ZB deletes from that subsection the reference to investing money. That returns to our theme of the independent operation of the trustee corporation. Why do the Government think it necessary to keep control of the corporation in that way? I can just about see why consent control is required in relation to borrowing, if borrowing is required, but I cannot see why the  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_343"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column 343</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Secretary of State should have a new role in relation to investment. That is what the trustee corporation will be doing&#151;investing tonnes of money. Surely it is neither practical nor desirable for the Secretary of State to be involved in these decisions, especially as one of the core competences of the trustee corporation will be to steer and oversee investment policies. That is not a core competence, as far as I am aware, of the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions.</p>

<a name="80702-0017.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a><a name="08070282000092"></a>Lastly, Amendment No. 112ZC deletes subsection (5) because I did not understand what it meant. I invite the Minister to explain it. Perhaps it means that the trustee corporation can borrow and invest in its capacity as the trustee of the scheme but not otherwise without consent. If that is the case, is the Minister satisfied that it will always be clear in what capacity financial transactions are being undertaken? Money is, after all, fungible, and how can distinctions be made? I look forward to the Minister&#146;s explanations and I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_225"></a>
<a name="08070282000093"></a><a name="80702-0017.htm_spnew18"></a><b><a name="80702-0017.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="08070282000156"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> We have made clear, here and in the other place, the Government&#146;s intention that the personal accounts scheme will be self-financing in the long term, through charges on members, and delivered at nil cost to taxpayers. However, as with most new enterprises, there will be periods when the scheme has an operating deficit. One possible source of financing for these costs could be borrowing, from either the private sector or Government or a mixture of both.</p>

<a name="80702-0017.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_420"></a><a name="08070282000094"></a>The delivery authority is evaluating a range of funding options to enable it to make recommendations on the best way to establish and run the personal accounts scheme. However, no decisions, including whether any borrowing will be required, have yet been made. It is important that the delivery authority is given the time to complete this important work. We are determined that the scheme should deliver a good deal for scheme members through low charges, but this must be balanced against what is needed to ensure that the scheme is a viable proposition and our intention for the scheme to be self-financing in the long run.</p>

<a name="80702-0017.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a><a name="08070282000095"></a>It is therefore vital that we do not restrict the options for financing the scheme at this stage, as Amendment 112Z would, as doing so could compromise the trustee corporation&#146;s ability to get value for money. I reassure your Lordships that if the trustee corporation needs to borrow, it will need to comply with existing guidance and legislation and show that this provides value for money, just like any other NDPB. If a government loan is required, it will also need to be affordable, represent value for money to taxpayers and comply with European rules on state aid and competition.</p>

<a name="80702-0017.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a><a name="08070282000096"></a>Amendment No. 112ZA would allow the trustee corporation to borrow and to invest money without consent from the Secretary of State. While Amendment No. 112ZB would allow the corporation simply to invest money without the Secretary of State&#146;s consent, Amendment No. 112ZC would require the Secretary of State&#146;s consent for any borrowing and investment that the trustee corporation makes. Between them these amendments cover almost all of the permutations that you could have.</p>

<a name="80702-0017.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a><a name="08070282000097"></a>I therefore thank the noble Baroness for the opportunity to clarify the Government&#146;s intention regarding oversight of the trustee corporation&#146;s borrowing and investment activities. For an NDPB, it is normal for functions such as borrowing and investing to require the consent of the parent department&#146;s Secretary of State, in this case the Department for Work and Pensions. This is because an NDPB&#146;s expenditure is taken into account in its parent department&#146;s budgets. The requirement for consent from the Secretary of State quite rightly provides a safeguard to ensure the wider interests of the taxpayer are taken into account, as well as the trustee corporation&#146;s own objectives.</p>

<a name="80702-0017.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a><a name="08070282000098"></a>In the case of decisions relating to borrowing, the trustee corporation would be responsible for balancing low charges for members against ensuring that the scheme is commercially viable. The Secretary of State&#146;s consent is needed to ensure that their actions are also consistent with the sound management of public finances. In the case of investment, we would generally not expect the trustee corporation, as an NDPB&#151;and therefore a not-for-profit organisation&#151;to invest any money on its own behalf. Therefore, the purpose of Clause 66(4) is to ensure that, should the trustee corporation wish to invest any funds provided for its operation, it could do so only with the consent of the Secretary of the State.</p>

<a name="80702-0017.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a><a name="08070282000099"></a>However, I assure noble Lords that this provision is not intended to compromise the independence of the trustee corporation. Although Clause 66(4) requires consent, Clause 66(5)&#151;which was, I think, the clause that the noble Baroness asked about&#151;ensures that the trustee corporation may act independently of Government, when acting as sole trustee of the personal account scheme. This provision would apply, for example, when the trustee corporation uses the power in Clause 66(3) to invest members&#146; contributions on their behalf. Investing members&#146; funds must be the responsibility of the trustee. It is right that Ministers should not have a role in these investment decisions. This is purely a matter for the trustee, acting in members&#146; best interests.</p>

<a name="80702-0017.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a><a name="08070282000100"></a>The noble Baroness may press me on when the NDPB would invest other than on behalf of members. I suppose there could be circumstances where there might be a short-term surplus of funding. I have not really thought it through, but one can see that there are circumstances where the NDPB might invest on its own account, rather than for scheme members. I make it absolutely clear that the investment of members&#146; contributions is the responsibility of the trustee. It is not the responsibility of Government or the Secretary of State. I hope that has helped with these amendments.</p>

It seems that the Minister is saying that there is a distinction between the trustee corporation acting as a corporation and the pension scheme, and that these activities can be separated.

It is difficult to separate the two; they are not separate in that sense. I

I struggled a little and had some discussions with officials, which are still under way. It was explained to me that the NDPB will have costs in relation to its members, which may not necessarily be scheme costs. There will be costs that the NDPB incurs which would be chargeable to the scheme, for example if asset management is outsourced. Whether those asset management charges go directly to the scheme or to the NDPB and are then recharged to the scheme is under consideration. The key point is that members&#146; contributions are invested by the trustees, not by the Secretary of State. He does not have a role in that and nor do the Government. We need to develop some pro forma examples of what these accounts might look like. It would certainly help me and I think it would help the noble Baroness. I would be happy to share those examples with her.</p>

<p><a name="08070260000018"></a>The noble Lord said: This order is presented under Section 55 of, and Schedule 9 to, the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. It will enable the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland and the Council for Licensed Conveyancers to become approved bodies which can authorise their members to provide probate services for a fee, gain or reward. By probate services, I mean the preparation of any papers on which to found or oppose a grant of probate or a grant of letters of administration.</p>

However, Section 55 of the Courts and Legal Services Act provides an exception for members of an approved body. The ICAS and the CLC are the first applicants seeking to provide probate services under the Courts and Legal Services Act approval mechanism since the provision was commenced in December 2004.</p>

<p><a name="08070260000022"></a>Before members of the ICAS are granted practising rights, they will need to show that they can satisfy the requirements set out in Section 55 if they wish to provide probate services. These include being suitably trained and ensuring that their employees are suitably trained, including meeting the continuing professional development requirements set by the ICAS; having satisfactory insurance and compensation arrangements in place to cover adequately the risk of any claim made against them and to protect the client in the event of them ceasing to provide probate services; and having a complaints scheme in place, including a route of appeal to the Legal Services Ombudsman.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000023"></a>As with members of the ICAS, members of the CLC will need to demonstrate they have the similar arrangements in place before being granted probate rights. The CLC was established in 1987 by the Administration of Justice Act 1985 to regulate licensed conveyancers in the provision of conveyancing services. It currently has around 1,043 licence holders and 42 recognised bodies. Members are required to have undertaken the qualification and practical training requirements set by the CLC before being granted a licence to practise. Only those members who hold licences will be eligible to apply for a probate-practising certificate.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000024"></a>In order to meet the full requirements set out in Section 55 of the Courts and Legal Services Act, the CLC requested approval to extend its existing compensation fund to cover probate matters. An order to this effect came into force earlier this year. This will ensure that clients of licensed conveyancers will be protected against fraud, negligence or dishonesty on the part of the licensed conveyancer. Consumer protection is something that both the ICAS and the CLC have demonstrated they take seriously in their applications. As established professional bodies in their fields of expertise, they already have in place effective systems of monitoring and enforcement. They have made sure that they and their members have, or will have, in place suitable arrangements for the provision of probate services.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000025"></a>The potential benefits to the consumer of these bodies being approved include: more choice of provider; more competitive prices; and, in the case of organisations such as the ICAS which have an existing customer base, the opportunity to provide them with a more cost-effective and efficient service. This is precisely what Section 55 is intended to do and is in keeping with the principle, which is central to our policy, of providing new or better ways of providing legal services and a wider choice of persons providing them at more competitive prices. If consumers are unhappy about the way in which the ICAS or the CLC has dealt with a complaint about one of its members providing probate services, they can refer the case to the Legal Services Ombudsman. The ombudsman&#146;s jurisdiction was extended to cover bodies authorised under Section 55 in October 2004, shortly before the Section 55 provisions were commenced. She has been approached by both organisations and has agreed to accept complaints

It is not anticipated that the LSO will receive a high number of additional complaints per year if this order is approved.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000026"></a>In the longer term, complaints about these two bodies&#146; members will be dealt with by the new Office of Legal Complaints in line with complaints about members of other legal professional bodies. If this order is approved, a subsequent order will need to be laid. This will amend the Legal Services Act to bring both bodies under the jurisdiction of the Legal Services Board and ensure that they retain their probate rights in the future regulatory regime. I commend the order to the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000027"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Probate Services (Approved Bodies) Order 2008. <I>22nd report from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments</I>.&#151;(<I>Lord Bach</I>.)</p>

<p><a name="08070260000028"></a><a name="80702-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80702-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08070260000204"></a>Lord Henley:</b> I thank the noble Lord for explaining the order. I do not think that it is controversial and I suspect that we can happily agree to it. However, I have a couple of short questions. The first concerns consultation. The order states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08070260000187"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State has considered the advice given to him by the Legal Services Consultative Panel and the President of the Family Division&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08070260000184"></a>Who else was consulted? What is the process of consultation on these matters?</p>

<a name="80702-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000029"></a>I ask my second question with some embarrassment. Why is the affirmative procedure being used? I notice that the order is being passed under the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, which was enacted when my party was in government. I believe that the noble Lord referred to a slightly later Act, which may have consolidated the earlier Act. It seems to me that some of the affirmative orders which come before us might be better dealt with by the negative resolution procedure. I am not clear why we need to deal with this order by the affirmative procedure, but no doubt the Minister will explain.</p>

<p><a name="08070260000030"></a><a name="80702-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80702-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08070260000205"></a>Lord Thomas of Gresford:</b> I have reservations about this order. Probate is a difficult and challenging area of the law. It can be successful if it is simple, but it can lead to long delays, particularly if it involves the administration of trusts under a will or matters of that sort. It is a much more complicated area than conveyancing, and indeed quite a long way removed from accountancy. It is right, therefore, that the Government should have made necessary inquiries before bringing this order forward. What is not apparent is, for example, the track record of the Council for Licensed Conveyancers. Have there been complaints, and has its compensation fund been used in relation to conveyancing?</p>

<a name="80702-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000031"></a>Another matter to which I draw the Committee&#146;s attention is that the Legal Services Consultative Panel did not immediately give a clean bill of health to the Council for Licensed Conveyancers and thought it desirable that it should have a separate fund to deal with compensation for probate matters as opposed to the existing conveyancing fund. However, since that recommendation was made, the Government have for  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC64"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column GC64</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>some reason agreed, and by order enacted, that the existing conveyancing compensation scheme should be extended to cover the new area of responsibility. If the organisation&#146;s record&#151;nothing in the Legal Services Consultative Panel&#146;s advice makes it clear&#151;is that there have been few complaints and no significant attacks on the compensation fund, then well and good. However, I should like to know the position.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000032"></a>The other matter that causes me some disquiet is why the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland should be seeking powers to deal with probate in England and Wales. There are quite different and separate jurisdictions in Scotland and Wales, and the area of the law covering probate and trust is quite different in Scotland from the system in England and Wales. As I said, accountants are fairly well removed from this area anyway, so why do they want to extend their business into England and Wales? What training will they have in these aspects of English and Welsh law which will be satisfactory?</p>

<a name="80702-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000033"></a>In the long term, all may prove to be fine. On behalf of my party, however, I wish to put down a marker that these extensions of business should not be accepted without the most rigorous consideration of the standing and record of the one fairly new organisation, the Council for Licensed Conveyancers, and the longstanding record of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland whose members are coming across the border to take the business of practitioners in England and Wales without, so far as I can see, any reason appearing on the papers which have been put before us.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000034"></a>I voice these reservations in the hope that if the Minister cannot respond to them today, he will be able to do so before this draft statutory instrument is brought before the whole Chamber and its implementation is sought.</p>
<h5><a name="08070260000190"></a>4 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08070260000035"></a><a name="80702-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80702-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08070260000206"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I am grateful to both noble Lords for their responses. I shall deal first with the question of why this is an affirmative resolution, in answer to the noble Lord, Lord Henley. The comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, give the answer to that. It is always an important step when the law is changed to enable bodies to take part in legal practice when they have not been able to do so before. There are always a number of doubts and concerns surrounding such a change and it is important that Parliament should have the right to deal with orders that make such changes in a positive, affirmative way. I hope I do not embarrass the noble Lord, Lord Henley, too much if I commend his Government for having made these orders affirmative; it would have been a subject of potential criticism if they had been merely negative orders.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000036"></a>The obligation is that consultation must be with the two bodies I have mentioned. The statutory approval process means that the Secretary of State has to seek the advice of the Legal Services Consultative Panel and the president of the Family Division, but no one else is consulted in the process. That is for these particular applications, but, before Section 55 itself was commenced, I am advised that a full consultation took place. I hope that deals with the queries that the noble Lord rightly raised.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC65"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column GC65</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80702-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000037"></a>I take on board the doubts that the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, has expressed. I want to reassure him as best I can that, given the status of the LSCP and of the president of the division, all the matters he was concerned about have been taken fully into account. Indeed, so far as the conveyancers were concerned, he is right that there was initial concern over the lack of compensation arrangements, and the LSCP recommended that that application should be approved only if adequate compensation arrangements were put in place. It further recommended that the Secretary of State give consideration to legislation to amend the Administration of Justice Act to allow the CLC to extend its existing compensation fund to cover probate work.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000038"></a>The endorsement from the president of the Family Division for that recommendation was received in February 2008, and ministerial agreement was given in the same month. In March the Courts and Legal Service Act 1990 (Modification of Power to Make Rules about Licensed Conveyancers) Order 2008 was laid. The order gave the power to the CLC to extend its existing compensation funds to cover probate work. That has allowed that body to make rules about paying compensation to people who had suffered loss, as I told the Committee a moment or two ago, as a result of negligence, fraud or dishonesty. The system, if I may say so, seems to work. The body that, by statute, has to be consulted on this made a recommendation. That recommendation was taken on board by the Government, and has now been put into force. There is confidence all round that that is a suitable body to get this right.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000039"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas, asked the obvious question&#151;although I do not mean &#147;obvious&#148; in any derogatory sense&#151;about why an organisation with &#147;Scotland&#148; in its title should want to do this work and why it should be entitled to. The name may be slightly misleading in that, as I understand it, a number of members of that body already do considerable work in England, even though the name of the organisation has &#147;Scotland&#148; in it. That is true also for banks whose names include the word &#147;Scotland&#148; but that have an important function in England too. The noble Lord may come back to me and say, &#147;Well, the Scottish legal system is rather different from the English legal system but that may not be so true about the banking system&#148;.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000040"></a>The fact remains, however, that some ICAS members already work in England as accountants. The ICAS plans to provide training, which is what the noble Lord was concerned about, through a variety of methods, including compulsory training courses at its examination centres and using solicitors who practise in England and Wales to assist with courses. The ICAS has also approached the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners about the possibility of members attending STEP training courses and, if that application is successful, would enter into a formal agreement.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000041"></a>I mention those factors because the Government are satisfied that both bodies are eminently suitable for the work that they have applied to take on. While the noble Lord is of course right to express doubts, and while this is an important step, we are satisfied, as are the consultative bodies and the president, that this is a good move which will pay off.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000048"></a>At an election, when a ballot paper is issued to an elector in a polling station a mark is made against the name of the elector in the electoral register to indicate that the elector has received a ballot paper and therefore we can assume has voted at the election. This is the marked register of electors. The list of persons who have appointed a proxy to vote on their behalf is marked in the same way when a ballot is issued in the polling station to a person voting as a proxy. Further, under changes made by the Electoral Administration Act 2006, the lists of postal voters and proxy postal voters are also marked to show which voters have returned their postal votes.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000049"></a>Copies of the marked registers and other lists may be supplied after the election to certain authorised persons, including candidates and political parties, who may use the registers and lists for electoral purposes. The political parties, elected representatives and candidates attach great importance to the marked electoral register for campaigning purposes and for maximising turn-out at elections. Access to these records allows them to see the extent to which electors voted, if their known supporters voted and to gauge the effectiveness of their campaigning. The Government feel strongly that marked registers serve a useful purpose in the democratic process and that we should not hinder access to them by persons who have a legitimate interest in the information contained within them.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000050"></a>The regulations before us set out the new fee payable for supply of the marked register and other lists produced at parliamentary elections in England, Scotland and Wales and at local government elections in England and Wales. The new fee will also apply to the marked electoral register produced at an election to the National Assembly for Wales. I shall go into the details of the  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC67"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column GC67</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>regulations shortly, but noble Lords will wish to know that the regulations significantly reduce the fee payable for copies of the marked electoral register.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000051"></a>Ideally, these regulations would have been in force prior to the recent May elections. Unfortunately, it was not possible to complete the various steps required to bring the new fees into force by 1 May. Importantly, we have given careful consideration to assessing the costs to local authorities of producing copies of the marked registers and the impact of any new fee level on them. This has resulted in taking a little longer than originally expected in bringing forward new fees, although we believe that the very thorough and careful consideration has resulted in new fees that are fair and proportionate. I can reassure the Committee that the new fee will apply to requests for copies of marked registers after these regulations come into force, including copies of marked registers from the May 2008 elections.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000052"></a>Let me set out the background and explain why we are bringing forward new fees for the marked register. In the May 2007 elections we introduced a new framework governing access to and supply of marked electoral registers produced at elections. That new framework introduced a formula for calculating the fees. The aim was to standardise the fees and to ensure consistency in the amounts charged for elections across the UK. Importantly, the fee was intended to cover the reasonable costs of local authorities in producing copies of the documents, not to provide a profit for them. The effect of those fees was to increase the amount that political parties and candidates had to pay for copies of the marked electoral register.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000053"></a>The earlier regulations that set out the revised fees were developed in consultation with key stakeholders and they were also debated and approved in both Houses. However, as noble Lords may know, it sometimes happens that the full implications of a new proposal do not come to light at the time that it is put forward. On this occasion, in hindsight, it seems that the impact of the new fees was not fully understood and only became apparent when the new regulations took effect at the May 2007 elections. Clearly there are lessons to be learnt, which we will take on board when developing new proposals in the future.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000054"></a>After the elections in May 2007, the Government received representations from the political parties and a number of Members of Parliament expressing concern about the impact of the new fees. Joan Walley, the honourable Member for Stoke-on-Trent North in the other place, put down an Early Day Motion on the impact of the new fees which was supported by a significant number of Members of Parliament from all sides of the House. We were concerned at those representations and, as a result, last July we issued a consultation paper setting out proposals concerning the fees. The consultation was aimed at political parties, local authorities, local electoral offices in the UK and the Electoral Commission.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000055"></a>Various options were set out. No fee at all was one option; setting fees at the lower end was another; and making no changes to fee levels was a third. Some 97 responses were received and we have published a response paper to the consultation which sets out a  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC68"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column GC68</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>summary of the responses. I can go into the responses if the Committee wishes but I have a feeling that it may not be necessary to do so. There was no consensus on what fee level there should be for the supply of the marked register and there were, perhaps not surprisingly, different views on this issue between political parties on the one hand and local authorities on the other.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000056"></a>In the light of the lack of consensus, Ministry of Justice officials conducted further work. They consulted a sample of local authorities which had responded in order to understand in more detail the cost drivers for producing the marked electoral register. We obtained useful information. In developing our proposals we want to get the balance right between the costs incurred by local authorities and the importance that the political parties attach to the marked register for campaigning purposes and maximising turnout.</p>

<p><a name="08070260000057"></a>Noble Lords will have copies of the regulations in front of them; I think they speak for themselves. Perhaps I may just remind the Committee that the new fee structure will work as follows. There will be a single administration fee of &#163;10 per request for a copy of the marked electoral register, added to which there will be a charge of &#163;2 for each complete, or part of, 1,000 entries in printed format, and &#163;1 for each complete, or part of, 1,000 entries in electronic format. Depending on the mixture of paper and electronic data provided in any request, this produces fees of between &#163;20 to &#163;30 for a ward of 10,000 electors and of between &#163;80 and &#163;150 for a constituency of 70,000 electors. As I said, this represents a significant reduction in the level of fee. The cost of a copy of the marked register at the top end of the current fee regime would be &#163;60 for a ward of 10,000 electors and &#163;360 for a constituency of 70,000 electors.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000058"></a>As I say, we think that we have the balance right. The new fees take into account the information that we have obtained from local authorities about the costs that they incur in producing copies. We do not believe that the new fees will result in a new burden for local authorities. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</p>

I am not sure whether the Minister was present at the ceremonial burning of the electoral registers following the Henley by-election.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000063"></a>The regulations have one very interesting feature. In previous legislation, in 2007, the fee for registers was &#163;20 in data form and &#163;10 in printed form. We seem to have reversed that. It is now &#163;2 in printed form and &#163;1 in data form. The data form is far more useful and I suspect that the printed forms will disappear. It is a curious anomaly which the Minister might like to explain.</p>

<p><a name="08070260000064"></a><a name="80702-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80702-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08070260000212"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I am grateful to both noble Lords for what I take is their support for these regulations. I agree that when one first looks at this, it is a slight anomaly. Indeed, I asked the same question earlier today. As I understand it, there was a charge of &#163;20 for a data copy and &#163;10 for a paper one as an administration fee under the 2007 arrangement. For paper, &#163;5 was charged for each complete, or part of, 1,000 entries, which is now &#163;2; while &#163;1.50 was charged for each complete, or part of, 1,000 entries in electronic format, which is now &#163;1. These conclusions have been reached as the result of a widespread consultation and represent a fair way of making sure that local authorities do not lose out while at the same time ensuring that it is not too expensive for those who are entitled to mark registers.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000065"></a>We are already committed to the principle of individual registration, but it is a far-reaching reform and needs to be undertaken with great care so that any new system is robust and actually tackles the problem of under-registration. Any move would require careful preparation. Unlike in Northern Ireland where there was a perception of over-registration, in Great Britain the problem is frankly one of under-registration, so we think that a rapid and unplanned move to individual registration would make the problem worse, not better. We support the principle, but it has not been determined how it could be implemented without causing significant numbers of eligible people to fall off the register. We wish to explore the issues involved with key stakeholders.</p>

Neither I nor my successor in the other place, Roger Williams, have any objection to the order. We have a very large constituency in Brecon and Radnorshire; in fact it is the largest constituency by geographical area in England and Wales, and about the fourth largest in Great Britain. This part is in the far south-west corner of the Brecon and Radnorshire constituency; it is an old mining community. As is typical of the valleys of south Wales, the communities there follow one after another up the valley.</p>

<p><a name="08070260000071"></a>On 1 April 2005, there was a boundary change for the local authorities. In that boundary change, part of Cwmtwrch was transferred from Ystaly Fera, which is in the Swansea Valley, to Ystrad Gynlais, which is part of the Brecon and Radnorshire constituency. That was altered by the Neath Port Talbot and Powys (Cwmtwrch) Order 2004.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000072"></a>I will not digress too far, except to explain that there are two Cwmtwrchs. There is a famous story in Wales of an Indian restaurateur who went back to India and was discussing where he came from. He said to his old friend, &#147;I live in Cwmtwrch&#148;. His friend said, &#147;Upper or lower?&#148; That is a classic story in both Welsh and English in Wales. The result of the order is that the whole of the land on one side of the Twrch Valley would be transferred into Powys. Logic follows that the statutory instrument before us today changes the electoral boundaries, which will now be contiguous with the local authority boundaries. That is widely welcomed in the valley because it is a valley community and a Welsh-speaking community at that. It is a very warm and friendly place, especially in Cwmtwrch, whether Upper or Lower.</p>

In other words, it races down the valley in a flood and turmoil, a bit like a pig ferreting around in a field; there are masses of round boulders in the river and you cannot walk across it in the flood; you would not survive.

<a name="80702-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000078"></a>The noble Lord said: The order relates to the European parliamentary elections to be held in the United Kingdom in June 2009, and forms an important part of the Government&#146;s preparations for these elections. Its purpose is to provide for the reduction in the number of United Kingdom members of the European Parliament from 78 to 72 as a result of the accession of two new states, Bulgaria and Romania, to the European Union. The order also sets out how the new number of MEPs is to be divided between the electoral regions in the UK. The new number of MEPs, as distributed by the order, will apply to the elections that are to be held in 2009.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000079"></a>I shall go as briefly as I can into some of the background to why this order is necessary. The treaty of Luxembourg, which entered into force on 1 January 2007, provides for the accession of Romania and the Republic of Bulgaria to the EU, resulting in an enlarged European Union of 27 states. It was agreed after negotiations, in which we played a full part, that the European Parliament would have a maximum number of 736 MEPs and that the number of MEPs allocated to the existing member states would be reduced to accommodate the new accession states.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000080"></a>The treaty of Luxembourg gives effect to the intent of the treaty of Nice that 12 new states would join the European Union, resulting in an expanded union. Ten of the 12 candidate states joined by virtue of the Athens treaty, which entered into force on 1 May 2004. The Luxembourg treaty provides for the accession of the remaining two.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC72"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column GC72</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80702-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000081"></a>The Government fully support the enlargement of the EU, but I am sure noble Lords will agree that it makes sense to put a limit on the total number of MEPs elected by EU states so that the European Parliament does not become too unwieldy. A necessary consequence of that is that the number of MEPs elected by existing member states, including us, needs to be reduced in order to accommodate the new member states. Parliament has given its approval to the Luxembourg treaty. The order implements the revised allocation of 72 UK MEPs provided for in that treaty.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000082"></a>As I have explained, the UK currently has 78 MEPs. Under the European Parliamentary Elections Act 2002, for the purposes of elections to the European Parliament the UK is divided up into 12 electoral regions. England is divided up into nine, and Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland each constitute a single electoral region. The 2002 Act specifies how many MEPs each region has.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000083"></a>The European Parliament (Representation) Act 2003 provides a mechanism for implementing any change under community law in the total number of MEPs to be elected for the United Kingdom. Where there is such a change, the Secretary of State for Justice will ask the independent Electoral Commission to make a recommendation to him about how the new number of UK MEPs should be distributed between electoral regions. The 2003 Act specifies that in making a recommendation, the Electoral Commission must ensure that each electoral region is allocated at least three MEPs, and the ratio of electors to MEPs is, as nearly as possible, the same in each electoral region. The Act provides that the recommendation made by the Electoral Commission must be reflected in the order that implements the change. There is no discretion to reject or modify the recommendation.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000084"></a>In January last year, the Secretary of State asked the Electoral Commission to make such a recommendation in respect of our reduced number of seats. The Electoral Commission made its recommendation at the end of July 2007 and, in accordance with the 2003 Act, the commission&#146;s recommendation was laid before Parliament in November 2007. The method used by the commission, the Sainte-Lagu" method, was fully explained in its report, and I need not go into details here. However, the method was supported by a number of expert sources such as the Royal Statistical Society and the Office for National Statistics. The recommendation was that in six electoral regions&#151;eastern, north-east, south-east, Yorkshire and the Humber, Wales and Northern Ireland&#151;the number of seats remains unchanged, while the other six regions have all lost a single seat.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000085"></a>I do not think that I need to go through the details, unless of course I am asked to do so. I remind noble Lords that the order applies to the United Kingdom and Gibraltar, because Gibraltar was enfranchised for the purposes of European parliamentary elections from June 2004 and has been combined with the south-west region to form a new electoral region for the European parliamentary elections.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>

I had not come across what he referred to as &#147;Sainte-Lagu"&#148;, if I have my pronunciation right, but I will be coming back to d&#146;Hondt, which he will remember, in due course.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000090"></a>I have two questions. First, obviously if the number of our MEPs is reduced from 78 to 72 as a result of the accession of the two countries mentioned by the noble Lord, that is fair enough and we have to make adjustments. Will the Minister give the figures on how many people each of the MEPs will now represent and what equality there is? For example, we now have three representing Northern Ireland, of which the population is X, and 10 representing the south-east, of which the population is Y. Will he tell the Committee what the variation is between the different regions in terms of how many people each of the MEPs will represent and what the level of fairness will be?</p>

<a name="80702-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000091"></a>My second question relates to d&#146;Hondt. I do this in memory of my late friend Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, who taught us all we know about d&#146;Hondt and the bogus, undemocratic, closed-list system that d&#146;Hondt then worked on for electing our MEPs, which none of us were happy with.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000092"></a>D&#146;Hondt works in a curious way and, I suspect, works better in larger constituencies. In the old days, the smallest constituency had four MEPs, but now it is down to two; the north-east now has three, as does Northern Ireland. Does d&#146;Hondt still work as effectively&#151;if it ever did work effectively&#151;when you are down to a constituency that has only three MEPs, or would it be better if we thought of some other system? The Minister probably would not like to go back to the debates we had on closed lists, open lists, d&#146;Hondt and so on, but I would welcome his comments on the matter at this stage.</p>

I would be interested to know what the proportion is for Wales compared with, for example, the south-east and other areas in the United Kingdom. In particular, we feel that four seats for the population in Wales does not accord with Northern Ireland&#146;s three. Rather than have other areas reduced, we feel that Wales should have one more seat. I would be grateful for the noble Lord&#146;s comments.</p>

I can say a word or two about the Sainte-Lagu" method, if the Committee will bear with me. I very much invite noble Lords who have a huge interest to look at the document, <I>Distribution Between Electoral Regions of UK MEPs</I>, which was published in July 2007 by the Electoral Commission. Appendix A provides the detailed workings of,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08070260000188"></a>&#147;Full iterative working: the Sainte-Lagu" method&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08070260000185"></a>I do not claim for a moment that I understand it, but it is absolutely fascinating.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000095"></a>Andr&#233; Sainte-Lagu" was a professor of applied mathematics at the Conservatoire National des Artes et M&#233;tiers in Paris. He devised a mathematical formula for apportioning seats in elections where a proportional voting system is used. We use that system in the European elections. The Sainte-Lagu" method is a devisor method with standard rounding and is similar to the d&#146;Hondt method. The whole Committee will agree with the noble Lord, Lord Henley, who said how much we miss Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish; d&#146;Hondt was completely his. It is used to distribute seats to parties at European parliamentary elections, as well as in the selection of additional member seats to the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and the London Assembly.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000096"></a>Noble Lords will recall with pleasure that under that method, seats are allocated one by one at each stage to the region with the highest number of electors, after that number has been divided by the number of seats already allocated&#151;wait for it&#151;plus one. The Sainte-Lagu" method is similar, but uses different divisors. The regional electorates are divided by two times the number of seats already allocated, plus one. Whereas the d&#146;Hondt method uses one, two, three, four and so on as successive divisors, the Sainte-Lagu" method uses one, three, five, seven and so on. Given that I have explained that so brilliantly, I know that noble Lords will absolutely understand at once how the system works, but just in case they may have missed the finer points, I strongly recommend that they look at Appendix A of the document. The system is fascinating, and is how it has been calculated that the six seats that we lose are taken away from six areas, while the other six areas retain the existing number of seats. I have spoken for quite long enough.</p>

It is very simple: how does the electorate compared with the number of seats vary from one region to another. Are some regions being dealt with better than others? Obviously there has to be some variation because you cannot get these things exactly right, but I would be interested to know the degree of variation between the best represented and the least represented.</p>

<p><a name="08070260000102"></a>Let me set out the electorate in round terms for each region and what the recommended seats are for them. The East Midlands has an electorate of 3,286,000 and five seats. The eastern region has 4,199,000 and seven seats. London has 5,105,000 and eight seats. The north-east has 1,943,000 and three seats. The north-west has 5,188,000 and eight seats. The south-east has 6,120,000 and 10 seats. The south-west has 3,947,000 and six seats. The West Midlands has 4,039,000 and six seats. Yorkshire and the Humber has 3,775,000 and six seats. Wales has 2,243,000 and four seats. Scotland has 3,877,000 and six seats. Northern Ireland has 1,070,000 and three seats. That is a total of 72 seats. One MEP equals a certain number of electors in each of these regions, and it is true that Northern Ireland has a slightly better ratio than other areas have. I would be happy to show the noble Lord the full figures after the regulations have been passed.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="08070260000009"></a>National Minimum Wage Regulations 1999 (Amendment) Regulations 2008</h3>
<h5><a name="08070260000196"></a>4.58 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08070260000106"></a><a name="80702-gc0003.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="80702-gc0003.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08070260000226"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (Baroness Vadera)</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the National Minimum Wage Regulations 1999 (Amendment) Regulations 2008.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000107"></a>The noble Baroness said: The minimum wage is a key protection for the UK&#146;s workers that provides a floor for workers while protecting business through a level playing field without competition on the basis simply of low pay. The regulations will increase the national minimum wage rates by 3.8 per cent from 1 October this year and will benefit around 1 million people. The Government have accepted the recommendations of the independent Low Pay Commission on the new rates. As always, the Low Pay Commission considered   


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC76"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column GC76</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a wide range of evidence before making its recommendations. This included talking to business and workers and considering economic, sectoral and labour market data and forecasts. The rate is intended to balance an increased minimum wage without damaging employment prospects by being set too high.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000108"></a>The regulations also make changes relating to the Jobcentre Plus work trials programme, and clarify the position of participants in some government employment programmes. Work trials are a long-standing, successful employment programme on which individuals claiming benefits agree to be placed with a potential employer for a short trial period with the intention of being offered the job permanently. Evidence suggests that employers sometimes screen out the long-term jobless because of misconceptions or stereotypical views about their work experience and skills. Work trials can help to overcome this by allowing employers to find out more about an individual&#146;s actual performance in a job. At the same time, they help demonstrate to individuals that their barriers to work are not as high as they might have thought.</p>
<h5><a name="08070260000197"></a>5 pm</h5>

<a name="80702-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000109"></a>Work trials have proved very successful, with consistently around half of the 10,000 to 15,000 people annually converting their trial into a permanent job. The Government have announced their intention to extend the maximum three-week period of the programme to six weeks. This is to update the programme in line with developments in our wider welfare reform agenda, which is progressively extending help and support to economically inactive groups. For example, many people on lone parent and incapacity benefits will have been out of work for a long time, and have only a weak attachment to the labour market. They may need more time to demonstrate their suitability to an employer, to develop the confidence that they can take a permanent job or to make decisions about the type of work they want to do.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000110"></a>In addition, the extension responds to requests from local areas for additional flexibilities to help them improve the co-ordination of local support for unemployed and other jobless people, and be as responsive as possible to the needs of individuals. That flexibility will be carefully implemented at the local level by Jobcentre Plus staff so that it is targeted to the needs of the individual. We would expect it to be used in only a minority of cases, and only with the agreement of both the individual concerned and their prospective employer. Jobcentre Plus also has controls in place to prevent work trials being abused.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000111"></a>During the trial the participant continues to receive benefits from the DWP and so is exempt from the national minimum wage. The regulations before your Lordships today will enable the current three-week minimum wage exemption to be extended to six weeks. The regulations also make an amendment to the wording of the current regulations applying to participants in certain government employment programmes. Those programmes provide a range of tailored options to provide jobless people with training, work experience or temporary work. Participants usually remain on benefits or receive a benefit-based training allowance. However, some may opt for a period of subsidised  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC77"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column GC77</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>employment with an employer, during which they will receive a wage. Current regulations ensure that that must be at least the national minimum wage. The amendment before your Lordships will not change the current position, but clarifies which programme participants are entitled to the minimum wage and which continue to receive a benefit-based training allowance or benefits. That will assist participants and their employers alike, helping to ensure that workers obtain their entitlement if the minimum wage is due to them.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000112"></a>I turn to the detail of the regulations. Regulation 1 provides that the increase to the minimum wage rates will come into force on 1 October 2008. The new rates were announced in March, ensuring that business had sufficient time to prepare and plan for them. That is a well-established pattern. The provisions on work trials and employment schemes will take effect from the day after the day on which the regulations are made to ensure that individuals will be able to benefit as soon as possible from extended work trials. We would expect the impact on business and individuals to be beneficial. The DWP has ensured that guidance is available on these matters, and those arranging placements will ensure that businesses and participants are aware of how the provisions apply to them.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000113"></a>Regulation 3 increases the adult rate of the minimum wage from &#163;5.52 to &#163;5.73 per hour. Regulation 5 increases the rate for workers aged between 18 and 21 from &#163;4.60 to &#163;4.77 per hour and the rate for workers under 18 from &#163;3.40 to &#163;3.53 per hour. The amount of the accommodation offset is increased from &#163;4.30 to &#163;4.66 per day by Regulation 6. As noble Lords will be aware, the accommodation offset is the maximum daily amount which an employer may deduct from a worker to pay for accommodation.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000114"></a>Regulation 4 clarifies the circumstances in which workers on schemes made under government arrangements qualify for the national minimum wage. Workers who are entitled to pay under the terms of the arrangements by Government, or who receive pay from an employer, must receive the minimum wage. Regulation 4 also extends the current three-week exemption from the national minimum wage for individuals taking part in a work trial to six weeks. That exemption applies only to work trials arranged for customers of Jobcentre Plus and not to any other trial arrangements agreed between workers and employers, to which the national minimum wage would apply. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</p>

<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC78"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column GC78</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>employers. Employers&#146; organisations, on the other hand, have of late been expressing their increasing concerns at the impact of inflation&#151;arising from, among other things, the recent dramatic increases in fuel and other costs&#151;on the competitiveness of British businesses.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000117"></a>In accepting the LPC&#146;s recommendation of slightly above predicted increases in prices, as well as the average increase in current pay settlements, are not the Government concerned about the effects of inflation upon the competitiveness of our companies? If they are, what action are they taking to ameliorate the effect of that inflation on the health of our businesses, without which, of course, there would be no earnings and no profits on which to levy tax?</p>

<a name="80702-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000118"></a>Small businesses&#151;I declare an interest as a shareholder in one&#151;employ a sizeable proportion of the country&#146;s workforce. They employ a high proportion of lower paid workers and often already operate at marginal rates of profitability. This gives rise to the concern, especially in the manufacturing and retail sectors, that if costs rise when profits are already wafer thin, redundancies are the only realistic option, thus often hitting the lowest paid hardest. The Minister mentioned that there is a delicate balance between keeping inflation at an acceptable level and ensuring that workers are protected from unacceptably low levels of pay. I look forward to her comments on this matter.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000119"></a>I have two other questions. First, how will the Government avoid a conflict between the provisions of the forthcoming Equality Bill to outlaw discrimination on grounds of age on the one hand and the fact that these regulations include lower minimum wage provisions in respect of workers below the age of 21 on the other? I suspect there is a straightforward answer and I look forward to it.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000120"></a>Finally, does Regulation 6 mean that if you are provided with free accommodation in return for a few hours&#146; free work per week, but you also have a full-time job independent of your landlord, that your landlord will be de facto in breach? Have the Government assessed how many people might lose their homes as a result? I look forward to the Minister&#146;s responses to these points and to the points of other noble Lords.</p>

<p><a name="08070260000121"></a><a name="80702-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80702-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08070260000228"></a>Lord Razzall:</b> Whenever these regulations come before your Lordships, I always welcome the change in tone of the Conservative Opposition from when we started these debates 10 years ago. They were then, of course, significantly against the introduction of the national minimum wage, which is now recognised on all sides of the House as an important part of our economic framework. We welcome the regulations, particularly&#151;this is a point we made when the Bill was introduced all those years ago&#151;as the Government seem to be sticking, by and large, to their undertaking at the time to comply with the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission. The noble Baroness indicated that this is a recommendation of the Low Pay Commission.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000122"></a>I do not wish to detain the Committee for long but perhaps I may touch on the point made by the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, with regard to the differential   


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC79"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column GC79</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>between workers over 21 and under 21. The noble Baroness will be aware that, right from the start, my party has had significant reservations about this. I am not going to come to the issue from the point made by the noble Lord about how the new Equality Bill will impact on it; rather I ask the noble Baroness, perhaps somewhat cheekily, whether she would care to comment on press rumours that the Government will be under pressure from the trade union movement to alter the differential.</p>

<p><a name="08070260000123"></a><a name="80702-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80702-gc0003.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08070260000229"></a>Baroness Vadera:</b> I am grateful for the support of noble Lords for the national minimum wage. In response to the question of the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, the issue of inflation is obviously very current and we are cognisant of the impact that it has on businesses, particularly in the retail, construction and other specific sectors. Nevertheless, the 3.8 per cent increase proposed is in line with the independent forecast for average earnings, which is 4 per cent. So it does not have an additional impact on businesses; it is what they would get, in one sense, from the market. On the Equalities Bill, I am advised that it provides an exemption for employers using the youth or development rates of the minimum wage from challenge on the grounds of age discrimination. I am afraid that I do not have the correct answer as regards the point about landlords and I am not entirely sure that I correctly understood the question. I would have been aware of any problems as regards people being thrown out of their homes. Therefore, I can probably reassure the noble Lord on that point in writing.</p>

<p><a name="08070260000124"></a><a name="80702-gc0003.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80702-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08070260000230"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> I understand that Regulation 6 refers to a minimum rate of earnings even if you have free accommodation. If you provide a few hours of unpaid work in return for free accommodation but also have a salaried full-time job elsewhere, would that place the landlord in breach of the measure?</p>

<p><a name="08070260000125"></a><a name="80702-gc0003.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80702-gc0003.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08070260000231"></a>Baroness Vadera:</b> I believe that it would not. However, I suspect that it would depend on how the work provided in lieu of accommodation has been declared. The hourly rate for work carried out elsewhere would be subject to the national minimum wage provisions. However, I am still not sure that I have understood the noble Lord&#146;s question. Therefore, I shall take it away and respond in writing.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000126"></a>I can only restate for the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, the Government&#146;s clear view on pay restraint. Temporary price increases will sustain inflation if they lead to a spiral of wage increases. Therefore, we remain firm on all issues relating to public sector pay. As regards the impact on businesses, an impact assessment has shown that the cost will be somewhere between zero and &#163;62 million. Given the rate of inflation and average wages, I should say that that will be a decreasing cost. As I said, the measure is in line with average earnings so there will not be an additional cost in adhering to the national minimum wage provisions. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="08070260000128"></a><a name="80702-gc0003.htm_spmin2"></a><b><a name="80702-gc0003.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="08070260000232"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (Baroness Vadera)</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Cancellation of Contracts made in a Consumer&#146;s Home or Place of Work etc. Regulations 2008.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000129"></a>The noble Baroness said: We propose that these new regulations shall replace the current regulations, the Consumer Protection (Cancellation of Contracts Concluded away from Business Premises) Regulations 1987 under the vires of the Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Act 2007 and Section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000130"></a>The purpose of the proposed new regulations is to extend to solicited visits the cooling-off period and cancellation rights that currently apply to contracts made during unsolicited visits by traders; and to require that a notice of the right to cancel the contract be prominently and clearly displayed in the same document where the contract is completed wholly or partly in writing.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000131"></a>As in the current regulations, the proposed regulations apply to contracts made during visits by a trader to the consumer&#146;s home; to his place of work; to the home of another person; or on an excursion organised by the trader away from his business premises.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000132"></a>There are certain contracts to which the proposed regulations do not apply. These include contracts made during solicited visits and relate to consumer credit and home purchase sales, where current regulation under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 and the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 is considered adequate and satisfactory.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000133"></a>As before, under the proposed regulations the consumer will have the right to cancel the contract at any time during a cooling-off period of seven calendar days starting from the date of receipt by the consumer of a notice of a right to cancel. The regulations apply to contracts with a total payment value of &#163;35 or more.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000134"></a>The proposed regulations will now require that the notice of the right to cancel must be prominently displayed in a contract that is completed wholly or partly in writing. The notice must be easily legible and where incorporated in a contract must be set out in a separate box with the heading &#147;notice of the right to cancel&#148;.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000135"></a>For certain types of contract, for example the sale of perishable goods, where a consumer has agreed to performance of the contract beginning before the end of the cooling-off period, we propose that the trader must include in the notice of the right to cancel a statement that payment may be required if the contract is subsequently cancelled, and the consumer must record their agreement in writing to performance of the contract beginning before the end of the cooling-off period, if that is what the consumer wishes. These

In the event of a dispute, it will provide the enforcement bodies with a much clearer audit trail.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000136"></a>The OFT in its 2004 report on the doorstep selling market estimated that a substantial proportion of complaints, around 44 per cent, are generated by home maintenance, improvements, repairs and doubling glazing sales. The potential for consumer loss is high in relation to these types of sales because of the value of the goods or services provided. For example, in 2007, the value of contracts for which complaints were made in relation to the construction or repair of conservatories alone was in excess of &#163;20 million. We therefore propose that the new regulations should now apply to contracts for the construction or repair of extensions, conservatories, patios and driveways. We believe it is right that these types of contract should fall within the scope of the regulations. As in the current regulations, the new regulations make it clear that failure to provide a written notice of the right to cancel a contract or to provide the information required, or failure to do so in accordance with the regulations, would make a contract unenforceable against a consumer. In addition, the new regulations would allow a maximum level 5 fine, which is up to &#163;5,000, to be imposed on a trader. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</p>

I understand that they extend the existing right of consumers to a seven day cooling-off period for unsolicited visits to solicited ones as well. We understand the impetus behind the regulations and certainly agree that vulnerable consumers need protection from unscrupulous vendors. However, I have one particular question to which I am sure the Minister can provide a satisfactory answer.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000139"></a>Once these regulations are in force, if, as an example, I invite a plumber to carry out some work on my house and within seven days I decide I do not like the quality of his work, can I avoid the contract with him? If so, can he sue me, and on what legal basis? I cannot believe that he would not be allowed to sue, but if he cannot, would it not simply allow me to take advantage of the regulations to get work done for free? Under the law as it stands, before confirmation of these regulations, I can argue with the plumber that his work was deficient, but at least he has a contractual basis on which to argue with me. The Small Business Advice Service made it clear during the consultation process that it believes these regulations will result in increased costs for many legitimate businesses while having a limited impact on real rogue traders. How does the Minister propose to ensure that such negative impact

<p><a name="08070260000140"></a><a name="80702-gc0003.htm_spnew12"></a><b><a name="80702-gc0003.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="08070260000234"></a>Lord Razzall:</b> Like the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, I welcome these regulations and congratulate Citizens Advice, which has been leading the campaign to deal with what is clearly a serious problem. The only point I want to make is that under the cancellation notice the period is to be seven days. I think that I am right that during the consultation period before these regulations were brought in, a strong view was expressed in the lobbying that that period was slightly too short and that a 14-day period would be better. Moreover, when the regulations were debated in the other place, the answer the Minister gave then&#151;which seemed to have some degree of spurious common sense&#151;was that the seven-day period would bring it in line with solicited visits and the existing provisions in consumer credit legislation.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000141"></a>On reflection, I would have thought that that is not necessarily the case. When a solicited visit is made, the individual consumer has already determined in principle that they wish to enter into that particular form of contract, whereas unsolicited visits of the nature that this regulation is designed to deal with are often quite different. Have the Government had an opportunity to reflect yet again on whether a 14-day period would be better than seven days?</p>

<p><a name="08070260000142"></a><a name="80702-gc0003.htm_spnew14"></a><b><a name="80702-gc0003.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="08070260000235"></a>Baroness Vadera:</b> In response to the first question, I can safely say that it would not hinder the ability of the supplier to ensure that they can get payment. The cooling-off period is therefore not related to the quality of the work which, depending on the type of work, would have its own set of regulations for settling any disputes. It would therefore have no impact. Indeed, the regulation specifies that a consumer shall be required,</p>
<ul><a name="08070260000189"></a>&#147;to pay in accordance with the reasonable requirements&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08070260000186"></a>of the specified contractor for goods that were provided before cancellation and that were made to a customer&#146;s specifications or had been incorporated into any contract. There is therefore no impact on the requirement on the consumer to pay.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000143"></a>I understand that the noble Lord is also concerned that the burden should fall only on rogue traders. In fact, many businesses already voluntarily provide consumers with a cooling-off period and a cancellation right in relation to a contract made as the result of a solicited visit by a trader. Members of the Direct Selling Association, whose member companies account for 59 per cent of total direct sales, offer consumers a 14-day cooling-off period as part of their code of practice.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000144"></a>There was some lobbying about whether the cooling-off period should be 14 days. My understanding is that, after analysing the issue, we were not persuaded that the cooling-off period should be increased because there was no quantifiable evidence to suggest that that was necessary. We also considered the point in light of the ongoing discussions in the European Commission, which will consider cooling-off periods in all the legislation that applies to consumer protection. The Commission will bring forward proposals later in the year.</p>

<h5><a name="08070260000200"></a>5.22 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08070260000146"></a><a name="80702-gc0004.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="80702-gc0004.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08070260000236"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (Baroness Vadera)</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Companies (Reduction of Share Capital) Order 2008.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000147"></a>The noble Baroness said: The order does two things. It sets out how the reserves arising from a reduction of capital&#151;the cash that a company gets from reducing its share capital&#151;may be treated, and it provides the form in which a solvency statement must be made, underpinning the new option introduced by the Companies Act for private companies to reduce their share capital without reference to a court. The treatment of reserves arises when a company, public or private, has reduced its share capital by any of the means permitted to it. The order clarifies whether the reserve is to be treated as distributable to shareholders by way of, for example, dividends.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000148"></a>The provisions of the order follow consultation on drafts and detailed discussions with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and the Law Society. The order provides that, subject to some exceptions, reserves resulting from a reduction of capital will be treated as &#147;realised profits&#148; for the purposes of Part 23 of the Companies Act 2006. Part 23 sets out the rules for the distribution of a company&#146;s assets. The effect of the order is that, with certain specified exceptions, once a reserve is created, Part 23 controls its distribution. This removes the need for what is currently extensive professional guidance on the matter.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000149"></a>The second aspect of the order arises from the need to prescribe the form of the solvency statement that is provided for under Section 643 of the 2006 Act. This part of the Act enables private companies to rely on a solvency statement for the purpose of reducing share capital without the need to have the reduction confirmed by a court. For companies wishing to utilise the solvency statement route under the new Act, the directors must form the opinion and confirm in a statement that, at the date of the statement, there are no grounds on which the company could be found to be unable to pay its debts; that if it is intended to commence a winding-up at any time in the 12 months following the statement, the company will be able to pay its debts within 12 months of the commencement of the winding up; and that, in any other case, the company will be able to pay its debts within the year following the date of the solvency statement. The content required of the solvency statement is therefore set out in the Act. This order relates only to the form of the statement which the Act requires to be prescribed in an order.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000150"></a>In this order we have prescribed the most elementary requirements as to the form of a solvency statement: it must be in writing, indicate that it is a

I beg to move.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000151"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Companies (Reduction of Share Capital) Order 2008. <I>22nd report from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments.&#151;(Baroness Vadera.</I>)</p>

<p><a name="08070260000152"></a><a name="80702-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80702-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08070260000237"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> I thank the Minister for explaining the order. I declare an interest as a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, on whose briefing I will draw in a moment. Before I do so, I should say that we strongly support anything which reduces the regulatory burden on business.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000153"></a>On the transitional provisions, I understand that, even after implementation of the order, a surplus which has arisen on a reduction of capital which took place before 1 October this year will not become distributable. Is there any logic for this?</p>

<a name="80702-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000154"></a>I hope your Lordships will forgive me if I take this opportunity to probe the wider context of the Government&#146;s position on the possibility of more fundamental reform of the capital maintenance and distributions regime, both at United Kingdom and EU levels. For example, it appears from a recent KPMG study into the costs of the capital maintenance regime, and the commission&#146;s reaction thereto, that the UK has over-implemented the second directive regime, resulting in much higher costs in the UK compared to other member states. This appears to be caused by the UK&#146;s realised profits test, which, as I understand it, is not required in other member states. Do the Government propose to consult urgently and widely, with a view to reforming these rules? If not, why not?</p>

<a name="80702-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000155"></a>The interaction between IFRS or converged UK GAAP and the current capital maintenance and distribution rules can mean that the payment of dividends can become an extremely and unnecessarily complicated process. Can the Minister explain what action the Government are taking to press the EU for changes to the second directive in relation to public companies and to alleviate the problems faced by private companies?</p>

<p><a name="08070260000156"></a><a name="80702-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80702-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08070260000238"></a>Baroness Vadera:</b> On the issue of the date, following discussions with stakeholders we are minded to agree that the provisions on reserves arising from reductions of share capital should be applicable prospectively as from 1 October 2008, irrespective of when the capital reduction took effect. The matter will be addressed in the draft seventh commencement order, which is currently subject to public consultation. We intend to make the order before the Summer Recess.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000157"></a>I am aware that there is wider debate with respect to specific aspects of the capital maintenance regimes&#151;for instance, the realisation test&#151;and that there are arguments both for and against further legislative reforms. European Community law governs much, if not all, of this area. While we do not currently have plans to publish a consultation on the specific proposals, we are maintaining an open

<h3 align="center"><a name="08070260000012"></a>Small Limited Liability Partnerships (Accounts) Regulations 2008</h3>
<h5><a name="08070260000201"></a>5.29 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08070260000159"></a><a name="80702-gc0004.htm_spmin2"></a><b><a name="80702-gc0004.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="08070260000239"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (Baroness Vadera)</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Small Limited Liability Partnerships (Accounts) Regulations 2008.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000160"></a>The noble Baroness said: We are considering three sets of draft regulations to be made under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000: the Limited Liability Partnerships (Accounts and Audit) (Application Of Companies) Act 2006 Regulations 2008; the Small Limited Liability Partnerships (Accounts) Regulations 2008, and the Large and Medium-Sized Limited Liability Partnerships (Accounts) Regulations 2008.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000161"></a>The first set of regulations applies, with modification, the provisions of Parts 15, 16 and 42 of the Companies Act 2006, dealing with the accounts of limited liability partnerships and the audit of those accounts. The other two sets of regulations apply to small and to large and medium-sized limited liability partnerships respectively provisions on the form and content of accounts previously contained in schedules to the Companies Act 1985 and the Companies (Northern Ireland) Order 1986 as applied to limited liability partnerships.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000162"></a>Limited liability partnerships were created by the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000 and its Northern Ireland equivalent in 2002. A great deal of the substance of the law applying to limited liability partnerships is created by regulations applying parts of company law, particularly the Companies Act 1985, to limited liability partnerships with appropriate modifications. A similar approach is taken in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000163"></a>Since its creation seven years ago, the limited liability partnerships structure has appealed to businesses of all sizes and sectors. The number of businesses choosing to operate as limited liability partnerships continues to rise&#151;from 24,555 in May 2007 to nearly 30,000 by February this year. The Companies Act 2006 has introduced important reforms to company law. In light of these changes, the Government will apply the relevant provisions of the 2006 Act to limited liability partnerships. This will be done in two stages. The first is the draft regulations we are debating today. These apply the accounts and audit provisions of the 2006 Act to limited liability partnerships. These will come into effect for financial years beginning on or after 1 October 2008; and the new Companies Act provisions on accounts and audit came into force for companies on 6 April 2008. Our consultees told us that they would like the equivalent provisions to be brought into force for limited liability partnerships on 1 October 2008. The second stage will be to apply the remaining  


<notus-date day="2" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC86"></a><b>2 July 2008 : Column GC86</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>relevant provisions of the 2006 Act to LLPs with effect from 1 October 2009 in line with the implementation timetable for the Companies Act. For these provisions we plan to publish draft regulations for comment later this year.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000164"></a>The regulations before the Committee are the result of consultations on the broad approach to applying the 2006 act to LLPs, and then on the detail. The vast majority of respondents to the consultations supported our approach. Following the principles of &#147;think small first&#148; and to improve the clarity of the legislation, we have taken this opportunity to change the structure of the legislation applying aspects of company law to LLPs. The 2001 LLP regulations apply large parts of the Companies Act 1985 with modification of varying degrees made by textual amendment in schedules to those regulations. This creates a complex set of regulations that have to be read together with the 1985 Act. A similar approach is taken in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000165"></a>In contrast, the regulations we are debating today set out the 2006 Act provisions applied to LLPs in full, as modified to take account of particular characteristics of LLPs. As is the case for companies, separate regulations for small LLPs and for medium-sized and large LLPs will apply the provisions on form and content of accounts previously contained in schedules to the 1985 Act and the 1986 Northern Ireland order. By applying the 2006 Act in this way we ensure that LLPs reap the benefits of simpler, clearer and more cost-effective legislation in more modern language. In line with the extension of company law to Northern Ireland, the regulations applying the 2006 Act to LLPs will also extend to LLPs in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000166"></a>In summary, the draft regulations are the first phase of the application of the Companies Act 2006 to limited liability partnerships. They restate in full the provisions as applied, in a set of stand alone regulations that are more user-friendly for LLPs, particularly small LLPs and their advisers. I commend the draft regulations to the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

As I said earlier, we strongly welcome any attempt to deregulate and make life simpler. Furthermore, I do not think that the regulations are hugely controversial in themselves. There are, however, a couple of matters that I would like to raise.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000169"></a>First, the impact assessments each tabulate the number of small, medium-sized and large LLPs that were respectively in existence in May 2007. What are the dividing lines between small, medium and large? Are those dividing lines structured so as to move over time in line with inflation&#151;which, after all, is now rather more significant than it has been in recent years?</p>

<a name="80702-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000170"></a>Secondly, I take this opportunity to make a gently critical point about BERR&#146;s procedures for calculating the financial impact of an SI. Perhaps the Minister can confirm this, but I understand that to estimate the cost on LLPs of implementing the Companies Act 2006 BERR simply took its estimate of costs of implementation on limited companies, multiplied it by the number of LLPs and then divided the result by the number of limited companies. LLPs tend to be small, as the Government&#146;s own figures show, and so do not tend to have in-house access to all the things that large companies do. If, for instance, a senior member of an LLP did his own accounts under the old system, the implementation of the new one will mean that he has either to retrain&#151;Companies Act 2006 provisions being somewhat different from the 1985 ones&#151;or to subcontract to an accountant, both of which will cost money.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000171"></a>Furthermore, this SI does not blanket apply the Companies Act 2006. A number of exceptions are made&#151;for instance, where the Act refers to specific numbers, and on definitions of company types and so on. I suggest that these render it yet more inappropriate to calculate the cost of implementation in this way.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000172"></a>If I am correct, in essence the department has used a short-cut method of determining the costs to LLPs of implementing the Companies Act 2006 that is not up to its normal standards. Perhaps the Minister could respond to that suggestion.</p>

<p><a name="08070260000173"></a><a name="80702-gc0004.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80702-gc0004.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08070260000241"></a>Lord Razzall:</b> As the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, indicates, the regulations, which are being debated together, are not in themselves controversial. I await with interest the Minister&#146;s answer to his question. I wish to put on the record, as perhaps the Minister did not do the Government justice in her opening remarks, how much I approve of and appreciate the way this is being done. When the Bill that became the Companies Act 2006, which turned out to be the longest Bill in the history of your Lordships&#146; House, was being debated, one of the points we made at Second Reading was that it was a serious error not to regard it as a consolidation Bill. Eventually the Government acceded to that argument and produced it as a consolidation Bill.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000174"></a>I hope this is a precedent for all future regulations under the Bill. It ought to go on record how important it is that they take the form of option C as set out in the impact assessment, rather than option B. Had option B been implemented for the purposes of these regulations, the only beneficiary would have been the publisher Butterworths, which would have had to have sold more copies of its book for people to plough through in order to try to cross-relate the relevant sections of the Companies Act to these regulations. I welcome the fact that option C has been the approach, so we have a set of regulations that stand on their own which anyone can read when they see what has to go into accounts. I hope that, the consolidation of the 2006 Act having been achieved, future regulations

I wanted to say that, and I hope that <I>Hansard</I> will reflect it.</p>

If we were to have our own set of thresholds and uprate them every time for inflation, we would be adding a layer of complexity that would not be appropriate either for the Government or for businesses. For the purpose of information, the thresholds are, for a small LLP, a turnover of not more than &#163;6.5 million and a balance sheet of &#163;3.26 million, and for a medium-sized LLP, &#163;25.9 million turnover and &#163;12.9 million in balance sheet. We do not think it would be appropriate to have a different set of definitions.</p>

<a name="80702-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08070260000176"></a>I cannot answer the question about the way in which the impact assessment was carried out because it was done some time ago, but I shall see if lessons can be learnt&#151;not least wearing my hat as the Minister for better regulation; it is the least I can do. I am most grateful for the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, which will be warmly welcomed by the large number of people in BERR who have been working on this for some time.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08070256000007"></a>I have reviewed the collaborative work of DCMS public bodies at regional level. The Secretary of State and I have decided that the four DCMS bodies which have a significant regional presence should work with key partners, such as local authorities and the regional development agencies, to agree shared priorities and the action they need to take. These bodies are the Arts Council England, Sport England, English Heritage and the Museums Libraries and Archives Council. They will be specifically charged to work together on matters relevant to the DCMS agenda, and they will bring in other agencies and DCMS bodies where that would add value to work they are doing.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="08070256000008"></a>The DCMS bodies will contribute in relation to culture and sport in the following priority areas:</p>
regional strategies;improving relationships with local authorities and developing services in partnership with local authorities;place shaping; and2012 and the cultural Olympiad.

We have, however, decided that it is now time to switch funding from the administrative costs of regional cultural consortia into grants for front-line delivery in all parts of England from the end of this financial year.

<a name="80702-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="08070256000012"></a>UK Trade and Investment has announced today, in its launch of the UK Inward Investment Results 2007-08, that there were 1,573 direct investments in the UK by foreign-owned companies between 1 April 2007 and 31 March 2008 as reported by UK Trade and Investment and its partner agencies in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the English regional development agencies. This is an increase of 9.9 per cent on the year before and this reconfirms the UK&#146;s position as the top investment location in Europe. Overall total associated jobs numbers were up 32 per cent to 103,539 of which new jobs were up 23 per cent to 45,051.</p>

<a name="80702-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="08070256000013"></a>This performance reflects the confidence that companies around the world continue to show in the UK business environment. The number of new projects has increased by 9 per cent from 600 in 2006-07 to 653 in 2007-08 and there were 436 expansions by existing investors up by 30 per cent from 334 the previous year.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="08070256000014"></a>UK Trade and Investment&#146;s five-year strategy <I>Prosperity in a Changing World</I> has refocused and restructured to concentrate on the areas where the Government can make the most difference to maintain and grow the UK economy. For inward investment, UK Trade and Investment is targeting high value, innovative inward investment and entrepreneurial talent, especially research and development projects that match and enhance UK strengths. The UK has therefore positioned itself as a springboard for global growth for companies seeking to grow internationally from a UK base.</p>

The National Offender Management Service continues to discuss the cost of calls with the providers but they are not contractually obliged to reduce the cost. To do this without their agreement would require a large subsidy from the taxpayer. The current contract is in place until 2011 and the retendering project will commence this year.
