<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>To ask Her Majesty&#146;s Government whether the practice of excluding International GCSE results from value-added calculations in the post-16 school performance tables has the effect of artificially enhancing the results of independent schools against those of state schools; and whether they have plans to change the practice.</p>

I recognise that excluding IGCSE results from the CVA calculations could potentially bias the results of independent schools in either direction. We have commissioned an internal analysis of this issue. I will be happy to provide noble Lords with a fuller reply when that analysis is complete.</p>

Is it not the case that the Government could simply ask the exam boards for the IGCSE results and incorporate them into the tables? There would then be no chance whatever of bias. Is it not much more important that the tables provide parents with the information that they need to help them choose schools than to keep the Government&#146;s amour propre clean concerning a little dispute about what an exam is called?</p>

We can reassure noble Lords that as regards the most current information, there is little likelihood of an impact. However, IGCSEs have not been submitted for accreditation to Ofqual. Therefore, until such a time as Ofqual has accredited those examinations and they are approved for use in maintained schools, we would not be in a position to collect those statistics.</p>

VED rates for heavy goods vehicles have been frozen since 2000, and heavy goods vehicles that meet European air quality standards are eligible for reduced VED rates through reduced pollution certificates. Business expenditure on vehicles may be tax deductible against companyprofits, subject to corporation tax rules.</p>

Industry will benefit, as will the private car owner, from reducing the pollutants which their engines emit. The level of vehicle excise duty is an important stimulus towards that.</p>

However, the noble Lord will appreciate the extent to which the Government have put emphasis on low-pollutant vehicles. VED is the easiest signal to send because it is paid once a year or at six-monthly intervals and is a gross figure. We are signalling that we expect vehicles with low emissions to be purchased. We are also encouraging manufacturers; it is not as though manufacturers are not aware of worldwide pressure to investigate those technologies that produce fewer pollutants.</p>

However, there is a cost involved in the reduction of taxation. It is a reduction in revenue, which means that expenditure would have to be cut elsewhere. I am always interested in the Opposition&#146;s proposals that we should cut revenue because I never get any suggestions of where they would cut expenditure.</p>

This makes it less expensive for lower-emitting cars to park. My borough of Richmond has been at the forefront of this.</p>

There is no doubt that a whole range of strategies can be deployed to encourage the use of low-pollutant cars.

The Irish economy is often quoted as an exemplar for the British economy. On almost every occasion that it is quoted, I look at the facts and the comparison does not stand up. It is a vastly different economy with vastly different issues of motor transport&#151;in the numbers of vehicles&#151;from those of an advanced economy such as the United Kingdom. The issues facing Ireland and Britain are vastly different.</p>

I have indicated the advantage that we have already given in grants to industry for the purchase of commercial vehicles that are lower emitters. We will emphasise that from October when the European directive becomes mandatory. We are concerned to ensure that, as far as possible, transport plays its part in lowering emissions. That is not as easy as the suggestion that one has merely to reduce the tax take on diesel.</p>

One of the first countries to employ this strategy was France, but it is running into very heavy deficits and its Government are incurring much higher costs in developing the scheme. Therefore, it is not surprising that our Government are taking care to evaluate the effectiveness of the scheme before it is fully deployed.</p>

We have to do that while keeping essential protections for employees and employers. Abandoning the forthcoming changes on HIPs, which are intended to consolidate the regulations and provide industry with certainty and stability, would not help that process. I am delighted to say that, despite the current difficulties facing the housing market, a recent survey of 16,000 transactions by a leading estate agent, Connells, showed that, where a HIP was available, exchanges were completed on average six days quicker.</p>

<a name="0903238000043"></a><b><a name="90323-0001.htm_spnew40"></a><a name="0903238000362"></a>Lord Dubs:</b> My Lords, I declare an interest in that I am trying to sell a house. I can give the address to anyone who wants it. I bought a HIP last year and I have to buy another one. I simply say to my noble friend that of course it makes no difference to the housing market and of course on some occasions HIPs are useful but there are times when a HIP is simply an additional price that one has to pay to sell a house.</p>

<a name="0903238000044"></a><b><a name="90323-0001.htm_spnew41"></a><a name="0903238000363"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> As I indicated, my Lords, we have seen some definite benefits from HIPs in terms of speed. The regulations we introduced in December will require sellers to provide a property information questionnaire that will include simple, basic information on matters such as electrical safety which one often does not remember to ask about when looking at a house. On the specific problems, I am happy to act as an estate agent for my noble friend. I can tell him that HIPs are valid for as long as the house stays on the market but that if it is removed, a new HIP will have to be done after 12 months. Even if the sale falls through after a year the seller can go back on the market with the original HIP as long as the marketing starts again within 28 days. So it effectively has a shelf life of a year.</p>

It was said then that HIPs might be very good in a rising market but not very good in a falling market where people were having difficulty in selling. Unfortunately HIPs have not helped anyone and people are generally in disfavour of them because they feel that they are of no benefit. What can be done to reduce the extra burden placed on those wishing to sell now? It is all very well to have a HIP but, as has been said, they last for only a certain time. On the other hand, if it is more than three months old, it will rarely be accepted by a building society, bank or another solicitor and they will require it to be updated. What can be done about that? HIPs are not effective if they are not effective for the duration.</p>

I agree with the noble Baroness that people need to see the HIPs. One of the things that has not succeeded is that estate agents have not been ensuring that the buyers, or the sellers, see the HIP. We have changed the regulations and removed the concession on first-day marketing so that from 6 April people will need to have a HIP when they put their house on the market. That will help the buyer and the seller to know that the HIP is in place and what it delivers. We should also remember that well over 2 million energy performance certificates have been issued through HIPs, all of which can save on costs. We have also seen a drop in the cost of searches of between &#163;30 and &#163;120. So, there are definite benefits to HIPs.</p>

The package that we brought forward in December is looking at different forms of simplification and working parties. I can send the noble Baroness a collection of evidence that we have gathered and put forward, but essentially it is counterfactual evidence because the HIPs were not being seen and we were told not least by estate agents and consumer organisations that it was important for buyers and sellers to be able to handle the HIP to make sure that they knew what they were getting for their money and what information it contained.</p>

The Government have well developed contingency plans in place should a franchisee default on a franchise.

I did not explain my concerns terribly well in Committee, and therefore wish to bring back the amendment.</p>

<a name="90323-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="0903238000063"></a>I will also ask the Government to expand on comments that the Minister made then. She said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="0903238000238"></a>&#147;The purpose of the clause is to raise the status, visibility and effectiveness of the overview and scrutiny function&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0903238000211"></a>She added that there was,</p>
<ul><a name="0903238000278"></a>&#147;substantial evidence ... that officer support is an important condition. ... If overview and scrutiny is to be effective, it is crucial that officer resources are in place&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 3/2/09; col. GC172.]</ul>
<p><a name="0903238000212"></a>I agree very much with that. I declare an interest as a member of the advisory board of the Centre for Public Scrutiny, which has worked with the Government on this. I agree that more resources and staff should, if applied well, lead to better scrutiny. However, designating an officer does not mean that there will be any extra officer resources. The Minister said that having a statutory officer was the critical thing, and that there was evidence to this effect. Will she&#151;or perhaps he, as it looks as if the noble Lord, Lord Patel, will be answering&#151;tell the House what that evidence is?</p>

<a name="90323-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="0903238000064"></a>As regards funding, the Minister gave an indication&#151;I could not find the reference when I looked for it&#151;about the amount of funding. Certainly she said that the Government would provide funding, that this would be ring-fenced and that the costs would be met in full. I recall thinking when I heard the figure that it was not very much funding. However, ring-fencing and meeting the costs in full in the way that she described seem to be inconsistent with the assurances that the Government gave in the same debate that it will be up to the local authority to decide what suits it best. In short, we support good scrutiny, but we do not believe that the Government have found the key to unlocking it.</p>

<a name="90323-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="0903238000065"></a>Also in this group are government Amendments 99, 100, 170, 171 and 172. We welcome these. The first expands on an amendment that we tabled at the previous stage. I believe it came from the Local Government Association. The Minister will explain the now rather longer clause, allowing for joint scrutiny by two or more local authorities. Given the constraints at this stage of the Bill, I will ask him some questions on his amendment, even though he has not yet had an opportunity to introduce it.</p>

<a name="90323-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="0903238000066"></a>The new clause says that regulations may provide for arrangements for joint scrutiny to be made,</p>
<ul><a name="0903238000279"></a>&#147;only in circumstances, or subject to conditions or limitations, specified in the regulations&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0903238000213"></a>Will the Minister give us a clue what that might cover; and, importantly, do the Government expect that local authorities will take the lead in proposing any prescriptions that might come through regulations? Could he also confirm that this is not intended to be a provision that would allow the Secretary of State to take particular action against particular local authorities? I cannot think what the Latin equivalent for ad hominem would be, but I am sure that the Minister understands my point.</p>

<a name="90323-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="0903238000067"></a>New Section 5C would allow regulations to provide that an authority must or may not disclose information to a joint scrutiny committee. I was surprised to see this. The essence of good local government lies in its

In providing for restrictions on disclosure, perhaps the Minister could tell us whether there is some equivalent that this replicates in the case of a domestic committee, an overview and scrutiny committee, within an authority. I am quite concerned about that restriction. I beg to move.</p>

Before I address them, I would first like to set out the Government&#146;s position on our proposals. We had a good discussion in Committee about proposals for overview and scrutiny, which together aim to raise the visibility and profile of scrutiny within the council and in the local community. We also want to improve its capacity and effectiveness so that it is better equipped to respond to issues of local importance. I am pleased that the noble Baroness agrees with the principle of what we are trying to do.</p>

<a name="90323-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="0903238000069"></a>This grouping includes our amendments for joint overview and scrutiny committees as well as Amendment 98 on our proposal for the scrutiny officer. I will deal first with the amendments concerned with joint overview and scrutiny committees. We talked at length about the merits of cross-boundary scrutiny and how it could positively contribute to our overarching aim of raising the visibility and effectiveness of scrutiny.</p>

<a name="90323-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="0903238000070"></a>We were in agreement that joint overview and scrutiny committees could provide an efficient and effective means of co-ordinating the scrutiny work of several local authorities. Indeed, it was for this reason that we provided for the setting up of joint overview and scrutiny committees between a county and one or more of its districts in Section 123 of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007, and why, in Clause 30 of the Bill, we sought to extend the scope of these provisions so that joint overview and scrutiny committees might make reports and recommendations on any matter affecting the area or inhabitants of that group of authorities, rather than on local area agreement matters alone.</p>

<a name="90323-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="0903238000071"></a>However, noble Lords wanted us to go further and extend these arrangements so that any group of local authorities might set up a joint committee. My noble friend the Minister said that we would give the matter further consideration, and we have done so. We have concluded that there is merit in noble Lords&#146; arguments. They will be pleased to hear that the new clause introduced by Amendment 99 will enable us to make provision for the appointment of joint overview and scrutiny committees by any two or more local authorities. This will enable cross-boundary scrutiny of strategic issues affecting a number of local authorities, which supports sub-regional working between local authorities.</p>

<a name="90323-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="0903238000072"></a>The new clause replaces Section 123 of the 2007 Act in its entirety and will also make the changes originally to be achieved by Clause 30 of the Bill; that is, extending the scope of what joint overview and scrutiny committees may do, so that they may make reports and recommendations on any matter affecting the area or inhabitants of that group of authorities, rather than on local area agreement matters alone. Broadening the scope of what these committees may consider will help maximise this more efficient and effective way of working.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="0903238000073"></a>Amendments 100, 170, 171 and 172 make necessary technical changes to the Bill and other legislation where references to joint overview and scrutiny committees need updating or where repeals are no longer needed now that we intend to insert a new Section 123 into the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007.</p>

<a name="90323-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="0903238000074"></a>A few noble Lords, prior to the comments made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, raised concerns about the need for clarification on the scope and content of the regulations that we intend to draw up and on the timing of these regulations. It is natural to want reassurance about the timing of the regulations and I am happy to provide that. The new provisions for the extended joint overview and scrutiny committees would, if accepted, come into force automatically two months after Royal Assent. The proposals for joint overview and scrutiny regulations that we set out in the <I>I</I><I>mproving </I><I>L</I><I>ocal </I><I>A</I><I>ccountability </I>consultation will provide a firm basis for regulations on any new, extended joint overview and scrutiny committees, so we are not starting from scratch. We intend to continue to work with the LGA, the Centre for Public Scrutiny and local government stakeholders, consulting as necessary to ensure that arrangements for extended joint overview and scrutiny committees are practical and strike the right balance. With this in mind, we hope to be in a position to issue final regulations providing for joint overview and scrutiny committees under new Section 123 of the 2007 Act shortly after the relevant provisions of this Bill come into force.</p>

<a name="90323-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="0903238000075"></a>On the scope of the regulations, my noble friend Lady Andrews said in Committee that we support the principle of cross-boundary scrutiny. She also said that any extended arrangement would need to be considered in the context of the powers that may be provided to overview and scrutiny committees under the 2007 Act. Our intention is that such overview and scrutiny committees&#151;where they are established, which will be completely at the discretion of the authorities concerned&#151;will be provided with appropriate powers, in line with the proposals that we set out for overview and scrutiny committees in our <I>I</I><I>mproving </I><I>Local Accountability</I> consultation. These proposals were broadly welcomed by the local government community. Those are our intentions but, as I said, we will want to work with the LGA, the Centre for Public Scrutiny and other representatives from local government to ensure that any regulations for these extended joint overview and scrutiny committees are appropriate and strike the right balance.</p>

<a name="90323-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="0903238000076"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, asked about disclosure and what we mean by,</p>
<ul><a name="0903238000280"></a>&#147;must ... or may not disclose&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0903238000214"></a>information. This would simply allow us to make provision regarding what information must not be provided by certain partner authorities. In our recent consultation, we set out proposals on this that were broadly welcomed by the authorities, which intend to follow this up using the same approach.</p>

<a name="90323-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="0903238000077"></a>In talking to Amendment 98, which would remove Clause 29, I will address some of the other points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. Clause 29 provides for a designated scrutiny officer in councils  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_454"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 454</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with a responsibility for LAAs. That will ensure that overview and scrutiny committees receive the officer support that they need to carry out this important work. The requirement is for one statutory officer who will act as a scrutiny champion. The clause is therefore central to our aims for improving the visibility and effectiveness of scrutiny.</p>

<a name="90323-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="0903238000078"></a>Noble Lords have suggested that the approach that we have set out in the legislation is unnecessary and that we would be better to leave this matter for local authorities to decide on. Let me reassure noble Lords that we have consulted extensively on the proposals for scrutiny support set out in the White Paper, <I>Communities in Control</I>. Views were mixed but, if I lay them out, noble Lords will see where we are coming from. Some welcomed the commitment to require a scrutiny officer resource. The Centre for Public Scrutiny thought it essential if scrutiny is to benefit fully from the new powers and responsibilities outlined in the <I>Communities in Control</I> White Paper. It went on to comment that it saw a danger of there being simply a single officer and that it would favour more extensive requirements. Others, however, while agreeing that scrutiny should be properly supported, stated that how to do so should be left to the discretion of councils. Given the range of contrasting views expressed, I believe that the approach that we have set out strikes the correct balance in that it recognises the important role that officer support plays in supporting members to drive effective LAA scrutiny but carefully balances this with the need to allow local flexibility. That is why, for example, we have not attempted any complex definition of scrutiny support and resources.</p>

<a name="90323-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="0903238000079"></a>While we are creating a statutory post, we are deliberately not prescribing detailed duties that the scrutiny officer must carry out or at what level the scrutiny officer should be, a point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, in Committee. The level of other statutory posts, such as the monitoring officer and the finance officer, are implicit from the legislation because of the complex and extensive duties that they must discharge. We have not set out a list of the duties that a scrutiny officer must perform on the basis that the role of the scrutiny officer may need to vary from one local authority to another, depending on the way in which scrutiny is organised in any particular council. We therefore believe that it is better for local authorities to make arrangements that are appropriate for their own circumstances.</p>

<a name="90323-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="0903238000080"></a>Noble Lords raised concerns in Committee that the provision in Clause 29 is not sufficient and that one officer is not enough. Although the requirement is for one statutory officer, we would expect local authorities to decide what resources they need to allocate to scrutiny to suit their particular needs. I am sure that noble Lords will agree that it is not appropriate for us to prescribe such detailed arrangements. As I have said, the approach that we have set out achieves the right balance.</p>

<a name="90323-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="0903238000081"></a>On resources, studies on the development of overview and scrutiny have shown that officer support is an important condition for effective scrutiny. If overview and scrutiny is to be effective, it is critical that officer resource is in place to provide support and advice. An

<a name="90323-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="0903238000082"></a>We have also consulted extensively on how to implement the proposals for scrutiny support that were set out in the White Paper <I>Communities in Control</I>. As I have said, views were mixed and we have chosen to strike the right balance in this process.</p>

<a name="90323-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="0903238000083"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said that my noble friend had commented on this resource being ring-fenced. I should make it clear that it is not. If the provision is enacted, we will ensure that resources are provided through future finance settlements in line with the wishes of local government, but the vast majority of government funding provided for non-school services is through general grants, such as the revenue support grant or the new area-based grant, so local authorities have considerable freedom to determine their spending priorities. The Government are committed to ensuring that local authorities have the flexibility to ensure that they can make local decisions on the provision of funding for the services for which they have statutory responsibilities.</p>

<a name="90323-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="0903238000084"></a>We have no intention of taking particular measures against particular authorities. We will regulate in line with our response to the consultation on implementation of the 2007 Act.</p>

<a name="90323-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="0903238000085"></a>These provisions considerably strengthen the arrangements for overview and scrutiny. I am grateful to noble Lords who brought to our attention the fact that joint scrutiny should be made. We have listened carefully to those views and I hope that the explanation that I have given will provide sufficient assurances on Amendments 99, 100 and 170 to 172 and that the noble Baroness will withdraw Amendment 98. I hope that I have covered all the points that she made. If not, I shall respond in writing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="0903238000093"></a>I am grateful that the Government have heeded our advice and I am delighted to support their amendment. Although the amendment does not go as far as we would like, the Bill is improved by its inclusion and we welcome that. We on these Benches, however, would like to see greater flexibility and a greater ability for councils to set up joint scrutiny committees on specific projects or schemes where joint working is needed, often across county boundaries.</p>

<a name="90323-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="0903238000094"></a>I am sure that my noble friend Lord Hanningfield will approve of my using an Essex example. On matters involving Stansted Airport, for example, it will be a question of Essex County Council working with East Hertfordshire, whereas on issues surrounding the Thames Gateway the appropriate partners might be the GLA or Kent County Council. The Government recognise the logic of allowing the joint scrutiny but have stopped short of allowing a more organic creation of such committees. An enduring theme of our debates on this Bill is the Government&#146;s apparent reluctance to accept that kind of bottom-up flexibility rather than top-down centralisation. However, when the Government try to make this a better Bill, we support their efforts.</p>

Before the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, replies, I would like to clarify the disclosure issue. Information that may not be disclosed, for example, would be information otherwise exempt under other legislation, such as data protection. Also, provision may be made to avoid duplication of requests. For example, if a partner has already provided such information, the same information might not be required a second time. Our proposals also set out the information that should be provided, such as on local area agreement matters to which the partners signed up. I hope that that helps to clarify what I said.</p>

We are much happier that it should not be, although of course it is often quite difficult to identify whether there is any additional funding when it is not ring-fenced. This does not mean that there will be an extra officer. I fully accept that having a designated officer may raise the status of the work but it does not necessarily mean that there will be any extra officer resource.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="0903238000097"></a>I am reassured to hear what the Minister has said on disclosure under the government amendment, but the new clause is drawn very widely. I am sorry to bowl this at the Government without notice, but I wonder whether they might consider withdrawing this amendment now in order to use the period between now and Third Reading to reconsider this. I assure them that from these Benches we will be very supportive of the thrust of the amendment, which is a good amendment. I am waffling to give an opportunity for some thought, but the time until Third Reading could be used to draw up something more precise about the restrictions on disclosure. The noble Lord is quite right to remind the House that there is a positive and negative in the sentence on what must be provided, but the interests of transparency and open government have to be considered if we are to limit what must not be disclosed. If the Government would consider using the opportunity to improve their own legislation, we would welcome it.</p>

<a name="0903238000100"></a><b><a name="90323-0003.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="0903238000399"></a>Lord Tope:</b> My Lords, I rise to move Amendment 100A &#151;I think to everybody&#146;s surprise at this point. We debated the amendment in Committee, but the Minister&#146;s reply was disrupted by a Division, so I return to the subject now so that we might give our concentration to it.</p>

<a name="90323-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="0903238000101"></a>My noble friend Lady Hamwee and I need no convincing of the importance of good and effective scrutiny. As I said in Committee, we each spent eight years of our lives on a body devoted almost entirely to scrutiny&#151;the London Assembly. We need no convincing of the need to strengthen scrutiny. My noble friend has just spoken of the limited effect that the designation of a scrutiny officer is likely to have. This amendment, if enacted, would have more effect than probably any other single measure in strengthening the visibility, status and effectiveness of overview and scrutiny committees.</p>

<a name="90323-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="0903238000102"></a>The amendment would give local authorities&#146; overview and scrutiny committees the power to require the connected authorities to give evidence, either in writing and/or in person. In an ideal world, those authorities would respond simply to an invitation and there would be no need for any statutory requirement; in good partnerships, that is what happens now. However, it is more likely to be necessary where the relationship is either not as good as it should be or the particular issues under consideration are rather more contentious. If those other bodies knew that, if necessary, a legal power could be used by the overview and scrutiny committees to require their information, their evidence and, if necessary, their attendance, that alone would raise the standing and status of those committees.</p>

<a name="90323-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="0903238000103"></a>That is the purpose of the amendment. I hope that in moving it again we are giving the Minister an uninterrupted opportunity to give a considered response. I again stress that our purpose is wholly consistent with the Government&#146;s intention of raising the status and effectiveness of scrutiny. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="0903238000104"></a><b><a name="90323-0003.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="0903238000400"></a>Lord Patel of Bradford:</b> My Lords, I hope that I can give a response without interruption on this occasion. Amendment 100A is concerned with those partner authorities set out in Section 22A of the Local Government Act 2000 that must provide information to overview and scrutiny committees. The amendment  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_460"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 460</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would add &#147;connected authorities&#148;, as defined under Clause 2 of this Bill, to Section 22A so that those partners would be under a duty to provide information to overview and scrutiny committees once this provision and the necessary regulations came into force.</p>

<a name="90323-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="0903238000105"></a>It would seem, from what the noble Lord says, that he believes that this amendment would provide overview and scrutiny committees with the power to require partners to attend. It would not. This issue of partner attendance was discussed at length during the passage of the 2007 Act. Parliament agreed that partners should be required to provide information but that attendance before a committee should be optional. We said at the time, and I say again now, that we firmly believe that it is not necessarily appropriate to impose a blanket requirement on partners to attend in person. Where councillors are working in partnership with such a broad range of public service providers, some of whom are not based locally, it is not necessarily appropriate to allow overview and scrutiny committees to compel attendance.</p>

<a name="90323-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="0903238000106"></a>We must also be mindful of the potential burdens that are placed on partner authorities, some of which will have limited capacity to respond. It is, of course, important to provide overview and scrutiny committees with the powers that they need to carry out their work, but we must strike the right balance. We think that we have achieved this. This is evident from our recent <I>Improving Local Accountability </I>consultation. We have consulted on the regulations that will provide overview and scrutiny committees with the power to require information from relevant partner authorities. We are now in the process of drafting these regulations. The proposals that we set out in that consultation were broadly welcomed by local government stakeholders. In fact, a significant number of responses opposed overregulation on the issue of attendance, taking the view that such matters should be left to local discussion and agreement, on the basis that it would not always be necessary, or cost-effective, to require attendance in person by partner authorities.</p>

<a name="90323-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="0903238000107"></a>Given my explanation and the evidence that I have presented from our recent consultation exercise, I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment. A careful balance must be struck between giving overview and scrutiny committees the powers that they need to carry out their work and recognising the limited capacity of some partners to respond. Noble Lords will remember that this issue was discussed in detail during the passage of the 2007 Act. I believe that we have achieved the right balance of powers and that we should not seek to add partners outside those named under Part 5 of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 without proper justification and detailed consideration of the potential new burdens. I hope that the explanation will be sufficient for the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

If the drafting is inappropriate, I shall have a word with my parliamentary draftsmen, but I think that the purpose and intention of the amendment is clear. As things stand, if I understood the Minister correctly, these bodies may be required or requested to give

However, there is an important difference between receiving information, desirable though that is, and the ability to question and cross-examine on that information, which is, of course, the principal purpose of an overview and scrutiny committee. I am, of course, disappointed that the Minister does not feel able to go just one more step along the road of making scrutiny effective, but under the circumstances I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="90323-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="0903238000110"></a>&#147;With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a Statement on the European Council held in Brussels last Thursday and Friday, which I attended with my right honorable friends the Chancellor and the Foreign Secretary, and which, once again, emphasised the importance of European and international co-operation to address the financial crisis.</p>

<a name="90323-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="0903238000111"></a>In October and November, all European and then G20 countries agreed to recapitalise the banks. In November, both the European Union and the G20 agreed on co-ordinated fiscal action to support employment and growth. Just as, at the last summit in December, Europe led the way towards a global climate change deal in Copenhagen later this year, so Europe has now made proposals in advance of the G20 to reshape the global financial and trading system and do what is necessary to build economic recovery across the world.</p>

<a name="90323-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="0903238000112"></a>First, we agreed that the global challenges we face today cannot be met if nations turn inwards to a protectionism that, history tells us, in the end protects no one. Our agreement to,</p>
<ul><a name="0903238000281"></a>&#147;avoid all forms of protectionist measures&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0903238000215"></a>requires monitoring by the World Trade Organisation. The Council agreed to encourage international trade by facilitating trade credits, and called for a,</p>
<ul><a name="0903238000282"></a>&#147;swift conclusion of bilateral trade negotiations and of the WTO Doha development agenda.&#148;</ul>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90323-0004.htm"/>


<a name="90323-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="0903238000113"></a>Secondly, we agreed measures to put to the G20 for global agreements to reshape the regulation of banks and financial services. We agreed that all systemically important institutions should be subject to appropriate regulation and oversight; and that this would extend to include hedge funds and the shadow banking sector. We pledged to protect the world&#146;s financial system from non-transparent, non-co-operative and loosely regulated jurisdictions, including offshore centres and tax havens. We welcome the progress which has already been made by Switzerland, Austria, Andorra and Lichtenstein, and look forward to seeing them implement the international standard rapidly. We call on those countries yet to endorse the international standard to do so urgently.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_462"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 462</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90323-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="0903238000114"></a>The Council agreed to improve supervisory co-operation by pushing forward with colleges of supervisors for all major cross-border financial institutions. We also agreed to adopt international principles on remuneration in the financial sector, based on an approach which rewards long-term success rather than excessive risk-taking. We called on the Council and the European Parliament,</p>
<ul><a name="0903238000283"></a>&#147;to rapidly reach agreement on the legislative acts relating to credit rating agencies, the solvency of insurance companies, the capital requirements for banks and cross-border payments and electronic money.&#148;</ul>
<a name="90323-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="0903238000115"></a>At its next meeting in June, the Council will take the first decisions on regulation and supervision in the EU following the Larosire report. Our policy is that regulatory rules should be set at an international level but that direct supervision is a matter for our national authorities. The Council was clear that, by acting together, the EU can,</p>
<ul><a name="0903238000284"></a>&#147;put its financial sector on a sound footing, get credit flowing to the real economy, and protect its citizens from the worst impacts of the crisis&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0903238000216"></a>as well as helping to build a stronger economy for the future.</p>

<a name="90323-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="0903238000116"></a>The Council also welcomed the Commission&#146;s proposal to double, to &#8364;50 billion, balance of payments assistance so that those within the European Union have the support they need to deliver the fiscal stimulus required to ensure their recovery. But with global capital flows in 2008 down by more than 80 per cent compared with 2007, and the financing gap for emerging economies this year up to $800 billion, this is not just an issue for the emerging economies. Because of the continuing risk of contagion, this is an issue for every country in the world, so it is vital that we increase the resources available to the IMF in order to ensure that it can intervene to stabilise economies, stop the crisis spreading, and return the global economy to growth. The Council called for a very substantial increase in resources available to the IMF; and agreed that, for their contribution to this increase, as a first step EU member states should provide, on a voluntary basis, a fast temporary support of IMF lending capacity in the form of a loan of &#8364;75 billion or over $100 billion.</p>

<a name="90323-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="0903238000117"></a>The Council called for continued,</p>
<ul><a name="0903238000285"></a>&#147;international co-ordination of fiscal stimulus measures&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0903238000217"></a>It agreed that,</p>
<ul><a name="0903238000286"></a>&#147;good progress has been made in implementing the European economic recovery plan&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0903238000218"></a>and that while we must ensure fiscal sustainability in the medium term,</p>
<ul><a name="0903238000287"></a>&#147;the size of the fiscal effort&#151;around 3.3 per cent of GDP or over 400 billion euros&#151;will generate new investments, boost demand, create jobs and help the EU move to a low-carbon economy&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90323-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="0903238000118"></a>The Council also agreed a further &#8364;5 billion to be invested for stimulus projects in energy security, renewable energy and broadband. This agreement provides for at least &#8364;220 million of additional investment in UK carbon capture and storage, and offshore wind projects.</p>

<a name="90323-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="0903238000119"></a>We have seen an unprecedented fiscal injection in every major economy&#151;in France a package worth &#8364;26 billion with further, more recent, measures worth &#8364;2.6 billion; in Spain, an infrastructure package worth &#8364;11 billion alongside other measures, with the  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_463"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 463</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>IMF estimating a total stimulus spend of 2.3 per cent of GDP; and, in Germany, not one but two fiscal stimulus packages, together totalling &#8364;82 billion; 1.5 per cent of its GDP this year and 2 per cent of GDP in 2010.</p>

<a name="90323-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="0903238000120"></a>As the Council concluded, its determination is</p>
<ul><a name="0903238000288"></a>&#147;to do what is necessary to restore jobs and growth&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90323-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="0903238000121"></a>The Council also reached important conclusions on energy security and climate change, on the Eastern Partnership and on relations with the United States. The Council remains committed to working for a worldwide and comprehensive climate change agreement in Copenhagen later this year. Following last December&#146;s Council, Europe became the first continent in history to make legally binding the detailed policies required to set itself on a path to a low-carbon economy, with a commitment to a 30 per cent reduction in emissions, provided that other countries make comparable commitments according to their capabilities. Our success in Copenhagen, however, will depend also on unlocking negotiations with developing countries. The Council therefore agreed that the European Union will, within the framework of a future comprehensive climate agreement, take on its fair share of financing for green technologies, reducing deforestation and protecting the poorest from the impacts of climate change.</p>

<a name="90323-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="0903238000122"></a>The global economic downturn is no time to walk away from our commitments to the developing world. The Council agreed that Europe should continue to play a leading role in supporting developing countries in order to avoid jeopardising the progress achieved in recent years and undermining their economic and political stability, and that commitments to increase development assistance and deliver on the millennium development goals must be honoured. The Council also emphasised the importance of promoting stability, good governance and economic development in its eastern neighbourhood.</p>

<a name="90323-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="0903238000123"></a>Finally, in looking ahead to the informal EU-US summit to be held in Prague next month, the Council welcomed the inauguration of President Obama and reaffirmed the strategic importance of transatlantic relations. At this moment of international economic crisis, we are showing that Europe and the world can work together to achieve co-ordinated interest rate cuts, a substantial fiscal stimulus, banking reform, new rules for tax havens and remuneration. I commend this Statement to the House&#148;.</p>

<a name="90323-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="0903238000124"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.</p>

Within it, and in its conclusions, there is much reference to the forthcoming G20 summit. Can the noble Baroness indicate what arrangements she will be making to report to Parliament on that summit, since it meets on that same day that we rise for the Easter Recess?</p>

<a name="90323-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="0903238000220"></a>We welcome renewed commitments on climate change, but was the EU trading emissions scheme addressed at the summit, when the price of carbon is plummeting, which actually encourages more carbon emissions?

The <I>Guardian</I> today says that everyone knows that that target is &#147;hopeless&#148;.</p>

<a name="90323-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="0903238000221"></a>Can the noble Baroness explain the strategic purpose of the Eastern Partnership, involving nations with dubious regimes such as Belarus and stretching to the Caspian Sea? The Eastern Partnership excludes the three strategic powers impacting on that region, namely: Russia, Turkey and Iran. What talks have there been with those nations about the Eastern Partnership, and what have been their reactions? Also, what is meant by full visa liberalisation with Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, Armenia, Moldova and Azerbaijan? What timetable do the UK Government advocate for that, and what thought was given to the risks of easing human trafficking from nations such as Moldova?</p>

<a name="90323-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="0903238000222"></a>In this Statement there are, naturally, ringing phrases about the Doha round. We can all agree on those, but can the noble Baroness give us even one view of what specific progress has been made since the last summit? Were any questions raised at the summit about threats to free trade: for example, French comments on repatriating jobs to France from Slovenia?</p>

<a name="90323-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="0903238000223"></a>It is vital to restore confidence in the financial sector. I know that the Government feel that we are fortunate, in this country, to have the noble Lord, Lord Myners, on the case. There was talk in the communiqu&#233; of tightening action on lightly regulated tax jurisdictions; perhaps the noble Lord will lead the Government&#146;s drive on that.</p>

<a name="90323-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="0903238000224"></a>It is right to explore areas of capital adequacy and transparency. Would that such key policy issues had been addressed earlier, and the present discredited and confusing regime of tick-box regulation had not been put in place by the Prime Minister.</p>

<a name="90323-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="0903238000125"></a>Within the EU, we already have a common fisheries policy with rules laid down by countries with no serious fishing interest. We can all see the results of that in the North Sea. Will the noble Baroness assure us that she will save us from the nightmare of a City of London regulated from Tallinn and Bucharest or, perhaps even worse, from Frankfurt and Paris? We can all foresee the potential dangers of that. Better co-ordination may be desirable, but are there not real dangers in a single European regulator that overrides national regulation?</p>

<a name="90323-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="0903238000126"></a>We are told that the Prime Minister is forging a world consensus behind the British solution. Is the noble Baroness aware that it is not the British solution that other nations are commenting on but the British disease? We are back to the humiliation of the 1970s. Other countries are talking of massive fiscal stimulus. Has the noble Baroness seen today's comments from the CBI that,</p>
<ul><a name="0903238000289"></a>&#147;a further significant fiscal stimulus is unaffordable and would lead to businesses and households retrenching&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90323-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="0903238000127"></a>Paragraph 12 of the conclusions says the Council,</p>
<ul><a name="0903238000290"></a>&#147;reaffirms its strong commitment to sound public finances .... with sustainable public finances&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0903238000128"></a>The noble Baroness has enormous experience of the European Commission. Does she think that that bit was drafted by our own Prime Minister or by Mrs Merkel?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="0903238000129"></a>Last week saw the worst set of public finance figures in our peacetime history. We are forecast to have the largest budget deficit of any G20 economy next year&#151;twice as large as the average for the G20 as a whole. We are in no position to lecture anybody. Is the noble Baroness aware that Europe is unanimous that cutting VAT was not the way ahead? Can she list any country in the EU that has copied this move?</p>

<a name="90323-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="0903238000130"></a>Britain is in the humiliating position of having the worst deficit in Europe. The Prime Minister is now forecast to have delivered a longer recession than the United States or the eurozone; the deepest peacetime recession since the great depression; and, last week, the fastest rise in unemployment since records began. The policies that led the country into such a mess are not the policies to get us out of it.</p>

<a name="90323-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="0903238000131"></a>Finally, does the noble Baroness know if there was any discussion at the summit about the sustainability of the euro? Are we not fortunate&#151;here I give credit to the Prime Minister&#151;that we are not caught like so many nations in the EU in the straitjacket of the euro and unable&#151;dare I say it?&#151;to find British solutions for British problems? As long as the Government stick to their no-euro line, they will be supported by the Conservative Party.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="0903238000264"></a>&#147;It&#146;s being so cheerful as keeps me going&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0903238000225"></a>Certainly, when the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, reads out the litany of problems, with none of which I disagree, it is only fair that we face these issues firmly and resolutely.</p>

<a name="90323-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="0903238000133"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, referred to the depression in the 1930s. Europe faced the issues in disarray and competitive beggar-my-neighbour trade policies. It is encouraging, and something to be welcomed, to find that, at a moment of not only national crisis but of world crisis, the Europe of today has been able to meet, as it has done, and the Prime Minister has been able to come back with positive gains in terms of co-ordinated action. We certainly welcome them. I do not think it is churlish to point out that it might have been even better if Europe had not been lectured for a decade or more both by the Prime Minister and Mr Blair about the successes of Anglo-Saxon capitalism as against the weaknesses and failings of old Europe. However, we shall let that pass. The co-ordination that is going on is really to be welcomed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="0903238000134"></a>A little commercial: I welcome the statement on tax havens and hope that when we debate them in this House on Thursday on a Liberal Democrat Motion, whichever Minister comes along will be able to give us specific examples of how the Government are taking action on British-ruled tax havens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="0903238000135"></a>On the Doha round, I recently went to a briefing by our own noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, who was quite optimistic that we could get Doha back on track. She estimated that something like 20 per cent of the issues were still to be decided. Of course, they will be the difficult 20 per cent. Nevertheless, do the Government have a timetable for the completion of Doha?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="0903238000136"></a>On eastern Europe, I share the desire of the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, for clarification on the Eastern Partnership. However, I feel strongly that one of the great triumphs of the EU has been shepherding and helping former east European communist dictatorships into democracy under its wing. Some of those democracies are extremely fragile, so it is important that the EU keeps up its responsibility for both good governance and economic stability in those areas. Similarly, we welcome the ongoing commitment to Africa. In the recent debate on aid, it was pointed out that this crisis might drag some 60 million people back into absolute poverty. It would be a tragedy if the positive actions on Africa were a case of one step forward and two steps back.</p>

<a name="90323-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="0903238000137"></a>On the green agenda, it was interesting at Oral Questions today when the noble Baroness, Lady Symons of Vernham Dean, raised the German example of scrapping old, polluting cars with a payment as an encouragement to buy new ones. I wonder whether, rather than our simply point scoring over other countries, an exercise in best practice and good ideas would not be worth while.</p>

<a name="90323-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="0903238000138"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, is right about the situation in the City of London. We must be alert to the fact that, in trying to get both European and global control of these now-tainted captains of the universe, we should not bring in a plethora of regulations that cripple what is still a great asset: the skills of the City of London. On the other hand, I say to the City of London that it must not believe that it can have its cake and eat it in this respect. It must realise that some of the exposed faults need genuine responses, and we would support the Government in those.</p>

<a name="90323-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="0903238000139"></a>As for the euro, let us wait and see. I had always suspected that the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, was a closet <I>Guardian </I>reader, and I noticed today that Mr William Hague, also in the <I>Guardian</I>, says &#147;never, never, never&#148; to membership of the <I>Guardian</I>.</p>

He goes on to say that that is not an ideological position. If it is not an ideological position, I do not know what is. We remain convinced that there may come a time when it is massively in British interests to be in the euro. Talking about cake and eating it, I suspect that the City of London cannot permanently get all the benefits of being the major trader in the euro from outside the eurozone. The City should think about those consequences.</p>

<a name="90323-0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="0903238000142"></a>This is a good work-in-progress Statement and we support it in that respect, particularly since, perhaps a decade too late, the Prime Minister seems to have discovered Europe.</p>

<a name="90323-0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="0903238000146"></a>This is an important Statement which very much leads up to the G20 summit, mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, who asked how I would report on it to Parliament. The G20 summit is on a Thursday, which means that there will be no immediate opportunity for me to report orally, but I am sure that the Prime Minister will make a Written Statement, and I will make sure that it is provided to noble Lords in the usual way.</p>

<a name="90323-0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="0903238000147"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, began by asking various questions about the carbon price and the renewables target. The December 2020 package committed the EU to reduce centrally the carbon targets. This will deliver substantial cuts in emissions and will place limits on the number of credits that can be bought in. This means that action will need to be taken in European countries. The economic context, of course, means that as output reduces, demand for carbon will fall, and we are confident that the tightening up of the EU ETS under the 2020 package will still deliver emissions reductions. Renewables were not discussed because the focus was on climate finance. We believe that the UK target of 15 per cent is ambitions in itself. I should draw noble Lords&#146; attention to the fact that in respect of renewables &#8364;40 million will be allocated for an Aberdeen offshore wind testing centre as part of the EU economic recovery plan. That is a very welcome step forward.</p>

<a name="90323-0004.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="0903238000148"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Strathclyde and Lord McNally, mentioned the Eastern Partnership which will be launched in Prague under the Czech presidency. This is a very welcome move because, as the noble Lord, Lord McNally, said, many of the democracies in those countries are very fragile, and for the peace and stability of our continent it is important that we work with them and assist them in whatever ways we can with democracy building, capacity building and so on. Essentially, that is what the Eastern Partnership relates to. I well understand the concern expressed that major countries such as Russia are &#147;excluded&#148;, but they can be invited on a case-by-case basis to take part in meetings or projects, although Russia will not be invited to the summit. Russia has decided not to take part in the European neighbourhood policy.</p>

<a name="90323-0004.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="0903238000149"></a>On Doha, my noble friend Lady Ashton was, in fact, in Washington last week. As I understand it, she had rather successful conversations with her new counterpart in the US Administration, but clearly their position on Doha will not be clear for a short while. There are also elections in India, the other key country in which there were problems in the earlier phase of negotiations. Until India has a new Government, we will not really know where the Indians are coming from. The Government are working very hard to ensure a successful conclusion to the Doha round.</p>

<a name="90323-0004.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="0903238000150"></a>The Government, like both noble Lords, believe that the City of London is a jewel in the crown and that we have to preserve it. Of course, it cannot have its cake and eat it. It must accept that there has to be better regulation. Both the Government and the European Council are clear that regulation and supervision must  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_468"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 468</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be strengthened. We have made it clear that this includes the sovereignty of national supervisors, such as the FSA. The key is for the EU as a whole to work together better. We are clear that the City of London should remain the jewel in the crown.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="0903238000151"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, asked whether anybody else has announced cuts in VAT. There was an agreement last week on new general areas where VAT can be cut. It includes the long-standing French priority of reducing VAT on restaurant bills. We expect a VAT cut this year in time for summer holidays. This is new information that has just arrived for noble Lords who are going on holiday to France. We must remember that there truly was consensus at the summit that fiscal stimuli, such as the one that we are engaged in, are important in safeguarding the economy of the European Union. It is great that the Government are working together with their partners and are not trying to work in isolation.</p>

<a name="90323-0004.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="0903238000152"></a>Manoeuvrability for possible future fiscal stimuli is a matter that the Chancellor will consider in the forthcoming Budget. I draw noble Lords&#146; attention to the fact that the IMF has said that there is room in our economy for further fiscal stimuli, should they be necessary. Tax havens are a matter that the G20 will, of course, address. The noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, raised more general principles, asking whether the Government were isolated in the European Union by what they are doing about fiscal stimuli, and so on. I draw the noble Lord&#146;s attention to a table that I have before me, which I will make available to him and the noble Lord, Lord McNally. It shows that we are not at all on a limb and very much in the mainstream, working on projects similar to those of our colleagues in the European Union. I look forward to further questions.</p>

Before the European super-regulator joins the European army among the men of straw that get set up and knocked down regularly in this House, will she confirm that there is extraordinary consistency and coherence between the ideas put forward for regulatory reform in this country by my noble friend Lord Turner and those put forward by Monsieur de la Rosire to the European Union and endorsed by the European Council? If that is the case, I am not sure what we are all so frightened about. There is consistency between those approaches.

<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="0903238000155"></a>On energy security, will the noble Baroness tell us whether the European Union is now moving from warm words to deeds&#151;a process that has taken an awfully long time? When the Council conclusions refer to dealing with emergency situations in the gas sector, will she confirm that the Government will not exclude from consideration the possibility that member states should have a legal obligation to maintain reserves of gas, just as they already have a legal obligation to maintain reserves of oil? It would make an enormous difference if that obligation applied to all 27 member states, just as the measures adopted after the crises of the 1970s helped us to deal with an oil crisis. Perhaps the noble Baroness can say something on those points.</p>

As I understand it, in the not-too-distant future the Commission will bring forward proposals and the Government will bring forward a White Paper. All these things will be on the table and there will be a further discussion at the European Council in June, but it is absolutely right for the noble Lord to point out that there is much agreement on many of these issues.</p>

<a name="90323-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="0903238000157"></a>In relation to climate change, it is extremely important that, again in the not-too-distant future, the European Council makes clear exactly what it will be able to do to assist developing countries so that they can be positively brought to the table and so that we can reach agreement in Copenhagen. Again, we will return to this at the June Council meeting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="0903238000158"></a>On energy security, I believe that we are moving from warm words to deeds. I cannot make any detailed comments on gas reserves but it sounds a very interesting proposal and I will come back to the noble Lord in writing. However, it is clear from various discussions that took place in Brussels last week that progress will be made very soon on projects such as the southern corridor and Nabucco. These have been raised in debate here in the past and are very important for diversity of gas sources. The European Union wants absolute action on these issues to ensure that we have security of energy supply.</p>

I do not believe that this is an opportunity for Governments across the European Union to grasp power, as he puts it. This is not just about EU countries; it is a global issue, which is why it is being discussed at both the European Union level and the G20 level. Many Governments feel very strongly about it. The Government are looking forward to the Foot review on tax havens as it will inform our approach to the UK&#146;s own Crown dependencies and overseas territories. We are absolutely committed to meeting our international responsibilities to the proper standards. We are also determined to take action on this not just within the European Union but globally.</p>

Strangely enough, the stability and growth pact was not a subject of great debate at the recent Council meeting, because all member states are in the same boat. The treaty says that member states should endeavour to avoid breaking the stability pact&#151;that is, the 3 per cent deficit and 60 per cent debt levels. We will endeavour to do that when the time is appropriate. In the Pre-Budget Report my right honourable friend the Chancellor set out how we will consolidate our position in the future. We know what we are working towards but now is not the time to take the necessary action. On the IMF, I think that the article which we all read in a newspaper stemmed from comments made by a person who worked for the IMF. That is absolutely fine.

We have every confidence that by working together and not in isolation we will soon come out of the crisis and be able to meet future challenges together.</p>

The Statement reads as follows:</p>

<a name="90323-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="0903238000168"></a>&#147;With permission, Mr Speaker, I should like to make a Statement on the Green Paper,<I> Rights and Responsibilities: </I><I>D</I><I>eveloping our </I><I>C</I><I>onstitutional </I><I>F</I><I>ramework</I>, laid before Parliament today. The Green Paper is the next stage in what has been described as a quiet revolution in our constitutional arrangements. Since 1997, we have had the independence of the Bank of

<a name="90323-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="0903238000169"></a>This Green Paper deals with some of the most fundamental questions we face as individuals and as a society: how we live together; what rights and freedoms we enjoy and from whom; and what duties and obligations we owe and to whom. These issues are not abstractions removed from the practical politics of jobs and housing, healthcare and education, crime and disorder, because these constitutional arrangements determine how power is distributed and, therefore, the conditions in which every other question in our public life will be answered.</p>

<a name="90323-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="0903238000170"></a>It is because of the centrality of these issues that my right honourable friend the Prime Minister chose to make his first major policy statement, within days of taking office, on exactly this matter of constitutional change. My right honourable friend told this House that it was right to involve the public,</p>
<ul><a name="0903238000292"></a>&#145;in a sustained debate about whether there is a case for the United Kingdom developing a full British Bill of Rights and Duties&#146;,</ul>
<p><a name="0903238000228"></a>as a step towards a written constitution.</p>

<a name="90323-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="0903238000171"></a>The Green Paper presents the arguments for such a Bill. It does not reach final conclusions&#151;that is for the end of the process of national discussion&#151;rather, it sets the framework for this debate. Indeed, if by the end of the process the Bill is perceived to provide protection to rights and freedoms, it will become effective in defining common values so that people in Britain of different backgrounds may feel ownership of it.</p>

<a name="90323-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="0903238000172"></a>From the Magna Carta and the Declaration of Arbroath, the 1689 Bill of Rights and Scottish Claim of Right, to the great reform Acts of the past two centuries, our history illustrates the proud traditions of liberty on which our nation is built. Although the profound changes which these great texts initiated were the subject of intense struggle at the time, the United Kingdom&#146;s experience of constitutional development has been unlike that of almost any other democracy in the world.</p>

<a name="90323-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="0903238000173"></a>The constitutional arrangements of most other nations have emerged from rebellion, revolution, civil war, occupation or oppression. The United States, France, India, South Africa, nations across Europe and the world, have had to set down their arrangements in a single text: a constitution, underpinned by declarations of rights. Whether legally enforceable or not, they have become abiding points of reference on how their citizens should relate to each other and to the state, and they help to define the kind of nation they wish to be. This Green Paper sets out the case for how a Bill could become a similar unifying force for the United Kingdom; not least because our society is much more diverse in race, religion and ethnicity than at any point in our history.</p>

<a name="90323-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="0903238000174"></a>We are launching this Green Paper at a time of great uncertainty and anxiety. Tackling the global recession must be our immediate priority. But acting at the same time to strengthen communities&#146; and individuals&#146; sense of a stake in society, by better articulating the responsibilities that we owe and the rights that   


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_473"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 473</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we have, is not an alternative to decisive measures on the economic front, but an essential complement to them.</p>

<a name="90323-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="0903238000175"></a>One of the most significant constitutional changes in the past dozen years is the Human Rights Act. I worked hard as sponsoring Minister to achieve a consensus behind it, and I commend the Official Opposition for the support that they gave the Act in its final form. Prior to the Act, accessing convention rights via the Strasbourg court was a time-consuming, expensive and difficult process and, as such, prohibitive for many. Now those rights can be accessed in UK courts, with cases heard by UK judges.</p>

<a name="90323-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="0903238000176"></a>The Act better protects the family. It has benefited all sections of society, from the elderly couple wanting to live in the same care home to the loftiest newspaper magnate. In providing a more practical mechanism to access rights, as well as a positive obligation on the state to protect them, countless thousands of people have benefited from the law, without necessarily having to resort to the law.</p>

<a name="90323-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="0903238000177"></a>Despite this, the Act has its detractors, primarily because the atrocities of 9/11 occurred less than a year after the Act came into force. Had those tragic events not occurred, I suggest that the HRA would have slipped comfortably into the fabric of our lives without controversy. As it was, those terrible events threw into acute relief the tension between liberty and security. We recognise these tensions, but the Government are proud of the Human Rights Act. We will neither resile from it nor repeal it.</p>

<a name="90323-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="0903238000178"></a>The principles and rights set down in the European convention, and now in the Human Rights Act, are timeless. They are the mark and measure of any civilised society at any time. But in the intervening 60 years, these rights have been added to by a great extension of social and economic rights&#151;of healthcare, dignity in old age, education, housing and social security. But as our rights have become so much wider and stronger, one question is whether their claim is balanced properly by an equally strong sense of the responsibilities that we each owe.</p>

<a name="90323-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="0903238000179"></a>We believe that there is a case for drawing out more clearly and explicitly the responsibilities that go with rights. Duties and responsibilities are to be found in the convention, in statute, in common law and woven deeply into our social and moral fabric. We have a latent understanding and acceptance of our duties to one another and to the state. That said, responsibilities have been something of a poor cousin to rights. The Green Paper proposes that responsibilities are given greater prominence in our constitutional arrangements, the better to articulate what we owe as much as what we expect. This is how we can move away from a &#145;rights culture&#146; to a &#145;rights and responsibilities culture&#146;.</p>

<a name="90323-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="0903238000180"></a>Some responsibilities are obvious: obeying the law, paying taxes, jury service. Others are less obviously recalled at the moment that they should be exercised: a responsibility towards future generations by living within environmental limits; the duty we have to protect the well-being of children in our care; a civic duty to vote; responsibilities towards our neighbours;  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_474"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 474</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>respect for those public sector workers who care for us; responsibility towards the taxpayer not to claim benefits if able to work.</p>

<a name="90323-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="0903238000181"></a>If we are to fulfil our responsibilities, we have to have a clear understanding of what they are. As the Green Paper sets out, an accessible bill of rights and responsibilities could be emblematic of the fair society that we want to live in, where awareness of our rights is matched with a greater understanding of our responsibilities to each other.</p>

<a name="90323-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="0903238000182"></a>Most of the social and economic rights to which I have referred are already embedded in law, but they are scattered across myriad legal texts. The Government believe that we should encapsulate these rights in a single document, bringing together the &#145;new&#146; post-war rights of social justice and the welfare state, victims&#146; rights, of equality and of good administration.</p>

<a name="90323-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="0903238000183"></a>A key question set out in the Green Paper is whether any Bill should have, directly or indirectly, the force of law. Bills of rights from around the world are a combination of symbolism, aspiration and law across a spectrum of legal effect. There need not be a binary choice between the justiciable and the declaratory. As the Green Paper points out, the Government do not necessarily consider a model of directly legally enforceable rights or responsibilities to be the most appropriate.</p>

<a name="90323-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="0903238000184"></a>Even without full legal enforcement, words have power. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights contained no legally enforceable rights; rather, it was the global expression of a shared commitment, a recognition of humanity&#146;s common dignity, what Eleanor Roosevelt described as the &#145;Magna Carta for all mankind&#146;. A bill of rights and responsibilities for the United Kingdom could be this kind of declaration to set in stone the values we cherish.</p>

<a name="90323-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="0903238000185"></a>I have had the rare privilege to take through this House many of the constitutional changes of the past 12 years, or have been closely involved with their development. Throughout that time, I have looked to secure the broadest political consensus behind them. Reforms of such importance to our democracy require nothing less. Constitutional change should take place only on the basis of full and proper deliberation. This Green Paper has been through such a process within government and now it is time to take the debate out to the people we all serve. This deliberation must not and will not be rushed, and so this Green Paper will not precede any legislation this side of a general election. We are dealing here with the fundamental building blocks of our democracy, and as the Prime Minister made clear:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a><a name="0903238000266"></a>&#145;Constitutional change will not be the work of just one Bill or one year or one Parliament&#146;.</p>

<a name="90323-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="0903238000186"></a>A bill of rights and responsibilities could form the next natural and necessary step in a process which began 60 years ago with the universal declaration. It is an opportunity to bring together existing rights and responsibilities in one place and better to define the relationship between citizen and state in a new and unifying constitutional document fit for this century. I commend this Statement to the House&#148;.</p>

<a name="90323-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="0903238000187"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.</p>

I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, has found himself in exactly the same boat.</p>

<a name="90323-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="0903238000189"></a>Inevitably, in skimming a document as weighty as this, one&#146;s eye is attracted to those passages in which one has been most concerned in one&#146;s political life. In those circumstances, when responding to what I have to say, the Minister might find that he is in a position to point me to other parts that I have not been able to read that successfully refute my observations. That is a risk that I shall have to take.</p>

<a name="90323-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="0903238000190"></a>I have the impression that the Green Paper is a massive exercise in sitting on the fence. If we needed any further proof that the Cabinet is deadlocked over enacting a Bill of Rights, here it is in this document. Nothing confirms the state of utter confusion that engulfs the Government more than paragraph 4.30:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a><a name="0903238000267"></a>&#147;If a Bill of Rights and Responsibilities took the form of an Act of Parliament, there would be a range of options for dealing with the Human Rights Act and the Convention rights. The Bill might subsume the Human Rights Act as part of the new Bill of Rights and Responsibilities. The Bill of Rights and Responsibilities might preserve the Human Rights Act as a separate Act. It might also be desirable to signpost the Convention rights in some way, for example by crossreference to make clear that neither they nor the Human Rights Act were affected by the new Bill&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0903238000191"></a>This is a monument to indecision.</p>

<a name="90323-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="0903238000192"></a>Further confirmation of the Government&#146;s state of mind is furnished by Chapter 5, entitled <I>New Steps</I><I>. </I>I apologise to your Lordships for reading out another passage but I think it is the most telling way to make the point. At paragraph 5.3 the Government state:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="0903238000268"></a>&#147;It is that process of consultation upon which we now embark. We intend to involve all parts of our country and our society in discussions both about the fundamental arguments for and against such a Bill of Rights and Responsibilities as well as the advantages and disadvantages of the individual components of any such Bill. Full consultation and debate about such a constitutional development will inevitably take some time. It cannot be the property of one Parliament and one Government. All sections of the UK will have a view. As part of the consultation process, we expect that Parliament will want to make a contribution to the debate and we will bring forward proposals for that in due course. The need for such extensive consultation means that, if it were concluded that the time was right for a Bill of Rights and Responsibilities, it would not be possible to bring forward any legislation before the next general election&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0903238000193"></a>If, by some remote chance, the Government were to win the next election, that should be substituted with &#147;before the general election after the next general election&#148;.</p>

<a name="90323-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="0903238000194"></a>Behind this political paralysis lies a forbidding complacency about what has happened to individual rights in our society since the Government came to power, despite their much vaunted Human Rights Act. The undermining of personal privacy was described by the Joseph Rowntree Trust today as,</p>
<ul><a name="0903238000293"></a>&#147;the most invasive surveillance ... of any western democracy&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0903238000229"></a>And it is soon to be amplified and further intensified by a centralised databank on all telephone and e-mail communications together with records of when we all travel abroad.</p>

<a name="90323-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="0903238000195"></a>On the right to a fair trial and trial by jury, paragraph 3.30 states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="0903238000269"></a>&#147;Much of the argument for enshrining a &#145;right&#146; to jury trial into a constitutional document may be driven by the deep cultural attachment to jury trial, originally deriving from its inclusion in Magna Carta. Notably, many other countries, including signatory nations to the European Convention, do not have jury trials even for the most serious cases&#151;jury trial is not necessary for compliance with Article 6 of the Convention. Moreover, the arguments in favour of jury trial in some serious cases are open to debate&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0903238000230"></a>What better example do your Lordships need for establishing the proposition that, for the Government, British history began in 1997? In their attempts effectively to remove the protection of habeas corpus in this country&#151;your Lordships will recall the famous attempt to extend arrest without charge to 90 days&#151;to reduce the circumstances in which individuals are entitled to jury trial and to change the burden of proof from beyond reasonable doubt to a balance of probabilities, the Government have always justified themselves by claiming that these initiatives are consistent with the European convention.</p>

<a name="90323-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="0903238000196"></a>The worrying thing about that assertion is that they probably do conform to the European convention because continental judges who sit in the European Court of Human Rights have no experience of our system of criminal procedure and often little understanding of it.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90323-0006.htm"/>


<a name="90323-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="0903238000197"></a>One might expect the Government to have seen the folly of their ways in this crucial area of rights&#151;heaven knows, they have been reminded to do so often enough by noble Lords throughout this House&#151;and to have taken steps to enshrine these great common law protections in legal form.</p>

<p><a name="0903238000231"></a>But not a bit of it. If we turn to paragraph 3.31, this is what we learn:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a><a name="0903238000270"></a>&#147;Additional protections in relation to liberty of the person or fair trials may not be necessary as the belief in their fundamental nature is already so deeply entrenched, culturally and politically, and there is no fundamental threat to them&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0903238000232"></a>I stop in the middle of the quotation simply to ask: can we really believe that? The Government then go on to say:</p>
<ul><a name="0903238000294"></a>&#147;At this stage, the Government does not propose the inclusion of the principle of habeas corpus or a right to trial by jury in any new Bill of Rights and Responsibilities, but it remains open to all arguments for and against as part of an informed public debate&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0903238000233"></a>Of the paragraphs I have read, I find that quite the most astonishing in the whole document; because nothing is more important to the rule of law and democracy in our society than these common law rights, which have been so severely undermined during the past 12 years.</p>

<a name="90323-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="0903238000198"></a>The Green Paper is entitled <I>Rights and Responsibilities</I>. In a legal sense, of course, as your Lordships&#146; well know, these two are inextricably linked: a right generates an obligation to respect it; equally, an obligation not to do something to someone else gives someone else an implied right. But the Government may well be trying to define responsibilities in some other way; if they are, from my cursory reading, I am not clear what it is. If they are trying to redefine responsibilities in some way outside their strictly legal meaning, then I have reached the preliminary conclusion that they have failed.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_477"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 477</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90323-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="0903238000199"></a>The main reason they have failed is because they have concentrated on the responsibilities of the state and local authorities. In the executive summary at the beginning of the document it states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a><a name="0903238000271"></a>&#147;Now is the time to discuss whether a Bill of Rights and Responsibilities should bring together those rights which have developed in parallel with the European Convention, but are not incorporated into it. A new Bill of Rights and Responsibilities could present the opportunity to bring together in one place a range of welfare and other entitlements currently scattered across the UK&#146;s legal and political landscape&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0903238000234"></a>But what about creating a society with room for individuals to exercise responsibility? What about the role of the family, where the fundamental values of life are imbibed, or at least ought to be? Indeed, one looks in vain in this document, at least in the short time I have had to study it, for any mention of the family as being the most important institution of all for establishing a responsible society.</p>

This Green Paper, in the very short time that I have had to look at it, is exactly about resiling from the Human Rights Act. For example, Article 2 on the right to life and Article 3 on the prohibition against torture are both absolute rights in the European convention. In relation to the prohibition against torture, we still have not had the inquiry that we have been seeking over the past few months about what has gone on in the torture of Guantanamo Bay detainees.</p>

<a name="90323-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="0903238000201"></a>Are these absolute rights to be undermined by making them contingent on responsibilities? That seems to be the thrust of the document. Paragraph 2.25 says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="0903238000272"></a>&#147;It is fundamental to human rights theory that human rights cannot be claimed or exercised by individuals without regard to the rights of others, and that most human rights (with exceptions like freedom from torture and slavery) are inherently subject to balance and qualification&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0903238000202"></a>The paragraph ends:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a><a name="0903238000273"></a>&#147;It would be possible in a future Bill of Rights and Responsibilities to highlight the importance of factors such as an applicant&#146;s own behaviour and the importance of public safety and security&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0903238000235"></a>So when the Government talk about rights and responsibilities, they are really saying that those responsibilities, in the sense of an applicant&#146;s own behaviour, should be taken into account when he is seeking to exercise the rights we currently enjoy in the European convention.</p>

<ul><a name="0903238000295"></a>&#147;deriving from its inclusion in Magna Carta&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="0903238000236"></a>in 1215, as opposed to the fact that every day and in every major Crown Court in this country, jury trials, which have the confidence of the public, are being carried out. Here again we have this Government&#146;s persistent, recurring theme of attacks on trial by jury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="0903238000204"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, also referred to habeas corpus. It is said to be &#147;seldom used&#148;. I drafted a habeas corpus writ about four weeks ago which fortunately did not have to be used. It is a fundamental freedom which we have enjoyed in this country for centuries. The Government say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a><a name="0903238000274"></a>&#147;At this stage, the Government does not propose the inclusion of the principle of habeas corpus or a right to trial by jury in any new Bill of Rights and Responsibilities, but it remains open to all arguments for and against as part of an informed public debate&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0903238000205"></a>We see, therefore, the return of the authoritarian attempt of this Government to cut down our traditional freedoms.</p>

<a name="90323-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="0903238000206"></a>As I have very little time, I move on to welfare rights. One would have thought that if the European convention rights were to be expanded, something would be said about economic, social and cultural rights, which should be guaranteed. Paragraph 3.53, however, states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a><a name="0903238000275"></a>&#147;In drawing up a Bill of Rights and Responsibilities, the Government would not seek to create new and individually enforceable legal rights in addition to the array of legal protections already available&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="0903238000207"></a>in the field of welfare. Do not expect, therefore, this to be a charter for economic, social and cultural welfare rights.</p>

<a name="90323-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="0903238000208"></a>One would have hoped that by now the Government would have considered incorporating the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child into English law instead of constantly saying it is an unincorporated convention which does not have any force. But they say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a><a name="0903238000276"></a>&#147;Any Bill of Rights and Responsibilities should allow for recognition that responsibility for many aspects of child wellbeing is devolved and the different ways in which outcomes are achieved for children across the UK&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0903238000209"></a>There is nothing about incorporating the convention into English law. As to how it is to be enforced, paragraph 4.25 states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a><a name="0903238000277"></a>&#147;The Government does not consider that a generally applicable model of directly legally enforceable rights or responsibilities would be the most appropriate for a future Bill of Rights and Responsibilities&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0903238000210"></a>In other words, you could not take a government department to court for a breach of a British convention on rights and responsibilities that is now being put forward as a pale reflection of the existing rights and responsibilities of the European Convention of Human Rights which British lawyers drew up to emphasise in a war-torn Europe that human rights apply to human beings. That is the important message that we should take away. This is just a muddle; an attempt to palliate the <I>Daily Mail</I> while trying to keep on board those of us who have a fundamental belief in the future and the continuation of human rights in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09032326000002"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, who is normally so fair, says that, by starting a debate on this subject, the Government are somehow showing weakness and not making up their mind. That is rather an unfair criticism. Let us just imagine the scene if I had come here this afternoon and said, &#147;Well, we&#146;re going to introduce a new bill of rights and responsibilities. Here&#146;s what it&#146;s going to say. We&#146;re going to get it through Parliament before the next general election&#148;. The noble Lord would have quite rightly castigated me and the Government harshly for doing something such as that without due consultation, without finding out what people thought, without a draft Bill and without deciding what should and should not be in it. I think that we have been rather unfairly treated this afternoon. This is a Green Paper to start a debate&#151;as it clearly has done&#151;on the merits or otherwise of having a bill of rights and responsibilities in this country. It is a perfectly serious issue that needs serious attention, which I am sure it will be given in due course.</p>

<a name="90323-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09032326000003"></a>The attack on the Government for restricting freedom again seems a little rich, bearing in mind that this is the Government who passed large amounts of equality legislation, devolution legislation, the Freedom of Information Act, the Data Protection Act, the Civil Partnerships Act, the Gender Recognition Act, the Human Rights Act, new proposals for a further equality Bill, a Bill on welfare reform and the <I>NHS Constitution for England</I>. I do not recall any of those measures being put forward by the party that now suggests that it is on the side of freedom and liberty. This legislation has made millions of our citizens free in a way in which they were not previously, which should be recognised.</p>

<a name="90323-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09032326000004"></a>Trial by jury and the right to a fair trial were lauded by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. I remind him that trial by jury is of course deep set in the British way of life, but his party restricted it for a number of offences when it was in power, as have all Governments. No party has for a very long time suggested that trial by jury should be the remedy for every criminal wrong. It should be available for those charged by the state with serious criminal offences. We stand by that, as I know does the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="90323-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09032326000005"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, really could not be more wrong when he claimed that the Green Paper is the death of the Human Rights Act because we are going to make those rights contingent on responsibilities. I know that he has not had long to look at the document, but I refer him to the first page of the executive summary, which states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a><a name="09032326000153"></a>&#147;The Government is clear that the rights in the European Convention cannot be legally contingent on the exercise of responsibilities. However, it may be that responsibilities can be given greater resonance in a way which does not necessarily link them to the adjudication of particular rights&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09032326000006"></a>There is no question of fundamental human rights being diluted or made conditional on fulfilling responsibilities. A criminal may lose his or her right to liberty by going to prison, but nothing could lawfully detract from his or her right to a fair trial or to be free from ill treatment by the authorities. A bill of rights and responsibilities provides an opportunity to set out the relationship between rights and responsibilities

Of course we believe in absolute rights&#151;for example, freedom from being tortured&#151;so I think that the noble Lord&#146;s criticism was unfair, if I may say so, although I concede that he has not had long to read this document. I am disappointed that his response was not slightly more welcoming for what is, in many ways, an opening up of this serious subject, which needs discussion in this House, in another place and around the country.</p>

While paying tribute to the achievement of this Government in securing the enactment of the Human Rights Act, I ask the Minister whether he agrees that it is difficult to promote public enthusiasm and indeed understanding of the Human Rights Act, a measure that simply implements an international convention and does not attempt, as a fundamental constitutional document should, to express its contents in terms specific to the history, the values and the needs of this country. Does he agree that that is the potential that a British bill of rights and responsibilities offers? Does he agree that only such a document can perform the educative function that a constitutional document should perform? Finally, does he agree that, if we are to move to a British bill of rights and responsibilities which is a fundamental constitutional document, which is principled, which commands public support and which speaks to the ages, it is vital for the discussion and the debate to try, so far as is possible, to avoid party-political considerations?</p>

I thank him for his general support for the Green Paper and the ideas behind it. I think that he has a point as far as the introduction of the Human Rights Act is concerned. He wrote an important article in the <I>Times</I> newspaper some months ago in which he made the same point, among others, arguing that the Government may have missed a trick when it introduced that Act in not setting out more clearly and in more detail the values and history behind its principles. I take the point and I hope that, if we got it wrong, we will learn from that experience if there is to be a bill of rights and responsibilities in the future. Of course, one of the values of such a bill would be its educative effect and the way in which it would point out the history and tradition and bring up to date the rights and responsibilities that are crucial to the United Kingdom. There is nothing in what he had to say that I can disagree with and I look forward to his contribution to the debate.</p>

Does not that really expose an enormously difficult problem? If the Government determine that the new rights  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_481"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 481</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>should be enforceable in the courts, will there not be legitimate fears of a flood of litigation? If they decide that the new rights should not be enforceable, how on earth can they guarantee that outcome? Have there not been plenty of examples in the past few years of the courts and the ECHR claiming jurisdiction when the Government thought that they had cast-iron safeguards written into the legislation that they were passing to prevent that from happening?</p>

One issue for debate is that, if there is a bill of rights and responsibilities, what should be the consequence of breaching those requirements of an Act of Parliament? A bill could take a variety of approaches across a spectrum of legal effect. Even if it had a merely declaratory effect, as some bills and Acts around the world do, such an instrument could still have considerable political and symbolic value. The bill of rights and responsibilities could also provide for different legal effect in relation to different rights. Of course, they would have to be set out clearly; some could be enforceable through the courts, whereas others could be expressed as principles that Parliament has passed and that courts could take into account when trying cases. Principles could be intended either to have symbolic resonance or to act as guidance for politicians making the law, administrators applying the law and courts adjudicating the law. There is no need for every single right and responsibility as legislated for in such a bill to be justiciable. It is not necessarily the case. This is one matter that is crucial to the debate, which is really in two parts: should we have such a bill and, if so, what should be in it?</p>

I eventually resigned in November because I became convinced that the Government would not propose anything that I thought was sensible in terms of constitutional reform. He will be aware that I saw no reason to have two documents, one called the Human Rights Act and another called a bill of rights and responsibilities, the latter not proposing any new enforceable rights or even adding new responsibilities. Today, we have heard the Minister seeking to justify what is now in this document. I must disappoint him by saying that nothing that I have seen and heard about it makes me think that I was wrong to leave my post.</p>

I shall certainly not detain the House with a further explanation of why I think that the poet Horace might have said something about the mountains labouring and producing something not very satisfactory. First, why does not the Green Paper deal with the real, practical problem created by the YL decision, which means that private bodies exercising public functions are outside the scope of the Human Rights Act? Why does not the Green Paper or any other measure propose to fill that gaping hole in the Human Rights Act as it stands? Secondly, building on a question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, I wonder why the Green Paper does not address the question of the language in which the   


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_482"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 482</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Human Rights Act is expressed. Does the Minister accept that we are the only country in the world for which the first question is the very odd, &#147;Is this compatible with a convention right?&#148;, whereas for the rest of the world the first question&#151;apart from &#147;Is it right?&#148;&#151;would be, &#147;Is this compatible with our bill of rights&#148;? If the Government wished to persuade the public to feel warmly about human rights, would it not have been more sensible to produce what we hoped that they would&#151;a bill of rights and freedoms that did not detract from the convention but added those few extra rights that are lacking in what we now have? Why was that strategy of building on the convention and the Human Rights Act as I have described not even mentioned in this document or, as far as I know, in any other?</p>

I put on the record the fact that we regret that he felt the need to resign when he did. However, I am disappointed that he is not in some ways enthusiastic about this Green Paper emerging to start a national debate on moving the whole human rights debate forward. I would have thought that he, of all people, would in many ways like to see the possible addition of other rights related to the social and economic changes that have taken place since the post-war convention was negotiated and signed. The Green Paper does not deal with all the issues that he raises because, frankly, it tries to look forward and ask whether it is in this nation&#146;s interests to have a bill of rights and responsibilities. It poses some of the issues that need to be considered if such a course is taken.</p>

The noble Lord mentioned the family; it is, in fact, mentioned in paragraph 2.33, but very briefly. In our society, beyond the family or other groups, we now have whole communities with particular ethnic traditions and backgrounds. How we allow them an opportunity to flourish and to continue their traditions within the framework of British values is, it seems to me, part of the key discussion that needs to take place. Let me choose the issue of education as an example. A constant sniping at faith-based education tends to occur in our society. There must be a way of enshrining a right to education, coloured by the traditions of particular communities, which nevertheless respects the fundamental values of our society. In the consultation that is about to take place, may I urge that a particular effort is made to consult the new communities and ethnic traditions that are part of our society? The success of this operation will largely depend not on a binary dynamic of the state and the individual but on that whole area of society in between, which Governments cannot control and which transcends individuals.</p>

We of course want this discussion and debate to go much wider than the political classes. We want it to involve all of society. One difficulty is in getting people interested in a debate such as this, which is why I hope that there will be a programme later this year to take these ideas out into communities. That will of course include ethnic minority communities and have an emphasis on families. One argument for the proposed bill is that it may be desirable to have in one place, although they may not necessarily be suitable as legally enforceable duties, the key responsibilities that we all owe as members of society, one of which might be safeguarding and promoting the well-being of children in our care. That issue really affects everyone, as the right reverend Prelate was saying. Therefore, his comments will be taken very much on board.</p>

It reminds me of the student who knew he was going to have trouble doing his homework so he got his strike in first. Both these parties have&#151;if I may use an inelegant legal term&#151;form. Both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats supported the Prevention of Terrorism Act with its internal exile, and the Conservatives supported a ban on Gerry Adams being broadcast on the BBC. They also supported certain aspects of locking people up without trial in Northern Ireland, as indeed did my own party at times. It shows the delicacy of the relationship between society and government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="09032326000017"></a>I have two brief points for the Minister. First, I very much welcome the rights and responsibilities argument. However, does he not accept that the responsibility bit has to be at least in part about education, because it is difficult to legislate for that? The other point we need to remember in this debate is that technological change has a dramatic effect on society. The data collection methods available to us now are a very important part not only of the protection of society but of the need to enhance the rights of individuals. Perhaps we have not given enough attention to the principles underlying the complexity of data and the scientific methods of collecting them as we should have done. As a result of this change, society is fundamentally different from what it was even 50 years ago, never mind 100 years ago.</p>

One of the reasons we have raised the issue now is that British society has changed so hugely over recent years, not least in the field of technology. As for responsibilities, education of course plays a crucial and vital part in those. We hope that regardless of what view is ultimately taken on whether or not to have a Bill, the effect of the debate will be to bring out more into the public domain the issue of the responsibility that we all owe each other and the responsibility that the state owes the citizen.</p>

If one looks at the views expressed by juridicial constitutional writers over the past century, one finds such a huge range of views expressed that one could well say that it was a muddled situation. I have not read the Green Paper but it seems to me that it refers to both the treasury of possibilities that exist and the thicket of problems that are clearly attached to almost every consideration. Perhaps I may therefore ask the Minister the following. Even though it is sensible and inevitable that there should be no legislation before the next election, will he consider publishing even before the next election a White Paper&#151;not a paper of pristine whiteness; a paper possibly with green edges&#151;that sets forth some leadership on the part of the Government on this crucial, central question which is the heart and kernel of it all, as to whether the rights and responsibilities that we are talking about should be of a declaratory nature or whether they should have the binding force of legislation.</p>

<a name="09032326000025"></a><b><a name="90323-0007.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09032326000450"></a>Lord Tope:</b> My Lords, I shall speak also to the other 44 amendments in this group that are in my name and the name of my noble friend Lady Hamwee. Mention of 45 amendments in one group seems sufficient to clear the Chamber. I reassure noble Lords that 40 of these amendments say exactly the same thing and relate to the name of the proposed body.</p>

<a name="90323-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09032326000026"></a>The Bill refers to the Boundary Committee for England, but 40 of these amendments change its name to the Local Government Boundary Commission for England. These amendments are supported by the Electoral Commission, and the change that they would make makes sense. The capacity for confusion between the present Boundary Commission and the Boundary Committee for England is obvious, and that confusion must recur again and again. The only explanation I have heard offered for choosing this name was that it was the most minor change possible. Generally it seems preferable to make as little change as possible. It does not seem sensible to seek to cause the greatest confusion possible.</p>

<a name="90323-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09032326000027"></a>Although the proposed name of the Local Government Boundary Commission for England is a little longer, it has the great merit of actually describing what it is and what it does. Giving a body a clearly descriptive title is obviously desirable. It would also bring it into line with the Local Government Boundary Commission for Wales and the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland. To have a similarly named body for England also seems sensible.</p>

<a name="90323-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09032326000028"></a>I hope that I shall achieve some success today in getting the Government to accept 40 amendments from me. At that point I may well decide to quit. I see that that is very tempting to the government Front Bench. I did not mean it.</p>

<a name="90323-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09032326000029"></a>Amendment 106 refers to the appointment of the chairman of the committee&#151;or the commission, as I hope it will be&#151;being made on the recommendation of the Secretary of State. The Electoral Commission has some concern, which I share, about the continuing part to be played by the Secretary of State. That does not mean that there are doubts about any individual, past, present or future. However, it is important that these matters are not only done impartially but seen to be done impartially. We therefore propose that the appointment should be made on the recommendation of the House of Commons rather than the say-so of the Secretary of State. It may seem like a small change, but it is an important one to ensure that absolute impartiality is seen and is beyond question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09032326000030"></a>Amendments 107 and 108 relate to the appointment of the deputy chair. The post is important, and should the chairman be unavailable or cease to be able to hold that office, the role of the deputy chair will clearly be as important as that of the chair. We therefore propose that the same appointments process and procedure should take place for the deputy chair as for the chair.</p>

<a name="90323-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09032326000031"></a>The effect of Amendments 142 and 143 is that there should be no transitional arrangements. The Electoral Commission and the Boundary Committee are very concerned indeed that if there is a gradual process of separation, the period of uncertainty for their staff and others will be all the greater. They state very clearly that they see no need for this period and that the transfer should take place cleanly on the specified date.</p>

<a name="90323-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09032326000032"></a>All of the amendments are sensible and I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s acceptance. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_123"></a>
<a name="09032326000033"></a><b><a name="90323-0007.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09032326000451"></a>Lord Patel of Bradford:</b> My Lords, I must admit that the noble Lord&#146;s earlier offer nearly made me jump to my feet, and it is a shame that he withdrew it. </p>

<a name="90323-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="09032326000034"></a>Let me first address the amendments in relation to the name of the new body. When introducing these provisions we sought where possible to minimise change, as the noble Lord, Lord Tope, said. As a result, we were of the view that the existing name should be retained. There is of course an argument that changing the name of the Boundary Committee will in itself cause confusion. However, I recognise that retaining the name of the Boundary Committee for England could also result in continuing confusion with the Parliamentary Boundary Commission for England, which deals with parliamentary constituencies and is commonly known as the Boundary Commission. There have been occasions in the past where those in Parliament and members of the public have been confused about the separate roles of these two bodies.</p>

<a name="90323-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09032326000035"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tope, and the Electoral Commission have put forward the name Local Government Boundary Commission for England, which is of course in line with the names of the Local Government Boundary Commission for Wales and for Scotland. I assure the noble Lord that we will give full consideration to whether the proposed name is appropriate. On a technical point which I should draw to the House&#146;s attention, despite the noble Lord&#146;s best endeavours, the amendments as they stand remove references to the existing Boundary Committee, which would need to be retained. We would also need to ensure that all references to the Boundary Committee are captured if we agree that a name change should be made. I hope the commitment that we will give further consideration to the proposed name change provides the noble Lord with the assurances he requires to withdraw his amendment at this stage.</p>

<a name="90323-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09032326000036"></a>I should now like to address the amendments to Schedule 1, which relate to appointments to the new body. First, in relation to Amendment 106, I set out in Grand Committee why we believe that the Secretary of State should be responsible for recommendations to Her Majesty on the appointment of ordinary members of the new Boundary Committee. The Secretary of State&#146;s role in making appointments to such bodies is  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_487"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 487</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>well precedented and is, in our view, wholly appropriate in this instance. I gave clear assurances during the debate in Committee that the appointments process will ensure that impartiality and independence are maintained. The Secretary of State would of course adhere to the guidance of the Public Appointments Commissioner.</p>

<a name="90323-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09032326000037"></a>As I set out in Committee, there will be oversight and audit of the process by the Public Appointments Commissioner; recommendations for appointment will be based on recommendations from a panel of officials, including an independent person; and a process of advertisement and executive search will be followed. In addition, by providing the Secretary of State with a role, knowledge of the local government sector will be brought into the appointments process.</p>

<a name="90323-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09032326000038"></a>The Electoral Commission has stated that these assurances have allayed its fears about the appointments process for ordinary members. I hope, therefore, that the noble Lord&#146;s fears can also be allayed and that he will withdraw Amendment 106.</p>
<a name="time_20"></a>
<a name="90323-0007.htm_time1"></a><h5><a name="09032326000179"></a>5.30 pm</h5>

<a name="90323-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09032326000039"></a>For the same reasons, it is not necessary for the deputy chair to be appointed following an address from the House of Commons. I set out in Committee that it is essential that appointments to the new Boundary Committee are, and are perceived to be, politically impartial, independent and unambiguously made on merit. This clearly applies to the post of deputy chair. Paragraph 3 of Schedule 1 provides for the Secretary of State to designate one member of the Boundary Committee for England to be the deputy chair. The deputy chair must therefore be an ordinary member and will have been appointed by the process that I have just set out.</p>

<a name="90323-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09032326000040"></a>On that basis, I have been able to address the concerns of the Electoral Commission, initially in relation to the appointment of ordinary members. I see no good reason to remove the Secretary of State&#146;s role in designating a member of the Boundary Committee to be a deputy chair. Indeed, as I indicated in Committee, we see nothing objectionable in the chair of the new body being appointed by the Secretary of State, so we see no good reason for her not to be responsible for deciding which of the members that she has recommended will be appointed deputy chair of the Boundary Committee.</p>

<a name="90323-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09032326000041"></a>An appointments process that involves the Secretary of State is at least as likely to deliver our aims of appointments being politically impartial, independent and made on merit as a process involving votes in another place. The Electoral Commission has stated that the Speaker&#146;s Committee should be responsible for the recruitment of the deputy chair. The Speaker&#146;s Committee gave its broad support to the Bill following its introduction. However, it is meeting today to consider its provisions in more detail. This will include what, if any, role it should have in the appointment process.</p>

<a name="90323-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09032326000042"></a>The Government will of course take into consideration the views of the Speaker&#146;s Committee, particularly in those areas where the Bill provides it with a role. However, until the views of the Speaker&#146;s Committee  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_488"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 488</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are known, we should not table amendments to provide it with a role that it may believe is unnecessary. Thus, I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

<a name="90323-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09032326000043"></a>Finally, the noble Lord sought clarification on the transitional provisions, which are set out in Clause 60 and Schedule 3 to the Bill. These transitional provisions relate only to the process by which the Boundary Committee&#146;s final recommendations become electoral change orders. For example, the Boundary Committee will remain the statutory committee of the Electoral Commission and its staff will continue to be Electoral Commission employees until the new body is established.</p>

<a name="90323-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09032326000044"></a>I will expand on the explanation that I gave in Committee. Clause 60 and Schedule 3 make transitional provision for the existing Boundary Committee to exercise its function in relation to electoral boundary work, without the involvement of the Electoral Commission, prior to the establishment of the new Boundary Committee for England. Schedule 3 provides for a transitional period, starting on the day that the Act is passed and ending with the establishment of the new Boundary Committee for England, which we expect to happen on 1 April 2010. During the transitional period, the procedure for implementing recommendations made by the existing Boundary Committee for England is modified so that it does not require the involvement of the Electoral Commission. This ensures that the Electoral Commission ceases to play a role in electoral boundary matters at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<a name="90323-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09032326000045"></a>As I set out in Committee, the key recommendation of the Committee on Standards in Public Life was that the Electoral Commission should concentrate on its core functions, hence the removal of its role from electoral boundary work. The Electoral Commission has stated that the process currently envisaged would involve a gradual separation, resulting, as the noble Lord said, in increased uncertainty for both staff and stakeholders. The provisions in Schedule 3 are clear. They remove the Electoral Commission&#146;s role and replace it with the new parliamentary procedure. This will involve work for the Boundary Committee in preparing for the new procedure, but I cannot agree that there will be uncertainty about what the procedure is.</p>

<a name="90323-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09032326000046"></a>The Electoral Commission has provided us with an indication of the recommendations that it expects to receive from the Boundary Committee in the next 12 months. It has informed us that, based on the latest plans, it expects the committee to make final recommendations in the electoral reviews of Cornwall in September, Northumberland in February, and Durham in March. Both the Electoral Commission and the Boundary Committee argue that, since they do not expect to make any orders in this period, there is no need for this transitional provision. Clearly, that argument can be turned on its head. If they do not expect to make any orders, why do the transitional arrangements present any difficulty? Indeed, the transitional arrangements in the Bill provide clarity so that electoral change orders can continue to be made in accordance with the new procedures, if and when they are approved by Parliament. We are yet to be convinced that we should, in effect, introduce an artificial moratorium period where electoral change orders cannot be made. That is the key issue.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_489"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 489</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90323-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09032326000047"></a>Were the transitional arrangements not in place, Parliament would have legislated for a new procedure that removed the role of the Electoral Commission, yet the commission would continue to be able to make its orders. It is clearly a matter for the Electoral Commission to decide if and when it chooses to make electoral change orders until such time as a new process is put in place. We continue to believe that it is right that, if and when Parliament approves the Bill, the new more accountable system should come into effect straight away. This will give greater clarity and confidence to local councils.</p>

<a name="90323-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09032326000048"></a>We are grateful to the Electoral Commission for providing information on the level of work that is expected in this period. We also note the Electoral Commission and Boundary Committee&#146;s concerns. However, to date, we have seen no compelling arguments for why the transitional arrangements that we have proposed would cause the Electoral Commission or the Boundary Committee any particular difficulties. Of course, they will have to develop new working practices to enable them to deal with Parliament instead of the commission, but these are not insurmountable. Indeed, given the small number of ongoing electoral reviews, they will be making the transition at a low point in their work programme. Having said that, we will continue to discuss all of these matters with the commission and the committee, but I hope the House will agree that, at this stage, Clause 60 and Schedule 3 should stand part of the Bill.</p>

On the question of the name and the 40 amendments that apply to it, I understood the Minister at least to express sympathy with the point that is being made and to give an undertaking to look at it. Of course I understand that the Government must be sure that, if it is to be done, it is done properly and in all the right places. I hope very much that they are able to do that in time for Third Reading so that when the Bill leaves this House we have at least achieved a name change here, and do not have to go through the same process all over again in another place. I am grateful for that.</p>

<a name="90323-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09032326000050"></a>I am also grateful for the explanation on the other points that I raised. They were points of concern raised by the Electoral Commission itself. As the Bill progresses, I am sure that discussions between the department and the Electoral Commission will continue. I hope that these concerns can either be allayed or met during the passage of the Bill. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Quite why this should ever have seemed like a suitable idea is unclear. In Grand Committee my noble friend Lord Hanningfield made it clear that he would be totally against the Secretary of State directing these assessments, because they should be conducted to assess the economic needs of the local authority, not the needs of the Secretary of State, which might be very different. I am pleased that the noble Baroness has taken our advice that these powers are not necessary and I welcome their removal from the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

They follow those moved in Grand Committee, to which my noble friend Lord Greaves and the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, spoke quite forcefully about the position of non-unitary districts. We think that having a duty to undertake an economic assessment is unnecessary, like much of this Bill, but we were told that,</p>
<ul><a name="09032326000172"></a>&#147;Such a duty would help local authorities and their partners to work more effectively, supported by a comprehensive and robust economic evidence base&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 9/2/09; col. GC 255.]</ul>
<p><a name="09032326000148"></a>It was confirmed that the powers are within local authorities&#146; current powers but that,</p>

<p><a name="09032326000149"></a>We were also told that there are clear advantages in having one body in the lead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09032326000055"></a>As I said, the two noble Lords spoke forcefully about the role of the districts. I shall not seek to repeat at any length their description of the diversity of districts within quite close areas, the districts often being the authorities with which the public identify. Therefore, it seems to us that a district should be able, if it wishes, to take advantage of the benefits that we are told this clause will bring. Some economic policies and plans will be very local, and I stress the voluntary nature of my amendment, giving districts the option to buy into the arrangements.</p>

<a name="90323-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09032326000056"></a>The Government&#146;s response at the previous stage and the provision smack of an agenda for bigger unitary authorities. As we have said before, there may be things to commend a unitary system across the country but we should debate that on an open and clear basis. We on these Benches find this quite difficult, coming at it all somewhat crabwise.</p>

<a name="90323-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09032326000057"></a>Amendment 151 is consequential on the first amendment. We have tabled Amendments 152 and 153 because Clause 65(6)(b) seems to us very narrow. It states that the county must have regard to the material produced under Section 13 of the 2004 Act. As we have lost so much of our debating time this afternoon, I shall not find the flag and read Section 13. The reference to the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 reminds us of the importance of the link between economic generation and planning for an area. Of course, the district is still responsible for much planning by way of the local development framework and development control. The Bill provides  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_492"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 492</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for other considerations prescribed or directed by the Secretary of State, and there may be other very relevant material. That is why our Amendment 153 inserts the words &#147;or otherwise&#148;.</p>

<a name="90323-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09032326000058"></a>Rather than co-operation going only one way, with the district co-operating with the county, I propose in Amendment 154 that both district and county should co-operate with each other. Amendment 155 would allow for an assessment made before the commencement of the section to fulfil the duty that the section will impose. The world did not start this year and will not start when the Bill is enacted and the relevant clause comes into force. It seems very unnecessary for local authorities to have to repeat what they have already done when they can simply point to work which many of them are doing at the moment in assessing the economic condition of their own areas. In our view, having carried out the work, the duty should have been fulfilled.</p>

I shall address Amendments 145 and 146 first. The Minister has put her name to the amendments, as the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, said.</p>

<a name="90323-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09032326000060"></a>We have listened carefully to noble Lords&#146; concerns that a Secretary of State power to direct an individual local authority to revise its assessment would give the Secretary of State undue control over how the assessments are taken forward. The power of direction was only ever intended as a safeguard and, as we are confident that local authorities will wish to keep their assessments up to date, we are very keen to keep government prescription to a minimum. For that reason, we are happy to support these amendments.</p>

<a name="90323-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09032326000061"></a>Amendment 147, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and the noble Lord, Lord Tope, would allow a non-unitary district council to elect to be placed under the duty, so that in two-tier areas both the county council and district council would be under a duty to prepare an assessment for their respective areas. Amendment 151 is a consequential amendment.</p>

<a name="90323-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09032326000062"></a>I understand the fear expressed by noble Lords that district councils would have a peripheral role in the preparation of local economic assessments in two-tier areas and that countywide assessments would fail to take account of the important contribution that district councils make to wider economic development. I assure noble Lords that we do not underestimate the vital role that districts play in supporting local economic development and regeneration. Indeed, we fully intend county councils and district councils to work in partnership in preparing their economic assessments.</p>

<a name="90323-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09032326000063"></a>The Bill, in Clause 65(6), already requires the county and district councils to work in partnership in the preparation of the countywide economic assessment. It includes a requirement on the county council to consult and seek the participation of district councils within its area and to take account of the evidence gathered by the district council in the course of its role as planning authority that may affect the development of the area. It also includes a requirement on the  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_493"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 493</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>district council to co-operate with the county. We do not believe that the amendment would further strengthen partnership working between the county and districts.</p>

<a name="90323-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09032326000064"></a>The amendment would place a separate duty on the county council and the district to prepare an assessment. As noble Lords are aware, local authorities have general powers to discharge their functions jointly. Thus, the county council and district councils electing to be bound by this duty could decide to prepare a joint county assessment. Although, in the best case, districts and counties might choose to exercise their duties jointly, nothing in the amended provisions would require them to do so. Therefore, we cannot discount the possibility that a district council would want to produce its own assessment rather than work with the county. In such a scenario, the district&#146;s assessment would have the same statutory status as the countywide assessment, which could lead to unnecessary duplication of effort. It could also mean that regional partners would be presented with two potentially conflicting assessments for the same area in preparing the regional strategy. Furthermore, if a district council was to go it alone, Amendment 151 would result in there being no requirement for the county to consult it and seek its participation in preparing the countywide assessment.</p>

<a name="90323-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09032326000065"></a>As I explained in Committee, we believe that it is important that assessments should reflect the local economic geography as much as possible. We do not dispute that district councils have a key role to play in economic development and regeneration. However, economic linkages or economies do not stop at district council boundaries; the solutions to local economic problems can often lie in the wider economy. For example, skills shortages and shortcomings in connectivity often require a county or sub-regional response. Counties provide a better match for real economic markets and are better placed to build a broad strategic understanding of the drivers of the wider economic area. For these reasons, we believe that it is better to prepare the assessment at a county level.</p>

<a name="90323-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09032326000066"></a>Therefore, we believe that the best way to take forward local economic assessments is to place the duty on county councils but with a clear requirement for the county to work with the districts. Counties are particularly well placed to lead on economic assessments, as they have a strategic overview of the economic, social and environmental well-being of the county as a whole. They are already the responsible authority for preparing the local area agreement in two-tier areas and they tend to be better resourced for this type of work than district councils. We consider that the Bill, as drafted, requires both the county and district councils to work in partnership in preparing the local economic assessments and that it provides district councils with a specific role in recognition of their important contribution to the assessment. Such an approach is simple and transparent, provides clear lines of accountability and will, it is hoped, lead to high-quality, consistent assessments. We believe that it strikes the right balance between ensuring that district councils are fully involved and the need to have clear lines of accountability. I hope that I have addressed the noble Baroness&#146;s concerns and that she will understand why I think that the amendment is not necessary.</p>

<a name="90323-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09032326000067"></a>Amendments 152 and 153, also tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and the noble Lord, Lord Tope, would require a county council to have regard to any material produced by a district council, regardless of whether it relates to the district&#146;s planning functions. Amendment 154 would require the county council and district council to co-operate with each other. The Bill makes specific mention of material held by the district council in the discharge of the district council&#146;s functions under Section 13 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, because the local economic assessment is expected to inform the preparation of local development frameworks. In view of this, it is important that there is consistency between the evidence assembled at a district council level in preparation of the local development framework and the evidence gathered for the local economic assessment duty. We should also not lose sight of the fact that the material collated under Section 13 is wide-ranging and is not restricted to economic data, as I think the noble Baroness mentioned. Section 13 requires local planning authorities to keep under review any matters that may affect the development of their area. This would include, among other things, principal physical, economic, social and environmental characteristics of the area.</p>

<a name="90323-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09032326000068"></a>Many district council functions relate to economic development and regeneration. Both district councils and counties contribute in different ways in supporting economic development, often working in partnership. For instance, both tiers work together alongside other partners in tackling skills challenges. There is a range of evidence that local authorities can draw from in developing local economic assessments, some of which is held by districts, some by counties and some elsewhere. Local authorities should also, where appropriate, draw on the evidence assembled in developing other key strategies such as local housing strategies, which are assembled by districts, and local transport plans, which are assembled by counties, in putting together their economic assessments. It is important, therefore, that county and districts work together with other partners in agreeing the range of evidence needed to assemble the local economic assessment, aggregating it and disaggregating it where necessary so that it both informs local priorities and gives a broad strategic picture that can properly inform the regional strategy. Our intention is to address these issues clearly in future guidance. We do not, therefore, believe that there should be an open-ended requirement on the county council to have regard to any material that the district council decides to provide. However, there needs to be a genuine dialogue between the county and districts. We believe that the Bill as drafted will help to achieve that.</p>

<a name="90323-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09032326000069"></a>Amendment 154 would place a requirement on both the county council and district council to co-operate with each other in the preparation of a local economic assessment. We do not believe that this amendment is necessary because, as I have explained, the Bill already includes a requirement on the county council to consult and seek the participation of district councils and the district councils to co-operate with the county councils. It is implicit within such a requirement that the county council should work closely and co-operate with district councils within its area. I can assure noble Lords that we will emphasise the need for co-operation in guidance.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_495"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 495</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09032326000070"></a>Amendment 155, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, would provide for an assessment prepared prior to these provisions coming into force to be able to fulfil a local authority&#146;s statutory duties in relation to Part 4 of the Bill. Noble Lords are understandably keen to ensure that existing work done by local authorities in developing an economic evidence base is not lost. We completely agree that local authorities should, wherever possible, build on existing work in preparing their new assessment. The important point is that the assessments be fit for purpose and give an accurate and up-to-date assessment of local economic conditions. As the policy statement on local economic assessments, which was placed on the Communities and Local Government website in January, makes clear, a local authority that has already carried out an assessment will need to consider it in the context of the new duty and any government guidance. While such local authorities may need to make some changes and will certainly need to ensure that they meet their new statutory obligation to consult, we do not intend that the work that they have already done should go to waste. I hope that noble Lords will, therefore, understand why we believe that these amendments are not necessary.</p>

I return to the simple point: we agree with the principle of conducting assessments. We agree that when a local authority is conducting an economic assessment of its area it is right that relevant bodies and persons should be consulted. Where we disagree is on the need to spell out in such great detail which those partner bodies must be. This has been a recurring theme throughout the Bill. The Government have gone into prescriptive overdrive and at every stage we have suggested a more flexible approach. This is another such situation. Our amendments would leave in the duty to consult but leave it up to the local authority to choose who the consultees will be.</p>

<a name="90323-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09032326000072"></a>One of the concerns that I have with putting lists into the Bill is that it may encourage a tick-box mentality, whereby a local authority may simply go through the list in the Bill but may not go any further. By placing the onus on local authorities, we will encourage them to consider every possible body that they should consult. We would therefore free up local authorities and allow  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_496"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 496</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>them to think creatively when consulting, rather than adopting a mechanical approach and thinking, &#147;We&#146;ve have done our bit&#148;. The list of partner authorities in Clause 66 is no doubt exhaustive and complete, or so the Government suggest, but that list may change. The Secretary of State may have to keep laying down orders to update the list to keep it exhaustive and complete. I suggest to the Minister that this Bill could be improved with the removal of Clause 66. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_134"></a>

Amendment 149 is a consequential amendment, while Amendment 157 would remove Clause 66, which lists those partner authorities.</p>

<a name="90323-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09032326000074"></a>We discussed these provisions at some length in Committee. We explained that we have included these provisions in the Bill because we believe that there are partners that local authorities should be required to consult in carrying out their assessments. The authorities that are listed are already working closely with local authorities in local strategic partnerships. We believe that it is important that these partners should be given the opportunity to engage with the principal local authorities in assessing the economic conditions of the area. The list of partner authorities takes as its starting point the list of partner authorities which are set out in Part 5 of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 for the purpose of agreeing local area agreements and which responsible authorities must consult when developing their sustainable community strategies.</p>

<a name="90323-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09032326000075"></a>We have taken this approach because local economic assessments are expected to form part of the evidence base for the sustainable community strategy and for the local area agreement negotiations. All the partners listed have a duty to co-operate with local authorities in determining local area agreement targets and must have regard to these targets in the exercise of their functions. In view of this, we believe that it is only fair that these partner authorities should have an opportunity to contribute to the local economic assessment. Involving these partners at an early stage in identifying the economic strengths and weaknesses of the local economy will help to strengthen the impact and effectiveness of targets agreed through local area agreements further down the line. Also, we should not lose sight of the fact that local economic assessments will inform the preparation of the regional strategy. It is important that the regional strategy should be informed by the best possible advice and knowledge. Many of the partner authorities listed in Clause 66 will play an important part in that process as well.</p>

<a name="90323-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09032326000076"></a>However, as I explained, our intention has been to ensure that local authorities at the very least consult those public bodies that are working closely with local authorities in determining local area agreement targets and delivering them. We are keen to keep prescription to a minimum and to allow space for local flexibility. In Committee, we heard the arguments put forward by the noble Baroness and the noble Lord against the

Your Lordships debated this matter last week. It concerns retrospective non-domestic rating of ports. We had an excellent debate. I expressed my extreme concerns regarding the current situation. The noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, gave a very careful and detailed explanation of the problem and why the Government believe that nothing more can be done to improve the situation.

The concern expressed was the difficulty in which individual companies are being left because lenders are taking the view that they are either insolvent or in such a precarious position that one must not lend to them. In saying that, I am not in any way trying to diminish the seriousness of the position and the problems faced by some companies. We own a large part of the banks so we should always use opportunities to persuade them to act in a civilised manner. That is a specific point which the Government could take up.</p>

I am happy to reiterate our concern today, without going into any detail, about the predicament of some businesses faced with unexpectedly large backdated bills. I went into some detail about the history of that and why it was such an unfortunate occurrence, coinciding with the downturn and so on.</p>

<a name="90323-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09032326000083"></a>I recognise the anxiety in the House and I recognise that the non-fatal Motion was lost by the Government. I put the same Statement into <I>Hansard</I> today, recognising and respecting the response of the House but reiterating, as I said in the debate, that we had gone as far as we could within the limits of the law because we could not waive tax liability&#151;no Minister could. I am grateful to the noble Earl for not rehearsing that today. Facts concerning tax liabilities that are now known cannot simply be disregarded, as he will understand, and of course port occupiers are not alone in having backdated liabilities as a result of ensuring that the ratings list is accurate and up-to-date.</p>

<a name="90323-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09032326000084"></a>We know that some businesses may struggle with significant and unexpected bills for more than 33 months from 1 April 2005 and that is why we have come forward with the new regulations which give businesses more time to pay those liabilities in certain circumstances. Under those regulations, businesses facing such bills will not be required to pay their backdated liability within the current financial year. Instead, the new legislation will give qualifying businesses the facility to pay their back-dated liability for previous years in equal interest-free instalments over eight years. As I told the House last week, that is absolutely unprecedented and it has been welcomed. We think it will help about 1,500 properties a year across England, within and outside ports, and will give help with cash flow problems faced by some companies.</p>

<a name="90323-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09032326000085"></a>On the specific question posed by the noble Earl, my advice is that bills can be sent out any time now. Local authorities will have to issue demands and bills now because there is no reason not to bill and payment of bills is due 14 days from the issue of the due bill. The schedule of payments, as agreed with the local authorities, would be eight equal instalments, if a company falls into that situation. That is what will happen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09032326000086"></a>The point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, is pertinent. I was happy to put on the record the situation about insolvency, as it is important information,  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_499"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 499</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>so that people would not feel that immediately they receive those bills on their balance sheets they will be bound to be declared insolvent. The point made by the noble Baroness about making it clear to the banks and to the lenders that that is the position is very important. I said in the debate that we would look for ways to ensure that that information was held by local authorities and that we will seek to put it on websites and so on. Bearing in mind what she said, let me think about how we can ensure that that information goes to the lenders as well. The debate on the issue has raised considerable public interest and a letter sent from both Stephen Timms and John Healey to the Treasury Select Committee received a fair degree of publicity. Nevertheless, we should ensure that we make as much of it is possible.</p>

<a name="90323-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09032326000087"></a>I must address the amendment before us. Obviously we do not think that the specific amendment in this context would be appropriate. We do not agree that matters that should be addressed in local economic assessments should be placed on the face of the Bill because it is up to local areas to determine what is relevant in terms of their economic assessment and how it is best deployed. It would also unnecessarily constrain local authorities and make it more difficult to respond to changing economic priorities. Local authorities should be free to determine what to include in their assessments, taking account of local priorities.</p>

<a name="90323-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09032326000088"></a>I am grateful for the opportunity to reaffirm what I said and to add further information about port businesses that are affected by the situation described on Wednesday in the debate on the Motion.</p>

I do think that we are heading for disaster, but it is helpful that the Minister has told the House that rate demands will be issued probably in the next two weeks.

I tabled an amendment, framed a little differently, in Grand Committee. It required local authorities to have regard to social and environmental issues alongside economic ones. It provoked the comment from the Government that my amendment would &#147;unnecessarily constrain&#148; local authorities. If the assurances about the importance of all three pillars of well-being&#151;economic, social and environmental&#151;mean anything, I do not understand how my amendment would constrain local authorities. The phrase makes me fear that the assurances are not as I would like to understand them.</p>

<a name="90323-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09032326000092"></a>The Government relied in Grand Committee on guidance that we have yet to see and referred to the policy statement that we have seen. I acknowledge that the policy statement covers wider ground than the narrowly economic. It mentions, for instance&#151;just to show that I have looked at it&#151;the transition to a low-carbon economy and the causes of worklessness. However, that is in a policy statement; it will not be in statute.</p>

I will try to reassure the noble Baroness, who has raised some important points. She mentioned the policy statement and her concerns about ensuring that social and environmental well-being is not left off the agenda. The fact that I am reassuring her in the House will, I hope, add strength to the argument that this amendment is unnecessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09032326000095"></a>Amendment 156 would insert the provision that the duty to prepare an assessment of the economic conditions of an area shall not affect the powers and duties of a principal local authority in relation to the social or environmental well-being of the area. I assure noble Lords that nothing in Clause 65 would have an effect on any local authority&#146;s powers or duties relating to social and environmental well-being. I understand that noble Lords are concerned that the new duty would give too great a prominence to economic issues at the expense of social and environmental matters. However, this is not the case.</p>

<a name="90323-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09032326000096"></a>As the noble Baroness said, we set out in our policy statement that we believe that local economic assessments will contribute to the overall aim of delivering sustainable economic development. A primary function of the economic assessment is to inform the preparation of the sustainable community strategy, which sets out the long-term vision for the economic, social and environmental well-being of an area. The local economic assessment, however, will form only part of the evidence base for the sustainable community strategy. In preparing the strategy, local authorities will need to weigh the  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_501"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 501</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>findings from the local economic assessment alongside all other factors that must be considered, including the need to promote social and environmental well-being.</p>

<a name="90323-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09032326000097"></a>We do not expect economic assessments to be prepared without any reference to wider social and environmental concerns. Some of the main barriers to economic success are social issues such as lack of skills and poor health. Economic conditions in turn may have social consequences. We know that worklessness is often linked to worsening social outcomes such as increased crime. At the same time, it is obvious that economic development has potential environmental consequences, and all areas need to think about how well placed they are for moving towards a low-carbon economy. The noble Baroness was right: we will address all this in government guidance.</p>

<a name="90323-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09032326000098"></a>In determining the long-term vision for the places that they serve, local authorities will need to bring together all the relevant issues in the sustainable community strategy. The economic assessment duty means that local authorities will have a good understanding of local economic circumstances, based on sound evidence. However, it is not the case that this evidence somehow trumps other considerations: it will be for local authorities to bring together all the evidence on economic, environmental and social issues, and balance the different considerations. The economic assessment duty will ensure that local authorities have a good understanding of the economy of the local area. There is no provision for these assessments to change existing local authority powers or duties on social or environmental matters. I hope that these reassurances will enable the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.</p>

However, I did not agree with his conclusion. We have sustainable community strategy duties, so why is it necessary to have the new economic assessment duty? The imbalance worries me. As the Minister said, the three aspects are interwoven. I should like to see something about this in the Bill. I should like to test the opinion of the House.</p>

Amendment 157A would make sure that the Secretary of State is not the ultimate power in all this and does not have the ultimate say. Amendment 157E goes back to the point that I made in Committee, which was that the economic assessments should form the main part of the evidence base for the regional authority in drawing up the regional strategy. For all the glowing comments that we had earlier from the noble Lord, Lord Patel, about the way in which district councils and counties were going to have a great say in the economic assessments, we want to make certain that the assessments are the base of any regional strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09032326000110"></a>As I was saying, it is understandable why the noble Lord has brought back these amendments on the preparation of regional strategies and the relationship of local authority economic assessments to regional strategies. I know that he is concerned that we should demonstrate how much this is an organic and bottom-up process.</p>

<a name="90323-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09032326000111"></a>On Amendment 157A, we debated the notion of the regional strategy being established by the responsible regional authorities in Committee. There will be a touch of d&#233;j  vu, because I raised concerns then which I still hold. The problem with the word &#147;establish&#148; is that, rather than helping the cause of the noble Lord, it adds to the confusion. I will address the issue of who publishes the regional strategy in my response to the next group of amendments, but this amendment simply confuses the nature of what is involved in the process. We have made it clear in Clauses 69 and 70 that the responsible regional authorities would prepare the  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_505"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 505</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>regional strategies. That is quite right because, as the noble Lord says, it is not the Secretary of State&#146;s job to do this; it is very much in the hands of the joint authorities. I am happy to put on the record again that the Bill establishes what I believe will be a genuinely equal partnership between the RDAs and the local authorities with a genuinely collaborative approach in the drafting of strategies to achieve the regional objectives. I am happy to reassure the House again about that.</p>

<a name="90323-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09032326000112"></a>The noble Lord is right that local economic assessments have to be the fundamental bodies of evidence for the regional strategy. Amendment 157E would make it explicit that new integrated regional strategies must take account of local economic assessments. I am sorry to disappoint him but I do not think that it is appropriate to go into that degree of prescription in the Bill. As we said in the policy document that we published alongside the Bill, we expect the local economic assessments to form a key part of the evidence base, which is why we have debated them at such length and put so much emphasis on the quality and consistency of that evidence base. They will inform the preparation of regional strategies.</p>

<a name="90323-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09032326000113"></a>We also said in our policy statement that local economic assessments will form part of the evidence base for the examination in public of the draft regional strategy. That is where they will be challenged and scrutinised by people from many different disciplines and experiences, which is an important iterative part of the process. We have said that we will set out more details about how the assessments should feed into the regional strategy in future guidance, when we will have an opportunity to explore and emphasise their significance and to go into some of the issues that local authorities would find helpful. I hope that that provides sufficient assurance for the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

We are going to discuss this again in the next group of amendments and I am sure that we will be pursuing this theme for a while. We all want to achieve something and make certain that we can build houses in and benefit the economy of our areas. I think that the Government often come from an urban perspective, considering groups of authorities that can easily relate together, such as in London, Manchester, Birmingham or Liverpool. However, most of the country is still divided into counties. Some of them are now unitaries; a lot of them still have districts with small or fairly large towns but not many cities. Getting coherent strategies on building houses and development is very different in those areas from the situation in London or Manchester. I will withdraw the amendment now but we will come back to this issue in the next group.</p>

My Amendment 157B is a Local Government Association amendment as well. Some of these issues were discussed in relation to the 2004 Planning Act, when the Government accepted the will of this House. As I said, it is vital that the planning process for regional strategies should be bottom-up. Otherwise, one is going to get resistance rather than acceptance for building houses. You have the district doing local development frameworks and the counties above that with the highway powers, waste and mineral powers and all the social powers. That is a coherent policy, which is tied to the economic, environmental and social strategies that we talked about in relation to the amendments tabled by the Liberal Democrats. It is important that all this should tie together and then go up to create the regional strategy.</p>

<a name="90323-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09032326000116"></a>The Government suggest that leaders&#146; boards working with the RDAs might be the answer. I fear that it will not be if you really want to achieve success, develop the economy, build houses and provide a satisfying solution, given that, as I have just said, a vast amount of the country is covered by two tiers&#151;it is very rural with a series of large towns in it. I have been involved in this process for a long while. I want to see agreement on the building of houses and development, but it works much better from the bottom up than it does from the top down.</p>

<a name="90323-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09032326000117"></a>The amendment sets out a number of bodies that should be part of creating the regional strategy; it should not be only the leaders&#146; board. Obviously the RDA and the leaders&#146; board will decide ultimately, but the process should be bottom-up, with lots of people participating and being involved; if it is not, it will not work. I think that everyone agrees that the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 has not worked terribly well in giving planning powers to the regional assemblies, otherwise we would not now be giving them to the RDAs; the Government have admitted that by proposing something different two or three years later. The Government should acknowledge that the process should be much more bottom-up and that these various bodies should be consulted and involved in the construction of the regional strategy. I beg to move.</p>

While I take second place to no one in my support for the Government in wanting to get planning streamlined and to be able to get ahead with it and so on, it will not work unless people have been properly consulted. It will run into all kinds of problems if people feel that they have been bypassed.</p>

<a name="90323-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09032326000119"></a>I shall speak to Amendments 160, 164, 165 and 168 and, in doing so, I should remind the House that I am president of the Friends of the Lake District and a vice-president of the Campaign for National Parks. I shall speak for a little longer than noble Lords have been speaking so far today, but that is because I shall be speaking to all four amendments. On aggregate my time will not exceed four minutes per amendment.</p>

<a name="90323-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09032326000120"></a>We all realise that leaders&#146; boards will be very important bodies. They will be responsible for the development and sign-off of the regional strategies. The regional strategy under planning law, once approved, becomes part of the development plan covering the national parks and other areas. Amendment 160 seeks to ensure that each leaders&#146; board has on it representation from each type of authority. There are good reasons for ensuring that all types of authority are represented, but I shall focus on the area that I know best&#151;the national park authorities.</p>

<a name="90323-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09032326000121"></a>The critical question is whether the arrangements will provide adequate representation. There are strong grounds for believing that they will not. The statutory purposes and functions of national park authorities, as set out in Parliament, are unique. Arrangements therefore need to reflect the &#147;national&#148; in national parks. I am well aware of much of the work that the national park authorities are doing to support local communities, as they take it very seriously, but we should not forget that national parks are just that&#151;national&#151;and that local authorities are responsible for their areas and local communities.</p>

<a name="90323-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09032326000122"></a>This significant difference needs to be recognised in the institutional arrangements. It may well be possible for district councils within a region to come together and establish a form of representation, but it would not be possible for local authorities to represent the interests of national parks, because the functions, purposes and audiences are different. Planning is the key to delivering national park purposes, and Parliament has decreed that national park authorities must have spatial planning powers. Indeed, spatial planning is a crucial tool in delivering national park purposes for the nation. The new regional strategies will be pivotal to the region&#151;indeed, they will form part of the development plans of the national parks&#151;and yet if a region wishes to exclude a national park authority from the leaders&#146; board, with the effect that it does not sign off the regional strategy, it is perfectly entitled to do so under this legislation.</p>

<a name="90323-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09032326000123"></a>The new arrangements would weaken the existing approach. The national park authorities are named authorities under Section 4(4) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. For this reason, NPAs have a seat on regional assemblies, which enables them  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_508"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 508</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to engage with regional partners. What is proposed represents a significant weakening of the current arrangements.</p>

<a name="90323-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09032326000124"></a>As we all know, the NPAs are not party political, yet they provide significant benefits for the nation. This means that they need the support of central government to ensure that their needs are met when new regional arrangements are being established, which itself has been a highly political process. Under the Bill as proposed, national park purposes would probably be undermined. If NPAs are not represented on leaders&#146; boards, the interests of national parks are unlikely to be addressed and the delivery of the national park purposes would be undermined. For example, the NPAs take seriously the need for affordable housing for local communities, but under the Bill decisions over housing numbers, locations and other infrastructure, which will have a direct bearing on national parks, could very well undermine or erode the special quality of those parks. The NPAs are at pains to balance both considerations in meeting the social need for housing.</p>

<a name="90323-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09032326000125"></a>NPAs are facing considerable development pressures on their doorsteps and will do so more in future. This demands that national park purposes are always reflected in the decisions that ultimately affect them. Where development policies are accepted as essential for the regional strategy but they erode the national park special qualities, it is necessary to have an informed representative on the leaders&#146; board who can propose counterbalancing or mitigating policies.</p>

<a name="90323-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09032326000126"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, argued, better planning requires less ministerial intervention. Without better planning arrangements, ultimately there will be more ministerial intervention. Ensuring that all parties are involved at an early stage in planning to iron out potential conflicts of policy will help to reduce the need for ministerial intervention. As I understand it, that is exactly what the Government want, but this requires bodies to be involved from the earliest stages.</p>

<a name="90323-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="09032326000127"></a>I was heartened by my noble friend&#146;s comments in Committee when she said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a><a name="09032326000168"></a>&#147;The National Park authorities are participating authorities responsible for drawing up the scheme for the leaders&#146; board. We said in the policy document that they can but do not have to be on the board, but they must be part of the board&#146;s membership and its operation and they would be consulted on the draft strategy and Clause 72(3), to be provided in regulations. Again, I am happy to write to the National Parks Authority, setting that out and ensuring that everyone is clear about that, because it is such a critical partner in this&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 24/2/09; col. GC 63].</p>

<p><a name="09032326000152"></a>Surely if it is my noble friend&#146;s sentiment that they must be part of the board&#146;s membership, that needs to be reflected in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90323-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09032326000128"></a>In 1995, Parliament gave the national park authorities independence under the Environment Act. This was in recognition that an arrangement whereby the national park authority, with national purposes, was effectively a sub-committee of a local authority was not appropriate. However, this Bill, if not amended, could lead to national park authorities having to look to local authorities to represent them; they would lose the independence we entrusted to them.</p>

<a name="90323-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09032326000129"></a>My noble friend may point to the participating authority status which national park authorities are said to enjoy. While this is a fluid process, my  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_509"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 509</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>understanding has generally been that national park authorities have needed to bang on the door to be let into discussions, rather than being invited genuinely to participate. In any case, the participating authority status will mean very little after the Secretary of State has approved the scheme for a leaders&#146; board in each region. It is a temporary status in this respect.</p>

<a name="90323-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09032326000130"></a>The national parks cover many administrative boundaries within a region. This enables them to take a wider perspective, which is helpful in addressing strategic planning issues such as climate change. It also means that it would prove extremely difficult for the interests of the national parks to be adequately represented by the local authorities sitting on the leaders&#146; boards. In addition to ensuring that the interests of national parks are addressed, national park authorities can bring significant beneficial expertise to the table; for example, regarding rural areas and sustainable development. This year is the 60th anniversary of the visionary National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. It would be sad if 2009 marked a weakening of the special role of the parks.</p>

<a name="90323-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="09032326000131"></a>On Amendment 164, the ground covered by this amendment was first discussed in Committee, when it was examined by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and the noble Lord, Lord Tope. This issue has attracted cross-party interest. It is also regarded as important by the CPRE and by the County Councils Network. The Local Government Association has also expressed concerns. My noble friend&#146;s response on day seven of Committee was that NPAs and the boards would be involved by virtue of being named participating authorities. This status means that the NPAs should be involved in agreeing a scheme for leaders&#146; boards. It does not mean, however, that the regional planning board needs to seek the advice of a national park authority in preparing a regional strategy, as is the case now.</p>

<a name="90323-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="09032326000132"></a>My noble friend said in Committee that she would write to the national park authorities on this point. Whatever the correspondence which has or has not taken place, surely it would be better to have the Bill amended rather than to rely on a letter which could all too easily be ignored by future Ministers. At present, regional planning bodies are to take advice from local authorities and national park authorities in preparing regional strategies. This is set out in Section 4(4) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. The Bill would repeal that requirement. Instead the regional planning body would be required to consult national park authorities and local authorities on an already prepared strategy. Why does this matter? National park authorities and local authorities have taken their responsibilities seriously. They are a source of expertise, in the case of NPAs, on issues relating to sustainable development and in particular their application to rural environments. It can help the regional planning body better to understand the implications of different policies and options and to avoid conflicting policies.</p>

<a name="90323-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="09032326000133"></a>The existence of the Section 4(4) duty has led to service-level agreements being adopted between national parks and local authorities. It has helped strengthen working relationships at a regional and sub-regional level. My noble friend will be aware that a duty to take  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_510"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 510</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>advice is very different from a duty to consult. The latter is much weaker. The Government have published the policy document on regional strategies. This document advocates an inclusive approach. The repeal of Section 4(4) would represent a weakening of the current statutory framework. I have been privy to correspondence which my noble friend sent to the director of the English National Parks Authorities Association, Paul Hamlyn, last October. In that letter she says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57"></a><a name="09032326000169"></a>&#147;Finally, with regard to the preparation of the regional spatial strategies, I can confirm that National Park Authorities retain their role under Section 4(4) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09032326000134"></a>The proposal to repeal the entire section seems contrary to that statement.</p>

<a name="90323-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09032326000135"></a>Finally, I suggest that the Government may be worried that what I am arguing is adding to the statute book: it is not. The amendment will simply ensure that existing duties, which Parliament has already approved, are maintained. If my noble friend is still concerned on this point, there is always Amendment 168, which is a simple formulation to achieve the same outcome.</p>

<a name="90323-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09032326000136"></a>On Amendment 165, the Bill includes provisions for a plan for implementing the regional strategy&#151; Clause 77(1). The proposal to strengthen the link between the spatial strategy and decisions over resource allocation is helpful. This lack of linkage has been a problem in the past for regional spatial strategies. The implementation plan will be a key document within the region in setting detailed priorities, public investment decisions and for creating strategic partnerships. The Bill contains no provisions for consultation on the implementation plan. The Government are on record as saying in paragraph 2.37 of <I>Prosperous Places: Taking Forward the Review of Subnational Economic Development Regeneration</I>, published in November 2008:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58"></a><a name="09032326000170"></a>&#147;The Government is committed to stakeholder engagement as a fundamental feature of the processes for developing and&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09032326000137"></a>I underline this&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09032326000171"></a>&#147;delivering the regional strategy and there will be a duty on the RDA and Leaders&#146; Board to consult and engage stakeholders&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90323-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="09032326000138"></a>The Government&#146;s principle is to apply to both developing the strategy and also to its delivery. Delivery is the role of the implementation plan. This amendment is about agreeing the principle on the face of the Bill, not the detail of how it might be done. That principle is too important to be left to guidance which can be changed at the stroke of a Minister&#146;s pen.</p>

<a name="90323-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="09032326000139"></a>Briefly on Amendment 168, this amendment has not been tabled previously in any form. It follows from Amendment 164. It reinforces the point that, instead of new legislation, the aim is simply to ensure that existing duties under the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 remain. The amendment therefore seeks to leave out the provisions in this Bill which would repeal Section 4(4) of the 2004 Act and in so doing reduce the ability of national park authorities and local authorities to engage meaningfully in regional planning at an early stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09032326000141"></a>I gladly put my name to the four amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Judd, and I am glad that two of them are subscribed to by the Liberal Democrats. There is not much more that I need to say. It is difficult to find a hole or gap in the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Judd. He put a comprehensive argument for the amendments. I reiterate the point that national parks are not the same as local authorities&#151;they are national. They are a provision of the 1949 Act. Their interests are national&#151;they represent the nation and not local authorities. It is extremely important that that is recognised at all stages in a Bill whose provisions I find difficult to understand.</p>

<a name="90323-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09032326000142"></a>I will close on the point about national parks. I hope that the Minister will look with favour on what the noble Lord has been saying.</p>

<p><a name="st_160"></a>
<a name="09032326000143"></a><b><a name="90323-0010.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09032326000488"></a>Lord Tope:</b> As the noble Lord, Lord Chorley, has just said, there is little to add to what the noble Lord, Lord Judd, has just said in speaking to Amendments 164 and 165. My noble friend Lady Hamwee has added her name to Amendment 164. If there had been room, I would have added mine as well but we both managed to get our names down in time on Amendment 165. We therefore readily support the amendments. The noble Lord has moved them so well and so fully that there is little that can be usefully added other than again to express our support.</p>

<a name="90323-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09032326000144"></a>Before I move to our amendments, perhaps I may also say that we fully support Amendment 157B, which stands at the head of this group. As the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, said in moving it, it commands wide support, including that of the Local Government Association, and we add to that.</p>

<a name="90323-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09032326000145"></a>Amendment 160A stands in my name and that of my noble friend. We had assumed that Clause 68 would expect all authorities within an area to participate in a leaders&#146; board, but the debate in Grand Committee and subsection (3) suggests that it may not be the case. Amendment 160A has therefore been tabled partly to clarify that, but also, if it is not the case, to add the words, &#147;and which determine to participate&#148;.</p>

<a name="90323-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09032326000146"></a>Amendment 160B returns to a point that was raised in Grand Committee, which is to ensure that leaders&#146; boards enjoy full party and non-party representation. If they are drawn solely from the leader of a party in control or their representative, that will often not be the case&#151;indeed, I think that reference was made in Grand Committee to the fact that, as things stand at the moment in the south-west of England, the party of national government would have no representation on a leaders&#146; board, which is absurd. If the leaders&#146; board is to command widespread support, to have credibility and genuinely to be able to speak for the communities, a way must be found to ensure that all the political parties represented in that area are represented on the board and that, if and where there are independent members, they, too, have an appropriate voice.</p>

<a name="90323-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="09032326000147"></a>Amendment 164A would add the simple word &#147;effective&#148;. I am sure that the Government would say that they want involvement to be effective, but, as things stand, nothing requires it to be effective; it may simply be a consultative process that is gone through for the sake of it. We wanted to add a word to the Bill  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_512"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 512</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that made it very clear that community involvement needs to be meaningful, and to be meaningful it has to be effective. Therefore, that one word has an important meaning in the Bill. Those are our three amendments, all of which would add clarity and emphasis to the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="st_161"></a>
<a name="09032337000001"></a><b><a name="90323-0010.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09032337000372"></a>Lord Smith of Leigh:</b> My Lords, perhaps I may speak to the amendments from a north-west perspective. Before I do, I declare the interests which I declared in Committee. I was for some time the chairman of the North West Regional Assembly&#146;s executive board, which became 4NW. I resigned from that position when I became a member of the Northwest Regional Development Agency in December.</p>

<a name="90323-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="09032337000002"></a>As I think the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, would recognise, as well as two big cities, the north-west contains quite a considerable rural area. I do not think that you can get more rural than Cumbria. In creating 4NW, which is essentially the leaders&#146; forum before the Bill cuts through, we had to make sure that all the different parts of the north-west were effectively represented. We started off by saying that each of the sub-regions should have three representatives, and that within those sub-regions, which had different kinds of authority, all the different kinds of authority should be represented. For example, if it was a unitary authority, there should also be a county and a district member.</p>

<a name="90323-0010.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="09032337000003"></a>At the end of last year we also started working with the NWDA on a regional strategy which, I again assure noble Lords, does not work in quite the way suggested. We started off by issuing a consultation draft on issues of principles which has gone out to all the partner agencies and local authorities. We will develop the strategy over the summer and more than 50 participating partners will be involved in the consultation. After the draft is produced towards the end of this year there will be a longer period of consultation before the strategy is agreed. At each stage all the local authorities and partner agencies will be able to contribute. My noble friend Lord Judd was concerned about the Lake District National Park. I assure him that it is a full member of 4NW and that it participates in it, as do the other agencies that are not included formally. Health needed to be included, so we got the strategic health authority involved. The new HCA is also involved. Those are some of the participating bodies. If you went to the meetings, you would not know where you were.</p>

<a name="90323-0010.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09032337000004"></a>I am concerned by the amendments on party politics tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Tope. I am not sure that we want the leaders&#146; boards to become party political. One of the problems that we had in the North West Regional Assembly was that it became very political and we were not talking to each other; in fact, we were arguing. When I became chairman of the executive board, I set out deliberately to be consensual. I would not let the Labour group or any of the other groups meet on their own, because they wanted to represent each other&#146;s sub-regions. I said to my Liberal Democrat colleagues in Stockport, &#147;I&#146;ve got more in common with you than I have with the Labour representatives up in Cumbria&#148;. We needed to make  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_513"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 513</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sure that we represented not just our own interests as a particular local authority but the collective interest. We had to listen to each other, participate in debate and make sure that we did not divide along party lines, because collaboration means working together. Therefore, automatic inclusion of political parties is a difficult matter. One has only to look at some of the local authorities these days&#151;Stoke-on-Trent would come to mind&#151;to see the number of splits, splinters and parties. If you had to have one representative from every one, you would probably need to hire a room much bigger than this one to get all those different parties in it. The leader needs to represent not an authority or a political party but his area, whether it is urban or rural, and try to make decisions which improve the lot of the people in it. I was very proud when I stepped down from my previous role to hear people comment that we had not had a vote&#151;that is not true; we had one vote on the name 4NW, which I lost. Working in that way meant that people had to think and listen to each other and not argue along party political lines.</p>

However, although there are two Labour members and one Liberal Democrat member in Greater Manchester we ensure that we also represent the two Conservative councils in the area, because we have a collective view on the issues that we raise. If we want the bodies to be effective, as the noble Lord&#146;s amendment seeks, we also need to think about their size.</p>

Many of the amendments relate to the composition of the boards and the danger of prescription. We have tried in the arrangements that we propose to give regions greater flexibility to devise detailed administrative arrangements which suit their regional circumstances. That came though in our sub-national report and is also the view of the LGA, which agrees that it should be for local authorities in a region to determine these things. I am very grateful to my noble friend Lord Smith for having just spoken about how it is working in practice.</p>

<a name="90323-0010.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09032337000008"></a>We debated this matter in Committee, where I said that the principle that we were trying to hold on to is non-prescription and explained why the Government have deliberately shied away from covering within the Bill matters that we thought inappropriate for national government to prescribe, such as the detailed composition of the leaders&#146; board and consultative arrangements. However, in recognition of concern about these points and in response to requests for greater certainty, we also indicated that further details would be covered by guidance and/or regulations, such as a list of statutory consultees to be set out in regulations. However, we are trying to strike the right balance between flexibility and assurance, and meeting different expectations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="09032337000009"></a>My noble friend Lord Judd, supported by the noble Lord, Lord Chorley, have tabled amendments which would include the national parks as representatives in  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_514"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 514</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>every region in which there is a park and necessitate consultation with them. We want the leaders&#146; boards to be small enough to be effective, streamlined, managed and properly representative of local areas, but the noble Lords have made an important case. On Amendment 160, I recognise the importance of my noble friend&#146;s argument regarding the national parks. I have listened to the concerns expressed and we will come back with a proposal to ensure that the Bill enables national parks to be properly represented without undermining the principle of regional self-organisation.</p>

<a name="90323-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09032337000010"></a>On my noble friend&#146;s Amendment 165, on the consultation arrangements, it is clear to me that noble Lords consider it important to spell out in more detail the relationship between the responsible regional authorities and the local authorities boards and individual local authorities. Again, I am willing to take the matter away and consider how we can address noble Lords&#146; concerns by setting out more clearly in the Bill the reciprocal duties of the responsible regional authorities to consult, engage and take advice from local authorities in the region and the responsibilities of local authorities to engage in that process. I hope that noble Lords will be happy about that.</p>

<a name="90323-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09032337000011"></a>On the amendments laid out by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, I think that we had a similar group of amendments in Committee. Amendments 157 and 164 require the responsible regional authorities to seek advice from the county and unitary councils, the national parks and broads authorities, and so forth. The noble Lord makes a powerful case about the different geographies of this country, in particular the rural as opposed to the urban. This is a restatement of amendments we considered in Committee, particularly in the light of concern expressed by the Local Government Association that the Bill does not replicate the Section 4(4) provision of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and is therefore perceived as weakening the role of strategic authorities held in principle under the previous legislation.</p>

<a name="90323-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09032337000012"></a>I sought to reassure noble Lords and the LGA that counties and national park authorities will have a number of clear statutory roles. I subsequently wrote to the LGA and the ENPAA setting these out. They include different levels of responsibility; a new duty to prepare economic assessments, which will be a key input, as we have just described, into the evidence base of the regional strategies; and a crucial role in establishing and configuring the leaders&#146; board in their region. Many county leaders will be members of their leaders&#146; board and therefore have direct management control of the regional strategy and process. They will also have a role as statutory consultees in their own right and be consulted on draft revisions to the regional strategy. We will set out our consultation expectations in regulations and guidance, including a list of consultees. That will additionally be covered in the statement of community involvement.</p>

<a name="90323-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09032337000013"></a>I believe that this package of provisions give counties and national parks much more real, practical influence over the regional strategy than they had over the RSS via the regional assembly, which had a much looser arrangement, and certainly more than they ever had in relation to the regional economic strategy. We have a  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_515"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 515</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>range of ways in which counties and districts can take advantage of input and participation to get a better level of influence. I think it will be a challenge and although I agree that we have not replicated it in exactly the same way as in the PCPA, there will no loss of opportunity or access to influence.</p>

<a name="90323-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="09032337000014"></a>I turn briefly to Amendment 168 in the name of my noble friend Lord Judd and the noble Lord, Lord Chorley. We will shortly be debating the need for an integrated strategy and I know that this amendment will keep the current system of regional spatial strategies by retaining Part 1 of the 2004 Act. I will not rehearse my arguments now but will say that we urgently need a single strategy to bring together the spatial expression of the need not least to provide more housing but also to manage our resources, with the economic strategy which is more closely focused on economic considerations such as jobs, skills, enterprise, business, investment and innovation. That is what a single regional strategy will do for the first time. It is long overdue in some cases. However, if noble Lords will allow me, I will come on to that debate later.</p>
<a name="time_27"></a>
<a name="90323-0011.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="09032337000147"></a>7.15 pm</h5>

<a name="90323-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="09032337000015"></a>I turn to the three amendments in the name of the Liberal Democrat spokesmen. Amendment 160A would allow local authorities to choose to opt out of participation. I heard what the noble Lord, Lord Tope, said, but I did not find it very convincing. We have already made clear the flexibility available to participating authorities in determining how they establish their leaders&#146; board and who should be a member, and I think that that is right and proper. Given the importance of the strategy and the key role of the leaders&#146; board, it seems right to require at least a certain level of participation from every local authority in critical parts of that process, and I think that input to establishing a leaders&#146; board is one of those.</p>

<a name="90323-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="09032337000016"></a>Amendment 160B is about participation and representation by all political parties. I think that that was very well answered by my noble friend and I do not have anything to add to that. Finally, Amendment 164A puts a greater onus on the statement of community involvement to demonstrate that the policies within the statement will be effective. I do not think that the amendment has that effect. We had a discussion in Committee about the challenge of making community involvement a genuine and inclusive process. It is very important that we work hard to make that so, and we committed to doing it. Looking at this amendment, it is very difficult to define effectiveness and very difficult to define how it might be assessed. I am sure that the noble Lords would not want a purely presentational amendment; they would want it to work, and there is already an implicit expectation that policies put forward by the responsible regional authorities should be effective. If they are not, they will certainly be challenged in the iterative process of consultation, in the examination in public.</p>

<a name="90323-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09032337000017"></a>I regret that I cannot accept these thoughtful amendments. However, I hope that noble Lords have been persuaded and that my noble friend Lord Judd is happy that we will address the issue that he raised in his amendments.</p>

I do not think that it totally addresses the points that I made at the beginning. If the economic assessments are going to be carried out by counties in conjunction with districts&#151;we did not win the concession that they should be automatically involved, but we are assured they will be&#151;then when it comes to the actual regional strategy, since the bodies we have just been talking about are not going to be properly, statutorily consulted on it, I do not see how the thing is going to be joined-up. I do not accept what the noble Baroness said about the regional strategy being joined-up and from the bottom up.</p>

The ultimate power will be the regional development assembly&#151;that is my point as well as the point of the noble Lord, Lord Judd&#151;and my amendment would make the national parks a consultee in the regional strategy. This is an LGA amendment. It is an all-party amendment from the LGA and I do not see why the Government cannot accept it. It would put into the Bill what should happen and who should be consulted about establishing a regional strategy. It is very important to test the opinion of the House on this.</p>

<a name="09032337000020"></a><b><a name="90323-0011.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09032337000378"></a>Viscount Falkland:</b> My Lords, I think that we shall, unhappily, be a reduced number in a few seconds. I shall try to explain to the House why my debate probably has a small number of people who will be contributing, but to whom I am enormously grateful. I knew very little about this subject until a few months ago, so I can understand people&#146;s bemusement when they read on the Order Paper what we are debating.</p>

<a name="90323-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="09032337000021"></a>My question is whether the National Health Service is actually fulfilling its remit to provide the best possible service at point of need. We all recognise, of course, how it does that to the best of its abilities and within great financial constraints. Yet we are deficient in one area, because what I am about to describe does not exist in most of the countries of Europe or, indeed, other countries in the civilised world. Those who are taken ill or involved in a serious accident outside the London area&#151;that is, roughly within the M25&#151;are treated by dedicated emergency crews that consist largely of paramedics and the police, with ambulances present. Yet there is no doctor present who can cope with critical care for someone who has been involved in a serious motor or sporting accident, or one that involves crushing of the spine or head injuries. Outside the London area, there is no critical care doctor present to make sure that those injured people can get to the appropriate hospital within the time that may save their lives.</p>

<a name="90323-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="09032337000022"></a>In fact, figures tell us that in the south central area&#151;the area on which I have been briefed, through my long friendship with people in the Hampshire Police Authority&#151;for those patients who are seriously injured in accidents of the kind that I have described, there is a 40 per cent mortality rate because of the delays in getting them to a hospital that can deal with them quickly, and with specialist care, within the time. That is because of the paramedics. I would not dare suggest that the paramedics do not do their job admirably; they are dedicated people, underpaid for what they do&#151;with no bonuses whether they do it right or wrong&#151;who go out in all weathers. Up to the level of their competence and training, they do the best that they can. Yet people who are severely injured&#151;who may well be unconscious, have crushed chests with  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_519"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 519</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>damaged airways, or the head injuries about which one reads of so often in the newspapers&#151;need expert attention very quickly.</p>

<a name="90323-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="09032337000023"></a>I have been briefed for this debate by a group of doctors who do not get paid for what they do, but work under charitable funding through an organisation called the British Association for Immediate Care&#151;a sort of umbrella charity. If such doctors volunteer, when they are available and can get out there, people have a chance of surviving. The losses in the southern central area, the one about which I know most through my briefing, indicate what prevails throughout the British Isles. A properly organised, doctor-led service could certainly save 141 lives a year in the southern area; in money terms, I believe that that is roughly calculated as saving the area &#163;186 million a year.</p>

<a name="90323-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="09032337000024"></a>Birmingham, for example, suffers the same in that there are innumerable accidents in that conurbation. In last year&#146;s records, it had 389 call-outs for specialist doctors and 1,978 arrivals. Compared with other parts of the country, that is quite a good record. Yet the number of people in need of the special care of qualified doctors who have to act immediately to get patients to a hospital that can deal with their particular trauma is certainly evidence of a need to overhaul the service. That will entail a National Health Service commitment for funding. My noble friend Lady Tonge is much better qualified than I to talk on these subjects. This comes as less of a surprise to her, with her medical training, than it might to others. She will elaborate in more detail on these matters.</p>

<a name="90323-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="09032337000025"></a>The competence of paramedics is not in question, but when it comes to anaesthetics or opening airways or things that need particular expertise and time, a doctor really is required in quick order&#151;if it is possible to get them there. Once there, those doctors can speed up the process of getting the patient to the right hospital. The job of the paramedics is to get the patient to the nearest general hospital, from where they may then have to be transferred again. It might take as long as 12, 13 or 14 hours before someone with serious head injuries gets to a place where they can be treated, by which time they may be so injured that they are no longer able to function, or they may be dead.</p>

<a name="90323-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="09032337000026"></a>That is the sum of my introduction to this debate, and I do not think that many paramedics would disagree with it. There is nothing that they would like better than to have a qualified doctor working alongside them, but should charitable organisations really be funding those doctors? They can only free themselves when they are not working in their daily jobs but, when they are called, they go out in all weathers and do an admirable job. Is it not time, then, for us to follow the rest of Europe, and the world, in providing a properly funded and doctor-led critical care service? Why should people who are not in hospital but are on their way to it get worse treatment than those who go to hospital and are treated in the normal way?</p>

The Minister and I have both been involved with the Red Cross. We know how important emergency medical services are. One Red Cross activity is planning and helping in disasters. More and more paramedics are being used in emergency situations these days. They are now much better trained than a few years ago, and can use much more sophisticated equipment. Regarding an emergency response, however, although paramedics have good assessing skills, they do not always have the competence to prioritise certain treatments. If a doctor could be present, it might be possible to start urgent treatment early, which might reduce serious injury or loss of life.</p>

<a name="90323-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="09032337000028"></a>In TV programmes such as &#147;Casualty&#148;, crash teams with doctors go out to serious incidents. Is that realistic or does it not happen? Perhaps the Minister can let me know whether they give a real or a false impression.</p>

<a name="90323-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09032337000029"></a>When not in London, my home is in north Yorkshire. The North Yorkshire and York Primary Care Trust is the size of Belgium. It covers 3,200 square miles, much of which is rural. For people living in the Yorkshire Dales, their nearest hospital can be 30 or 40 miles away. Without the air ambulance service, many lives would be lost. Some local GPs are trained to be part of the pre-hospital care team. In this country, all doctors are initially trained by the National Health Service. This important service would not exist without much fundraising.</p>

<a name="90323-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="09032337000030"></a>Seriously injured people are taken to the most appropriate hospital, which may be a long way from home as it is vital to get specialist treatment when the condition needs it. I say to the noble Viscount that some paramedics now carry out this task. They have been trained to take a patient to the nearest specialised hospital. That has recently happened.</p>

<a name="90323-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09032337000031"></a>The principle of a doctor/paramedic team was first used by the London Helicopter Emergency Medical Service. This fundamental break from the usual paramedic-only model radically changed the dynamics of the crew and the level of care available to patients in the pre-hospital environment. In 2003, the Great North Air Ambulance Service integrated physicians into its team. Several air ambulance services are utilising this approach to pre-hospital care, including in Kent, Surrey, Sussex, the east of England and the West Midlands.</p>

<a name="90323-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="09032337000032"></a>HEMS physicians may originate from a number of specialities, including emergency medicine, anaesthetics and general medicine. Regardless of specialist medical background, doctors should have a strong grasp of the fundamentals and demonstrate practical ability in the other acute specialities. For example, an anaesthetics specialist should have completed a significant period of emergency medicine, and an emergency physician should have a background in anaesthesia and critical care. To this end, most HEMS operations require similar criteria.</p>

<a name="90323-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="09032337000033"></a>Serious illness often presents out of doctors&#146; hours. It can be very difficult in rural areas for seriously disabled people and people who do not drive to get access to a doctor. Doctors have to cover events such as horse shows, race meetings, rugby games and all sorts of occasions. Organisers of the events have to pay for that, but it shows the importance of doctors being present where there are risks. I think the answer  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_521"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 521</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to the noble Viscount&#146;s Question is that there is an important need for doctors to save lives, but the NHS cannot afford to do everything. At times there has to be shared co-operation, communication and co-ordination.</p>

<a name="90323-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="09032337000034"></a>Some years ago, a GP called Dr Easton living near Catterick started a rota of GPs linked up with the police, who went out to serious injuries on the notorious A1 and surrounding roads. This excellent scheme was highly commended and appreciated by the local people, but it was in the days when doctors&#146; hours were more flexible. I hope that strategic health authorities and PCTs across the country will look very carefully at what happens in their locations to critically injured and ill patients and how improvements can be made across the country.</p>

<a name="90323-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="09032337000035"></a>I am reminded of the tragic young rugby player who broke his neck and was paralysed from the neck down. Finally, he went to Switzerland to end his life, which he found intolerable. His mother recently stated that when he was taken from the rugby field to a hospital, his arms were still moving. After having been x-rayed, and twisted and turned, he became totally paralysed. I am told that he should have been operated on within four hours to relieve the pressure on the spinal cord. It was too late by the time he was admitted to a spinal unit.</p>

<a name="90323-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="09032337000036"></a>I end by quoting from the 2007 report <I>Trauma: </I><I>W</I><I>ho C</I><I>ares?</I> It states:</p>

<ul><a name="09032337000139"></a>&#147;and other components of care of severely injured patient, must be embedded in practice at every stage: the scene of the accident; alerts to the hospital; the journey from the scene to the emergency department; preparations made there; expertise accessible on arrival and at all subsequent stages, including transfer to specialist services ... It is by sympathetically, and analytically, studying where things go wrong that we can learn most&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09032337000125"></a>When critically injured patients are being handled and treated, it should be of utmost importance in the minds of the medical personnel that further damage must not take place and the correct procedures must always be followed.</p>

This is an important subject. I must confess that the more I look into it, the more amazed I am at how inadequate the provision is.

<a name="90323-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="09032337000038"></a>Let us just recall what happens. After a serious accident, an ambulance is called; 75 per cent of accidents are attended within eight minutes. That is not a problem; the ambulances get there. It is pretty good. We have heard of the wonderful services given by the ambulance crews and the paramedics. However, the victim&#146;s survival depends crucially on their airway being kept open and their brain being supplied with oxygen. That is a basic need that we human beings have; we need oxygen to our brains if we are going to stay alive.</p>

<a name="90323-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="09032337000039"></a>In the past paramedics used to intubate, which means putting a tube down the windpipe of the patient. They could do that only if the patient was unconscious.  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_522"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 522</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>They are not allowed to do it now. The difficulty comes when the patient is semi-conscious and needs to be anaesthetised before the tube is put into their windpipe to give them essential oxygen. That can be done only by a fully trained doctor anaesthetist, someone who really knows what they are doing. It is quite a delicate procedure. Then the patient can go to hospital and, one hopes, the right hospital. Sometimes, as we have heard, they will go to an A&amp;E department, where they are assessed and sent on to a specialist centre. Valuable time is lost. The worst scenario is if a doctor is not at the scene of the accident quickly to ensure that the patient&#146;s brain gets oxygen. That is the crucial thing.</p>

<a name="90323-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="09032337000040"></a>It is worth reflecting on the fact that the mortality rate for severe trauma in this country is 40 per cent higher than in the United States of America. Recently, there was a national confidential &#147;enquiry&#148; into patient outcome and death, called <I>Trauma: Who </I><I>C</I><I>ares?</I><I>.</I> Incidentally, why is that a confidential &#147;enquiry&#148;; surely it should be an inquiry? Will someone please educate the Department of Health as to the difference? The inquiry said that many trauma victims, including children, as well as stroke cases and those in diabetic comas&#151;people with all sorts of conditions need oxygen given to the brain during the transfer to hospital&#151;are dying in this country through a lack of appropriate care. The Department for Transport accident report in 2006 said that there were 3,172 deaths and 28,673 serious injuries across the UK. With proper care at the scene of the accident, studies have shown, over 2,000 lives could have been saved; two out of each three people who died could be alive today if proper care had been available.</p>

<a name="90323-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="09032337000041"></a>In the USA, Australia and many countries in Europe, such as Germany, there is 24-hour, seven-day-a-week pre-hospital care provision. In London, an NHS-funded critical care doctor and paramedic team are on call during the day. That is rather typical of the NHS, I have always thought. Apparently people do not have accidents or get seriously ill at night. If you are going to be ill or crash you car, you should do it in the daytime, for heaven&#146;s sake. In London, there is a pretty good daytime service, anyway: as we know, there is the air ambulance and good road transit when the roads are free. At night, however, the service is covered by volunteers and the ambulance crews. This should be available countrywide, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In fact, severe trauma is the only area of the NHS where a patient dies through the lack of a doctor.</p>

<a name="90323-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="09032337000042"></a>The British Association for Immediate Care&#151;BASICS&#151;consists of volunteer doctors working in their spare time to give care to the desperately injured; they must be tired, and they are not paid. This is a patchy service across the country and yet another example of the postcode lottery. I pay tribute to Dr Phil Hyde, Dr David Sutton, Dr Charles Deakin and many others who work in Hampshire. They not only provide this service voluntarily but have campaigned hard and long to bring it to our attention and to that of Members in the other place. My honourable friend Mark Oaten introduced a debate in Westminster Hall last June, which I hope the Minister has seen; it was a very good debate.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_523"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 523</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="09032337000043"></a>We have recently heard of the appointment of a &#147;trauma tsar&#148;. New Labour loves its tsars; I never understand why it loves them so much, but perhaps that says something about its mentality. We are told that strategic health authorities will be required to have trauma centres, but there is still no planned national service; it is dependent on strategic health authorities. The response is the usual message that primary care trusts and the SHAs are responsible for assessing need in their area. I am sorry, but I do not understand them assessing need in their areas for trauma patients and serious accidents. There must be a pretty uniform rate of accidents throughout the country. This service is needed everywhere and should not be left to the whims of individual area managers.</p>

<a name="90323-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="09032337000044"></a>We know that people will die if they do not receive proper care and oxygen to their brains before they reach hospital. We cannot say that often enough. Again, it is not just trauma patients, but cardiac patients, stroke patients, people in diabetic comas and many, many children. It is a scandal that our health service does not recognise this and ensure that this service is provided. If anything is to be decided locally, maybe it could be whether the service is provided by air ambulance or a fast road vehicle, as that will depend on local conditions, but not the trauma itself.</p>

<a name="90323-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="09032337000045"></a>I repeat: trauma centres, yes, but the patients have to get to them alive for them to be any good. That takes time and trained doctors who can attend the scene of the accident in the first place and ensure that the patient arrives alive. The operating framework for the NHS in England for 2008-09 tells PCTs what they must do, but I did not see anything about critical care at the scene of an accident or the requirement to ensure that local emergency care services will provide such a service.</p>

<a name="90323-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="09032337000046"></a>I repeat: a team of one doctor and one paramedic. Those doctors cannot be the doctors who work in the trauma centres or those who work in accident and emergency, who must stay where they are. I acknowledge that extra staff are needed, but we are talking about one paramedic and one doctor, qualified to give anaesthetics and perform intubation at the accident site, on call 24 hours a day. I hope that the Minister will relieve my distress and save lives by telling me that, among the paper storm that comes from the Department of Health, there will soon be one setting up this service.</p>

I thank him for that and for his powerful and persuasive speech. Trauma care is a topic that has received precious little attention in this House during recent years, which I regret because trauma is the fourth leading cause of death in people below the age of 40. In terms of serious injury and long-term disability, it represents an enormous burden on society and the NHS, so it deserves a lot more parliamentary air time. In a given week there are reckoned to be 240 severely injured patients who are taken to hospital across the UK. Collectively, that is a lot of patients. The natural and obvious question that arises is how well or badly we are doing in looking after those people.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_524"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 524</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90323-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="09032337000048"></a>Sir George Alberti, the emergency access director, has been studying that very issue. I know that one aspect that he has been examining is the lessons that we can learn from abroad. Comparisons with other countries are never totally straightforward, but it seems that we in the UK are not doing as well as we should or could be. America, for one, is far ahead of us in the percentage of trauma patients delivered alive to hospital. In Germany, there is a nationwide network of air and road ambulances that can, and do, get a skilled doctor to the scene of the vast majority of emergencies within a quarter of an hour, with impressive results. Here, as we have heard, the presence of a doctor at the scene of an incident is a hit-and-miss affair, depending on where you happen to be. That really cannot be a satisfactory situation.</p>

<a name="90323-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="09032337000049"></a>What difference does a doctor make? The noble Viscount and the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, summarised it very well. The answer is that it depends on the nature of the trauma but, in general, if you have a patient whose airway is blocked and who needs intubating, only a doctor can see to that. Only a doctor can administer the drugs and pain relief that the person is likely to need. If someone has been knifed, only a doctor is capable of opening up the chest at the scene of the incident.</p>

<a name="90323-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="09032337000050"></a>Saying that is not to belittle or detract from the skills of paramedics, who are highly professional and dedicated people, but paramedics are trained only to a certain level. They are not doctors. The 2007 report <I>Trauma: Who </I><I>C</I><I>ares?</I>, which has already been mentioned this evening, pointed to a high incidence of patients arriving at hospital with a partially or completely obstructed airway and an unacceptably high incidence of failed intubation. It is interesting that 41 per cent of patients treated by a helicopter-based system were intubated at the scene of the incident. That is nearly six times the percentage of patients intubated by road ambulance crews.</p>

<a name="90323-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="09032337000051"></a>Of course, response times and intubation rates are only proxy measures for what really counts in trauma care, which are long-term outcomes. Here we are in the age of quality indicators and quality accounts, but the amount of public discussion about quality in trauma care has been minimal. I am aware that PCTs and ambulance trusts have been devoting attention to this area and we must hope that the result of this will be a sharper focus on best practice and greater uniformity of care across the country. Published studies have provided clear evidence that an ambulance crew consisting of a doctor as well as a paramedic delivers significantly higher survival rates and lower morbidity. The College of Emergency Medicine has added its weight to this analysis.</p>

<a name="90323-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="09032337000052"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Darzi, has previously indicated his view that we need to move towards developing dedicated regional trauma centres where specialised services can be concentrated. I agree with that, but it is of course only part of the answer, because the logical consequence of having fewer specialist centres is longer distances for very seriously injured patients to travel. That is why there is now so much interest in developing a network of air ambulances. At the moment, air ambulances are run by some 18 air ambulance charities.  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_525"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 525</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The financial contribution that the NHS makes, or does not make, to the running costs of those charities is a debate for another day, but I am slightly worried that, when it comes to developing and enhancing air ambulance services, the Government are leaving rather too much to local determination. That point was powerfully made by the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge.</p>

<a name="90323-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="09032337000053"></a>Certainly, the local NHS and the charities should sit down and work out how to move the service forward and how in particular more doctors can be put into helicopters. However, the question that this raises is what benchmarks the NHS and the charities are able to use to agree on an appropriately high level of service. What standards for trauma care should we expect them to aspire to and what in human resource terms does it take to deliver those standards in a given set of circumstances? Those questions can surely be resolved only at national level. I should like the Minister to say whether she agrees with me about that.</p>

<a name="90323-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="09032337000054"></a>We need to grasp the point about standards, which of course applies equally to land ambulance services. The <I>Trauma: Who Cares?</I> report came to the sobering conclusion that nearly 60 per cent of trauma patients received a standard of care that was less than good practice. It said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60"></a><a name="09032337000135"></a>&#147;The organisation of prehospital care, the trauma team response, seniority of staff involvement and immediate in-hospital care was found to be deficient in many cases. Lack of appreciation of severity of illness, of urgency of clinical scenario and incorrect clinical decision making were apparent ... the provision of suitably experienced staff during evenings and nights was much lower than at other times ... this is a major concern&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09032337000126"></a>That is a pretty serious list of failings and, while some of it can no doubt be addressed by concentrating trauma care into fewer centres, some of it points to the need for national clinical standards and clear guidance on best practice.</p>

<a name="90323-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="09032337000055"></a>I am aware of the framework document published last year that set out a number of recommended management and service standards for air ambulances, but this is not quite the same thing as trying to define the standards that should apply to ambulance care overall. We need to recognise, as that document points out, that pre-hospital emergency care is now a speciality in its own right. There is no doubt whatever that expert critical care at the roadside, if it arrives early enough, has a significant effect on patient outcomes in cases of serious injury. Some ambulance trusts now provide fast response unit cars staffed by individual paramedics. These are helpful in a lot of cases such as heart attacks, but they cannot be a substitute for a fully fledged ambulance, nor can they do anything to speed up a patient&#146;s journey to hospital. Speed of response is important, but we need to be very careful; targets imposed on ambulance trusts that are expressed in terms of response times and nothing else carry dangers, because they fail to address what really matters, which is the quality of care that patients receive once help has arrived.</p>

<a name="90323-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="09032337000056"></a>Reading about this subject, I have been struck by the absence of useful statistical information. Over the years, there have been various studies relating to the care of trauma patients, but there has never been a nationwide study looking at the overall care of such patients. The Government should seriously consider  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_526"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 526</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>such a study. A good deal of the data that we possess has come from TARN, the Trauma Audit and Research Network, which was instigated 20 years ago following a working party report by the Royal College of Surgeons. That database is extremely valuable, but participation in it needs to be rolled out more widely if we are to gain an understanding of where the most serious shortcomings in trauma care exist.</p>

<a name="90323-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="09032337000057"></a>I hope that the Minister can illuminate these issues and give us cause to hope that the concerns raised by the noble Viscount and, indeed, all speakers will be satisfactorily addressed.</p>

This issue of the treatment of critically ill and injured patients outside hospital and the role of doctors in that treatment, NHS support and otherwise, is critical.</p>

<a name="90323-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="09032337000059"></a>NHS services have to deal effectively with critically injured and ill patients and give them the support and treatment they need, as and when they need it. The job of central government is to provide strategic direction, as the noble Earl said. However, it is surely right that local services determine the best organisational arrangements to ensure that the right services are in the right place at the right time and to provide appropriately for the needs of patients in this area.</p>

<a name="90323-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="09032337000060"></a>Perhaps I should declare an interest. My brother is an ambulance driver in Yorkshire and, I think, is qualifying as a paramedic right now.</p>

<a name="90323-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="09032337000061"></a>What matters is that patients get the right care at the right time, whether that is from a paramedic, an emergency care practitioner, a doctor or another service, and whether that care is provided by the NHS or by partners such as BASICS doctors or air ambulances. It is for the local NHS to commission and manage these services. I shall come on to talk about the framework that is necessary to deliver that, and what we hope will happen.</p>

<a name="90323-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="09032337000062"></a>Noble Lords mentioned London. Its environment presents special and unique circumstances in which those dispatched to treat the seriously ill and injured have to operate. I am pleased to be able to acknowledge that London&#146;s air ambulance is recognised world wide as having led the way in the treatment of advanced trauma. The London Ambulance Service is also fortunate to be able to call on an extremely well established team of BASICS doctors who possess a wealth of experience in this kind of care; but of course circumstances and demands differ across the country.</p>

<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_527"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 527</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90323-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="09032337000065"></a>The work of BASICS doctors differs from area to area. I do not pretend that this is a perfect service, but I am trying to explain how we are making progress in this area. We absolutely welcome the invaluable support that BASICS provides in advanced trauma cases.</p>

<a name="90323-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="09032337000066"></a>On the front line we have an ambulance service that deals with more calls than ever before. It is still treating the critically ill and injured more quickly; it is saving more lives. During 2007-08, 77.1 per cent of category A&#151;that is, immediately life-threatening&#151;calls received a response at the scene of the incident within eight minutes. This is the ambulance service&#146;s best ever emergency response rate. The new &#147;call connect&#148; method of measuring response requires ambulances to respond, on average, 90 seconds faster than was previously the case. As further evidence of how critically ill and injured people are benefiting, we need to consider that survival rates for cardiac arrest show a year-on-year improvement in the number of people resuscitated after cardiac arrest.</p>

<a name="90323-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="09032337000067"></a>We know that we need always to seek better ways of responding to critically injured and ill patients and the victims of trauma. In this context, we welcome the findings and recommendations of the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death, or NCEPOD, report of last November. The report made strong recommendations about how the treatment of trauma care could be improved. The Government and the NHS have taken the recommendations to heart. The key recommendation of NCEPOD&#146;s report is that planning for severe trauma care should be done at a regional level. This allows for the pooling of specialist skills and equipment, to offer patients for whom every second counts the best quality of care available, from specialists in specially designed centres.</p>

<a name="90323-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="09032337000068"></a>There is a relatively low incidence of severe trauma cases in the UK, with the majority of hospitals seeing less than one such patient per week. The question is how to have the best-qualified people available on that basis. Surely, it is more important to have more and better-qualified paramedics backed up by BASICS doctors. The Government agree with NCEPOD that it is not necessarily the proximity of the nearest hospital or accident and emergency department that matters most in some emergencies, but, as the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, pointed out, the care that patients receive from ambulance staff and paramedics, and the quality of the care that they receive once they arrive at hospital.</p>

<p><a name="st_174"></a>
<a name="09032337000069"></a><b><a name="90323-0012.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09032337000385"></a>Baroness Tonge:</b> My Lords, I am sorry to interrupt. The Minister is being very generous in giving way. Yes, of course, the care that the trauma patient receives at the site of the accident will determine whether they survive. Trauma centres are great, but you need to stabilise the patient as quickly as possible and get oxygen to their brain before you get them to the trauma centre. The Minister is still saying, I think, that this service will be provided by ambulance crews and paramedics, with the help of BASICS doctors. BASICS is a charity. Are we to depend on volunteers to assist the most seriously injured people?</p>

<p><a name="st_175"></a>

What you have to do is ensure that ambulance staff and paramedics are as well qualified as they can be. I will talk about their training in a moment. You have to ensure that the best possible care is available as quickly as possible, but clearly that does not include, or depend on, having a qualified doctor on every ambulance crew, unless that is what the noble Baroness is suggesting. Clearly, that would not be a proper use of qualified doctors.</p>

<a name="90323-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="09032337000071"></a>Strategic health authorities, as part of the Government&#146;s next-stage review, have to set out their visions for improving the provision of trauma care services. I am pleased to say that the majority are planning to set up one or more of these centres. I also welcome the appointment of Professor Keith Willett, the Government&#146;s new director for trauma. I have not, in any of my briefings, seen the word &#147;tsar&#148;, so I certainly do not intend to use it. His appointment comes into effect on 1 April. He has extensive experience in trauma care and medical management. His appointment sends a clear message of intent from the Government on this issue. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, is quite right: we expect to hear more about trauma. Indeed, we need to hear more about trauma.</p>

<a name="90323-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="09032337000072"></a>Two issues deserve special mention. First, the noble Earl, Lord Howe, mentioned research. Research has shown that air ambulances can provide particular assistance in cases where the patient has suffered major blunt trauma, especially in rural areas and where road access is a problem, as mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Masham. They can be an effective way of getting better and faster access to hospitals and are valuable in supporting inter-hospital transfer. The department continues to encourage the air ambulance charities and ambulance trusts to work together to agree how both services can maximise their contribution to high-quality patient care. In recognition of the contribution that air ambulances make, in 2002 the Government directed NHS ambulance trusts to meet the costs of clinical staff on air ambulances. That includes, where appropriate, doctors.</p>

<a name="90323-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="09032337000073"></a>Secondly, I welcome the valuable work of those who work for the British Association for Immediate Care&#151;BASICS&#151;as volunteers. We acknowledge the valuable support that these doctors offer local NHS services and recognise that the availability of the medical advice and assistance that they bring has advantages for some seriously injured patients. However, central government currently have no plans to require the NHS to fund BASICS doctors. As I have already explained, it is for the local NHS to decide how it uses BASICS doctors. I understand that in some places ambulance trusts have clear systems to allow them access to the control room to call on the expertise of BASICS doctors immediately when they are required.</p>

<a name="90323-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="09032337000074"></a>In response to a question from the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, it is worth noting that some paramedics are now trained to intubate. Various trusts across the country have a cadre of specialist trauma paramedics who have, and indeed use, these skills.</p>

<a name="90323-0012.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="09032337000075"></a>The noble Viscount raised the issue of South Central Strategic Health Authority. This SHA advises that there is no commissioning of doctors outside the hospital environment within its area, but it uses the  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_529"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 529</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>BASICS voluntary scheme on occasion. The strategic health authority considered the skills required in the pre-hospital environment and felt that the priority was to expand the capacity of emergency care practitioners, who have an enhanced range of skills when compared with paramedics, for the care of critically ill patients. Paramedics in this region are now able to administer a variety of 40-plus drugs and medications and are also able to perform procedures such as crypto thyroidotomy, chest X-rays and so on, in additional to intubation, infusion and other advanced life-saving skills. That occurs within the noble Viscount&#146;s strategic health authority.</p>

<a name="90323-0012.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="09032337000076"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Masham, referred to Yorkshire. The Yorkshire ambulance service receives support from a network of volunteer doctors across the county. These medics are affiliated to BASICS, they have specialist training and their skills are particularly valuable. Their 999 communication centres are linked to the BASICS doctors by pager so that they can be called upon when needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="09032337000077"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, referred to the new director of trauma, who will be working with the strategic health authorities and PCTs to help them to implement best practice. Professor Willett&#146;s priorities will include ensuring regional excellence in dealing with severe trauma. He will be expected to work with each strategic health authority to develop the plans that arise out of the NCEPOD report, <I>Trauma: Who Cares?</I>, and to take forward the next-stage review of my noble friend Lord Darzi.</p>

<a name="90323-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="09032337000078"></a>In conclusion, we believe that the NHS, guided by the outcomes of the next-stage review, is providing a better service than ever before. However, we are not complacent: we know that there is room for improvement. We welcome this debate and the questions that have been raised, and the new director is taking note as noble Lords speak. I am sure that this will not be the last time that we debate these issues.</p>

<ul><a name="09032337000140"></a>&#147;policies in relation to the protection and enhancement of the environment and social welfare of the region&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09032337000128"></a>That continues my argument that all the aspects of sustainability should be recognised and that the regional strategies should be rounded. The Minister at the previous stage resisted the term &#147;sustainable development&#148; in this part of the Bill for technical reasons&#151;in planning terms, &#147;development&#148; has a special meaning&#151;she and we are persuaded of the importance of the other policy areas. My argument therefore is that they should be interwoven and melded together and that the third area of the protection and enhancement of the environment and social welfare should be included. When preparing for today, I was sure that I had got that wording from somewhere, but I could not remember where; it is either in a government document or possibly in a statute somewhere.</p>

<a name="90323-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="09032337000082"></a>Amendment 157F requires consistency between the policies. This is not a frivolous point. The policies should be consistent, and, therefore, economic policy should not outstrip the others&#151;or the other way around. In this Bill, I am so aware of the dangers of economic policies taking priority instead of being set in their proper context.</p>

<a name="90323-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="09032337000083"></a>Amendment 164K would require&#151;after a period in Grand Committee one misses having a table to rest papers on&#151;that a plan must,</p>
<ul><a name="09032337000141"></a>&#147;deliver sustainable growth, using a full range of social, environmental and economic indicators&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09032337000129"></a>That is pretty much the same argument.</p>

<a name="90323-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="09032337000084"></a>Amendment 165A is about the regional development agencies. This is one amendment that would not be satisfied by transposing Clause 80. In Committee, I tabled the same amendment to provide that the regional development agencies&#146; remit and responsibilities should be updated. I see that the same typo, which did not come from me, has been repeated. I am sure that the Minister recognises that it should read &#147;section 4(1)&#148;  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_531"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 531</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and not &#147;section 41(1)&#148;. The purposes should extend not just to &#147;economic development&#148; but to &#147;sustainable economic development&#148;. In having regard to issues of sustainability, each RDA should think more widely than its own region. In Committee, the Minister told me that was not necessary but, increasingly, I see the paragraph in the 1998 Act as too limited. Thinking has moved on.</p>

<a name="90323-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="09032337000085"></a>The amendment uses the phrase,</p>
<ul><a name="09032337000142"></a>&#147;where it is relevant to its area&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09032337000130"></a>It is possible that an RDA could come up with a scheme that is economically advantageous to its own area but would have an impact on another area. The Government&#146;s consultation on the proposals to reform regional planning acknowledged that the RDAs would need to undergo significant change in what they did and how they operated. I agree with that, but I do not think that the changes are adequately reflected in the Bill. The RDAs will have to work across boundaries. At previous stages, I have mentioned carbon emissions and the wider climate change agenda, which are obvious.</p>

<a name="90323-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="09032337000086"></a>Since tabling the amendment, I have learnt from the CPRE that it carried out work in partnership with WWF and Friends of the Earth on the sustainability of the regional strategies&#151;in other words, the work that has been undertaken so far. They noted that the regional spatial strategies and the regional economic strategies across all regions would have&#151;do have, I suppose&#151;a significant combined cumulative negative impact on some environmental resources. They tell me that policies on air and road transport and on water resources were of particular concern. Each region has developed strategies that it thinks have relatively minor negative impacts, but, taken together, they have considerable significance. If our country is to move towards sustainable development, the regions cannot operate in isolation from one another.</p>

<a name="90323-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="09032337000087"></a>Secondly, the Government have confirmed that the economic prosperity boards can be formed from local authorities that work across regional boundaries. The EPBs are likely to work with RDAs. However, in order to ensure that the RDAs can work with the new bodies to enable sustainable economic growth, their purpose must be altered in the way that I propose.</p>

<a name="90323-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="09032337000088"></a>The Regional Development Agencies Act 1998 required each agency to,</p>
<ul><a name="09032337000143"></a>&#147;contribute to the achievement of sustainable development in the United Kingdom where it is relevant to its area to do so&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09032337000131"></a>This suggests that there is no obligation to contribute to sustainable development unless it is relevant to its own area. That in turn suggests that there may be instances where it is not relevant: that cannot be so. I beg to move.</p>

I am grateful for the opportunity presented by the noble Baroness to address some issues raised by them. The amendments are detailed and, as she said, intended to strengthen the requirement for regional strategy to be based on sustainable development principles. I will start by reassuring the

I will come to Clause 80 at the end of my speaking note: that is the logical sequence.</p>

<a name="90323-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="09032337000090"></a>The integrated regional strategies that we are creating are underpinned by the strong commitment to sustainable development that runs through our planning policies and that is fundamental to the way in which we develop our ability to survive and grow as a nation and an economy. I am pleased to say that we are acknowledged world leaders in our response to the mitigation of climate change. Sustainable growth cannot be achieved unless it is within regional environmental limits. We have been absolutely clear about this in our definition of sustainable economic growth, both in the Bill and in the policy document that accompanies it.</p>

<a name="90323-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="09032337000091"></a>Clause 80 makes clear our commitment to sustainable development, which is also in the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and the Planning Act 2008. I completely understand the intentions and aspirations of the noble Baroness, and of environmental stakeholders such as Natural England. However, it is important to be clear, first, that the Bill must be read in the round. Individual clauses cannot be applied in isolation. Secondly, there are several further safeguards to ensure that sustainability plays a key role in shaping the new regional strategies.</p>

<a name="90323-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="09032337000092"></a>I will run through the clauses briefly. Clause 67 makes it clear that regional strategies must set out policies on sustainable economic growth, development and land use, and must include policies designed to contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Clause 73(2) makes it clear that regional strategies are required also to undergo a sustainability appraisal and a strategic environmental assessment under the Environmental Assessment of Plans and Programmes Regulations 2004.</p>

<a name="90323-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="09032337000093"></a>Clause 71 makes it clear that the process for preparing regional strategies also requires full community involvement, including from statutory consultees such as Natural England and the Environment Agency, which will use their scrutiny and expertise to ensure that the strategy takes full account of all sustainability considerations. Clause 72 ensures that strategies will have to be tested by an independent panel which, in the course of its examination, will take account of the sustainability appraisal and the strategic environmental assessment, as well as of all the representations from stakeholders including NGOs.</p>

<a name="90323-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="09032337000094"></a>Clause 73 requires that, in preparing their strategies, responsible regional authorities will need to have regard to national policy and guidance. This means having full regard to the principles set out in the cornerstone of the planning system&#151;PPS1 on delivering sustainable development and its climate change supplement&#151;and applying the policies in other planning policy statements and guidance.</p>

<a name="90323-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="09032337000095"></a>There are further checks about how sustainable regional strategies are because under Clause 77 responsible regional authorities must prepare and publish a report on the implementation of the strategy. That will include  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_533"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 533</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>an assessment of how well other bodies that work within the context of the regional strategies, including EPBs, are delivering on the commitments they contain, including commitments on sustainable development.</p>

<a name="90323-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="09032337000096"></a>It is significant that we are also starting work on a national core sustainability framework, which we announced in our SNR consultation document last year. When finalised, this framework will replace the existing separate sustainable development framework documents for each region and will be a key yardstick against which all regional strategies can be appraised. Therefore, we have a clear set of provisions that ensure that sustainability is fully embedded in the Bill and in the policies that will follow.</p>

<a name="90323-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="09032337000097"></a>I turn to the specific amendments. Amendment 157C seeks to remove the reference to &#147;growth&#148; and to replace it with the words &#147;development and regeneration&#148;. My difficulty with this is that the word &#147;growth&#148; is there for a purpose, not to indicate an overriding imperative for growth at all costs, but because our regions must work towards stronger regional economies based on skills, jobs, investment, innovation and enterprise, which all underpin sustainable economic growth. At a time of serious challenges to our economy and growing unemployment, I would be very reluctant to indicate in any way that jobs are a secondary issue. Removing the word &#147;growth&#148; changes the focus of regional strategies, including the requirement to deliver the regional economic performance PSA that challenges regions to increase their prosperity and enhance their competitiveness. We must ensure that regional strategies secure the right outcome for future generations. Shying away from the economic outcomes of the strategy is not the way to do this. It can be done only within the context of sustainable development because, as I said in Committee several times, I believe that the two are interdependent.</p>

<a name="90323-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="09032337000098"></a>I know that the noble Baroness is very serious about Amendment 165A, which would require the RDAs, as a key purpose, to further sustainable economic development instead of economic development. I really do understand the concerns here, but let me reassure the noble Baroness that Section 4(1)(e) already gives the RDAs a duty to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development alongside their economic development duty. The Bill provides for the RDAs to exercise their functions in relation to the regional strategy for the region with the objective of contributing to sustainable development&#151;that is under Clause 80&#151;and requires regional strategies to have policies in relation to sustainable economic growth&#151;under Clause 67&#151;so the safeguards are there.</p>

<a name="90323-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="09032337000099"></a>As the noble Baroness said, the amendment also removes the words,</p>
<ul><a name="09032337000144"></a>&#147;where it is relevant to its area to do so&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09032337000132"></a>in Section 4(1)(e) of the RDA Act. As she said, that would increase the scope of an RDA&#146;s sustainable development purpose so that the purpose would be to contribute to sustainable development everywhere else in the UK as well as in its own area. This issue has been well debated by both Houses on several occasions. I understand the noble Baroness&#146;s argument, which she made very powerfully, but if we remove from the RDA legislation the phrase,</p>
<ul><a name="09032337000145"></a>&#147;where it is relevant to its area to do so&#148;,</ul>



<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_534"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 534</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09032337000133"></a>each RDA would have a duty to take actions contributing to sustainable development that is not relevant to its area. That makes its purpose and focus less credible and realistic. The qualification enables sustainable development to be relevant to a RDA area, but not restricted geographically to it. That is the best legal balance to capture what we want the RDAs to do. It is a difficult balance, but the appropriate one. It would not be sensible for RDAs to spend time and money on activities that might arguably contribute to sustainable development across the UK, but might have no relevance to the region.</p>

<a name="90323-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="09032337000100"></a>Amendment 157F seeks the introduction of further wording into Clause 67(4) to ensure that the policies prepared under subsections (2)(a) and (b) are consistent. The noble Baroness made a strong case about the logic of consistency. For reasons I have set out, I feel that the argument is partly made because the Bill achieves that. Any strategy which has inconsistent policies is not going to be sound. We have an independent examination of strategies to test for soundness. Internal consistency is an essential requirement and we can safely leave it to a panel of inspectors to test for soundness and consistency against the criteria contained in the guidance.</p>

<a name="90323-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="09032337000101"></a>We also debated Amendment 157D in Committee. That would expressly require regional strategies to have policies concerning the protection and enhancement of the environment and social welfare of the region. Clause 71 already requires responsible regional authorities&#151;the RDA and the leaders&#146; board&#151;to have regard to national policy when preparing a regional strategy and to guidance issued by the Secretary of State. Given that the Secretary of State has published policy on the need for plans to protect the environment and promote sustainable communities, this amendment would not have much practical effect. I understand the concern to promote sustainable development and protection of the environment. They are fundamental to our policies on plan-making and development management. We have been explicit that they form part of our expectation of the outcome of the strategy because the published definition of sustainable economic growth is growth that can be sustained and is within environmental limits but also enhances the environment and social welfare. They certainly form part of our policy expectations in relation to the development and use of land and policies designed to contribute to the mitigation or adaptation of climate change.</p>

<a name="90323-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="09032337000102"></a>Amendment 164K seeks the introduction of a new paragraph under Clause 77(3), requiring the regional strategy monitoring report to demonstrate how the implementation plan will deliver sustainable growth by using a full set of indicators. It is not the purpose of the monitoring report to demonstrate how the implementation plan delivers the strategy. That is the role of the implementation plan itself under Clause 77(1), which, as we have said, focuses on how the outcomes will be achieved and how the strategy will be implemented. The purpose of the report is to provide an annual update on how effective the regional strategy has been in delivering its vision.</p>

<a name="90323-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="09032337000103"></a>It is the role of the sustainability appraisal report under Clause 73(2) to test how sustainable the strategy is. I can reassure noble Lords that we intend to take  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_535"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 535</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>forward, and if necessary develop further, the core set of output indicators which we published in revised form in July 2008. They provide clarity on what regional spatial strategies should report on in their annual monitoring reports. I recognise the concern raised in Committee by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, that the new regional arrangements will skew the focus of local development frameworks and local planning decision-making towards economic growth outcomes at the cost of sustainable development. The noble Baroness referred to her anxiety in general, so it is right that I should provide assurance on that point.</p>

<a name="90323-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="09032337000104"></a>Local Authorities remain local planning authorities. They will not lose their planning powers; they will not be faced with a change in either the principles which underpin the system or their responsibilities under this Bill. They will continue to be subject to legal requirements regarding sustainable development, sustainability appraisal and, like regional strategies, they will need to have regard to national policy in preparing their policies and when making planning decisions. Local plans will still need to be in general conformity with regional strategies, and that will be for the planning inspectorate&#151;those expert independent adjudicators&#151;to determine and not for the responsible regional authorities. Having gone through that in some detail, I hope I have provided some assurance.</p>

<a name="90323-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="09032337000105"></a>My pice de r&#233;sistance is Clause 80. I accept the case put by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, that there is a good chance that this might be overlooked because of the position it occupies at the end of this part of the Bill. It is there because it relates to the exercise of all functions of the responsible regional authorities and the Secretary of State as regards regional strategy and bodies that are described only from Clause 67 onwards. So in drafting terms it follows logically from the description of those functions and bodies. I understand the force of the argument that it needs to be made more visible, more salient and more significant. Therefore I am sympathetic to Amendment 166A which has the effect of moving the clause to the front end of the regional strategy clauses, flagging up in lights the significance of that. I will therefore table an amendment at Third Reading to move Clause 80 to after Clause 69, ensuring that it follows the key clauses on regional strategy, Clause 67, and Clauses 68 and 69, which relate to the bodies which implement them.</p>

<a name="90323-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="09032337000106"></a>I hope that even though the beginning of that rather long speaking note was disappointing, I made up for it in the flourish of the final few seconds.</p>

<p><a name="st_179"></a>
<a name="09032337000107"></a><b><a name="90323-0013.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09032337000391"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> My Lords, I am particularly grateful for the final flourish, as the Minister put it, and for the care with which she answered on the amendments. We do not regard jobs in any way as secondary. Our take on the Bill is to be sure that short-termism does not skew the architecture, a term quite often used by the Minister. If you skew the architecture, the building might fall down, so perhaps it is not a bad analogy.</p>

<a name="90323-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="09032337000108"></a>On RDAs, my concern at the moment is to go further than the Bill; I am sure that the Minister recognises that. I understand her argument as it relates to the Bill but I am still concerned about what I see as  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_536"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 536</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>too narrow an approach from the RDAs. I recognise that different priorities between different government departments may have something to do with the way in which RDAs are promoted and supported.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="09032337000109"></a>On the Minister&#146;s interpretation of my amendment, I do not agree that requiring an RDA to look beyond its own area would have the adverse effect described. Nevertheless, I dare say that that is a debate that we will have again on another day on another Bill. I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s approach to the last of my amendments in the group. When she said that she was going to accept my amendment, I wondered how she would accept it but bring it back as hers. I now see that it will come back a little further on in the Bill and will have to be in a different place, but that is good enough for me. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

In Committee, noble Lords expressed concern about the extent to which the Bill provides for the Secretary of State&#146;s role and powers in relation to regional strategy. As I explained then, there is nothing new in the powers provided in the Bill other than those attached to the leaders&#146; board, which is, of course, a new entity. They are essentially the same powers, in broad terms, as exist in the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. They are minimal powers, which are included to deal with any risks that might arise. As we discussed in Committee, the first risk is that there could be disagreement between the different parties in the region, such that the Government might be required to arbitrate. The second risk is that the regional strategy does not reflect national imperatives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="09032337000112"></a>It seems that we agree on the principle that the Bill needs to be abundantly clear about the role of the Secretary of State and to achieve the right balance between different parties in strategy making and delivery.

I intend that the regional spatial strategy and the regional economic strategy should in combination form the regional strategy on commencement of the legislation. In Committee, we debated a series of amendments on the provision and now we have Amendments 158 and 159 in the names of the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, and the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield. They would give the responsible regional authorities instead of the Secretary of State the power to specify how much of the existing regional spatial and economic strategies would form the regional strategy on commencement.</p>

<a name="90323-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="09032337000114"></a>I accept the principle that the Secretary of State should not be given responsibility for determining how much of existing strategies should form the regional strategy on commencement. I cannot accept that it makes sense, however, for such responsibility to be given to another party, given the ensuing uncertainty and the risk of inconsistent decision-making. We explored that in Committee. We have therefore tabled Amendment 157G, which removes the concept and the process involved in a transitional arrangement. We are proposing instead that it should be automatic and that, on commencement, the regional strategy would simply consist of the RES and the spatial strategies that subsist on that day. That is a much more sensible outcome. It reduces the uncertainty, removes unnecessary procedure and recognises that considerable work has already gone into aligning the regional economic and spatial strategies such that we consider the risk of significant contradictions between them to be minimal. This approach would also deal with the concerns at the heart of Amendments 158 and 159, which would remove the Secretary of State from the process.</p>

<a name="90323-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="09032337000115"></a>We have also taken a fresh look at the process for approving revisions to regional strategy with a view to ensuring the right balance. The Secretary of State retains responsibility for approving the strategy but the end product is jointly owned by the responsible regional authorities. Our Amendment 164G takes up the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, in Committee. I am sorry that he is not in his place, as I would have liked to have seen his delight as we accepted this amendment. He proposed to remove the requirement for the Secretary of State to publish the approved strategy and to replace it with a requirement for responsible regional authorities to publish the approved strategy. That means that the regional authorities will publish the approved strategy. It does not take away the Secretary of State&#146;s responsibility for approving the final version but it gives the regional authorities a clear responsibility for publishing the final approved version. That confirms the leadership role that they have in drafting the strategy. I trust that both the amendments will meet with noble Lords&#146; approval.</p>

We recognise that the Government have gone some way with their amendment and we are grateful for that. That is encouraging and it is the second time today that they have removed some of the powers of the Secretary of State along the lines that we wanted. I hope that there might be further movement as we go through the legislation. We argued throughout the Committee that that should be so.</p>

<a name="90323-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="09032337000118"></a>I am still a little unclear about what elements of the existing strategies we are talking about. I gathered from the Minister that the Secretary of State would not look at RDAs&#146; individual strategies where they do not affect national policy and that they would be able to decide what they took forward. I give noble Lords an example. Since this legislation was written and thought about, there have been dramatic events and changes in the way in which development is taking place. Only this morning, I was looking at a large development in north Essex that has collapsed because the developers cannot afford the Section 106 agreements that they entered into because of the collapse in the price of the land. They want local authorities to put in some of the infrastructure that would have come out of the Section 106 agreements. Therefore, whatever strategy the Secretary of State or the RDA has, a lot of local decisions will have to be made. We are talking about 15 years for a development that was going to take place in the next three.</p>

<a name="90323-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="09032337000119"></a>The planning strategies in this legislation will be very much dependent on the economic situation in the next few years. Some of them are almost irrelevant for the moment; they might be more relevant in five years. It is very difficult to see how we are going to build some of the houses that are planned for. Therefore, whatever the Secretary of State says, a lot of local decisions will have to be made. I would like to see more of that in the legislation; I shall come back to that in a moment. However, I am grateful to the Minister. She has moved in our direction and clarified that the Secretary of State will not be as involved as we first feared. None the less, I would like to know a little more about how she sees the RDAs developing the regional strategy from day one under their own auspices.</p>

On Amendment 164G, I think that my noble friend Lord Greaves would probably say that he is glad to see the Government accepting sensible propositions and wishes that they would do more of it.</p>

<a name="90323-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="09032337000121"></a>Clause 74, to which our amendments relate, deals with the approval of revision by the Secretary of State. The amendments would ensure that any modifications to the draft revision of a regional strategy proposed by the Secretary of State were published for consultation so that any member of the public could make representations about the changes, with the views being considered by the Secretary of State before the revision was finalised and published.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_539"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 539</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90323-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="09032337000122"></a>As the Bill stands, the Secretary of State has the right to determine whom to consult. This exclusive discretion contrasts with the current process for the revision of the regional spatial strategy. Our first amendment would give the right to anyone who wished it to be consulted. Draft revisions of a regional strategy would be developed by the regional development agencies and the leaders&#146; boards in consultation with stakeholders&#151;that horrible word&#151;and local communities. It is important that those who live and work in a region are able to feed in to the development of the strategy, hence the second amendment.</p>

<a name="90323-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="09032337000123"></a>If, under the process for revising a regional spatial strategy set out in the current legislation, the 2004 Act, the Secretary of State proposes to make changes to the draft revision, those changes have to be published for public consultation. It seems to us that, if the Secretary of State decides to modify the strategy at this stage in the process, the changes should be published for consultation, so that views can be given and taken into consideration, as is consistent with the process for developing regional spatial strategies.</p>

<p><a name="st_185"></a>
<a name="09032342000001"></a><b><a name="90323-0014.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09032342000164"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> My Lords, these amendments cover a number of detailed aspects of the process for approving revisions to regional strategy, and I can understand the intentions behind them. Noble Lords want to strengthen the consultation requirements on the Secretary of State before approving or revising the draft strategy. It is absolutely not our intention to limit the Secretary of State&#146;s consultation in any way. Amendment 164C would make it explicit that the Secretary of State must publish a draft revision of a regional strategy for consultation and would delete the current provision for the Secretary of State to,</p>
<ul><a name="09032342000038"></a>&#147;consult such persons (if any) as the Secretary of State considers appropriate.&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="09032342000033"></a>Clause74(3) already requires the Secretary of State to engage in consultation which would automatically include publishing a document for consultation, which would obviously go as wide as possible.</p>

<a name="90323-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="09032342000002"></a>Amendment 164E would insert into Clause 74(3) a provision that &#147;any person&#148; can make representations on the proposed changes. Clause 74(4) already makes it clear that any person can make representations and the Secretary of State must have regard to those representations. That also takes care, in part, of Amendment 164C.</p>

<a name="90323-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="09032342000003"></a>Amendment 164H would insert an explicit requirement into Clause 74(5) for the Secretary of State to set out reasons for making any changes to the draft strategy revision submitted by the responsible regional authorities. We have had the regional spatial strategy process for some time now; it is a well established and welcome practice for the Secretary of State to set out the reasons for making further changes to strategy revisions. It is done in some detail so that everyone can see why the Secretary of State is recommending a different approach. It seems to me that there is little substantive difference between what the noble Baroness is proposing and the existing provisions. The important principle, on which we are absolutely agreed, is that there should be wide public consultation on the final draft of the strategy. We will make sure in guidance that that will be as clear a commitment as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="09032342000004"></a>I may not be able to answer the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, in exactly the context in which he raised it. He is absolutely right that we are in a very dynamic situation, and it is clear that the landscape over the next few years is going to look very different, whether we are talking about management of resources or the trajectory of housing starts. Clearly, our regional spatial strategies will have to be dynamic. We are looking at revisions to some strategies at the moment as more demographic information comes online.</p>

<a name="90323-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="09032342000005"></a>The important point about the amendment is that, instead of having what we originally proposed&#151;the concept of a transitional arrangement&#151;we will just have the regional spatial strategy in its present status and condition and the regional economic strategy. Together they will form the regional strategy on the day of commencement. There will not be any waiting for further changes or negotiation of accommodation&#151;that will be the starting point. The noble Lord was absolutely right that the delivery of our strategy will be affected by local economic realities. It is the combination of evidence, intelligence and forecasting that comes out of the RES and the RSS which forms the framework for development. In local decisions, of course, economic conditions are always a material consideration. There will be a feed-through into local decision-making as well. I am very happy to write to the noble Lord if he would like some more detail on how we see that process working.</p>

We talked a lot about regional strategies, their success and how they are going to happen or not going to happen, and I am sure that we will talk more about leaders&#146; boards and other things. Our contention is that regional strategies are not successful, do not work and that we would do better without them.</p>

<a name="90323-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="09032342000007"></a>When the Government published their proposals for this legislation, I thought that something might be happening that one could begin to agree with. We talked about economic assessments and EPBs, which are sub-regional, as well as MAAs and the development of LAAs, which everyone can support because their local authorities are working together for the best for that area, or groups of areas. They could all be successful because there are people on the ground who know the problems. As long as they are on EPBs and are mostly elected rather than appointed members, all three are recipes for success.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="09032342000008"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Smith, has talked about the north-west, and I accept that in some places it works differently. But that is my argument; the Government&#146;s whole approach should have been more flexible. Flexibility and different arrangements for different places would  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_541"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 541</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have delivered better results, because the country is very varied. In the east and the south-east, the regional strategies that we have had so far have not worked at all; they have resulted in a lot of arguments, with one area arguing against another and no decisions or conclusions being made about anything, even after four or five years. No real conclusions have been reached and no real sites have been developed in the south-east or the east, which contains 20 million people&#151;a great chunk of our country.</p>

<a name="90323-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="09032342000009"></a>As I have said several times during the passage of this legislation, I have spent most of my life in local government trying to get things to work and things to happen. I want to see housing and the economy improving, and a more flexible approach would have been much better. The Government have missed a tremendous opportunity here in developing that. I know that with legislation it is difficult to be flexible, but I would have liked to see some attempt to do that.</p>

<a name="90323-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="09032342000010"></a>The House of Commons Business and Enterprise Committee published a report a couple of weeks ago on RDAs and this Bill. Some interesting, revealing and illuminating evidence was given to the inquiry, which has produced a report. Paragraph 89 says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64"></a><a name="09032342000036"></a>&#147;Many witnesses raised the lack of RDAs&#146; skills in relation to spatial planning. RDAs stated that they were already addressing this shortage and would both inherit some staff from regional assemblies and recruit new staff&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09032342000034"></a>That does not sound very encouraging to me, when many local authorities, whether at unitary, district or county level, have very good planning officers and the capacity to do more of that work. We were defeated on an amendment a little while ago that might have involved different tiers of authorities in creating more of the planning requirements. The committee said other things about this legislation, which have not been addressed at all in our debates.</p>

<a name="90323-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="09032342000011"></a>I know that the Government will not agree with this amendment, but it is not too late to have a bit more flexibility in this legislation. It would have helped if the EPBs had more power, and perhaps that is the future. If there is a change of government in the not-too-distant future, EPBs could become much more responsible bodies, because they are at a sub-regional and more local level. They might get local authorities to work together to deliver what we all want to see. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="90323-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="09032342000013"></a>I am puzzled by this amendment, because it removes Clause 67 alone. The noble Lord has not tabled amendments to remove any of the subsequent clauses that follow on from this, on the review of regional strategy in Clause 70, and so on, or Clause 82, which brings in Schedule 5 and repeals, including among others the repeal of the first 12 sections of the 2004 legislation&#151;the regional spatial strategy clauses. I am not sure whether the noble Lord is intending to revert to the 2004 situation or to the pre-2004 situation. As and when he replies, he can deal with that and, perhaps, be a little clearer about the technical position, if I may put it that way. Although I absolutely take his point that one should deal with realities and then make the

<a name="90323-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="09032342000014"></a>As I understand it, the argument of the noble Lord is that there should be no strategy at a regional level. On these Benches, we take the view that what the Government have put in place is too over the ears&#151;too heavy, or too top down. We would much prefer a less heavy or rigid model than that, but we believe that there is a need for strategic work above the district level. That is where the noble Lord would leave us in some places, so I have some difficulty in following him on this.</p>

I take the point that the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, has just made: without Clause 67, the effect is that Part 5 of the Bill cannot be implemented, so the amendment is clearly significant. When we debated this issue in Committee, I resisted it strongly. I completely respect the experience and commitment of the noble Lord&#151;certainly his commitment to making sub-regional arrangements work, and to being highly innovative in his own area&#151;but I must disagree with him about the need for a spatial strategy that occupies the regional space.</p>

<a name="90323-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="09032342000016"></a>In Committee I spoke at some length about the role and scope of regional strategies and why I believe that a regional perspective and policy capacity will be needed even more in future, in the post-recession world. That world may well be faced&#151;the noble Lord has already indicated that he understands this&#151;with radical differences in location, in terms of jobs, regeneration, skills and housing, and with the extraordinary challenge of building a low-carbon economy. I do not want to reiterate those arguments, but I must briefly say why we need this part of the Bill and why the noble Lord is quite right that we cannot accept his amendment.</p>

<a name="90323-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="09032342000017"></a>This country has had regional strategy-making provision in various guises for decades, because successive Governments have recognised that there are strategic issues that can only be addressed at the right spatial level, whether that is national, regional, sub-regional or local. We are a country of regions, just like other European countries. Our regions have different strengths, demographics, histories and geographies, and they face different challenges on resources, land use, housing and regeneration, and on employment and natural environments. Each of our regions could put forward a different profile; each presents a different contribution to the future of the UK, the European and the world economies; and each faces different challenges in how to build aspirations, skills, jobs and enterprises, and how to deliver sustainable growth.</p>

<a name="90323-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="09032342000018"></a>Finding a solution to those challenges&#151;although the solution will differ and sometimes be more difficult in different regions&#151;can be effectively sought only at the right spatial level. Working at a regional level to link across higher education, for example, to plan for social cohesion, to create knowledge-based jobs, to reduce travel-to-work times and to target the right investment and regeneration, are all challenges common to all regions. To compete with global challenges

<a name="90323-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="09032342000019"></a>More than ever, we need a regional perspective and regional opportunities. The creation of a single regional strategy is a crucial tool to help strengthen our local and regional economies in a sustainable way. If every local authority had to prepare its own strategy in isolation, it would be a recipe for confusion and uncertainty. It is the opposite of what business and communities want. They want certainty, transparency and leadership. That is why our response to the consultation showed near universal support for the principles of a single regional strategy.</p>

<a name="90323-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="09032342000020"></a>The new strategies we are legislating for in the Bill will help support and grow our regional and local economies in a particularly potent way. The current system of separate strategies has led to fragmentation of both the number and range of strategies and organisations at the regional level.</p>

<a name="90323-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="09032342000021"></a>I took the liberty of taking some advice from the north-west as it moves towards its own analysis and configuration of its regional strategy. I am very grateful to be able to quote from its most recent document, <I>Principles and Issues</I><I> Paper</I>, as I think that it is a very compelling argument. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65"></a><a name="09032342000037"></a>&#147;We ... know that there will be increasing and sometimes competing, land-use pressures on the countryside, urban fringe, open spaces and brownfield land. All will be needed to deliver economic growth, infrastructure, housing, energy, adaption to increased flood risk and climate change, recreation, less intensive farming, food, and a valued landscape ... All these issues mean that we must ask ourselves fundamental questions about how our economy and society work. We will need to be radical in considering how we can integrate environmental, economic and social issues to achieve economic prosperity without unsustainable use of resources. We will need to address what sustainable models of business look like post recession, where the jobs of the future will come from and any fundamental long term changes in the world economy&#148;.</p>

<a name="90323-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="09032342000022"></a>The north-west has set out how it sees that vision unfolding for its region. That means an integrated vision for 20 years or so&#151;a strategic framework&#151;bringing together the spatial elements of policy on land use, planning, demographic and housing needs, which have been expressed so far in the regional spatial strategies. That has to be brought together with the evidence and planning for jobs, investment and enterprise, which has been held by the regional economic strategy. It is not so much an alignment of strategy, whether it is alignment in evidence or policy, as a way of expressing those elements together to get the right results in the use of natural resources, planning for urban and rural areas and housing, locating suitable transport, jobs and business. It is the only way we can hope to meet our greenhouse gas targets and our budgets and to identify the right regional parties and local interests which ensure that we have a strong delivery focus.</p>

<a name="90323-0014.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="09032342000023"></a>Therefore, in all those new strategies, we are looking for more than an alignment of evidence or policy; we are looking for a framework which will provide a more streamlined and timely process, with a better balance of priorities and local interests and a clear alignment between economic and spatial planning with a strong delivery focus. We also believe that, contrary to the  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_544"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column 544</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>fears raised by noble Lords opposite, this will increase the amount of local involvement in the preparation of regional strategies because of the considerable flexibility for local authorities to identify the priorities they feel able to tackle at local or sub-regional level, and to identify, through active participation in the leaders&#146; boards, what they consider to be regional priorities. The local authorities are in the driving seat of those proposals. We have talked about the importance of consultation and stakeholder engagement. The proposals do not centralise power because&#151;after extensive consultation, not least with the local authorities themselves&#151;we are confident that the balance is right for a genuinely equal partnership, a collaborative approach between the RDAs and the local authorities.</p>

<a name="90323-0014.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="09032342000024"></a>We have also made it clear that there are improved requirements to consult and engage communities and stakeholders with the process of independent testing of the regional strategy though an improved examination in public. Where the legislation provides for the Secretary of State to intervene, this intervention is limited. Where there are Secretary of State&#146;s powers, they are either not new or they are limited in scope.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="09032342000025"></a>I understand that the noble Lord has a deep-seated opposition to what we are doing. However, our proposals are widely supported by those whose job it is both to anticipate and to manage the future in practical ways. That came out in the consultation with a strong degree of consensus across the private and public sectors. The joint statement from the chief executives from the RDAs and the LGA, which was published last year, welcomed the strengthened role for local government in economic development and the introduction of a single regional strategy. As we have debated on a previous amendment, we do not want regional strategies that promote economic growth at all costs without full and proper regard and testing of whether they follow sustainable development principles.</p>

<a name="90323-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="09032342000026"></a>I understand that we will probably not agree on the need for a regional dimension for policy. However, we genuinely believe that a single integrated strategy is more crucial given our economic circumstances and how we will have to plan for the future. It will provide a better mechanism to address the challenges and opportunities facing all our regions and will put in place important preconditions for recovery in a sustainable way.</p>

It was quite long and I could give as long a reply with detailed arguments on all her points. I agree with virtually everything that she said towards the end, but I totally disagree that a regional strategy delivers it. Instead, we need a strategy worked out by authorities working together with a common aim and purpose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="09032342000028"></a>In the south-east, where the authorities have no common identity and the distances are so great, this would be unworkable. Most regions in Europe have about 1.5 million people. We have established artificial regions in this country, but European regions are historical and there are some very small ones. There are some big ones in Germany and Spain, but generally regions throughout Europe are much smaller and therefore people in them have a greater ability to work

I am pleased that the north-west is so successful but, if we asked detailed questions of people in Cumbria, I am not sure that they would totally agree all the time. There are differences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="09032342000029"></a>After many years, what we want is some system that will work. To answer the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, one would not want to go back to the position pre-2004. A development from that would be bottom-up and one would not have the same type of plans that one had in 2004. On the sorts of arguments that we have all been making about how you take the local government frameworks through to a county level and then through to a sub-regional level, you would get some results on both economic and planning strategies. However, there will be no results from this new legislation.</p>

Certainly, if the noble Baroness would like, we can table a whole series of amendments that would make this work. The pre-2004 position would need rethinking because the world has changed a lot, but it was much more local. I would like to see the development of a much more bottom-up approach. We did not table a lot more amendments, because we did not want to detain the House for a long while. If anyone wanted a lot more detail about what might happen if there were ever a Conservative Government, they could read the Conservative Green Paper on local government.</p>

It might work in some places, but it will not work in a lot of places. We are creating a piece of legislation, like we did four years ago, which someone will have to redo in two or three years&#146; time, because it will not work on the scale that has been suggested. I do not think that we will get very far today, but I should test the opinion of the House to make certain that it is on the record.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000004"></a>Tax credits, together with child benefit, deliver financial support to the vast majority of families with children in the UK and are vital in our commitment to tackle child poverty. I am pleased to introduce these regulations and orders, which increase certain elements and thresholds of tax credits and raise the guardian&#146;s allowance. In my view, the regulations and orders are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000005"></a>First, I turn to the Tax Credits Up-rating Regulations 2009. Tax credits play a major role in ensuring that work pays and in tackling child poverty. Overall, nearly 6 million families containing nearly 10 million children are benefiting from tax credits. These regulations bring forward the Government&#146;s commitment to increase the child element of the child tax credit by &#163;25 above indexation in April 2010 to April 2009. Added to the existing commitment to uprate the child tax credit, this means that the child element will therefore increase by &#163;75 above indexation to &#163;2,235 from April 2009. Since its introduction in April 2003, this element will have increased by &#163;790, benefiting 7.2 million children. From April 2009, a family with two children, with a single earner working full-time on the minimum wage, will receive around &#163;10 extra in tax credits per week compared to the previous year. Other rates and thresholds are also increased by these regulations. The disabled element of child tax credit and also most of the other WTC elements increase in line with prices.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC150"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column GC150</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90323-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000006"></a>I turn to the guardian&#146;s allowance orders. These will increase in line with prices to &#163;14.10 per week from April 2009. We normally debate these orders in conjunction with the child benefit orders. However, as the Committee will be aware, we debated these increases before Christmas, as the Government brought forward their commitment to increase child benefit to come into effect in January 2009, rather than in April. A family with two children will gain &#163;24 from bringing forward the increase to child benefit.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000007"></a>With the increases introduced by these instruments, we will be delivering even more support next year. We remain committed to the Government&#146;s goals on child poverty, and tax credits will remain a key part of this. As a result of all changes to the personal tax and benefit system since 1997, families with children in the poorest fifth of the population will be &#163;4,400 a year better off. I commend these regulations and orders to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="09032314000008"></a><b><a name="90323-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09032314000082"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> I thank the Minister for introducing the orders, which we look forward to each year. The orders are not themselves controversial, but as the Minister knows, he never gets away with quite an easy ride as finishing at that point. I have three issues to raise with him.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000009"></a>First, there is uprating for inflation. I am well aware that tax credits are not uprated by inflation but there is a requirement for the Treasury to review tax credits each year in line with the general level of prices and to publish the result of that review, which it has done. The Treasury decides which general level of prices to use; I understand that it uses the RPI&#151;at least, it has used 5 per cent in its calculations in the document attached to the Explanatory Memorandum. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000010"></a>With social security benefits that are income related, the Treasury uses the Rossi index; generally, it is lower than the RPI but last year it was higher. Tax credits are in effect income-related benefits. Why does the Treasury use the RPI rather than Rossi as its baseline for general prices; what is the logic of that? Linked to that, will the Minister comment on deflation? Tomorrow, we expect the RPI to go negative; doubtless Rossi will follow in due course. I do not ask the Minister to forecast the path of the RPI. Most commentators believe that when we get round to this autumn&#146;s numbers, which will be used to drive a number of benefits, we will have a fall of as much as 4 or 5 per cent in the level of the RPI. Will the Minister set out the Government&#146;s policy to items such as tax credits when we hit a period of falling prices? Will they leave tax credits the same in nominal terms, which would imply a significant real increase, or will they consider reducing the nominal amount to recognise the fall in price level?</p>

<a name="90323-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000011"></a>The second issue concerns the impact of tax credits on the Government&#146;s child poverty targets&#151;we have debated that and the Minister referred to it. When the tax credit changes were announced in the last PBR, it was claimed that there was no additional contribution to the child poverty targets because the reduction in the number of children in poverty was measured from the 2007 Budget and did not change between the Budget of 2008 and the PBR of 2008. The PBR was a sort of standstill in terms of child poverty. The Government  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC151"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column GC151</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have reduced the numbers since 1997 but the latest figures for 2006-07 showed an increase in the number of children in poverty and the signs are that the latest statistics will show further rises. The Government&#146;s target was to have lifted 1.7 million children out of poverty by 2010 with an intermediate milestone of 850,000 by 2004. They have lifted to date&#151;or to the latest date for which statistics are available&#151;only 600,000: they missed the 2004 milestone and most people believe that they will miss the 2010 target by a mile.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000012"></a>The latest research from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows that the number of children in poverty with parents in work has risen as a percentage of all children in poverty and that more than half of all children in poverty are now in families with working parents. That suggests that the tax credit programme as opposed to the benefits system is failing to have any real impact on the child poverty figures. It also shows that the Government have failed to create an environment in which work lifts families out of poverty. We firmly believe that in the long run work is the only viable route out of poverty and we thought that the Government shared that view. However, the statistics suggest that the Government&#146;s policies are running in the opposite direction.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000013"></a>Will the Minister update the Committee on the Government&#146;s approach to halving child poverty by 2010? That target does not look achievable. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Institute for Fiscal Studies calculated recently that, using benefits or tax credits alone, it will cost &#163;4.2 billion to achieve the 2010 target. I do not think we will be kidding ourselves that, in the context of the shaky finances we find in our country, the Government could even contemplate that scale of redistribution. So what will they do?</p>

<a name="90323-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000014"></a>My third topic is the role of the Social Security Advisory Committee. I was pleased to see that during last year, the Treasury gave up its obstinate refusal to allow the SSAC to report publicly on its work on tax credits. Doubtless, that has something to do with the change of Chancellor, but, whatever the reason, the decision is welcome. Somewhat later than expected, a revised memorandum of understanding was entered into in January of this year. The SSAC&#146;s reports on tax credits should now be made publicly, but we do not have a report before us to assist in our consideration of these orders. Was the SSAC given those draft orders for comment and has it raised any issues? If so, why is there no report in the public domain?</p>

<p><a name="09032314000015"></a><b><a name="90323-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09032314000083"></a>Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay:</b> Like those of the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, our questions and comments focus on the appropriate index for uprating and the outlook for inflation on the one hand and the affordability and complexity of child credits on the other. On the indices, people perhaps do not realise that retail prices are already clearly falling. Because we are mesmerised in this country by looking just at the 12-month rate, unlike a lot of professionals in the market who look at all sorts of indices including three-month rolling figures, the retail price index has already fallen by 3.8 per cent over the past four months and clearly has a good deal further to fall. Deflation has well and truly arrived.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC152"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column GC152</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90323-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000016"></a>In particular, what will happen next year to these upratings? For what it is worth, my central forecast is that money GDP over the next year will fall by 10 per cent; that is, a 5 per cent real fall in economic activity and a 5 per cent fall in prices. As the noble Baroness said, it is very much common ground among all serious commentators that we are looking at a period of falling prices. Can we have a categorical assurance that however fast prices fall over the next year, benefits will not be cut?</p>

<a name="90323-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000017"></a>As regards whether or not the policy instrument is working, do the Government not see that tax credits are not getting through to the people who need them? They are far too complex, and there is too much error and fraud. In addition, too much is going to people who do not need them at all, particularly to those who are well up the income scale with family incomes of as much as &#163;50,000 a year. Is that really a priority for public expenditure in today&#146;s recession and these difficult economic times?</p>

<a name="90323-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000018"></a>Clearly, the Government are failing abysmally on the child poverty target. Does the Minister recognise&#151;the noble Baroness did not mention this&#151;that this is a relative target? The Government have failed partly because of the rapid increase, under them, of incomes at the top end of the income scale. When will the Government do something about excessive greed and rapidly rising incomes at the top? Unlike the Conservatives, we on these Benches do not think that giving tax breaks for dead double millionaires through inheritance tax is either affordable or sensible in a recession. That sort of policy will only make the achievement of the child poverty target much harder. It is a relative target, which depends on relative incomes. Do the Government recognise and will they face up to that fact?</p>

<p><a name="09032314000019"></a><b><a name="90323-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09032314000084"></a>Lord Jones:</b> I thank my noble friend for his cogent and helpful explanation of the regulations. Hard-pressed families really do need every possible help. The Government have done good things for families and I should like them to have greater credit. Paragraph 10.2 of the Explanatory Memorandum refers to a considerable sum, which must be important to families in a time of serious recession and domestic financial strain. So today&#146;s news has to be welcomed. Can the Minister indicate by how much cash the payment has been increased since the payments were introduced some years ago?</p>

<a name="90323-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000020"></a>In paragraph 7.2 of the Explanatory Memorandum on the guardian&#146;s allowance, the uprating is indicated. Again, will the Minister state what the original first-time payment was? This allowance seems to be very helpful indeed to families, particularly to children. I am looking to see by how much Her Majesty&#146;s Government have increased the benefit since it was introduced, because the credit and the allowances are very important in today&#146;s circumstances.</p>

<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC153"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column GC153</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Baroness is really inviting me to range over the full philosophy behind tax credits and cover every issue since their introduction. I seek to concentrate primarily on the very interesting questions which were raised. At the same time, I hope to be sufficiently broad in my answer to meet both her points and those made by the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott. If I might say so, he invited me to embark on even wider consideration. I am not sure that this is the place to debate the proposals on inheritance tax, but a passing reference might be in order. I hope that at the end of that I will have convinced my noble friend Lord Jones of the value of what we sought to achieve.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000022"></a>On the question of which index we use, tax credits are part of the tax system, and we use the same indexation measure as other parts of the tax system, namely the RPI. Income tax allowances and rate bands are increased every September by the September RPI each year, unless Parliament determines otherwise. Child benefit uses this RPI because that is the uprating used for other non-income related social security benefits. There is a problem with Rossi because, as the noble Baroness says, it would produce rather different figures. At present and in the immediate future, Rossi excludes housing elements, which is appropriate for benefits such as housing benefit and council tax benefit, which are aimed to support housing costs. It is not appropriate for tax credits, which is a further reason why we should use RPI. There is nothing new in that.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000023"></a>The noble Baroness suggested that we have been very limited in our onslaught on the challenging issue of child poverty, as did the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, who was not overly complimentary about the Government&#146;s progress thus far. I understand that it is the function of the opposition parties to indicated their ambitions, should office ever arrive for the Liberal party or, even less likely, for the Conservative Party, when they would have to translate such ambitions into action and face up to issues in somewhat different terms than merely asking questions.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000024"></a>It is clear that in the PBR 2008 we recognise the need for help now, as far as low-income families are concerned. Low-income families and children will benefit not only from these upratings but from wider measures on personal taxation and VAT. I know that the party of the noble Baroness in particular&#151;I am not sure that the Liberal party was that far behind&#151;was somewhat scathing about the 5 per cent reduction in VAT.</p>

They will have benefited from our position on VAT. We are going to introduce a range of changes over the next few months, but the noble Baroness is right to say that  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC154"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column GC154</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we need to take stock of the very significantly changed financial and economic position. Where I think she is seeking a great deal of the Committee is in asking me to speculate on the implications of a negative retail price index. Not that I am not tempted to do so, but time is a wonderful thing and we do not have it in unlimited quantities. My noble friend is sitting eagerly beside me, ready to introduce the next debate. There are other items on the agenda today, and not just the Treasury is to have the chance to display its constructive wares on behalf of the Government.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000030"></a>More important is that the noble Baroness&#146;s question is fundamentally important. It involves Budget judgments for which we have to wait only a matter of three to four weeks before they are delivered. Those judgments will need to evaluate a situation which has been transformed since last year, and of course will set out the Government&#146;s forecasts and plans on uprating. However, she will rejoice in one factor, and that is that a negative RPI means that even if uprating did not take place, a negative RPI would be an advantage for families because of the consequent drop in the cost of living. Although we have a range of monumental problems around the credit crunch and the recession to which the Budget must be addressed, one of the plus factors for families is that a move towards negative inflation&#151;which the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, also predicted with finality and, I am sure, great accuracy&#151;may change the lengths to which their existing incomes will actually stretch. However, the noble Baroness will be the first to recognise that a debate on the financial situation and macroeconomic policy is a little beyond the range of this Committee and marginally above the pay grade of the Minister replying to this debate on child benefits.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000031"></a>In response to the more general points, I recognise the anxieties expressed about the 2010 target. The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, followed the noble Baroness in upbraiding the Government on it. The target was always an ambitious one and in difficult times it will prove to be even more so, but since 2007 we are expecting to have lifted around a further 500,000 children out of poverty, while before that year we had lifted 600,000. We recognise that the target we set for 2010 is yet to be attained and that there are real challenges attached to it, but I am absolutely confident that my noble friend Lord Jones will give the Government full credit for their achievements thus far in lifting children out of poverty through child tax credits and other related measures.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000032"></a>There has been substantial investment in tackling this issue, which we are sustaining. Prevention is at least as important as cure in the form of support. The problem with prevention is that in a period of savage decline in the global economy and the increase in unemployment in all advanced countries, including the United Kingdom, extra burdens will be placed on the Government in terms of giving help to those in very real need. Changes will be introduced over the coming months. We have proven our commitment thus far to achieving our ambition of removing child poverty and to the targets for 2010 and 2020. However, in these difficult economic circumstances, I do not underestimate the fact that those targets will become even more difficult to achieve. However, on the broader

<a name="90323-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000033"></a>As regards the rise in tax credits over time, the guaranteed minimum income&#151;my noble friend asked about this&#151;for a working couple without children has risen by 52 per cent in real terms since 1999 from &#163;117 per week to &#163;232 per week as a result of consistent increases to the national minimum wage and to the working tax credit. I am sure that my noble friend will recognise the value of those changes.</p>

<p><a name="09032314000034"></a><b><a name="90323-gc0001.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09032314000090"></a>Lord Jones:</b> I am grateful to my noble friend for those comments. The record and the increase are very good. However, I should like the appropriate arm of Government to promulgate these successes a little more effectively than has been the case previously&#151;not that I direct that friendly criticism at my noble friend.</p>

<p><a name="09032314000035"></a><b><a name="90323-gc0001.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09032314000091"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> That is kind of my noble friend. He interrupted me as I was in full flow, extolling the virtues of the Government&#146;s achievements. As a result of all changes to direct tax and benefit since 1997, by October of this year, families will be on average &#163;2,100 a year better off in real terms, and families with children in the poorest fifth of the population will be on average &#163;4,400 a year better off, which shows where we have directed our priorities in terms of tackling child poverty and helping poorer-off families. I accept my noble friend&#146;s congratulations on behalf of the Government. I am with him on the necessity of sustaining this progress as far as we can. I beg to move.</p>

If he cannot give that assurance, it will be very worrying for many people who rely on these benefits.</p>

<p><a name="09032314000037"></a><b><a name="90323-gc0001.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="09032314000093"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> As I indicated, we shall have to wait a month to hear the Chancellor set out in the Budget the Government&#146;s broader strategy on managing the economy. The noble Lord would be the first to emphasise that we live in greatly changed times. However, he will appreciate that it is clear from the regulations that we are committed to this year&#146;s increases, but that decisions have not yet been taken for the future. I emphasise that a falling index is an unparalleled feature in his and my lifetime. I am a few years older than the noble Lord and I cannot remember a falling index.</p>

It is expected that the Government and wider society will have to respond to it in very different ways than was the case with the incident to which the noble Lord refers. In fact, we have to go back to the 1930s before we see parallel circumstances. However, that debate is a little wide of today&#146;s regulations and I shall resist the temptation to enter it, although the noble Baroness might provoke me to do so.</p>

<p><a name="09032314000043"></a><b><a name="90323-gc0002.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09032314000101"></a>The Minister of State, Department for Transport (Lord Adonis):</b> The order will give legal effect to changes to an existing scheme that requires suppliers of fossil fuel for road transport to ensure that a proportion of the fuel they supply is renewable.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000044"></a>The legislation before us is of key importance in our efforts to tackle climate change. Biofuels are the most readily available technological alternative to fossil fuels. They will play a key role in meeting our European renewable energy targets and keeping within our forthcoming carbon budgets. It is of both environmental and economic importance that we amend the order today.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000045"></a>The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation was introduced in April 2008 by the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations Order 2007, made under powers contained in the Energy Act 2004. The RTFO obligates suppliers of fossil-based road transport fuels to source a certain percentage of their fuels in the United Kingdom from renewable sources. If they do not supply enough renewable fuel themselves, they can buy renewable transport fuel certificates from renewable fuel suppliers or pay a buyout price.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000046"></a>The RTFO is administered by the Renewable Fuels Agency, which operates an internationally acclaimed carbon and sustainability reporting system. In the year from April 2008 to April 2009 the RTFO obligation level is 2.5 per cent of total fuel supplied. &#147;Total fuel&#148; means the total amount of renewable fuel and relevant hydrocarbon oil. In other words, suppliers have to produce certificates for an amount of renewable fuel equivalent to 2.5 per cent of the total fuel that they supply. Under the 2007 order the obligation level increases each obligation year until it reaches 5 per cent in 2010-11.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000047"></a>I take this opportunity to refer to the helpful consideration of this draft amendment order by the Merits Committee. In response to its seventh report I wrote to the committee on 27 February and provided some additional information about our biofuel policies. I hope that that response has been helpful, and I would be happy to answer any further questions on the points raised in their report.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000048"></a>Three important changes will be made to the RTFO as a result of the draft amendment order. First, it will slow down the rate of increase of the annual RTFO obligation levels. The obligation level will reach 5 per cent of total fuel supplied by 2013-14, instead of by 2010-11. This slow-down is in response to concerns about the current sustainability of existing biofuel production, following the publication of the Gallagher review in July 2008.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000049"></a>The Gallagher review concluded that biofuels have the potential to deliver approximately 338 million to 371 million tonnes of global carbon dioxide savings every year. However, because of sustainability concerns, Gallagher proposed a slower rate of increase for our obligation levels than that set out in the 2007 order. That is why we are amending the RTFO order today: to give effect to the Gallagher recommendations.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000050"></a>Secondly, the draft order will correct a significant problem that we have identified with the definition of &#147;relevant hydrocarbon oil&#148; in the 2007 order. The   


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC158"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column GC158</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>definition determines whether a supplier is obligated, and, if so, how many certificates the supplier must produce. In short, this means that obligated suppliers have the opportunity to supply lower volumes of biofuels than we intended when we made the 2007 order. Clearly this would have an undesirable effect on the demand for biofuel products.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000051"></a>The order in front of the Committee today corrects this problem, with effect from 15 April this year. It also proposes a higher obligation level than we originally consulted on for the next obligation year, which commences next month. This is to help make up for any shortfall in the levels of biofuel supplied over the past year as a result of the problem to which I have just referred. Accordingly, the obligation level for 2009-10 will be 3.25 per cent of total fuel supplied, instead of the 3 per cent level recommended by the Gallagher review. This problem needs to be corrected now if we are to prevent it continuing into the next obligation year and to avoid any unwanted consequences for the UK biofuels industry. However, we do not have powers under the Energy Act to legislate retrospectively.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000052"></a>Thirdly, we are adding two new fuels to the renewable fuels eligible for certificates under the scheme: namely, biobutanol and renewable diesel. This increases the flexibility for obligated suppliers to meet their obligation in the future.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000053"></a>The changes before the Committee today are intended to balance the environmental concerns about the impacts of biofuel production with the need for greater investor certainty in renewable energy. If left unresolved, the problem with the definition of relevant hydrocarbon oil in the 2007 order could depress demand for biofuels and threaten the future of the UK biofuels industry. It would also be a step backwards in our plans to meet our climate change goals. I therefore commend the order to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="09032314000054"></a><b><a name="90323-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09032314000102"></a>Earl Attlee:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s explanation of the order. I propose to make a few initial observations, and then look forward to hearing other noble Lords. With the leave of the Committee, I may make some winding-up comments.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000055"></a>It is, to say the least, extremely unfortunate that the definition of &#147;relevant hydrocarbon oil&#148; in the original RTFO order was defective. Worse still was the difficulty in rectifying the problems which the Minister described. This is despite all the care that is taken when drafting statutory instruments. I was on the JCSI for a while, and it surprised me how many drafting errors slipped into secondary legislation.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000056"></a>When we agreed the principle of a renewable transport fuel obligation, if we are honest, we must admit that we all thought that it would work just as well as the non-fossil fuel obligation for generating electricity. However, the reality is rather different. We are now suffering under the law of unintended consequences. When I pressed the print button to print one of the department&#146;s publications, little did I realise that I would be printing 71 pages of detailed analysis: a sure sign of serious problems.</p>

Given the high proportion of our CO2 emissions arising from road transport operations, it is an obvious thing to do. However, our overall objective must be to reduce our global CO2 emissions. To do that, we need to substitute renewable fuels and power for fossil fuels. The problem is that road transport fuels, principally petrol and diesel, have to be produced to a very tight specification, otherwise engine damage or poor fuel economy or performance will result. On the other hand, a thermal steam-raising power station is relatively insensitive to fuel quality; thus the biofuel, or waste carboniferous fuel, being burnt in a thermal power station would not need much processing, so the fuel economy would be much higher. Is there not a horrible possibility that while renewable transport fuels are desirable, it might be better to concentrate our carboniferous fuel substitution efforts on power stations, for all the reasons given in the Gallagher review? Gallagher did not necessarily propose that; I am  merely asking whether we are going in the right  direction.</p>

<p><a name="09032314000058"></a>Although not all noble Lords may agree, it may be right to slow the rate of increase on renewable transport fuels, but it is very much work in progress and the jury is out.</p>

<p><a name="09032314000059"></a><b><a name="90323-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09032314000103"></a>Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay:</b> It has been a busy weekend for rugby but little did I think that, between three orders as Treasury spokesman and four orders as pension spokesman, I was going to get a hospital pass from my noble friend Lord Bradshaw a few minutes ago&#151;he sends his apologies; he has to be at another Committee meeting at four o&#146;clock&#151;to ask if I would also take on this order. I will do my best.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000060"></a>The Minister talked about the helpful report from the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee. He said he had written a letter about it, although I am afraid I have not seen it. Will he say a little more about the question that the committee properly raised&#151;that is, that Professor Gallagher&#146;s review indicated that it is doubtful whether biofuels will actually reduce greenhouse gases? It commended the Department for Transport on taking a more cautious approach but said that,</p>
<ul><a name="09032314000065"></a>&#147;due to the minimal evidence provided&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09032314000064"></a>the committee,</p>
<ul><a name="09032314000066"></a>&#147;can only continue to question whether the commitment under the European Directive of requiring road transport to use  10 per cent of renewable fuels by 2020 is either achievable or desirable&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90323-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000061"></a>The Gallagher committee made the point that the case for biofuel use is not fully proven. I ask the Minister, as that committee did, for more information about how much feedstock is produced domestically and how much is imported. Obviously it is a heavy item that affects the carbon footprint. Where do the Government now stand on the 2020 target?</p>

<a name="90323-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09032314000062"></a>I have one other, less serious question from reading the report. As I have to admit that I did only one term of physics at school and one of chemistry&#151;there was no national curriculum in those far-off days&#151;will the Minister please tell me what an ester is? I am afraid it means nothing to me.</p>

I think the Minister is aware that I have been involved in biofuels almost since the word was first spoken, but we are now in the most terrible mess and muddle, not least because the biofuel industry straddles four different ministries: Defra, BERR, the Department for Transport and, not least, the Treasury. I was a member of a &#147;gang of four&#148; who persuaded the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, to accept the principle of a renewable transport fuel obligation during the 2004 Energy Act. From early days we were trying to persuade the Government that a tax rebate for biofuels was essential.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000001"></a>We did that because of the benefit to the UK economy in terms of opportunities for agriculture and manufacturing, and the contribution that renewable fuels could make to reducing the UK&#146;s carbon emission. The oil companies were not going to use biofuels unless it was in their commercial interest to do so or they were forced to do so by legislation. Of course, it took European Union legislation in the form of the biofuels directive in 2003 for the Government to act decisively.</p>
<h5><a name="09032316000184"></a>4.15 pm</h5>

<a name="90323-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000002"></a>Once their hand was forced, the Government introduced a fuel duty rebate of a rather miserly 20p per litre for biodiesel and bioethanol. Although that was not enough, it was at least a starting point. It soon became clear that this rebate would be insufficient for the UK to reach the targets it had agreed in the biofuels directive. Again, because the European Union forced them to look at policy by threatening infraction proceedings against the United Kingdom, the Government looked at introducing this original renewable transport fuel obligation. The decision to introduce the original RTFO was taken only because of the increase in oil prices, and not because the Government had any vision about how they would tackle rising carbon emissions in the road transport sector or interest in promoting the UK economy.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000003"></a>Over all those years, the Government showed that they were supremely good at talking about the urgent need to take action to combat climate change, but the reality was that nothing was happening. Carbon emissions in the transport sector have risen 20 per cent in the past five years. It is very distressing. My noble kinsman referred to the Gallagher report. The Government were also good at producing endless consultations, but their record of taking decisions in these matters has been one of far too little and far too late. Less than a year into the life of the renewable transport fuel obligation, the Government want to change it&#151;not to make the targets more stretching because we face catastrophic climate change, but to reduce them.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000004"></a>Why should there be a reduction? I do not take on board all the points made by the Minister. The Government appear to be taking their orders from the green groups, which have found a brilliant way to raise their own income; namely, to produce scare stories about all biofuels and get the public to pay up. I know a little bit about what I am talking about here. It must be agreed that the Government have also made a mess of drafting their legislation.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC161"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column GC161</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90323-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000005"></a>In the recent past, at no stage in the debate has any serious consideration been given by the Government to the fortunes of the United Kingdom and the missed opportunity for economic activity, particularly during this time of recession. UK agriculture is about to contribute to reducing carbon in the transport sector, not by starving anyone, but by increasing production and productivity. The record of UK agriculture has been exemplary over the past few decades&#151;I declare an interest as a farmer who grows oilseed rape for biofuel production&#151;and has risen to the challenge of feeding us all. I feel certain that the farming community will rise to this new challenge of providing fuel.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000006"></a>According to the Government&#146;s Renewable Fuels Agency, the UK biofuels sector produces biofuels with the highest sustainability scores. It delivers greenhouse gas savings of 69 per cent compared to the fossil fuel average of 42 per cent and 99 per cent meet environmental sustainability standards. Why therefore do we not encourage the sector to do more? Instead, we stop them by reducing these targets and we punish them further by making them pay for the Government&#146;s mistake. No biofuel manufacturer will invest any more money in what has in many cases been an absolute disaster due to no help at all from the Government. I fear that once again Britain will lose out in this emerging market, which would be a terrible shame.</p>

<p><a name="09032316000007"></a><b><a name="90323-gc0002.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09032316000210"></a>Viscount Eccles:</b> I have a great deal of sympathy with some of the wide-ranging points put by the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, and a certain overlap with my noble friend. However, I would like to come at this subject from a different point of view; that is, with a rather sharp critique of the way the order was presented to the Merits Committee, of which I am a member, and where I think its approach was wholly inadequate to this very important subject. Because of the faulty definition and the reactions of the fuel suppliers to it, we are now faced with a new start, and indeed not anywhere in the evidence presented to us have we had a critique of the way the renewable transport fuel certificate system is working. All we know is that the UK made a pretty slow start on biofuels and is still markedly behind the game. In such an important area as climate change, to miss the opportunity of reviewing the wider Government policy towards biofuels and the progress made against it is, I think, not what we would expect from the Department for Transport.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000008"></a>It has been pointed out that there is a difficulty; we keep being told that we have a joined-up Government, but in this instance the joined-up aspect has not been achieved. What did the Explanatory Memorandum tell us? We are due to have a revised one in answer to the point made by the Merits Committee that no reference was made to the impact on the UK biofuels industry, whether the agricultural, processing or distribution parts of it. The memorandum states that we have to conform with the renewable energy directive and that the slowdown mentioned in the opening policy statement is,</p>
<ul><a name="09032316000178"></a>&#147;in response to concerns about the sustainability and food impacts of indirect land use change&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09032316000169"></a>The Minister referred to sustainability, but the EM connects it absolutely to the Gallagher conclusion about the possible impacts of indirect land use change.  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC162"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column GC162</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>How does that conclusion affect the United Kingdom? We import 14 per cent of our present biofuels from Brazil in the form of bioethanol, and it all comes from sugar cane. Brazil has been producing bioethanol from sugar cane for the past 30 years, and even 20 years ago a 20 per cent blend was being used in Brazilian motor cars that had nothing to do with climate change, but with substituting for imports. Brazil has no indigenous supplies of oil, so for many years the Brazilians have been interested in producing bioethanol and blending it with petrol. They are also the world&#146;s largest producer of sugar from sugar cane, with Australia coming in second.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000009"></a>I was for a while the chairman of the trustees of Kew Gardens. I heard about deforestation in Brazil for the purposes of cattle and soya, but I am not aware of it having been an issue that has affected the Brazilian sugar cane industry. There is no evidence in the Explanatory Memorandum or the regulatory impact assessment to connect the Gallagher conclusion with Brazil. Secondly, there is a strong conclusion about South-East Asia, Indonesia and Malaysia related to palm oil, which forms 7 per cent of the UK&#146;s consumption of biofuels, in this case biodiesel. It is perfectly true that there are issues about biodiversity and deforestation that relate to the planting of oil palms. However, we have to remember that the oil palm is the most productive vegetable oil plant in the world, and much more productive than soya and oilseed rape. It is much more highly productive than soya oil or oilseed rape. It is dangerous to draw conclusions from the fact that 7 per cent of the UK&#146;s imports relate to oil palm. What about the indirect effects on land use of the rest of the UK&#146;s consumption&#151;75 per cent of it, approximately? That is mainly imported from the United States and produced in Europe, including the UK and, to a degree, in Argentina, which has a temperate climate. There is an analysis in the RFA&#146;s reports about how much of this is from existing cropland. The answer with UK production is that 100 per cent is from cropland. I do not believe that there are any indirect land use effects in the UK. In the Explanatory Memorandum and the RIA, there is absolutely no evidence that there is. I suspect that the issue in the case of the USA is about how much support the US Government should give to their farmers, particularly in relation to soya beans, but that is a different issue&#151;it has nothing to do with the Gallagher conclusion.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000010"></a>We move from the Explanatory Memorandum to the regulatory impact assessment. For the first time, that raises the question of greenhouse gas emissions and gas savings. That is not in the Explanatory Memorandum, although that is the heart of the Government&#146;s policy on biofuels. In the latest RFA report, the savings are calculated at over 40 per cent; so far, so good. It says that if we were able to calculate indirect effects, it might be somewhat lower. I do not think that it would be much lower for the UK. If future calculations show that it is, I hope that we will be presented with it.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000011"></a>Deep in the RIA, after a passage about government intervention, which in essence is a negative intervention&#151;that is to say, &#147;You will pay if you cannot produce certificates&#148;; as the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, said, that is something that people have to live with because  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC163"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column GC163</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of climate change although it is not something that they enjoy&#151;we are told that the 20p duty rollback will disappear at the end of the coming financial year. The government intervention will become all stick and no carrot in April 2010. It is very distressing that throughout this presentation, there is no mention of UK agriculture or UK processors, yet sugar beet provides 16 per cent of our bioethanol usage; it is a UK supply and does not have indirect land-use issues. The hectarage of sugar beet has been going down because although the performance of the beet has been pretty good in terms of yield, the price has been very poor. I do not think that the sugar beet issue has any effect on food supplies in the UK or in the world, where there is&#151;there always has been in my time in tropical agriculture&#151;plenty of sugar.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000012"></a>I turn to the oilseed rape market. The document is silent on the production of diesel from oilseed rape, yet we import 15 per cent of the biodiesel that we use from Germany; we produce only 6 per cent from UK supply. One asks what is going on to make that the situation. I thought that the Common Market was a level playing field and I find it difficult to believe that Germany can produce oilseed rape at a lower cost than the UK.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000013"></a>The UK processors&#151;I will finish very shortly&#151;are basically living on used cooking oil and, to a degree, on tallow and sugar beet as domestic supplies of feedstock. Some of their plants are working at well below capacity. Every now and again we are told that there are great hopes for second generation biofuels, which somehow will put all this right, even though in the Government&#146;s view, the primary agriculture market does not seem able to perform. I am very sceptical about second generation feedstocks. It is freely said that they are waste materials, but the great majority of them do not have no use at present. Do we have a United Kingdom policy on biofuels? If we do, what is it, or are we just waiting to be told by Brussels what to do next?</p>

Obviously the order corrects a government mistake but what really worries me is that all these producers stand to lose 500 million renewable transport certificates according to the latest figures that I got this morning, which amounts to something in the region of &#163;300 million. Will the Government compensate these growers? I hope that the Minister will give a categorical assurance

When we originally dreamed this up four years ago, it never crossed our mind that we would be cutting down the rainforest, growing sugar, making ethanol and shipping it half way round the world. It was absolute madness. I also look forward to hearing the answer that the Minister will give to the noble Earl.</p>

The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, may be aware that I wrote to that committee on 27 February, and that we have been revising the impact assessment, which I hope has given him more information.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000018"></a>There is a big question and a number of little questions. I shall deal with a few of the little questions first. I welcome the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, to our debates. The proportion of UK biofuel coming from domestic feedstock is about 8 per cent at the moment. The noble Lord asked me what ester is. I am afraid that I am coming to the limits of my knowledge here but I am told that it is a chemical compound that mimics, or substitutes for, diesel. I say to the noble Earl that we cannot discriminate between different biofuels suppliers, which is why it is so important for us to ensure that we have a sustainable basis for production at the European and domestic levels. I again put on the record that I agree it is extremely unfortunate that the definition of &#147;relevant hydrocarbon oil&#148; in the 2007 order was inadequate for the purpose. It was precisely for that reason that we regarded it as our duty to come forward with this amendment as soon as we could in order to give the confidence that the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, and the noble Viscount seek as regards the future of the biofuels industry.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000019"></a>I think that I can respond fairly robustly to the major question that underpins the debate. It is not the case that we do not see a strong future for the biofuels industry: we do. Indeed, I have met the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, to discuss his interest in biofuel production, as well as quite a number of biofuel suppliers, and I know that they are doing good work. However, to balance the support and confidence that we must give to the biofuels industry with concerns about the environmental sustainability of certain biofuels, we asked Professor Ed Gallagher, the chair of the Renewable Fuels Agency, to look at the whole issue last year. He produced a report that runs to 90 pages and looks at a large number of the issues that have been raised in the debate.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000020"></a>I took the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, to be criticising the Government for not supplying sufficient information to the Merits Committee. We took it for granted that the Gallagher report would be available to the committee; indeed, we supplied it. It is the most substantial and in-depth assessment that has been made of issues such as indirect land use and the sustainability of biofuels. Perhaps the most useful thing that I can do to indicate  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC165"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column GC165</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Government&#146;s stance is simply to quote from the Gallagher report and its conclusions, which, as I say, were published only last July and formed the basis of government policy on biofuels and the course that we are taking in the ongoing negotiations in Brussels.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000021"></a>In the report&#146;s foreword, Professor Gallagher says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09032316000175"></a>&#147;We cannot afford to abandon biofuels as part of a low carbon transport future. Equally, we cannot continue producing biofuels&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09032316000170"></a>&#147;we&#148; means not only UK producers but producers globally&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09032316000179"></a>&#147;which are ultimately more environmentally and socially damaging than the fossil fuels they seek to replace&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90323-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000022"></a>The report concluded:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09032316000176"></a>&#147;This review concludes that it should be possible to establish a genuinely sustainable industry provided that robust, comprehensive and mandatory sustainability standards are developed and implemented. It further concludes that the risks of indirect effects can be significantly reduced by ensuring that the production of feedstock for biofuels takes place on idle and marginal land and by encouraging technologies that utilise appropriate wastes and residues. A framework for such policies is proposed, but significant challenges remain in the detailed design, implementation and enforcement ... The RFA judgement, based upon the balance of evidence is that if all subsidies and other support for biofuels were removed entirely, this would reduce the capacity of the industry to respond to the challenges of transforming its supply chain and investing in advanced technologies. However, the rate of introduction of biofuels should be slowed until adequate controls are established&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09032316000171"></a>That is precisely the Government&#146;s policy. It was precisely in response to those recommendations by Professor Gallagher&#151;a good deal of the points raised by the noble Viscount are, as I say, addressed in the 90-page report&#151;that we announced after careful consideration late last year our intention to slow down the rate of growth in the targets for biofuel, to achieve the 5 per cent target by 2013-14 rather than 2010-11, to remain committed in principle to more ambitious targets for 2020, and to have the EU review in 2013-14: all in the cause of establishing a firm and clear policy base on which we could reassure those who have expressed concerns about the environment and give confidence to biofuel producers that we remain committed to the progressive increase in the supply of biofuels&#151;the present generation of biofuels as well as the second generation to which the noble Viscount referred. In doing that we also give confidence to the investors, who, as I well appreciate, are making significant investments in this area.</p>

Having met representatives of the industry over recent weeks, I know it is a concern of theirs that there should be a clear trajectory beyond 2013-14 for the growth in the supply of biofuels and it is our intention, when we submit our action plan to the Commission, to publish indicative trajectories beyond that year. The cross-sector stakeholder group, which includes leading biofuel suppliers as well as environmental groups, will be meeting from next month.

With regard to the order we are debating today, however, I stress again to the Committee that if we do not support this amendment to the RTFO now, the discrepancy that has caused so much concern to suppliers will remain uncorrected. In effect, that would give fossil-fuel suppliers the opportunity to avoid the obligation in future through blending small quantities of biofuel with their fossil fuel. That outcome would damage both the biofuel industry and our efforts to tackle climate change. While we accept that we need to establish as soon as we reasonably can a clear trajectory for further development of biofuels beyond 2013-14, the order is necessary. As I say, it is part of a clear government policy for the development of biofuels. We could not have sought to address the underlying concerns and evidence more thoroughly than we did with the work of the Gallagher committee that was published last year; it is a comprehensive analysis that is informing our negotiating position in Brussels and has led to clear statements of policy that I believe give confidence to the industry about the development of biofuels over the next five years, while in the summer we will be publishing our further indicative trajectory for meeting the 10 per cent target. Taking all these factors into account, I think the order deserves the Committee&#146;s support.</p>

He did not study what was happening with sugar beet in East Anglia or what was happening about oilseed rape in Yorkshire. There was no UK focus. There is a question mark about tallow, which is not related to the same issues as the sustainability criteria for normal agricultural crops, but so far as I know there is no sustainability issue with UK-grown oilseed rape, nor with sugar beet. If there is, we should be told about it. If the Minister and his colleagues spend the next three years looking at the global issues, what will happen to the industry in the United Kingdom?</p>

That is no reflection on the domestic suppliers, simply a statement of the necessity that we face to see that the industry as a whole is put on a sustainable basis if we are going to see the significant increase in biofuels that we want so that they can replace fossil fuels. They must do so on a basis that does not have unacceptable negative environmental impacts.</p>

</ul>

<p><a name="09032316000029"></a><b><a name="90323-gc0003.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09032316000220"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> In 2002, this Government recognised that members of defined-benefit occupational pension schemes were underprotected if their sponsoring employer failed. That is why we used the Pensions Act 2004 to establish the Pension Protection Fund. It is a statutory fund that protects members of defined-benefit occupational pension schemes and members of the defined-benefit parts of schemes that are a hybrid of defined-benefit and defined-contribution schemes.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000030"></a>The fund pays a statutory level of compensation if the sponsoring employer of the scheme experiences what is called a qualifying insolvency event, such as when a company enters administration; if there is no possibility of a scheme rescue; or if there are insufficient assets in the scheme to pay benefits at PPF compensation levels&#151;broadly, 90 per cent for deferred and active members and 100 per cent for people over normal pension age.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000031"></a>The fund is administered by the board of the Pension Protection Fund, a public corporation. The fund is funded from three sources: the assets of pension schemes that transfer to it, including any recoveries from former employers; a levy charged on the schemes that are protected by it; and investment returns on those assets.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000032"></a>The Pension Protection Fund ensures that members of eligible defined-benefit schemes still receive a meaningful income in place of the pension they worked for and would have received had their employer not experienced a qualifying insolvency event, and the fund of which they are a member is unable to pay benefits at Pension Protection Fund levels.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC168"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column GC168</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90323-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000033"></a>The &#147;purple book&#148; published by the Pension Protection Fund and the Pensions Regulator in December 2008 estimates that around 7,400 private sector defined-benefit schemes are protected by the Pension Protection Fund. Since 2005, 112 schemes have been assessed by the Pension Protection Fund following an employer insolvency event. A further 295 schemes, with around 134,000 members, are currently being assessed. At the end of February, 8,215 former scheme members were receiving compensation at an average cost of &#163;4,000. A further 21,653 former scheme members are already due to receive compensation when they retire.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000034"></a>The Committee will be aware that when Members in another place considered these instruments last week, they spent some time discussing the impact of current economic conditions on the PPF. All sides recognised the valuable protection that the PPF offers to scheme members, and explored some important questions about what the future might hold with my right honourable friend the Minister for Pensions and the Ageing Society.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000035"></a>We should be vigilant to ensure that the PPF is able to continue to offer protection to members of defined-benefit pension schemes, and that we take steps to deal with threats to the PPF. That is why, for example, the Pensions Act 2008 extended the powers of the Pensions Regulator and, as the Committee will recall, we were concerned that new business models seeking to offer alternatives to insured buyouts of pension scheme liabilities highlighted the disproportionate risk to the PPF that could arise from mechanisms by which shell employers became sponsors of pension schemes. After careful scrutiny, Parliament agreed that powers were needed to deal with such risks.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000036"></a>Vigilance is needed, particularly in difficult economic times such as these when trustees or employers may well hear siren voices suggesting actions such as transferring pension schemes to shell employers as a way of evading liabilities or otherwise bypassing the controls set out in legislation to limit the PPF&#146;s exposure to claims. The Government have made it clear that pension liabilities should generally be backed by substantive employers or by the regulatory capital held by insurance companies. The Committee will no doubt be glad to hear that the regulator is indeed prepared to act if it considers that trustees or employers are seeking to abuse the system.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000037"></a>I now turn to the draft Pension Protection Fund (Pension Compensation Cap) Order 2009, under which a cap on the level of the Pension Protection Fund compensation is applied to scheme members who are below their scheme&#146;s normal pension age at the point immediately before the employer&#146;s insolvency event. These members are entitled to the 90 per cent level of compensation when they retire.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000038"></a>Under the Pensions Act 2004, increases to the compensation cap are linked to increases in the general level of earnings. To increase the compensation cap for 2009-10, we must consider average earnings in Great Britain, as measured by the average earnings index and published by the Office for National Statistics in the 2007-08 tax year, which shows an increase of 3.5 per cent. Such an increase gives a new cap of &#163;31,936.32 for the 2009-10 tax year. This means that  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC169"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column GC169</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the total value of compensation payments for members below normal pension age shall not exceed &#163;28,742.69 for the new tax year. The new cap will apply to members who first became entitled to compensation at the 90 per cent level on or after 1 April 2009. The order ensures that the level of the compensation cap is maintained in line with the increase in earnings, as required under the Pensions Act 2004.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000039"></a>I now turn to the draft Occupational Pension Schemes (Levy Ceiling) Order 2009. The pension protection levy is the responsibility of the board of the Pension Protection Fund. The levy ceiling is one of the statutory controls on the pension protection levy. Rather than set the rate of the levy, it restricts the amount that the board can raise in any one year. The levy ceiling for 2008-09 was set at &#163;833 million.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000040"></a>Under the Pensions Act 2004, the levy ceiling is increased annually in line with increases in the general level of earnings in Great Britain, using the rate for the 12-month period to 31 July in the previous financial year. The order before the Grand Committee uprates the levy ceiling by 3.6 per cent, bringing it to &#163;863,412,967. This does not mean that the pension protection levy will increase to the ceiling. The board of the Pension Protection Fund is responsible for setting the actual levy for any year, but it must not set one that is above the levy ceiling. The board understands the pressures that businesses are under in the current economic climate. In August 2007, the board made a commitment to set a levy estimate of &#163;675 million for the following three years, indexed to earnings, subject to there being no change in long-term risk. The PPF has kept this commitment, and announced that it will increase this year&#146;s levy estimate only by earnings, which means that for 2009-10 the levy estimate will be &#163;700 million. However, the annual increases in the ceiling ensure that, after 2009-10, the board of the PPF could in future increase the levy up to the levy ceiling if it considered it appropriate.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000041"></a>I confirm that I am satisfied that the statutory instruments before us are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. They provide that the Pension Protection Fund compensation cap and levy ceiling are uprated in line with increases in average earnings.</p>

<p><a name="09032316000042"></a><b><a name="90323-gc0003.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09032316000221"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> The Grand Committee will be grateful for the Minister&#146;s careful explanation of these two orders, especially the background to them. I have nothing to say about the background to these orders, but I might be tempted to say something when we get to the financial assistance scheme regulations.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000043"></a>As for as the compensation cap provision, it is one of those things that come along like trains every year; perhaps, after the last debate and Question Time, trains are not an appropriate metaphor. Anyway, they come every year and they do exactly the same thing; they uprate by the level of earnings in the previous tax year, as the Government are obliged to do by the Pensions Act 2004, as the Minister said. It is one of the many orders that cause the bee in my bonnet to buzz furiously. I have referred to my objective of downgrading affirmative instruments of this sort many times before; indeed I have given evidence to  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC170"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column GC170</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Select Committees from time to time, but I will not labour that point today, except to say that in 2004 we should have made the first order affirmative and subsequent ones negative. Alas, that option was not open to us then, although I am glad to say that the position has now changed, at least as far as the DWP is concerned, and I commend it for that.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000044"></a>All that I would say on that order is that it comes under the horticultural heading that I have referred to before of DDT which, parliamentarily speaking, stands for doing the decent thing. The main subject of this debate, therefore, is the levy ceiling order, as it was in another place last week. I suppose that I should not be surprised that in many cases in his explanation of that order, the Minister has rather shot my fox, but he was speaking so quickly that I did not quite take in the figures that he gave towards the end of his speech. I would be grateful if he would repeat them.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000045"></a>As a rather green participant in the debates on the Pensions Act 2004, I still like to think of the PPF as a statutory insurance scheme for the underfunded pensions schemes whose sponsoring employers go bust. I am aware, of course, that Ministers have always denied this and have said that it is not a pension fund either. It is technically a compensation scheme. To me that is semantics. To all intents and purposes, since it behaves like an insurance scheme, therefore to me it is an insurance scheme. Unusually, it is an insurance scheme with two premiums: one to run the fund and the second a risk-based premium on schemes. We are concerned today with the latter.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000046"></a>This risk premium, or rather the maximum amount that the fund can demand, has gone up by leaps and bounds since we first debated this annual order, and it is right that this is debated every year. For 2005-06, I seem to remember that the levy ceiling was set at &#163;150 million. It has been raised again and again in subsequent years, and now, as the order makes clear, it stands at &#163;863,412,967. I think that that is the exact figure, although the Minister faltered at that point in his speech. This seems to be a very precise sum. Will the Minister confirm that the odd pounds come about because of the increase in the average level of earnings of 3.6 per cent?</p>

<a name="90323-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000047"></a>Having got that off my chest, this sum of &#163;863-and-a-half-odd million is more than double what was expected when we debated the Bill; that is for the full year after the first year. At that point, it was expected to be some &#163;300 million a year. The Committee will appreciate that that was in the boom years, which of course the then Chancellor of the Exchequer abolished, as he did the bust years. Hubris, we find, has descended on him now that he is Prime Minister.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000048"></a>Be that as it may, indeed is, the situation now is completely different. Unemployment is growing at the fastest pace ever recorded, and now, as the Minister told us last week, it stands at 2.03 million. Firms seem to be going to the wall almost daily&#151;I hope that I am wrong about that&#151;and I venture to suggest that most of them, if not all, will have underfunded pension schemes.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000049"></a>While I appreciate that the levy ceiling has never yet been breached, will this last, or will we see the ceiling increasing yet again to, say, &#163;1 billion by the end of this  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC171"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column GC171</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>decade, which is only 12 months or so away? The Minister made some reference to that in his speech. Or on the other hand, is he as confident as his colleague in another place on Wednesday last, who gave the impression that there was plenty of money in the fund. If so, is the ceiling too high, or is it precautionary? How is it arrived at? That is where the Minister shot my fox on the figures I was going to ask him about. Will he repeat how close to last year&#146;s ceiling the levy has got? How many schemes currently are within the fund and how many are in the queue? He illustrated how they have changed in the past two years, but I wonder whether I am alone in seeing the absolute importance of comparing from year to year. As I said, I expect the situation to get a lot worse over the next few years.</p>

<p><a name="09032316000050"></a><b><a name="90323-gc0003.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09032316000222"></a>Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay:</b> I thank the Minister for the explanation of the changes. This is a timely moment to ask a few serious questions about the grave position in which the Pension Protection Fund finds itself. The most recent figures were that defined benefit pension schemes in this country, the universe which the Pension Protection Fund is set up to protect and the people who are paying the levies that we are discussing today, had a total deficit of &#163;191 billion, which was up from &#163;48.8 billion a year earlier. I remember well the passage of the then Pensions Bill 2004 when we debated these matters. I also remember well, in 2005, two academics, Anthony Neuberger and his colleague, David McCarthy, wrote an excellent and groundbreaking article in <I>Fiscal </I><I>Studies</I><I></I>on the PPF. Their conclusion, with which I agreed at the time, was that there was a significant chance that the claims on the PPF,</p>
<ul><a name="09032316000180"></a>&#147;will be so large that the PPF will default on its liabilities, leaving the Government with no option but to bail it out. The cause of this problem is the double impact of a fall in equity prices on the PPF: it makes sponsor firms more likely to default, and it makes defaulting plans more likely to be underfunded&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09032316000172"></a>It explained that when they go down, the black holes are bigger. In those debates, I challenged the Government&#151;it was laughed off, but I ask them now whether they are equally confident&#151;about whether the PPF would prove to be a leaky lifeboat sailing on uncharted seas. Never, in my darkest nightmares, did I fear that the economy and pension schemes would collapse in the way that they have over the past five years.</p>

<p><a name="09032316000051"></a>In America, the model for the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation does not have an explicit government guarantee, but it has the US Secretary of the Treasury and the US Secretary of Labor sitting on its board. Everyone in America knows that that amounts to an American government guarantee. It is really a fiction for the Government to maintain, if they do, that this is an arm&#146;s-length body. The cost of funding by the PPF levy is falling on an ever-smaller number of private sector defined benefit pension schemes, which are shrinking by the day. It is almost like an ever-bigger upturned pyramid resting on an ever-narrower base.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000052"></a>Will the Minister review with his officials one specific and growing problem? In the past few months following the change in insolvency laws, there have been a great flood of pre-pack administrations in this country&#151;phoenix administrations. He mentioned shuffling off pension liabilities. There is a rash of companies calling in the accountants and setting up a clever scheme whereby, in many cases, they shuffle off their pension fund and property liabilities. They then go into administration and come out again 10 minutes later with the same people in charge, having walked away from their pension liabilities. This serious abuse has developed in recent weeks. I have already taken it up in writing with the noble Lords, Lord Myners and Lord Mandelson, but there is a very significant pension involvement here and I hope that the Minister will also take it up with the noble Lord, Lord Mandelson, whose department is responsible. It is a matter of serious concern as it concerns not only getting rid  of pension fund liabilities, but also, in the way it is operating in the commercial property market, it is gravely undermining pension funds and life insurance solvency because it undermines the rental income on which property portfolios depend.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000053"></a>I, too, looked at the report of the debate in the Commons on 18 March. A request was made then for the calculations that have been made and to which the Minister, the right honourable Rosie Winterton, referred. The calculations might better be called scenarios as to solvency under different conditions in the PPF. She gave an undertaking to put them in the Library in so far as they were not &#147;commercially confidential&#148;. I find it hard to see how calculations of that sort could be commercially confidential as they do not refer to individual firms. I hope, therefore, that the Minister can confirm that those forward calculations have now been placed in the Library so that we can all see them. This is a matter of great public concern. We need to see what the conditions and the assumptions are in order to hold a proper, open debate.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000054"></a>In the debate in the Commons, Ms Winterton talked about liquidity. That is not the point. No one is suggesting that the Pension Protection Fund or individual pension funds in this country are going to run out of cash in the near term. The issue for pension funds, which are very long term, is not liquidity because they are not going to run out of cash in the near term, but that they go bust when they cannot meet their liabilities over the long term. That is the problem which people are so concerned about, and is why these calculations are so important.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000055"></a>This is a very testing time for the economy, for pension funds and for the Pension Protection Fund. I encourage the Minister to be as open as possible in a debate that is very serious for the country as a  whole.</p>

I shall try to answer each of the questions that have been  raised.</p>

<p><a name="09032316000057"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, made a point in passing about the affirmative nature of these regulations. He will be aware that to change the current arrangements would need primary legislation, so it looks as though we will meet routinely on this matter.</p>

<p><a name="09032316000058"></a><b><a name="90323-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09032316000224"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> There has been no lack of pensions legislation in recent years.</p>

The noble Lord asked me to confirm the numbers, and I am sorry if I went a little quickly earlier. Let me look first at the pension protection levy for 2008-09. It was set at &#163;675 million, part of it as a risk-based assessment and part on a scheme basis at roughly an 80:20 split. In 2009-10, as I indicated, the proposal is for a &#163;700 million levy that is designed to meet the commitment of the PPF to keep the levy in real terms, which is what it does. On the levy ceiling, in 2007-08 it was &#163;804 million, in 2008-09 it was &#163;833 million, and for 2009-10, as we have discussed, it is &#163;863 million. I believe that the odd numbers at the end are derived just from the arithmetic of that percentage increase, but if they are other than that, I shall let the noble Lord know. He also asked about the levy ceiling in 2005-06. No levy ceiling was applied in the first year of the levy.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000060"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, raised important points about recent reports, the 7,800 series, and projections for scheme deficits. As he acknowledged, it is important that we look at those for the long term. Liquidity is the key issue for the Pension Protection Fund. As my colleague said in another place and as was touched on earlier, there is sufficient liquidity in the PPF, even testing it against some quite severe economic scenarios, to continue to pay benefits for many years to come&#151;I think it is about 20 years.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000061"></a>On the request made of the Minister of State, when she said that she would consider what could be done, the data is driven by the PPF and we need to be mindful of its confidentiality, but we are in touch with the PPF to see how that matter might be taken forward.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000062"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, talked about pre-packs and the current trend. It is important to remember that pre-packs require the agreement of all creditors, including the pension scheme, but he is quite right that we need to ensure in all these things that the pension scheme should be treated fairly. He raised an issue that has been raised before: should the Government effectively underwrite the pension protection scheme? We do not believe that it is necessary to do that; we have not been asked to do that by the Pension Protection Fund itself. To underwrite it would be to move us away from the principle that the fund is funded by those who are protected by it. If we went to a government guarantee, we would be drawing other people in to underwrite it.</p>

<p><a name="09032316000063"></a>On the strength of the PPF and the role of the regulator&#151;again, the noble Lord referred to the challenges that schemes and scheme sponsors face&#151;the Pensions Regulator has made clear in a number of pronouncements recently that it is entirely appropriate for trustees to look at reasonable affordability when looking at recovery plans. He subsequently referred more specifically to

<a name="90323-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000064"></a>I have not dealt specifically with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, about the current economic situation, but I think that I have dealt with it in my response to the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott. Currently, the PPF has about &#163;3 billion in assets and is paying out &#163;3.7 million a month in compensation. It was designed to work in a benign environment as well as in the downturn. On the basis of the analyses that have been undertaken, it has enough cash to continue to pay benefits for at least 25 years. Part of its assessment is to keep its promise that the levy should be kept whole in real terms.</p>

The Pension Protection Fund said that it would try to keep that level for three years, adjusted for changes in prices only.</p>

On one high-profile pension, does the Minister share my regret, for this purpose anyway, that the Royal Bank of Scotland did not go bust, unlike so many of its customers, so that Sir Fred Goodwin's pension could be limited to &#163;27,700 a year, as it would have been if he had been in the PPF? Although I do not necessarily expect the Minister to comment on that, does he accept that I believe that there is ample evidence to stop Sir Fred Goodwin's pension now, not least the shocking revelations in the <I>Sunday Times</I> and the <I>Observer</I> at the weekend about misuse of shareholders&#146; and savers&#146; funds by Sir Fred and bullying of non-executive directors? That pension should be challenged in the courts and stopped on the grounds of improper authorisation, negligence and, very probably, fraud.</p>

<p><a name="09032316000068"></a><b><a name="90323-gc0004.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09032316000229"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I am sure the noble Lord will understand that that issue is way outside the matter that is before us today, and I am not briefed on all the detail behind it. In common with most people, one is gravely concerned about someone in those circumstances walking away with a pension fund at that level. I am advised that not all of it would come from a scheme that would be eligible for the PPF, so that would be outwith it in any event. The noble Lord is quite right that for a member of a scheme that went into the PPF and who retired early, if their normal retirement age was after the date on which the assessment was made, the cap would certainly kick in.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000069"></a>I told the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, earlier that the levy was increased by reference to price, but it is not; it is increased by reference to earnings. I apologise for that.</p>

<p><a name="09032316000070"></a><b><a name="90323-gc0004.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09032316000232"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> The draft regulations were laid on 11 February. The Financial Assistance Scheme&#151;or the FAS, as I shall refer to it hereafter&#151; offers help to certain people whose defined benefit occupational pension schemes have not provided them with the pension that they were expecting.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000071"></a>In December 2007, we announced a significant extension to the scheme, and noble Lords will recall considering two sets of regulations last year that implemented key elements of those changes. They will also recall that we decided to implement the December 2007 announcement in stages to give priority to the elements that offered the most help to FAS members. I am sure noble Lords will be pleased to know that, as a result of those changes, the FAS now makes payment at 90 per cent of a qualifying member&#146;s expected pension, subject to a cap, from the normal retirement age, subject to a lower age limit of 60.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000072"></a>The FAS also allows early reduced payments on grounds of ill-health and includes certain schemes where the employer is still trading and solvent. As a result, a total of more than &#163;50 million has been paid to 10,556 people so far. It is estimated that around 140,000 people will receive assistance from the FAS in the long term. However, we recognise the difficulties experienced by those who lost their pensions through no fault of their own, and the particular difficulties of pensioners who are unable work due to their ill-health.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC176"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column GC176</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90323-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000073"></a>The FAS currently allows early access to actuarially reduced payments for members who are unable work and will continue to remain unable to work until their normal retirement age. The FAS also provide early unreduced access for members who are terminally ill and likely to die within six months. It should be noted that although the rules of many occupational pension schemes allow members to take their benefits before the normal retirement age where they are in ill-health, this facility is generally not available when a scheme has started to be wound up.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000074"></a>The draft regulations include some significant measures in response to representations that we received when we introduced the existing ill-health provisions that a small number of people with ill health leading to significantly reduced life expectancy could be excluded from early access to the FAS under the current provisions because they are more than five years away from their normal retirement age.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000075"></a>We have also responded to concerns raised by campaigners that the actuarial reduction in payments under the current ill health provisions are inappropriate where a person is likely to have a significantly shorter life expectancy due to their severe ill health. I am therefore pleased to present these draft regulations, which will provide for early unreduced access to FAS payments where a person is aged 55 or over and has a progressive disease from which death might reasonably be expected in five years. These payments will be known as severe ill health payments.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000076"></a>In developing a test to identify the people with severe ill health resulting in reduced life expectancy, we considered how best to focus on the people most in need of early payments of assistance. We concluded that the best way to achieve this is via a test in the  form that,</p>
<ul><a name="09032316000181"></a>&#147;the member can reasonably be expected to die within five years&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90323-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000077"></a>This is a novel test that is without precedent in legislation, and we needed to check that it would be fair and operable.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000078"></a>During the development of the test, departmental medical advisers advised that it would be impractical to try and apply a test looking more than five years ahead, due to the lack of reliable survivability data and the need to take into account a large range of factors, such as lifestyle, which could influence a person&#146;s longevity. A range of views were expressed in consultation responses. A number of responses urged the Government to set a test looking 10 years ahead, but they did not provide evidence that this test would be operable or fair. Other responses supported the Government&#146;s approach. I thank all the respondents to the consultation, including private individuals, trade union representatives and members of the Pensions Action Group for their input.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000079"></a>I reassure noble Lords that we do not expect the life expectancy condition to set a cut and dried test. This is not a test of whether someone will die in five years, but one of whether their death within that time is a reasonable expectation. This wording does not mean that a doctor would have to confirm that the prognosis for a person was shorter than five years in order for that person to satisfy the test; rather, that the medical  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC177"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column GC177</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>condition of the person is such that five years or less would be among the reasonable prognoses that a doctor could give for someone in their situation.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000080"></a>The Government have responded positively to concerns raised by stakeholders and campaigners that a small number of members, who have been severely ill for some time, have been disadvantaged because these provisions have not been a feature of the financial assistance scheme from its commencement. Draft Regulation 7, therefore, makes provisions to put such people back into the position that they would have been in if severe ill health payments had been available since May 2004, when the financial assistance scheme was first announced.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000081"></a>First, severe ill health payments can be paid for periods before the date of application in cases where a person can demonstrate that they would have met the qualifying conditions at an earlier date. This can apply even where a member has now reached their normal retirement age; they will be able to apply for earlier payment of severe ill health payments where they can demonstrate that they would have met the qualifying conditions at that earlier date.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000082"></a>Secondly, provision is made for survivors, or personal representatives, to apply for severe ill health payments for a past period on behalf of any member who would have met the qualifying conditions but who has, unfortunately, died before the regulations came into force.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000083"></a>Thirdly, a scheme member currently receiving reduced ill health payments will be allowed to apply for the new unreduced severe ill health payments where they believe that they would have met the qualifying conditions if the provisions had existed earlier.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000084"></a>I add that the provision to pay for a past period will not be a regular feature of the financial assistance scheme. We have included it solely to allow people to be reinstated into the position they would have been in if the provisions had been a feature of the financial assistance scheme from the outset. Therefore, applications for severe ill health payments for a past period will have to be made within one year of the regulations coming into force.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000085"></a>These regulations also make an amendment to the incapacity benefit regulations. Regulation 2 amends the incapacity benefit regulations to provide that financial assistance scheme payments are treated as pension payments for the purposes of that benefit. This means that half of any FAS payments in excess of &#163;85 per week will be taken into account when calculating entitlement to incapacity benefit. However, this will not affect qualifying members who first became entitled to financial assistance before these regulations came into force.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000086"></a>Finally, noble Lords will be pleased to know that we hope to start making payments to those who qualify by the end of April, subject to the provision of relevant information from members and their medical practitioners. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="09032316000087"></a><b><a name="90323-gc0004.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09032316000233"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> I referred earlier to having been gently chided, during a previous debate on the financial assistance scheme, for going into a history of that scheme as I saw it. I am going to resist that temptation  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC178"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column GC178</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>today, probably to the Minister&#146;s pleasure. Suffice to say that the substance of the order is not like that of the scheme itself or the orders emanating from it, where the Government had to be led, kicking and screaming, to do anything at all. This order is a different ball game.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000088"></a>Last year&#146;s order improved the financial assistance scheme yet again, that time to make payments available to people with terminal illnesses and those unable to work through illness up to five years before their normal retirement age. Naturally, their payments would be actuarily reduced at the time of first payment, and, presumably, after their retirement date as well&#151;in other words, throughout their life. Perhaps the Minister will be able to confirm that.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000089"></a>It came to light, though, that there was a problem with a few people who would be excluded from that provision, being too young to qualify. I believe that they did not totally fulfil the illness criterion as set out in last year&#146;s order. I would be grateful if the Minister will confirm that when winding up. The order corrects that in cases where people have significantly reduced life expectancy if they have attained the age of 55 and are suffering from an ailment&#151;the Minister used a technical term that I am afraid I did not catch&#151;of which the prognosis is that they will die within five years. Amazingly, such payments are not to be actuarily reduced. Is this not apples and pears? The long-term ill are to have actuarily reduced payments, under last year&#146;s order, while payments to the longer-term terminally ill are to be paid without such a reduction. That raises a question that I hope the Minister will be able to answer: why?</p>

<a name="90323-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000090"></a>The second question that arises is what happens when the unfortunate sufferer exceeds his life expectancy of five years. Doctors, after all, are not infallible, and medical science is improving all the time. Do the payments remain the same, suddenly become actuarily reduced or what? Will the recipient perhaps have to reapply? Incidentally, in the Minister&#146;s closing words, when he said he hoped that the first payments would be made by the end of April this year, he did not comment on the fact that the individuals have to apply. That raises the question of how they apply and to whom. Given that when the five years is up they are, or will be by then, almost at, or near, death&#146;s door, I hope that the payments will continue unaltered and unreapplied-for&#151;what a horrible word&#151;until death.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000091"></a>I also note the second part of this order, which says that the payments we are discussing are to be treated as pensions. That has two effects. The first is that if the individual has enough income, the FAS payments will be taxable. The other is that they will go to reduce any incapacity benefit that may have been in payment. Will the Minister reassure me that not only will no one be worse off financially as a result of this but in all cases they will have more money to live on in their declining years? If the answers to my questions are positive, as I hope they are, then this order makes beneficial improvements to the financial assistance scheme and deserves our full support.</p>

That would not be appropriate today, now that we are in the mode of rejoicing over a sinner that repenteth. It is now in a good state. This is a welcome change, and I congratulate the Minister on it.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000093"></a>There is one question of detail. I understand that establishing an individual&#146;s life expectancy in these difficult circumstances will be for the department&#146;s medical advisers, so the regulation says, but the final decision rests with the FAS scheme manager. How do those two things square? Are there situations in which the financial assistance scheme manager will overrule the medical advisers? That would be quite difficult to assess. Is there an appeals process? It could be quite a stressful time. Perhaps the Minister would clarify those points. We believe that the provision applies to only a small number of people. Perhaps the Minister could give an estimate of how many people are affected. There has been serious injustice for a small number of people and we are glad that it has been rectified.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, pressed me on actuarially reduced amounts. For someone with ill health, early access to actuarially reduced amounts simply reflects the fact that having access to the arrangements earlier will enable them to have them for a longer period of their life. It is a technique which quite often applies. That is in contrast to someone who has the severe ill health payment, which is predicated on a person having a progressive illness with a life expectancy not exceeding five years. Therefore, not reducing the amount actuarially reflects the fact that they will have it for a shorter period. That is the difference.</p>

<p><a name="09032316000095"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, asked me about the number of people involved, which we think will be small. Something like 61 people in receipt of ill health payments at the moment will be contacted about these new arrangements. We think that a couple of dozen people may be entitled. That is the scale of the issue. The noble Lord also asked me about the process. The individual will need to make a claim to the FAS operational unit. The individual&#146;s GP or consultant would be contacted to provide information. The DWP&#146;s medical advisers will have the opportunity to review that and will clearly advise the scheme manager who will make that decision. Obviously, the scheme manager would be constrained by rules of consistency and fairness, and would be expected to act on the basis of the medical advice given.</p>

<p><a name="09032316000096"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, asked whether, for someone who lived for longer than five years with an original prognosis of less than that, there would be any adjustment. No, there would not. They would continue to be entitled to the payments at the unreduced levels for the rest of their life. The noble Lord also asked about incapacity benefits.</p>

We are already in touch with potential applicants so that we can process their applications speedily. Members will need to make a written application to formally start the process.</p>

<p><a name="09032316000100"></a>As regards incapacity benefits, these regulations simply put people in receipt of FAS benefits in the same position as PPF members or members of pension schemes where they are taken into account to an extent as income when looking at receipt of incapacity benefits. In conclusion, I was remiss not to state earlier that in my view these regulations are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

I am sure that the answer is no, but I hope he will be able to confirm that.</p>

<p><a name="09032316000105"></a><b><a name="90323-gc0005.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09032316000243"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> Before I proceed further, I wish to state that in my view this statutory instrument is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000106"></a>Before speaking on the content of the regulations, it may be helpful for the Committee if I set the regulations in context and explain a little of the history behind the accrual of guaranteed minimum pensions. Between 1978 and 1997, if a defined-benefit occupational pension scheme wanted to contract out of the state additional pension, the employer had to agree that the scheme would pay at least a statutory minimum level of benefits&#151;the guaranteed minimum pension. When an employer provides a contracted-out pension scheme, both he and his employees pay a lower level of national insurance contributions. Employees who are contracted out into a defined-benefit occupational scheme forgo all or part of their state additional pension entitlement, and instead receive a private pension from their employer&#146;s scheme.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000107"></a>As I explained, the GMP was the minimum benefit that schemes were required to provide. Many schemes offered more generous pension benefits in excess of the GMP; consequently, those schemes have had to record both the GMP and the scheme excess. GMPs ceased to accrue in 1997, and for service beyond 1997 a new standard, the reference scheme test, applies. However, schemes retain liability for GMPs and therefore have to operate two different sets of rules. That has caused complications and extra costs for many schemes.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000108"></a>The provisions of the draft Occupational Pension Schemes (Contracting-out) (Amendment) Regulations 2009, together with Sections 24A to 24H of the Pension Schemes Act 1993, will permit the trustees of defined-benefit contracted-out occupational schemes to simplify their scheme structure and reduce the regulatory and administrative burdens placed on them. This new legislation will allow the trustees to convert their GMPs into ordinary scheme benefits which are of at least equal actuarial value.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000109"></a>The regulations are technical in nature and complement the detailed provisions for GMP conversion in Sections 24A to 24H of the 1993 Act, which were introduced by Section 14 of the Pensions Act 2007. Those sections set out the conversion conditions that occupational pension schemes must meet in order to convert GMP rights into scheme benefits, provided that the overall actuarial value of the benefit package is maintained.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000110"></a>Sections 24B and 24C of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 provide for regulations to be made for the purposes of prescribing the method by which actuarial equivalence is achieved, and for setting out when the scheme receiving the converted GMPs must provide a survivor benefit. These regulations seek to fulfil those requirements.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000111"></a>I turn to the detail. The new sections introduced by the Pensions Act 2007 set out five conversion conditions that must be met in order to convert the GMPs. It is only after these conditions have been met that a scheme can extinguish its liability for paying the GMP. The draft Occupational Pension Schemes (Contracting-out) (Amendment) Regulations 2009 facilitate conversion conditions one and four, so I will concentrate only on those two.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC182"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column GC182</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90323-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000112"></a>Conversion condition one requires that the pension a member is entitled to after GMP conversion is actuarially at least equivalent to what it was before conversion. Actuarial equivalence allows the whole structure of benefits already accrued in a pension scheme to be changed while maintaining their actuarial value. It is a concept that has been in existence for some time and is often used for private pension schemes. For the purposes of GMP conversion, it is the scheme trustees who will decide whether the GMPs held in a scheme should be converted into equivalent scheme benefits. If the trustees do decide to convert GMPs, they are required to seek advice from an actuary about the actuarial assumptions to be used. In deciding what assumptions are to be used, the trustees and actuary will need to refer to the provisions set out in the draft Occupational Pension Schemes (Contracting-out) (Amendment) Regulations 2009.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000113"></a>In order to ensure that actuarial equivalence has been achieved, the scheme trustees must arrange for the actuary to calculate the actuarial values of the pre- and post-conversion benefits. It is only after the actuary is satisfied that actuarial equivalence has been met that the actuary will provide a certificate to certify that condition one has been satisfied; that is, that the post-conversion benefits are actuarially at least equivalent to pre-conversion benefits. The actuary is also required to provide the trustees with a certificate within three months.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000114"></a>I turn to conversion condition four, which seeks to protect the position of the spouse or civil partner post-conversion in the event of a member&#146;s death. Currently, on the death of a member, a contracted-out occupational pension scheme is required to pay a survivor benefit based on the earner&#146;s accrued GMP rights. Section 24D of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 sets out the current survivor benefit requirements, which are that in the relevant circumstances, a widow is entitled to a survivor benefit based on her husband&#146;s accrued GMP from 1978 to 1997. A widower or surviving civil partner is entitled to a survivor benefit based on the earner&#146;s accrued GMP from 1988 to 1997. After conversion, a requirement to provide a survivor benefit is retained based on the scheme pension earned from 1978 to 1997 or from 1988 to 1997 as the case may be. The requirement seeks to protect the position of the beneficiaries whose additional state pension will be subject to a contracted-out deduction following the member&#146;s death.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000115"></a>Section 24C of the 1993 Act requires regulations to be made for the purpose of prescribing the circumstances in which and the periods for which the survivor benefits are payable from the new scheme benefit; that is, after the conversion of the GMP. The circumstances under which a survivor benefit is payable after conversion remain the same as those which apply before conversion, as does the period for which it is payable. The survivor benefit rules are complex, and in their simple terms, the regulations require that the survivor benefit may be withdrawn where the survivor is not in receipt of a relevant benefit such as widowed carer&#146;s allowance, widowed mother&#146;s allowance, widow&#146;s pension or bereavement allowance, or where the survivor is aged over 45 and has remarried, formed a civil partnership, or is living with somebody as husband and wife.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC183"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column GC183</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90323-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000116"></a>In summary, although the regulations may appear complex, they simply ensure that post-conversion benefits are actuarially at least equivalent to the pre-conversion benefits and that the current rules which specify when and for what period a survivor benefit is payable are retained post-conversion. These regulations are to facilitate GMP conversion and thus enable contracted-out defined benefit occupational pension schemes to simplify their benefit structures by moving to one set of scheme rules. Schemes that undergo a conversion exercise will benefit from no longer having to purchase advice for GMP calculations, no longer having to deal with queries from members on GMPs, simpler awards of benefit where pensions become payable, and a single approach to the annual uprating of pensions in payment.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000117"></a>Finally, I should point out that the facility to convert GMPs is purely an optional one which is being made available to schemes. The requirements of these regulations become mandatory only at the point at which a scheme decides it wishes to convert its GMPs. I commend these regulations to noble Lords.</p>
<h5><a name="09032316000192"></a>5.45 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09032316000118"></a><b><a name="90323-gc0005.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09032316000244"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> We have now turned our attention to guaranteed minimum pensions and I, for one, am grateful to the Minister for his attempt to steer us through what this most complicated order is doing. The noble Lord called it complex. If I had a deeper word in my vocabulary to express complexity, I would most certainly use it. I say &#147;complicated&#148; because, although Section 14 of the Pensions Act 2007 is crystal clear in its intent and is referred to in the Explanatory Memorandum, nowhere could I find a reference to it in the order itself. I would not expect it to be in the main guts of the order, but I would expect to find it in a footnote. Footnote (a) on the front page of the order states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09032316000177"></a>&#147;1993 c.48. Sections 24B and 24C were inserted by section 14(3) of the Pensions Act 2007&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09032316000173"></a>I did not find that terribly helpful. I therefore had to mount a paper chase to discover that Section 14 actually amends Sections 13 and 17 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000119"></a>I hope that I have understood the order correctly, not being nearly so expert in the field of guaranteed minimum pensions as my noble friend Lady Noakes. Its background, though, is, I think, fairly clear. As the Minister has said, between April 1978 and April 1997 defined-benefit schemes and, I believe, members of the schemes themselves&#151;I stand to be corrected on that&#151;could, and often did, contract out of the second state pension in its various guises. Why we have to have different names for essentially the same thing defies me, but I shall let that pass.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000120"></a>The point is that the schemes themselves had to be as good as, or better than, the state scheme, and provide what came to be known as the guaranteed minimum pension. How many schemes have contracted out, and how many have already converted? As I read the situation, it has taken until now for the Government, through the Pensions Act 2007, to come up with a way to mitigate the fact that schemes have to continue to administer the rights already accrued, even though  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC184"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column GC184</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>they ceased accruing as long ago as April 1997. Not only that, but many scheme benefits have already been converted. I have assumed, therefore, that this order is required to convert the rest. However, I am confused by paragraph 8.2 of the Explanatory Memorandum, which ends by stating that schemes would be unlikely to convert &#147;in the near future&#148;. Presumably, that means that more schemes would be unlikely to convert in the near future. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell me the reason for this, as I would have thought that most of the conversion would have been done already, at least in those schemes that have already contracted out. This order might have been in operation had Section 14 of the 2007 Act been in the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000 instead. Given that, I would be grateful if the Minister would explain the timing of what this order does. In essence my question is, why now? Why has it taken so long to achieve this?</p>

<a name="90323-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000121"></a>One usually gets to penetrate the opacity of Department for Work and Pensions orders. However, new Section 69B is more than opaque; I suggest that it is the darkest night just before the dawn. Can the Minister&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Richard, requested at Question Time&#151;explain in English the two parts of new Section 69B as none of my advisers could translate it to my satisfaction? Unusually, we received no comment on this from the Merits Committee. Therefore, I would be grateful if the Minister could provide me with an answer to that.</p>

<p><a name="09032316000122"></a><b><a name="90323-gc0005.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09032316000245"></a>Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay:</b> Perhaps the Merits Committee did not comment on the provision because it could not understand it. Like the noble Lord, I picked up the Minister&#146;s phrase that the regulations may appear complex. He can certainly say that again. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, was searching for a deeper expression than &#147;complex&#148;. I suggest &#147;utterly obscure and totally incomprehensible&#148;.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000123"></a>On a point of fact, I see that the regulatory impact assessment suggests that the total initial cost&#151;presumably the one-off cost of making these changes&#151;will be between &#163;11 million and &#163;22 million, and would produce a total annual cost saving of &#163;6 million to &#163;13 million. That is a 50 per cent to 60 per cent annual rate of return of which any pension fund with which I have been associated would have been proud. I just wonder whether those figures can be right. They seem to be particularly hopeful, do they not? That is one question.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000124"></a>More generally, and more seriously, the order shows how totally wrong and unnecessary contracting out the whole state second pension is. I have been in the pensions industry for 33 years and understand how it works, and I just wish that the Government had been bolder and scrapped it rather than slowly phasing it out following the Turner report.</p>

<p><a name="09032316000125"></a><b><a name="90323-gc0005.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09032316000246"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I thank each noble Lord for their contributions. I do not have data to hand on the number of schemes that have been contracted out, but I will dig them out and write to the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale. He suggested that the schemes would already have converted GMPs. They could not, however, because it is the legislation that was inserted  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC185"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column GC185</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>into the recent Pensions Act and these regulations provide the wherewithal to do that. The GMPs had to be preserved, even though, as he suggested, there are no longer accruals post-1997.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000126"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, asked why this is being done now. I accept what both noble Lords say; this is complex stuff, which is partly to do with simplification. The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, is absolutely right that the legislation is impenetrable. That is why we have taken action, certainly so far as DC schemes are concerned. As the noble Lord will be aware, we are going to abolish contracting out for those schemes very shortly. The Turner commission report expanded on the reason for not doing this more immediately for DB schemes. There needed to be a period in which the long-term effects of removing GMPs and removing contracting out had to be reflected in those arrangements. The Turner commission was pretty clear that they could be phased in over time.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000127"></a>As the noble Lord knows, this is due to expire by 2030. As we generally squeeze out the earnings related part of S2P, there will be a diminishing earnings related part to contract out.</p>

<p><a name="09032316000128"></a><b><a name="90323-gc0005.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09032316000247"></a>Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay:</b> I thank the noble Lord for those kind remarks. In the light of what he said, I have decided not to point out that he read out the whole of his brief verbatim. I think that was the first time I have ever seen him or any other Minister do that, but I do not blame him for that in any way.</p>

<p><a name="09032316000129"></a><b><a name="90323-gc0005.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09032316000248"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I always read my brief verbatim; I am a noble servant of the Government. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, asked me to interpret new Regulation 69B. I will have a go, but the important thing to recognise is its reference to Condition 4 of Section 24B of the 1993 Act. Condition 4 is one of five conditions, and requires that the converted scheme provides certain survivor benefits in circumstances and during periods that are prescribed by regulations. That is the thrust of that condition and the thrust of what new Regulation 69B seeks to address. Rather than test the noble Lord&#146;s patience today, I am happy to have a private word with him or to write him further if he so wishes.</p>

<p><a name="09032316000130"></a><b><a name="90323-gc0005.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="09032316000249"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> This is such a complicated matter that on this occasion I would much prefer a letter. The first part of new regulation 69B&#151;that is, paragraphs (1), (2) and (3)(a)&#151;appear to have rather different connotations from (3)(b), (3)(c), (3)(d) and (4). My question was about comparing the two halves of 69B. I would be grateful for an explanation.</p>

<p><a name="09032316000131"></a><b><a name="90323-gc0005.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="09032316000250"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> In short, the explanation may be that the first part deals with the requirements of provisions for survivors and the second part touches on the time frame in which they have to operate. Because they do not necessarily need to continue for ever, as I touched upon in assiduously reading my brief, there are circumstances that will trigger the cessation of those benefits for survivors&#151;for example, someone remarrying after a certain age. I will be happy to write in more detail to the noble Lord if he thinks that would be helpful.</p>

The Committee will have noticed that this is a long and complex statutory instrument, and I hope it will be of assistance if I set out the legislative background to these regulations and why they are needed.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000133"></a>The conduct of European elections in Northern Ireland is currently governed by the European Parliamentary Elections (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2004. The regulations apply similar provision to European elections to those that apply to parliamentary elections, with the necessary modifications to take account of the different voting systems. Similar regulations governing the conduct of European elections are in force in Great Britain.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000134"></a>Since 2004, a number of changes have been made to the legislation governing parliamentary elections in the UK, most of which are provided for in the Electoral Administration Act 2006. In the light of those changes, it has been necessary to update the legislation relating to elections to other legislatures. The Committee may recall that we updated the law regarding elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly earlier this year. Regulations updating the law governing European elections in Great Britain and Gibraltar were also recently approved by this House, and the regulations before us today will make the necessary updates for European elections in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000135"></a>When we updated the law relating to Northern Ireland Assembly elections earlier this year, the Government also took the opportunity to make a number of possible changes specific to Northern Ireland following a full public consultation last summer. As many of the proposals included in the consultation could also be applied to European elections, we again consulted with key stakeholders on whether such changes should be brought forward for European elections. As a result, a number of changes discussed in the earlier consultations have been included in these regulations, and it will no doubt assist the Committee if I briefly explain these proposed changes.</p>

<p><a name="09032316000136"></a>The first relates to suspension of the count. Currently at a European election the returning officer may suspend the count between 7 pm and 9 am, but only if the election and counting agents agree. In a PR STV  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC187"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column GC187</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>system, counting rarely finishes before 7pm and agreement can usually be reached to suspend the count until the following day if it appears that it will last long into the night. However, in a number of constituencies in the 2007 Assembly elections, agreement to suspend could not be reached. Counting in an STV system is complex, and it is important both for the welfare of counting staff and the integrity of the count itself for it to be suspended at a reasonable time.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000137"></a>It is for that reason that Parliament recently approved that there should be an automatic suspension of the count at Assembly elections at 11 pm unless there is agreement between the agents and the returning officer that it should continue. These regulations would make the same change for counting at European parliamentary elections. Under the 2004 regulations, candidates for the European Parliament must have their nomination papers subscribed by two electors, as proposer and seconder, and 28 other electors. During the consultation, there was widespread support for the view that this places an undue administrative burden on those seeking to be candidates and also on those responsible for verifying that the subscribers are in fact genuine. The regulations before us today would bring Northern Ireland in line with the rest of the UK by removing the requirement that a candidate&#146;s nomination paper at European elections must be subscribed.</p>
<h5><a name="09032316000194"></a>6 pm</h5>

<a name="90323-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000138"></a>The Committee may wish to note that a new provision has been introduced to regulate the release of information by presiding officers on the number of ballot papers issued on polling day. It has been common practice for many years in Northern Ireland for this information to be released by presiding officers on polling day. However, there is no statutory provision to regulate the practice. This has led to concerns that presiding officers are not taking a consistent approach to releasing this information, and some presiding officers have had to endure excessive demands for this information, often to the extent of distracting them from carrying out their primary duties.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000139"></a>It is clear therefore that statutory guidance is necessary in relation to this issue. The question is whether we should legislate to prohibit this practice altogether or seek to regulate it. None of the respondents to the consultation were in favour of legislating to prohibit this practice. For this reason, the draft regulations include provision for the chief electoral officer to direct presiding officers on when and how they may release this information on election day. Presiding officers will be able to release this information only in line with the chief electoral officer&#146;s directions.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000140"></a>I believe that this will protect presiding officers from excessive requests and against claims of favouring one party over another, while still allowing parties to continue to pursue as large a turnout as possible in areas where the turnout may be low. However, I appreciate that this is a new policy and, for this reason, the Government will closely review the operation of the policy with the chief electoral officer and the Electoral Commission shortly after the election. If the new policy is deemed to be a success, the Government will   


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC188"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column GC188</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>look towards extending this to other elections in Northern Ireland. If it is not a success, the possibility of prohibiting the release of this information entirely will be considered.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000141"></a>In summary, these regulations are necessary to ensure that the current law governing European elections in Northern Ireland is fully up to date with legislative developments elsewhere in the UK. The consultation demonstrated that there is widespread support in Northern Ireland for these updates and the other changes contained in the regulations. I strongly believe, therefore, that the regulations are essential to ensuring that the June elections are administered successfully, and I hope that the Committee will agree. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09032316000142"></a><b><a name="90323-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09032316000253"></a>Lord Glentoran:</b> I thank the noble Baroness for that very clear and concise presentation of what, at first sight, looks like a pretty horrendous provision. As she explained, in fact, it makes a lot of changes to a number of Bills. We have been regularly legislating for elections in Northern Ireland over the past five years, and I believe that now we have probably come ahead of the field in Europe. We have as sound and good a system as anywhere, and it is certainly better than the rest of the United Kingdom on all fronts; that is for sure. I am happy about that.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000143"></a>The recent changes seem to be down to good sense. On removing the 30 people who have to vouch for a candidate, it is understood that the fact that the candidate has to put up &#163;5,000 is probably a big enough deterrent to stop him playing the fool as a candidate and messing up the election. The question of releasing information is probably a concern in Northern Ireland more than in other parts, because there are two, three or four parties, or sometimes eight, and everyone assumes that the officials are biased and are going to help one party more than another, and so on. That certainly happened from time to time in elections in Northern Ireland. The parties wanted to know how many voting papers had been released, and sometimes they were told and sometimes they were not told. It may have depended on which party wanted to know and which did not, or on what the presiding officer felt at the time. Now, under the present legislation as a result of this instrument, as I understand it, the senior presiding officer will decree that this information will be released twice during the day, at 11 o&#146;clock in the morning and 4 o&#146;clock in the afternoon, and it will be done in all the polling stations at the same time and in the same manner, I hope. I am getting nods from behind the Minister. That has to be a plus.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000144"></a>This is a good order. I thank the officials for briefing me beforehand, when I was able to ask a number of questions. This is a long order, and we have had a lot of electoral law recently. Are there any plans to consolidate all the amendments and different electoral legislation for our little province into one statute? It would be very handy for all those concerned with managing elections. I support this statutory instrument.</p>

<p><a name="09032316000145"></a><b><a name="90323-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09032316000254"></a>Baroness Garden of Frognal:</b> I, too, thank the noble Baroness the Lord President for introducing this. Our concern about the legislation is about the timing. It is a complicated order, coming quite close to elections. We understood that it was government policy not to  


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC189"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column GC189</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>make legislative changes for elections within six months prior to a polling day, yet we are being asked to pass this less than two months before the publication of the notice of the election.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000146"></a>Like others, however, we welcome this order, which makes sensible provisions to improve the conduct of European elections in Northern Ireland. We particularly welcome the provisions regulating the release of information by presiding officers on the number of ballot papers issued on election day and by allowing the returning officer to direct how and when that information will be released. This provides clarity to presiding officers, party officials and all those involved in the running of election day in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000147"></a>We also welcome the introduction of smart passes and photographic provisional driving licences in the lists of documents to verify a voter&#146;s identity on election day. While it is important to have in place proper protection against electoral fraud in Northern Ireland, we must do all we can to ensure that no one is disenfranchised. The order should be helpful in both those respects.</p>

<p><a name="09032316000148"></a><b><a name="90323-gc0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09032316000255"></a>Lord Bew:</b> I, too, thank the noble Baroness the Lord President for introducing this instrument. I welcome the decision to hold the suspension of the count at 11 pm. For Northern Ireland Assembly district council elections, that makes sense. I also agree that it is right to abolish the need for the subscription of nomination papers; the idea that you had to have a proposer, a seconder and 28 others seems to be over-elaborate, and this is a useful change.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000149"></a>The Government have insisted that the broad thrust of this legislation is to bring Northern Ireland&#146;s electoral legislation fully into line with the rest of the United Kingdom. The proposal, which has a lot of common sense behind it, that there should be a regulation for the release of information by presiding officers on the number of ballots issued during the day, and that guidance should come from the chief electoral officer essentially controlling that, in a way takes Northern Ireland away from the UK model. I understand that the Electoral Commission had some concerns on that score, and I would be grateful if the Minister would comment on that point. It is not that I have any serious reservation about the proposal, which seems to be a wise one, but it slightly conflicts with the broader logic of government policy in this respect.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000150"></a>The point has also been made that it is government policy that legislation affecting elections should not be introduced less than six months before an election. This seems to be an exception, even if one accepts that in this case the legislation is basically sound.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000151"></a>I have one final query, which relates to an issue that arose some weeks ago when the Minister was putting through the legislation that she referred to earlier with respect to the Northern Ireland Assembly elections and by-elections. This is slightly outside the remit of the legislation that we are considering today, but it is intimately connected with her answer to me on that day and to a lacuna in this legislation. I asked her to defend the arrangement that by-elections would not be held in the case of Assembly elections. I was   


<notus-date day="23" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC190"></a><b>23 Mar 2009 : Column GC190</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>enormously convinced by her reply, which is that in the case of Northern Ireland, for a number of reasons, a by-election could produce a distorting outcome.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000152"></a>That is even more so in the case of a European election. Should a nationalist republican&#151;who would in all likely circumstances be elected as one of the three candidates&#151;be run over by the proverbial bus and we had a by-election, which, as I understand it, is the current regulation, it is almost certain that there would then be a unionist victory in the by-election. The sensitivity that the Minister displayed, rightly, in her reply to me in the case of the Assembly elections, for the way in which by-elections could lead to a distorting result and an unfair outcome is even more marked, potentially, with respect to European elections.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000153"></a>That is outside the scope of these regulations, extensive though they are. I would like to have a sense that the Government are aware of the difficulty; that is really all that I am asking for this afternoon. There is a potential problem on this score. I thank the noble Baroness for introducing the statutory instrument, which is essentially sound and viable.</p>

<p><a name="09032316000154"></a><b><a name="90323-gc0006.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09032316000256"></a>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon:</b> I thank noble Lords for the broad support that has been expressed. I agree that Northern Ireland is certainly ahead of the field in many aspects of elections, and it is a delight to be associated with being ahead of the field. I am grateful to the noble Lord for explaining the importance of the release of information, especially in a Northern Ireland context. I understand that there is a sort of conflict with logic here, if I might put it like that, because we are bringing Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the United Kingdom, but not in respect of the availability of information. It is best for Northern Ireland; although it is not logical, we cannot always be logical if we want to serve democracy in the best way. In the way in which we are introducing this part of the regulation, we want to best serve democracy in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000155"></a>Consolidation of all the orders and regulations that have been introduced over the past five years is a very attractive idea, and I will take it back to the department. I am sure that it will wish to act on that if it is at all possible, but it would be an enormous amount of work. The noble Baroness, Lady Garden, is right to be concerned about timing. We would not wish to have been in a position where we were introducing these regulations so close to the European elections. However, we have been working closely and sharing drafts with the Electoral Commission and the chief electoral officer at a very early stage in the drafting. That has allowed electoral administrators to put together the necessary guidance for the election. I do not think that there will be significant practical implications for the election. It was better for us to take time over ensuring that the regulations were right rather than acting swiftly, so I am glad that we took more time than perhaps might have been expected.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000156"></a>Going back to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Bew, about the importance of not favouring one side over the other in Northern Ireland, I emphasise that we will review this after the elections with the Electoral Commission, and we will come back to it.</p>

<p><a name="09032316000157"></a>The by-elections and the lacuna are being dealt with, as I understand it, in the Political Parties and Elections Bill, so the noble Lord should express his concerns when that Bill is taken through this House.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000158"></a>With that, I thank noble Lords for their support. This set of regulations is dense but relatively simple.

<a name="90323-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000160"></a>The background is that the European Parliamentary Elections Regulations 2004 apply the legal framework that is in place for UK parliamentary elections to the conduct of European parliamentary elections, with necessary modifications. The European Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Regulations 2009 amended the 2004 regulations to take into account changes that have been made to electoral law since the last European parliamentary election in 2004. After being approved by this House and the other place, the 2009 regulations were made on 29 January 2009 and came into force the following day.</p>

<a name="90323-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09032316000161"></a>The draft regulations before us today are necessary to correct a small number of unintentional errors introduced into the 2004 regulations by amendments made in the 2009 regulations. The 2009 regulations substituted new Schedule 1 to the 2004 regulations, which contain the European parliamentary elections rules. Rule 53(3), as substituted by the 2009 regulations, currently provides that, while counting the votes, a local returning officer must keep the ballot papers with their faces upwards and,</p>
<ul><a name="09032316000182"></a>&#147;take all proper precautions for preventing any person from seeing them&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09032316000174"></a>The amendment in Regulation 2(2) of the draft regulations corrects this rule, in accordance with the original policy intention, to provide that a local returning officer must take all proper precautions for preventing any person from seeing only,</p>

<p><a name="09032316000162"></a>Regulation 2(3) of the draft regulations corrects a small number of very minor errors in the absent voting provisions in Schedule 2 to the 2004 regulations, which was substituted by the 2009 regulations. My department has clear procedures in place for checking draft statutory instruments before they are laid. They were adhered to in respect of these regulations, but unfortunately the errors were not picked up. Although in some respects explicable by the length and complexity of the 2009 regulations, it is of course fully recognised that these errors should not have occurred, and I apologise to the Committee. The draft regulations were prepared as soon as the errors were identified, and it is not expected that the timing of the draft regulations will create difficulties for electoral administration in the build-up to the European parliamentary elections on 4 June.</p>

As I was telling the Committee, the draft regulations were prepared as soon as the errors were identified and it is not expected that the timing will create difficulties for electoral administrators. As required by statute, the Electoral Commission has been consulted and has confirmed that it is content with the draft regulations. While the corrections made by the draft regulations are relatively minor, they are nevertheless important to ensure the smooth running of the European parliamentary elections in England, Wales, Scotland and Gibraltar on 4 June. That is our objective. I commend the regulations. I beg to move.</p>

I am also grateful for the noble Lord&#146;s saying that the department&#146;s procedures did not work as they should have done. Should a further measure be required in future, we hope that the department will ensure that the procedures work as they should, and that such mistakes can be spotted earlier. I offer the Opposition&#146;s full support for the regulations.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="09032310000003"></a><b><a name="90323-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09032310000091"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Baroness Taylor of Bolton):</b> My honourable friend the Under-Secretary of State (Kevan Jones) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90323-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="09032310000004"></a>I am pleased to inform the House that with effect from 1 April 2009 there will be an increase in pensions paid through the Gurkha pension scheme of 14.1 per cent.</p>

<a name="90323-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="09032310000005"></a>In addition, there will be significant increases of 20 per cent and more to some 1,000 pensioners who are 80 years or over.  This increase is in line with the tripartite agreement which established a linkage between Indian Army pensions the Gurkhas pension scheme.  This means the elderly who are the most vulnerable will get an overall increase of at least 34 per cent on their pensions, a significant proportion of which will be backdated to January 2006.</p>

<a name="90323-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="09032310000006"></a>It has always been our policy to ensure that the 26,500 Gurkha pensioners mainly living in Nepal are treated fairly.  The Gurkha pension scheme currently costs some &#163;47 million per year and it is calculated that these increases will add to the cost by a further &#163;7 million per year.</p>

<a name="90323-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="09032310000009"></a>Today I am publishing <I>The Learning Revolution</I>, a White Paper on informal adult learning. Copies have been placed in the Library.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="09032310000010"></a>The boom in book clubs, online research and blogging, together with the continuing popularity of museums, public lectures and adult education classes, all demonstrate that people in this country have a passion for learning. This informal adult learning can transform people&#146;s lives and makes a huge contribution to the well-being of the nation.  It is a growing movement this Government are proud to foster and encourage.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="09032310000012"></a>The White Paper reaffirms the commitment to informal adult learning across government. It sets out how we will facilitate this by building capacity within individuals and communities and connecting the people who can make this happen.</p>

<a name="90323-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="09032310000013"></a>Government cannot do this alone. Our role is to be a catalyst for innovation and change. We will invest an additional &#163;30 million in 2009-10, from within DIUS existing baselines, to support the innovation we want to see. But it will take the continued efforts of all those who have been engaged with us to date, and many more, to continue the learning revolution.</p>

Recalling its conclusions of November, the council urged BiH to engage with stronger determination on the necessary reform agenda and called on BiH&#146;s political leaders to refrain from nationalist rhetoric and actions. The council also reconfirmed its readiness for a transition from the OHR to increasing local ownership, supported by a reinforced EU presence, once the conditionality is met. It reviewed progress of EU preparations for this reinforced presence. The council also agreed to keep under review the possible evolution of EUFOR-ALTHEA (the EU&#146;s military operation in BiH) in light of political developments. </p>

A review of Belarus's progress will take place at the end of the nine months, with the possibility either of reimposition of sanctions, or their complete lifting. The Government broadly welcome this decision which reflects the mixed progress made by Belarus to date.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="09032310000034"></a>The council adopted conclusions that: confirmed the above decision; welcomed positive steps taken by Belarus following the council's decision on the temporary suspension of sanctions in October 2008; expressed concerns about the human rights situation and stressed that it was important for Belarus to address these.</p>

My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary said that the EU needed to keep up the pressure on Sudan to reverse its decision; contacts with the African Union (AU) and the League of Arab States (LAS) were an important part of this; but we also needed to consider urgently what the consequences would be if our current precautionary measures failed and the NGOs were no longer able to operate in Sudan.  We would need the AU and the LAS to step in to alleviate the situation; but we should also be aware that we could quickly find ourselves in a serious humanitarian crisis, extending well beyond Darfur.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a><a name="09032310000055"></a>I am pleased to announce that the Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera) will vest on 1 April 2009 as an executive agency of Defra.</p>

<a name="90323-wms0001.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a><a name="09032310000056"></a>Fera brings together the Central Science Laboratory (CSL), the UK Government Decontamination Service (GDS) the Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate (PHSI), Plant Varieties and Seeds Division (PVS) and Plant Health Division (PHD). It has a starting complement of 900 staff and will have an annual turnover of &#163;72 million.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a><a name="09032310000057"></a>Fera&#146;s purpose is to provide robust evidence, rigorous analysis and professional advice, underpinned by world-class research, to help Defra, other government departments and other stakeholders support and develop a sustainable and secure food chain, a healthy natural environment and protect the global community from deliberate chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) or major accidental Hazard Material (HazMat) incidents.</p>

<a name="90323-wms0001.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a><a name="09032310000058"></a>As an executive agency of Defra, Fera plays an important role in helping to deliver the department&#146;s strategic priorities. These are to:</p>

Fera has responsibility to support government in responding to and recovering from emergency situations, by providing relevant capability, scientific evidence, analysis and advice. Including the GDS in Fera enables a wider breadth and coherence of service offering to government, and will enhance the national emergency response and recovery capability and UK Resilience. It will also strengthen the science capability underpinning GDS functions and areas of expertise.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a><a name="09032310000060"></a>Fera also provides research and development, advice and services to other public and private sector organisations on a commercial basis. The agency will have a remit to develop wider market opportunities alongside its work for government. This will build on the skills that underpin its sustainable future and will maximize the value to the taxpayer of its unique knowledge and facilities.</p>

<a name="90323-wms0001.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a><a name="09032310000061"></a>Fera will work closely with other government departments and contribute to their PSAs. For example:</p>
 climate change (Department for Energy and Climate Change);regional economic performance (Department for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform); international poverty reduction and achieving MDGs (Department for International Development); counterterrorism (Home Office);safer communities (Home Office); innovation and skills (Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills);health and well-being (Department of Health);food safety, choice and healthy eating&#151;support for the Food Standards Agency (FSA) strategic priorities; and environment, sustainability and rural affairs (Welsh Assembly Government).

<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a><a name="09032310000062"></a>The agency will continue CSL&#146;s established remit in supporting government and industry food security objectives. Through its scientific expertise Fera:</p>
 is recognised both nationally and internationally in the areas of food chain safety and quality, and food security. It is part of a national network of laboratories specifically established to respond to CBRN incidents, which might include malicious/accidental food contamination, and has national status as the UK National Reference Laboratory for the FSA and Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) for specific chemical analyses in food including dioxins, mycotoxins, trace elements and pesticides;has a dedicated food safety and quality operation, which provides scientific capacity, capability and advice to underpin the food-related objectives of Defra, the FSA, Pesticides Safety Directorate (PSD), VMD and other industry, and international stakeholders; andhas significant international influence with experts on European Food Safety Association (EFSA) panels, and is also heavily involved in European food research programmes. For example the agency is leading a

(More information at <a href="http://www.trace.eu.org/menu/project/">www.trace.eu.org/menu/project/</a>).

<p><a name="wms_stpa_56"></a><a name="09032310000063"></a>Fera will continue to deliver the business functions and services that have been provided by its constituent parts. For example it will provide the following services to the agricultural and horticultural industries:</p>
plant clinic services&#151;global pest and disease identification services;LIAISON&#151;contains information on registered agrochemical products for all UK crops;IENICA&#151;Interactive European Network for Industrial Crops and their Applications;BeeBase&#151;information for beekeepers;certification schemes for seeds and propagating material;registration and breeders&#146; rights schemes for new plant varieties;proficiency testing schemes&#151;Fera operates several schemes which provide the food, water, environment and plant health industries with assessments of the technical performance of their analysis laboratories.
<a name="90323-wms0001.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_57"></a><a name="09032310000064"></a>Details of all its services are available on Fera&#146;s website at <a href="http://services.csl.gov.uk/fera">http://services.csl.gov.uk/fera</a>.</p>

<a name="90323-wms0001.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"></a><a name="09032310000065"></a>In the short term stakeholders should not be affected by the formation of Fera and will receive the same professional services they currently enjoy. As the new agency develops I expect to see stakeholders benefit from improved services in the following areas:</p>
stakeholders have access to a &#147;one-stop&#148; service in support of sustainable agriculture and food safety;scope for a more efficient and integrated approach to EU legislation, and therefore simpler, more cost-effective regulation;co-location of policy and scientific databases, improved risk assessment, more seamless transfer of diagnostic results through integration of databases resulting in more rapid management action, and better, faster disease control at lower cost;development of service provision in international consultancy, advice and training for the PVS and PHSI elements of the new agency as a result of greater critical mass and collaboration with CSL where expertise in these markets already exists; andmore cohesive approach to supporting and informing the central government approach to developing CBRN-related policies.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_76"></a><a name="09032310000086"></a>A number of debates have taken place this year with reference to the occupiers of the properties affected by the ratings review of ports. The Government have listened carefully to the concerns put forward by the affected occupiers who, as a consequence of being separately assessed for rates from 1 April 2005, are in receipt of unexpected and significant backdated rate bills.</p>

<a name="90323-wms0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_77"></a><a name="09032310000087"></a>In the current economic conditions, the Government have constantly emphasised that they are concerned about the impact of significant and unexpected backdated rates liability on businesses. The ratings system has to be fair and equitable to all, and there is not a legislative solution for waiving tax liability which does not confer a disadvantage among other rate payers who have paid the rates that are legally established and due.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_78"></a><a name="09032310000088"></a>However, we believe, in the current economic circumstances that there is a general case to assist all businesses liable to receive large, unexpected backdated bills that have to be paid immediately, as is the case with a number of companies, including some port-based businesses across the UK.</p>

These procedures have been approved by European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the US Federal Aviation Administration (US FAA) and have been made mandatory for all US and European airlines. Both EASA and the US FAA are content that, subject to the application of these procedures, B777 aircraft with Rolls-Royce Trent engines are safe to remain in service. The new procedures were shown to be effective in the incident investigated by the NTSB referred to above when thrust control was successfully recovered following an uncommanded power reduction in a single engine on a Delta Airlines Boeing 777 on 26 November 2008.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_372"></a><a name="0903239000407"></a>The revenue payments are the annual payments made by National Health Service trusts to their private sector partners. This is to cover the cost of the funding raised by the contractors on the project (known as senior debt) in terms of financing charges and repayment of principal, building maintenance, lifecycle costs and, in many cases, non-clinical support services such as cleaning, laundry, catering, portering and security. On an annualised basis, the cost of the funding, comprising finance charges and principal in varying proportions, accounts for approximately 50 per cent of the annual payment for a scheme including non-clinical services.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_373"></a><a name="0903239000408"></a>PFI schemes are normally funded by two types of senior debt finance; traditional fixed rate project finance (a bank loan) and index linked bonds, priced by reference to bank and gilts rates respectively. Each source of debt finance has its relative merits and their prices move in relation to each other depending on market conditions. Decisions on the preferred source are made as part of the value for money calculation by the trust and its private sector partner at the time of preparing

To these rates is then added a margin, which is an annual charge pricing the risks in the project. Both funding routes also involve a number of costs associated with arranging and maintaining the funding for a scheme such as arrangement and commitment fees. The combination of rates, margins and fees is the overall financing charge&#151;the equivalent of an interest payment.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_374"></a><a name="0903239000409"></a>The overall financing charges therefore vary from scheme to scheme and depend on several factors. Information on financing charges is contained in the FBC for each scheme, which must be made publicly available following its approval. The financing charges are modelled for each year of the term of the loan in the financial models which are contained in the FBC and are fixed for the public sector, but these may differ from the actual charges incurred in any year by the private sector (the risk sits with the senior debt provider and contractors). The information on the actual finance charges paid in any one year for all PFI schemes which have opened could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_382"></a><a name="0903239000427"></a>In particular, lawyers are analysing the extent to which common law provisions may need to be replicated in statute law, and the introduction of one or more specific criminal offences. If the Government decide to ratify the convention, these changes to the law would require primary legislation, which would be introduced when parliamentary time allowed. Decisions would also need to be taken in due course on whether the UK required any reservations or declarations upon ratification. These are complex issues requiring further consideration and analysis which will take some time to complete.</p>
