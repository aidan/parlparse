In addition, the Government have announced an emergency fund of more than &#163;1 million to prevent immediate closures of rape crisis centres. The Government have invested around &#163;10 million over the past four years to ensure that victims are supported through a number of organisations and agencies.</p>

What more can the Government do to help those centres and to enable them to plan properly for the future, which erratic funding prevents them from doing? Can the Government do anything to encourage people to give to charities that help women and children as generously as they give to those that help animals and trees?</p>

We seek to ensure that a range of agencies provides support and assistance for victims of this most unpleasant and appalling crime. The noble Lord drew attention to what no doubt he sees as a disparity in support and sympathy for rape crisis centres and animal welfare charities; I fully understand that point. By encouraging people to give and, as important, by focusing on the local support that these agencies and bodies receive, we can raise their profile and encourage greater support from the public.</p>

That is an affront to the administration of justice. As far as any deployment of police resources is concerned, the nature of the crime makes it unlikely

That is why the Government have provided support and encouragement to sexual assault referral centres, which were established in the early part of this century and are now increasing in number and developing the quality of their service. The noble Lord draws attention to the low percentage of cases of recorded rape that end up with a conviction. If there is good news in this sector, it is that the percentage of rape cases that are prosecuted is increasing: it now stands at some 34 per cent, which is up over the past 10 years. I take some encouragement from that, as I do from the fact that the Government&#146;s approach in this sensitive policy area has at least begun to improve the volume and quality of reported rape cases, which are up from some 6,600 in 1997 to over 14,000. That shows that women are more confident in coming forward.</p>

Only women are referred to them. Those who go to the centres may have been raped 10 or 15 years ago and many will not have made a complaint to the police; nevertheless, they still need support and counselling, even after a long period of time. I believe that the uniqueness of rape crisis centres means that the Government should put much more funding into them compared with other organisations that deal with women, men and children who have suffered sexual violence. Will the Minister agree to have talks with my right honourable friend Harriet Harman to see whether further funding can be made available, not only to keep open those centres that already exist but also to create new ones?</p>

Indeed, I take pride from the fact that we helped to rescue the local rape crisis centre in Brighton through local authority funding, which is the more traditional route for funding such centres. As I said, we have already announced an emergency fund of over &#163;1 million to target the centres that appear to be most at threat. Of course, we will listen carefully to the advisory group in this field, which will no doubt give further advice to my right honourable friend Harriet Harman regarding proposals for future funding.</p>

Can the Minister confirm that the funding of sexual assault referral centres, of which 20 are new and 18 are planned, is secure so that they can help with prosecutions into the future?</p>

A student who is earning &#163;18,000 is expected to repay around &#163;22 a month for their loan. I am sure the noble Baroness will agree that when we consider the benefits of higher education, which I am sure everyone in the House accepts are highly significant and very important, it is not unreasonable to expect students who benefit significantly from such education to make some contribution towards the costs, as indeed the Government have been doing in the past 10 years by significantly increasing funding for higher education.</p>

He is right to point out that students from what are sometimes described as non-traditional backgrounds can find bewildering the process of applying for university and looking for finance. That is why the Government have invested significantly in programmes such as Aimhigher. There has been a year-on-year increase in applications from students from disadvantaged backgrounds, but we are also mindful of the need to do more. The Student Loans Company, as instructed by the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills, is involved in a major overhaul of the information, advice and guidance available to students, and we are aiming to have a streamlined application process for university and finance online by 2009.</p>

We need to be clear about the difference between the interest rate on the outstanding debt, which is in line with RPI&#151;it will be set again in September in line with RPI for March this year, so students will see a reduction in the interest charged on the outstanding debt&#151;and the interest rate on repayment, which will always be 9 per cent above the &#163;15,000 threshold. For example, the &#163;18,000 earner will pay only 9 per cent, which is &#163;22 a month. So we are talking about two kinds of interest and the repayment interest rate is 9 per cent.</p>

Indeed, the debt will be accumulating at that point because with a debt of something like &#163;20,000, which is what students will have in future, one will hope to be earning &#163;25,000 before one starts repaying the debt, as distinct from just meeting the interest rate payments which, I accept, reflect the rate of inflation. However, at 4.8 per cent one needs to repay more than &#163;500 a year before one gets anything back.</p>

Recently, President Mbeki wrote to President Bush asking him to &#147;butt out&#148; of Zimbabwe. Meanwhile, Mbeki used his vote at the UN Security Council to block discussion of the crisis in Zimbabwe. Is it not time he was reminded forcefully that the US and the UK between them have to feed over half the population of Zimbabwe to save them from starvation as a result of Mugabe&#146;s evil policies? Does the Minister agree with Morgan Tsvangirai that President Mbeki&#146;s lack of neutrality makes him unfit to lead the SADC process on Zimbabwe? Given HMG&#146;s patient support for regional action on the crisis and our strong bilateral links with SADC countries, what response has there been to the Prime Minister&#146;s call for election monitors from the Caribbean, Canada and other countries? Is it not time for SADC to insist that trade union delegations from the region be allowed to enter Zimbabwe? Finally, if China can be open to the world in its crisis, why not Zimbabwe?</p>

The desperate and tragic violence in recent months reflects the cost to South Africa of failing to resolve this crisis. The internal debate in South Africa around that issue shows that many South Africans share the view not just of this Government but of SADC neighbours that it is time for an honest, fair election and for its result to be recognised by President Mugabe.</p>

Cluster bombs have a large number of submunitions within a single shell&#151;last year we decommissioned one which had 600 submunitions within a single weapon&#151;but the BSFM, which is to replace these weapons, is different in three critical regards and therefore does not meet the Dublin treaty definition. First, it has only two submunitions; secondly, not only does it self-destruct but if it were not to do so, it would deactivate because of a battery mechanism within it; and, thirdly, it is much larger and therefore not a risk to children, who were thought to have picked up the cluster bombs considering them toys. The strong lobby at Dublin is satisfied that the BSFM is a weapon which serves the pure military purpose of protecting against tanks in warfare without damage to civilians.</p>

<a name="80603-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="08060383000066"></a>Together with the changes to the state pension in the Pensions Act 2007, this Bill represents the most radical reform to the pensions landscape since Lloyd George enacted the first state pension a century ago. It seeks to tackle undersaving by individuals and underprovision in the private pensions market. It will enable millions more to save for a better retirement, benefiting millions of low-paid workers, especially women, by giving them a pension for the first time. It will allow millions of those who do save the benefits of employer contributions for the first time.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_81"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 81</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80603-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="08060383000067"></a>The Bill is built around progressive values. It removes inequalities so that low income or lack of understanding will no longer be barriers to saving for the future. It promotes social justice, enabling millions more to realise their aspirations in retirement and to lead an active and more dignified later life. It builds on our reforms from last year, creating the basis for equality for women and carers, and with a more generous state pension linked to earnings.</p>

<a name="80603-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="08060383000068"></a>Since 1997 we have relentlessly sought to alleviate pensioner poverty and rebuild confidence in pensions. This year we are spending &#163;75 billion on our pensioners, &#163;12 billion a year more than if we had continued the policies of the previous Government. Our policies have targeted support at the poorest, lifting more than 1 million out of relative poverty and more than 2 million out of absolute poverty. As a result, pensioner incomes have risen across the board with the poorest benefiting the most, so that today old age is no longer a proxy for poverty.</p>

<a name="80603-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="08060383000069"></a>Today, though, we need to go further. The challenges posed by our ageing society mean that we need to look ahead not in years at a time but in decades. When the first state pension was introduced a century ago, there was just one pensioner for every 10 people of working age. Today there are only four people of working age to every pensioner, and by 2050 that will fall to just two.</p>

<a name="80603-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="08060383000070"></a>In 1908, pensions were an insurance against the risk of old age; today they are a necessity for the certainty of old age. With longer, healthier retirements, people&#146;s aspirations and expectations are increasing. However, too few people currently save for retirement. More than 40 per cent of working-age employees are not saving at all, and that is even more pronounced among the young, with only one in seven aged between 20 and 24 saving compared to about half of those aged over 35.</p>

<a name="80603-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="08060383000071"></a>The Bill forms the second part of the Turner package of reforms to UK pensions. The first part, the Pensions Act 2007, created a simpler, fairer and more generous state pension. It addressed the historic inequalities faced by women and carers and committed us to restoring the link to earnings broken by the previous Government. The 2007 Act enables restoration in 2012 or by the end of the next Parliament. That means that by 2050 the basic state pension will be worth twice as much as it would have been otherwise.</p>

<a name="80603-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="08060383000072"></a>The Bill will build on that Act, reforming private pension provision to encourage more people to save. The linchpin of these reforms is a requirement for employers to automatically enrol eligible jobholders who are not in a qualifying pension scheme into an automatic enrolment scheme. Jobholders will be enrolled from the first day they become eligible, but they will have the right to opt out. The term &#147;jobholder&#148; is defined widely and includes agency workers.</p>

<a name="80603-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="08060383000073"></a>The Bill places a duty on employers to pay contributions at least equal to 3 per cent of earnings of an individual between &#163;5,035 and &#163;33,540 in 2006-07 earnings terms. We believe that automatic enrolment will change the equation; instead of inertia preventing saving, it will result in saving. Having a pension will  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_82"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 82</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>become the default position. While automatic enrolment creates the presumption to save, the employer contribution gives individuals a clear incentive to save. For most, their money will be matched pound for pound by a combination of contributions from their employer and the state through tax relief.</p>

<a name="80603-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="08060383000074"></a>The Bill provides for the Pensions Regulator to have overall responsibility for the compliance regime. It also introduces new employment rights that will protect workers from unfair treatment if they decide not to opt out of pension saving and measures to deter employers from encouraging or forcing workers to opt out. We are proposing to strengthen these provisions by bringing forward an amendment introducing a prohibition on inducements to opt out. </p>

<a name="80603-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="08060383000075"></a>For those employers who do not already offer an adequate scheme, Chapter 4 of Part 1 gives the Secretary of State the power to establish a pension scheme. The new pension scheme, or personal accounts, will be targeted where the need is greatest&#151;low to median earners with limited access currently to good quality occupational pension provision&#151;providing a simple, easy-to-understand product with low charges. Personal accounts will be a trust-based scheme, procured by the Government but run independently of Government for the benefit of members.</p>

<a name="80603-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="08060383000076"></a>Chapter 5 broadens the remit of the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority to take forward the implementation work for this scheme. The size and nature of the personal accounts scheme presents a number of challenges in developing a viable strategy. We cannot take decisions on the best approach until PADA has been given the powers, through the Bill, to complete the design of the scheme and engage with private-sector suppliers. However, we are clear that any strategy will need to deliver low charges for members; be consistent with our intentions for the scheme to be self-financing in the long term; be commercially viable; and comply with EU state-aid rules. We do not want to unfairly advantage this scheme. Indeed, the broadened remit of PADA requires it to have due regard to a number of principles, embedded in which is the focus on the target group and being complementary to existing provision.</p>

<a name="80603-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="08060383000077"></a>It is important that these reforms are designed to complement, rather than replace, existing employer provision. That is why the Bill includes a number of measures discouraging employers with good schemes from levelling down. Employers with existing good schemes will be encouraged to continue offering them via a straightforward qualification test. We propose a ban on transfers between existing pension schemes and personal accounts, and an annual contribution limit of &#163;3,600 in terms of 2005 earnings. Further, we are helping employers to adjust to the new minimum contribution requirements over a three-year period.</p>

<a name="80603-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08060383000078"></a>This Bill has engendered considerable debate around savings incentives and the impact of means-tested benefits. This is not a new issue; nor is it created by this Bill. Our reforms to the basic state pension and the state second pension will help to reduce means- testing and provide a solid foundation for private saving.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08060383000079"></a>The measures in the Bill will further improve incentives to save. Millions of workers&#151;many for the first time&#151;will see their pension contributions matched pound for pound through employer contributions and tax relief. The majority of those who are auto-enrolled can expect to benefit from having saved, including those on benefits. We recognise the need for well-informed discussion and evaluation of savings incentives, and have therefore established a government-led work programme to consider this issue. We also recognise that individuals will need access to relevant and accurate information when they are auto-enrolled, but do not believe that they will need regulated advice or, in most cases, extensive guidance.</p>

<a name="80603-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08060383000080"></a>The UK still has strong private pension provision. In 2005, the value of pension funds in the UK was approaching &#163;1 trillion, about two-thirds of GDP. We recognise the decline in defined-benefit pension schemes. It is a steady decline that has occurred since the mid-1960s, and is not confined to the UK. We want to send a clear message to employers with good pension schemes: &#147;We want you to continue&#148;.</p>

<a name="80603-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08060383000081"></a>The present regulatory system governing occupational pensions has grown incrementally over the past 30 years. It is now, by common consent, lengthy, complicated and hard to understand. That is why we announced a rolling deregulatory review and why, in this Bill, we are determined to reduce legislative burdens on employers, while recognising the balance needed to protect members&#146; interests. We will reduce the revaluation cap on pensions which build up in the future from 5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. We will repeal the requirements relating to safeguarded rights, removing a layer of particular complexity for scheme administrators. As a further measure to support existing provision, following clarification from the European Commission, we are bringing forward amendments to enable automatic enrolment into qualifying workplace personal pensions. This is an important and growing market and these amendments will enable WPPs to take advantage of the benefits of auto-enrolment.</p>

<a name="80603-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08060383000082"></a>While supporting the existing pensions market, we must not lose sight of the continuing need to protect scheme members. We recognise the importance of innovation in the pensions buyout market, but we must also be alive to the emerging risks posed by particular business models. That is why we are consulting on changes to the anti-avoidance powers of the Pensions Regulator. Following the outcome of the consultation, we may bring forward amendments to the regulator&#146;s powers.</p>

<a name="80603-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08060383000083"></a>Changes to the Pension Protection Fund are provided for in the Bill, especially to enable compensation to be shared on divorce or dissolution of a civil partnership. We are seeking to allow members of the Pension Protection Fund who are terminally ill to claim a lump sum, bringing this into line with the practice of the financial assistance scheme.</p>

<a name="80603-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08060383000084"></a>We will also bring forward amendments to ensure that the historic settlement reached on the financial assistance scheme can extend to certain schemes that formerly fell between the PPF and FAS and, consistent with that settlement, an extension of the current restriction on annuitisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08060383000085"></a>There are other important matters in the Bill which I am sure we will have the opportunity to consider in Committee. They include easement of pension credit arrangements for those aged 75 or over, consolidation of accrued rights under the succession of earnings-related state schemes and provisions to enable pensions paid under the Pensions (Polish Forces) Scheme to be paid to those who are now resident in Poland.</p>

The bulk of them are drafting amendments designed further to clarify the legislation rather than change our intended policy. I am pleased to announce that we will bring forward amendments to comply with all of the recommendations made by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee last month.</p>

In this Bill, we therefore intend to bring forward amendments to allow the controlled sharing of data with energy companies.</p>

<a name="80603-0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08060383000088"></a>We are also pleased to bring forward an amendment to help those resettled in Britain through Kindertransport during the 1930s. Changes to their UK national insurance records will allow the German authorities to recalculate their entitlement. I am committed to tabling government amendments at the earliest opportunity to enable noble Lords to take a considered view.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08060383000089"></a>The Bill has been the subject of an exceptional consensus. There has rightly been debate about the details and I do not doubt that there will be more in your Lordships&#146; House. The Government have sought to play their part&#151;for instance, over savings incentives&#151;and have listened to the debate and mapped a way forward. From the TUC to the CBI, Age Concern, NAPF, EEF, Which?, EHRC, ABI, PPI and others, we have seen a mature understanding of the long-term issues at stake. There is a pressing need for these reforms. One of the pensions commissioners, Professor John Hills, stated in January this year:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="08060383000332"></a>&#147;We believe that there is a great prize here. The reforms in last year&#146;s Act and, potentially, in this Bill, offer the opportunity to open up low-cost savings for retirement to a group of people who have never had that before&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08060383000333"></a>We know that the pension system hitherto, state and private, has discriminated against women. It was not necessarily always by intent, but its provisions did not fully take account of the differing work patterns and particularly the caring responsibilities which fall disproportionately to women. The measures in the Bill, taken together with the reforms provided for in last year&#146;s Pensions Act and the reform of SERPS, are transforming the pension prospects of women. They lay the basis for equality and justice and take us beyond the Beveridge settlement, which, however far-sighted, envisaged a society focused on men. This Bill will provide millions of women with a chance to save or to save more.No Government in our country&#146;s history have done more to better the pension prospects for all women.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08060383000334"></a>There is an outstanding issue concerning whether we can do yet more to redress the inequalities of the past by introducing opportunities for additional buy-in of class 3 national insurance contributions. We have not hitherto found a way to deliver a targeted solution consistent with the criteria of fairness, affordability and simplicity, but we are continuing to consider these issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08060383000090"></a>This is a truly historic Bill, which will complete the reform package. On top of a wider and more generous state pension, the Bill will give millions of people access to private pension saving for the first time. We will see 9 million more people saving and &#163;10 billion a year more saved in pensions. This is a transformation of the private pensions landscape and a blueprint for embedding a new savings culture in Great Britain. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

I welcome that decision, and the overall tenor of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80603-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="08060383000093"></a>The Minister mentioned consensus; we do not resile from what our honourable friends said in another place. However, it is no good for the Government to assume that everything in the garden is beautiful. There is a collective view among parties&#151;and, as the Minister just said, among stakeholders&#151;that it is right to introduce personal accounts, and as soon as is practicable. He mentioned 2012, just three and a bit years after Royal Assent&#151;a tight timetable if ever I saw one. I wonder whether it is achievable. Consensus works both ways. Dogmatism on the details will not maintain this consensus. It is the details that worry me and my noble friends. Your Lordships are in for a lot more explanation from the Minister before we can agree on the way forward for personal pensions.</p>

<a name="80603-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="08060383000094"></a>I hope that the House will forgive me if I look back. When this Government took over running the country in 1997, they inherited a pensions industry that was the envy of the world, with 6.2 million employees enrolled in private sector workplace pensions, 5 million of them in defined benefit schemes. Savings were high, with a total saving of &#163;54.39 billion and a savings ratio of 9.5 per cent. Today the position is very different and the EU recently reported that Great Britain was fourth from bottom of the pensioner poverty league. Only pensioners in Spain, Latvia and Cyprus are more likely to fall into poverty. In 2007, total savings were only &#163;26.413 billion and the savings ratio was 2.9 per cent. The number of active members of pension schemes has fallen from 5.1 million to 3.3 million. Only 900,000 workers are in defined benefit schemes in the private sector. These schemes have closed not only to new members, but to existing employees as well. Workers have had to suffer a reduced income in retirement after being forced into DC schemes. State employees, though, have on the whole retained their DB schemes, resulting in much greater retirement income. No wonder jealousy abounds.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_86"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 86</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80603-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="08060383000095"></a>There are two reasons for this downgrading of private sector pensions. The main one is affordability&#151;affected, obviously, by increased longevity. Firms have found that they have to put more into their pension schemes to maintain the status quo. Secondly, there is the effect on pension schemes of the Government&#146;s decision to remove advanced corporation tax in one fell swoop. This brought an extra &#163;5 billion a year into the Treasury&#151;&#163;55 billion to date. I admit that not all of this was attributable to the investment income of pension schemes. However, the Government have never admitted that there was any effect on schemes, although the Pensions Policy Institute&#151;it is very well thought of&#151;believed the figure was between &#163;2.5 billion and &#163;3.5 billion a year. What prospective pensioner has gained from this? Have pensioners really benefited to the tune of &#163;2.5 billion a year from, for example, the National Health Service?</p>

<a name="80603-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="08060383000096"></a>The Government recognised, even in those early days, that one group of employees was not saving for a pension, so they invented stakeholder pensions, which we were told would be applied for by 4 million to 7 million employees. By May 2006, according to the Government&#146;s White Paper, only 2.7 million of them had been sold. I do not believe that that is to be seen as a prognosis for this Bill, most of which covers personal accounts along the lines of the scheme envisaged by the noble Lord, Lord Turner of Ecchinswell, and his Pensions Commission. The Minister has revised the figures to the top end of the original figures; the first impact assessment that I saw referred to between 6 million and 9 million employees but the Minister mentioned 9 million employees alone in his speech.</p>

<a name="80603-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="08060383000097"></a>However many employees are involved, the Government believe that they will have pensions savings for the first time because of auto-enrolment, by which workers have to be make a positive decision to opt out, but not on day one. An added twist is that employees will pay into the scheme from their first pay date after day one and get their money back if they opt out. Knowing this Government, I assume that that will be without interest. Ministers in another place have stated that the decision to opt out must be taken within a month. This may be time enough if you are paid weekly, as you will be able to see the effect of the withdrawal of 4 per cent of your pay cheque on your household income, but what about those who are paid monthly? Will it not take more than one pay period to establish whether they are doing the right thing by remaining in a personal account? We will discuss that in Committee. I am glad to hear, though, that the Minister intends to amend the Bill to allow any firm to auto-enrol its employees into its existing workplace pension.</p>

<a name="80603-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="08060383000098"></a>We will look, too, at the very curious drafting of the Bill, which, although it is all about personal accounts&#151;or 90 per cent of it is, at least&#151;does not even mention them until Clause 58, some half way through. The Minister could save himself an awful lot of trouble by telling me why that is so when he winds up, as well as why it is necessary to have quite so many regulation-making powers, which are as yet pretty opaque. I counted 11 of them in the first 28 clauses, which must be a record. I read the comments of your Lordships&#146; Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_87"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 87</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with much interest, and I am interested to hear that the Minister is going to accept all its recommendations. Certainly, the Government&#146;s response to that report did not give me that impression, so this is looking on the brighter side.</p>

<a name="80603-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08060383000099"></a>As for the scheme itself, the Government are rightly seeking to contract it out to the private sector, to be overseen by a board of trustees. On their own figures, 60 per cent of moderate to low earners, earning from &#163;5,000 to &#163;35,000 a year, are not saving for their retirement, so a low-level pension scheme is certainly needed. However, especially at the top end of the range&#151;let us say from &#163;20,000 to &#163;35,000&#151;personal accounts will be competing with existing schemes. There must therefore be a level playing field. It is of particular note that for personal accounts wages are counted as gross, whereas for any workplace pension that I have heard of they are counted as net. We will investigate that in Committee.</p>

<a name="80603-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08060383000100"></a>There is, too, a particular worry that firms will be tempted to downgrade their existing schemes to or near the basic minimum of 4 per cent from employees and 3 per cent from themselves. I am glad that government amendments are promised to stop employers inducing their employees to opt out. There are also concerns about the qualifying schemes, which, if you are a member of them, may absolve you from enrolling in personal accounts. Can a private pension scheme with no employer input, for example, be a qualifying scheme?</p>

<a name="80603-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08060383000101"></a>Many of the earners that we are talking about are likely to take career breaks, either voluntarily or involuntarily, in which case their contributions will cease. We will seek to change the Government&#146;s mind on whether top-ups are to be allowed when people are back in work. After all, that is exactly what is allowed with state pensions.</p>

<a name="80603-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="08060383000102"></a>On the subject of state pensions, I believe that in the dying days of last year&#146;s Pensions Bill the Government behaved shabbily in persuading the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, to withdraw her amendment on women being able to make up more contribution years than is allowable on the basis that they would review the position, giving the distinct impression that something could be done. The Minister was then forced to come to the House to say that the Government had reviewed the position and decided to make no change. I have no doubt that the issue will be raised again in our debates, and that the thorny issue of compulsory annuities at 75 will figure in our discussions.</p>

<a name="80603-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="08060383000103"></a>There is also the tie-in between state pensions and personal accounts because of the date of increasing the former by earnings gross, which the Pensions Commission said was intrinsically entwined with personal accounts. Had my party won the last election, it would have already happened, but the Government have been very coy about the start date. Should not the change be made at the same time as personal accounts start in 2012?</p>

<a name="80603-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="08060383000104"></a>I readily understand why it will take at least that long to prepare the ground, to arrange the contracting out, and for the pensions industry to prepare the individual funds from which to choose, which include a Sharia fund but I note no ethical fund. Nor indeed, apart from a default fund, has there been any announcement of other sorts of funds.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_88"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 88</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80603-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08060383000105"></a>There is a balance to be struck here and we need to work it out in Committee, somewhere between caution at the beginning and things that employees will want to do with their contributions. However, the more funds there are, the more confusing the scheme will be for the employees it is aimed at. We believe that the KISS principle should apply. Is it, for instance, right that it is only after personal accounts are up and running for five years that a decision will be made about whether an employee&#146;s extra funds can be put into the scheme or, indeed, small amounts of money taken out? That is almost 10 years away. That will not give confidence to many people, especially migrant workers, who are on the whole only in the United Kingdom for a short time before returning to their country of origin. Is Brussels turning a blind eye to this as it applies to EU citizens, or do they not know about it?</p>

<a name="80603-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08060383000106"></a>We also have concerns about the cost of personal accounts and when the scheme will be self-financing. To what extent will the start-up costs fail to be paid back by the trustees when it is up and running? As to the overall cost of the scheme, I hope that the Pensions Commission&#146;s suggestion of 0.3 per cent a year can be adhered to. However, that cannot possibly cover advice to employees, which the noble Lord mentioned briefly, so who will provide this? We will certainly be looking at that in Committee.</p>

<a name="80603-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08060383000107"></a>My noble friend Lady Noakes in particular will be looking critically at the new trustee body and the length of time that the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority will survive after the former is set up.</p>

<a name="80603-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08060383000108"></a>Your Lordships will remember only too well the plight of the 125,000 pensioners whose firm had become broke, and the fact that the Government were forced by the ombudsman and the High Court to bring in the distinctly mean financial assistance scheme in 2004 by means of a clause in the Pensions Bill of that year, and only then at the last minute after the threat of a major rebellion by Back-Benchers. That clause was purely and simply an order-making power, a Henry VIII power. All the operative legislation on the FAS has so far been by affirmative instrument. These have included the much better terms and conditions that the Government were forced into yet again and which my noble friend Lord Taylor and the Minister debated the week before the Recess. It is always nice to welcome a reformed sinner, and I congratulate Ministers in the DWP on achieving them. No doubt a tremendous battle ensued with the dead hand of the Treasury, but they got there in the end to the great relief of a large number of people who believed their pensions to be safe and discovered that they were not.</p>

<a name="80603-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08060383000109"></a>I only mention this because I note that part of the Government&#146;s most recent changes involved changes to the definitions of &#147;qualifying member&#148; and &#147;qualifying pension scheme&#148;, and those cannot be made by order, even an affirmative one, which is why we find them in this Bill.</p>

<a name="80603-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="08060383000110"></a>It has become a part of the pensions arena that occasionally pension funds get bought by insurance companies and others, and that could be said to be a case of business models running ahead of the regulatory framework. Ministers have said that they  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_89"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 89</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>intend to give the regulator draconian powers over this perfectly legitimate activity, which can be to the benefit of both existing and future pensioners, affording them more security. I do not know how far these plans are advanced or whether they are even intended for this Bill or some future one, perhaps next year&#146;s welfare Bill. To allow pension schemes to be sold extraterritorially where there is no robust control by the regulator needs thinking about extremely carefully. I am also concerned that such powers are to be so draconian as to prevent perfectly reasonable sales and so throw the baby out with the bath-water.</p>

<a name="80603-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="08060383000111"></a>In some ways, one can liken this Bill to a train journey. We know the starting point&#151;the Pensions Commission&#146;s report. We know where we want to get to: the pension scheme for low-to-middle earners that does not exist at the moment. These are likely to work in small and medium-sized enterprises and there are concerns about the costs of personal accounts to them. Although we welcome the proposals to phase in personal accounts, this remains a worry. Continuing with my metaphor, the vague regulation powers are like scheduled stops in the middle of the night where you cannot read the station signs. Indeed, some of the stops are as yet unscheduled. We have to investigate a lot more before we arrive at our destination&#151;which I am sure after several weeks we will.</p>

We all want to reverse the spiral of decline in private pension provision over recent years. It must be a cause for real national concern, not a party political point, that good quality final salary pension schemes of the type I have been proud to manage for most of my working life are now limited to the public sector and the odd oil company and bank. In 1995, 5 million people were members of open defined benefit pension schemes. As the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, said, today that figure is 900,000&#151;a fall of five-sixths. We all want to see as many people as possible saving again for a pension as long as they keep the fruits of their saving when they retire and do not see it eaten away by the maggot of means-testing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="08060383000114"></a>We must also fear for the future when family budgets are so savagely squeezed today. Two-fifths of households have negative monthly cash flows and nearly half of all credit card holders do not clear their debt each month. When hard-pressed families cannot find the cash for their gas bill or mortgage payment, they are sadly not going to spend a penny on a new pension. Debt destroys pensions saving today and it will cast its shadow over the whole &#147;does it pay to save?&#148; debate up to 2012 and beyond. Mike O&#146;Brien, Minister for Pensions Reform, highlighted the problem just this week in the <I>Financial Adviser</I>. Referring to the

He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="08060383000335"></a>&#147;It is up to those with these large debts to decide whether they are best served servicing these debts or putting money into personal accounts. We cannot make decisions for people and it is up to them to inform themselves on the best financial choices&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80603-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="08060383000115"></a>Well yes, but only up to a point. The 8 million or 9 million people on low and middle incomes being auto-enrolled into personal accounts&#151;especially women who miss out so badly today&#151;will ultimately have to make their own decisions. Yet they will need access to good quality, simple and generic advice on one of the biggest financial decisions of their lives in what will be for many uncharted financial waters. Saying it is up to them to inform themselves on the best financial choices if they have large debts sends the wrong message. Millions of people drowning in debt desperately need help. With the collapsing housing market, a mortgage famine and savage credit squeeze, the debt crisis will not be solved any time soon.</p>

<a name="80603-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="08060383000116"></a>We have a cross-party consensus on the aims of pensions policy and the brave project of personal accounts at the heart of the Bill. In the cut and thrust of scrutiny and amendment as we improve the Bill, we on these Benches will always remember that a national pensions saving scheme, as we called it, was our idea. We will oppose any attempts to hobble it, pad it out or make the rules for personal accounts too restrictive. Like the People's Pension Coalition of <I>Which?</I>, Help the Aged, Age Concern, the TUC and the Equality and Human Rights Commission, we want to make personal accounts as simple, accessible and cost effective as possible&#151;a real people's pension scheme.</p>

<a name="80603-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="08060383000117"></a>Paul Myners and Tim Jones, the chairman and the chief executive of PADA, were very persuasive in the useful evidence session in Committee in the Commons when they urged Parliament to avoid the temptation to add bells and whistles to personal accounts. Everyone in the pensions world always condemns complexity, but then each of us seems to have our own pet scheme or qualification to add to whatever is proposed. My Bill team and I have had many fascinating meetings and read many useful submissions on the Bill from business, charities, academics and campaigning organisations. We will discuss their ideas at length in Committee and, I am sure, benefit from them. But the first question on my mind on any amendment on personal accounts will be: does this make the scheme simpler to operate and understand? Does it keep the costs down so that people of modest means saving for the first time for a pension get the biggest bang they possibly can for their buck?</p>

<a name="80603-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="08060383000118"></a>The threat of &#147;levelling down&#148; posed by personal accounts is much exaggerated. It has been going on for years, well before personal accounts came in, and will continue quite independently. For perfectly understandable reasons, our highly sophisticated and profitable financial services industry has not been able to reach the 8 million or 9 million people who are the target market for personal accounts, as the abject  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_91"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 91</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>failure of stakeholder pensions proved. Do not stop millions of people being &#147;levelled up&#148; from no private pension saving at all.</p>

<a name="80603-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="08060383000119"></a>Personal accounts do not represent a serious commercial threat to existing pension providers. It just is not their market, however fond our memories might be&#151;for those of us old enough to remember&#151;of the man from the Pru in his bicycle clips pedalling from door to door. That just is not something they can do today. Some of our businesses and insurance companies should be careful not to be seen to be adopting a dog in the manger approach. Financial services firms also will benefit both from investment management fees on the tens or even hundreds of billions being invested in personal accounts and from massive additional annuity business when personal account holders retire.</p>

<a name="80603-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="08060383000120"></a>So far so good; we are part of the consensus with the Government on making personal accounts work. But we will not be able to support much of the detail of the Bill in this place unless the Government face up far more honestly to the scale of the means-testing and generic advice problems and take action. The key problem on means-testing is still that our basic state pension is far too low&#151;down, as the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, pointed out, in the European relegation zone. Let me use another analogy. Britain&#146;s rotten state pension is now worth less as a share of wages than when Clem Attlee was Prime Minister in 1950. We will move amendments in Committee to link pensions to earnings again, and we will be hoping&#151;and hoping the Conservatives will come with us&#151;to do that by 2010 at the latest, as the Turner commission proposed. We hope the Conservatives will back the link again, as they did in their last general election manifesto. Three million pensioners cannot wait until Labour&#146;s last date of 2015, because they will be dead.</p>

<a name="80603-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="08060383000121"></a>Far too many people&#151;30 per cent to 40 per cent on the Department for Work and Pensions&#146; own estimates released yesterday&#151;will see chunks of their savings eroded by losing means-tested benefits. That can lay the Government open to a charge of mass pensions mis-selling unless the groups at most risk are guaranteed access to high-quality face-to-face generic pensions and debt advice. We are most concerned, as are the Pensions Policy Institute and the People's Pension Coalition, about the highest risk group: people over 50 who are likely to be on housing benefit when they retire.</p>

<a name="80603-0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="08060383000122"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, made clear, the Conservatives care about means-testing too; of course they do. But unlike the Liberal Democrats they are not prepared to make a commitment to raise the basic state pension over two Parliaments so that pensioners then receive as of right the means-tested benefits they now have to apply for. As we know from the Department for Work and Pensions&#146; annual report, which has only just come out, it is clearly failing to get pension credit out even to its fairly modest targets, falling 800,000 short. That is just not working and not getting through. A simple citizens&#146; pension is the right and straightforward way to make sure people keep every pound they save. Meanwhile, let us at least try and carry the House with us on the principle that the earnings link will be restored as soon as possible, whichever party is in power.</p>

<a name="80603-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="08060383000123"></a>My noble friend Lady Thomas of Winchester will call for a massive expansion of integrated debt and pensions advice, based on the uniquely trusted one-stop shop, the citizens advice bureau. How can it be the right advice for people to save for a pension with an expected long-term rate of return of 7 or 8 per cent if they are paying 17 per cent a year, which is the average rate of interest on unpaid, unsettled credit card bills, or 30, 40 or 50 per cent on other borrowing, as so many lower-income people are today?</p>

<a name="80603-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="08060383000124"></a>The Government are clearly worried by the widely held and well-informed concern about whether it will pay for these high-risk groups to save. As the Minister has just said, they have set up a work programme for stakeholders which will report by the end of 2008. The Liberal Democrat and Conservative Front Benches have had an invitation, with an illustrious list of stakeholders in the pension debate, to a savings incentive seminar in the Duke of Wellington Hall on 11 June. I hope that DWP Ministers do not copy the example of the Duke who, when asked how his first Cabinet meeting had gone, said, &#147;I gave them their orders but they all insisted on asking questions&#148;. I am afraid I have a prior engagement with the Association of Mirror Pensioners&#151;the innocent victims of pirate captain Maxwell&#151;but I very much hope that our new DWP spokesperson in the Commons, Jenny Willott MP, will be able to go. Frankly, a report after the Bill has been passed is not good enough. We on these Benches warned James Purnell in his previous incarnation as a DWP Minister years ago that he had to take the advice gap more seriously and urgently. We are not prepared to buy a pig in a poke, even from him.</p>

<a name="80603-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="08060383000125"></a>We will bring forward amendments to make it crystal clear to both buyers and sellers of annuities that the full range of options must be made available, including enhanced annuities. These used to be called impaired life annuities when they started but that had a rather ominous ring to it. This is for up to 40 per cent of people who might, for instance, have been smokers or had diabetes or cancer. Now you can get a better rate if you have an unhealthy postcode in Liverpool or Glasgow. As the <I>Mail on Sunday</I> and the <I>Sunday Times</I> have highlighted, only a quarter of people eligible currently buy these best-value products. More than half a million people retired in Britain last year and more than 400,000 bought annuities. They lost more than &#163;1 billion in pensions altogether by not getting proper advice on their best-value annuity. That rip-off must stop.</p>

<a name="80603-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08060383000126"></a>There is consensus on the aims of pensions policy and on the direction of travel but not on the Government&#146;s snail&#146;s pace of reform and poverty of ambition. Let us give women and carers pension justice now, as this House demanded overwhelmingly under the excellent lead of the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, last year, by letting them buy back more years to qualify for a full basic state pension. Let us protect those most at risk from wasting their hard-earned pension savings by rolling out face-to-face debt and pension advice in every constituency in the country. And let us set a firm date now, whichever party is in power, to end the shameful erosion of our basic state pension and link it to average earnings to turn back at

This House must send a bolder and clearer Bill back down the corridor after it has done its job over the summer and autumn.</p>
<a name="time_6"></a>
<a name="80603-0004.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="08060383000355"></a>3.53 pm</h5>

<p><a name="st_52"></a>
<a name="08060383000127"></a><a name="80603-0004.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80603-0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08060383000429"></a>Baroness Hollis of Heigham:</b> My Lords, pensions are designed to deal with the low-income and longevity of old age by smoothing earnings from work to retirement and locking them away. We ask people to start saving early, to save enough, to do so regularly, and not to touch their savings for 40 years with the promise that it will be worth it in the end. Yet none of this makes much sense for many women. Pensions have been a poor fit for the risks and realities they face, which is why, outside the public sector, as both of the previous speakers have said, so few low-earning women have pensions. For pensions you need to start early, for example by 30, and pay regularly, but whereas men&#146;s earnings peak at 42, and their pension payments with it, women&#146;s peak around 29 and then fall off. If they have children, half of them stop paying into a pension whereas men carry on.</p>

<a name="80603-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="08060383000128"></a>Do they pay in enough? Women are paid less, they often work part time or for small employers, they move jobs more often and they are exposed to risks that most men do not face, including lone parenthood and caring responsibilities. They therefore want savings that they can access in an emergency, not a pension that they cannot access. His income, for example, rises after divorce; hers falls. She may experience more financial pressure during her working life than at retirement, unlike him.</p>

<a name="80603-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08060383000129"></a>Over the years, the basic state pension has recognised this through HRP, carers&#146; credits and, in particular, last year&#146;s excellent Bill, but occupational pensions have not, because they presume a full-time attachment to the labour market. Personal accounts are designed to be an occupational pension for the low paid, especially women. There are low rates, low charges, auto-enrolment, no small-firm exemptions and there is greater portability. They are contracted in and built on the platform of the BSP and the state second pension.</p>

<a name="80603-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="08060383000130"></a>To what extent does the Bill rectify the shortcomings in conventional pension provision for women? To what extent is it a good fit, given women&#146;s needs? To what extent will the Bill overcome poverty in retirement? To what extent will it encourage women to save and will saving be worth it? I apologise to the House&#151;well, no, actually I do not&#151;for putting up the gender filter in this way, because personal accounts very much have low-paid women in mind.</p>

<a name="80603-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="08060383000131"></a>Auto-enrolment should encourage the early start of payments and research suggests that up to 70 per cent of women will continue to pay in, which is good news, and it should be worth it, which is very good news. If a woman on half median earnings, say &#163;11,000 a year, saves for 30 years&#151;not 40 years, but 30&#151;in a personal account, I calculate that she should have a replacement income in retirement of some 85 per cent of her earnings, which is transforming. I congratulate my noble and right honourable friends in the DWP on such an achievement.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_94"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 94</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80603-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08060383000132"></a>However, certain safeguards need to be in place to achieve that outcome. First, as both noble Lords on the Benches opposite have mentioned&#151;for which I am grateful&#151;there must be an opportunity for women to have a full basic state pension by having a right of buy-back for missing years when they have been looking after other people, children or the elderly, instead of themselves. This issue is not going away, as the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, helpfully reminded the House. I hope that the Government will agree with that; if they do not, I shall again seek the support of the House on this issue.</p>

<a name="80603-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08060383000133"></a>The second safeguard is that with a broken work record a woman&#146;s ability to save may be more lumpy than that of a man. Pension sharing on divorce may bring in a small sum, or she may receive a small inheritance following caring, which has taken her out of the labour market. So we need to add a modest lifetime cap in addition to the annual cap. Will my noble friend confirm that at the very least&#151;I pick up a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale&#151;women will be able to buy back not just current years in which they might be out of the labour market, but missing past years, which would then exceed their annual contribution, as with the BSP? Given that she changes jobs more frequently and may pile up several very small pots, she should, within limits, be allowed to transfer them into her personal account. We all accept that personal accounts should draw in new money, not recycled, existing money. We need greater flexibility regarding women&#146;s capacity to contribute. The simplicity of a single pot with smaller pots going into it as a result of her job mobility would be a great gain and very attractive.</p>

<a name="80603-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08060383000134"></a>Another issue that we must explore, given that pension contributions to personal accounts, unlike WPPs, are made only on earnings above &#163;5,000, is that a woman with two &#163;6,000 jobs is very much worse off than a woman with one &#163;12,000 job. I am confident that we can find a way through this issue in Committee.</p>

<a name="80603-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08060383000135"></a>Thirdly&#151;this has already been mentioned by noble Lords&#151;we must ensure that we spring the trap of means-tested benefits. Like everyone else, I am well aware of the downside of IRBs, especially the intractable housing benefit, although I understand that there is a government working party on this. Of course, now only a quarter of pensioners are not owner-occupiers and the number is reducing. I think we all understand that, unless need is targeted, benefits will be either too limited in their effect on the individual or, in an attempt to make them adequate but universal, too expensive for the community.</p>

<a name="80603-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="08060383000136"></a>Men have more than twice the pension income of women. Pension credit is mostly claimed by and paid to single women&#151;mainly elderly widows whose income has died with their husband. That is usually because his annuity is single-life, flat-rate and eroded by inflation. I know that there are technical difficulties with this but changing the rules on annuities might do more to keep widows off pension credit than changing the rules of pension credit. If not, unless and until women have their own pensions  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_95"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 95</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in their own right, widowhood will need the benefits and means-testing that stand between them and profound poverty.</p>

<a name="80603-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="08060383000137"></a>The complaints about means-testing may be erroneous in another way. In future, any woman retiring with a full earnings-linked basic state pension and a full state second pension would have an income of around &#163;145 in today&#146;s terms&#151;enough to float her off pension credit entirely. Therefore, the two state pensions added together would mean that at the point of retirement her income would be above the level of pension credit and she could enjoy and keep her personal account pound for pound. Full state pensions plus personal accounts, if paid in full, equal no means-testing at retirement.</p>

<a name="80603-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="08060383000138"></a>A fourth way of avoiding the means-test trap is by trivial commutation, which at the moment is limited to some &#163;16,000, or about &#163;1,200 a year, and is fussy and fiddly to administer. I hope that the Government will consider raising it to, say, &#163;25,000, doubling to 22 per cent the number of pensioners who are able to commute. Most pensioners live within their income but have a shortfall in capital for white goods, improved heating, the car, the roof or the walk-in bath/shower. Those things are especially necessary because, as pensioners grow frail, they need to adapt their homes if they are not to move into residential care, and that takes capital. Can we please have some joined-up thinking? After all, we can all turn capital into income if we wish but it is very difficult on a low income to turn income back into capital.</p>

<a name="80603-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08060383000139"></a>I should also like to see whether we can raise, or perhaps even align with commutation, the exempt capital in pension credit&#151;currently &#163;6,000&#151;and related benefits. However, that would be costly. It would require &#163;240,000 to raise it to &#163;15,000 and &#163;350,000 for a &#163;25,000 disregard for PC and related benefits, but it would spring pensioners out of means-tested benefits and into relative comfort in retirement.</p>

<a name="80603-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="08060383000140"></a>The next problem for women is that pension savings cannot be touched. That is fine for men; come children, divorce or frail parents, they continue to work and build a pension. Each of these life changes for women, however, may take them out of the full-time labour market, stop them saving and create a financial crisis. The product that many women say they want was proposed by the party opposite: a combined lifetime savings and pension accounts, or LISA. I have always been a fan of that. At the moment, we can put ISAs into pensions but we cannot put pensions back into ISAs. It is absurd that of the two pots of value that most people have&#151;a house and a pension&#151;it is easier to get money from the bricks than it is to get money from the money. LISAs were complicated and the American 401K scheme is probably far too loose, but perhaps I may suggest a way forward. On retirement, we all get 25 per cent of our pot tax-free. Subject to a de minimis&#151;let us say that you must have &#163;20,000 in your pension pot&#151;and a ceiling of, say, &#163;80,000 or &#163;100,000 so that there would be no fancy footwork for school fees, why should you not draw down during your working life that tax-free sum, giving your pension a defined top slice of liquidity&#151;a savings element? No  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_96"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 96</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>tax adjustments would be necessary. We obviously want to keep personal accounts simple but today we can draw our tax-free lump sum at 50 or 55, so today it is detached from paying a pension. No principle would be breached but it might overcome that psychological hurdle that you have locked money away for 40 years, come whatever crisis.</p>

<a name="80603-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08060383000141"></a>Most women would not want it or need it, but knowing that they could access between &#163;5,000 and &#163;25,000 according to the size of their pot for divorce, disability, debt, risk of repossession before retirement instead of only at retirement, would allow women to overcome a major hurdle to pension savings&#151;their belief that pensions are selfish because their money is locked away for 40 years when they may need it 10 years down the road, given the huge financial riskiness of many women&#146;s lives compared to those of men. After all, pensions should reduce financial risk. As presently structured they can, for many women, add to it. I hope that we will pursue that avenue.</p>

<a name="80603-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="08060383000142"></a>This all suggests that for some women the decision to opt out would be finely balanced, and I follow the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, who was absolutely right. As John Hills said, the calculation for any individual as to whether to opt in or opt out is really quite simple. All they need to know is their age, gender, present and future employment status and earnings, existing savings and future investment returns, existing pension rights, present and future housing tenure, future eligibility for mean-tested benefits, future assets from elderly relatives&#151;and all these factors for their partners as well&#151;together with an assessment of their health and that of great-aunt Ethel&#146;s. But despite the complexity of risk, we can offer broad-brush group guidance, which is why sound financial information and advice is essential.</p>

<a name="80603-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="08060383000143"></a>I declare an interest as a trustee of the Pensions Advisory Service and we hope to produce a traffic-light system offering high, medium and low-risk guides to people seeking advice. We must address this issue, otherwise the Government and employers, both, face a particular risk and charge of mis-selling.</p>

<a name="80603-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="08060383000144"></a>I give a warm welcome to the Bill; profound gratitude to the noble Lord, Lord, Turner, for making it possible; and to the Government for making it happen. We still have issues to address, safety nets to insert and loopholes to close if women are fully and safely to gain from this Bill, but we look forward to its future progress.</p>

I strongly support the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, in the work that she has been doing to ensure the right for women to buy back up to nine years of insurance contributions. I cannot understand why the Government find it so difficult to introduce that change, and I hope that something will be done to get it right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="08060383000146"></a>I also agree with the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, that our current state pension is still too low. If raised, it would deal with a lot of the problems of means-testing, and it needs to be relinked to earnings sooner than the Government plan for the obvious reason that a lot of the people about whom we are most worried will be dead by the time they would receive that benefit.</p>

<a name="80603-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="08060383000147"></a>I welcome many aspects of the Bill, particularly the ones that I shall mention briefly, such as the broad definition of &#147;jobholder&#148; so that people with no formal contract can be included, and the personal accounts that are essential for jobholders who are not in current qualifying pension schemes. By ensuring automatic enrolment and compulsory employer contributions to personal accounts, people will be able to support themselves much better in the future. This automatic enrolment can combat the tendency not to act when faced with financial difficulties, which, sadly, as the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, said so eloquently, is a problem that many, particularly younger people, face at the moment.</p>

<a name="80603-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08060383000148"></a>The Government need to ensure that personal accounts are offered to low and middle-income people who want to save, regardless of whether they take breaks from work for short periods. Age Concern has pointed out that that is very important. I am also worried about non-employed people, some of whom are the carers on whom we depend so much for the care of the very frail people in our population. We must ensure that such people are able to join personal accounts because, as the Bill is currently drafted, they may be excluded unless they have previously been a member of a scheme. I hope that the Government will be able to do something about that.</p>

<a name="80603-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="08060383000149"></a>I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, about trivial commutation. We have a fast-ageing population and many people will live to be very old and very frail. They need capital, not just income, and we need to ensure that poorer pensioners have access to some capital if they are to achieve the essential changes to their homes which enable them to stay in them in some comfort.</p>

<a name="80603-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08060383000150"></a>The Commission for Equality and Human Rights, on which I serve, has pointed out that there may be some individuals for whom savings will not pay, as their savings in personal accounts or other savings products will serve merely to replace means-tested benefits, such as pension credit, housing benefit or council tax benefit to which they would have been entitled had they not saved. The Pensions Policy Institute has pointed out that dilemma and I hope that the Government will be able to solve it.</p>

<a name="80603-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="08060383000151"></a>Another group that has been mentioned to me is people who change employers regularly. Each time they leave a job they are given the option of taking back their pension contributions. When they ask what their contributions have bought in the way of a pension, they find that the amount is so little that they do not think it is worth keeping the pension in place. If we are not careful, such people will have no private pension at all when they eventually retire. We need to consider that group.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_98"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 98</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80603-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="08060383000152"></a>Some young people, often those who are self-employed, have very high, even interest-only mortgage repayments and they are putting off paying into a pension scheme. They have been relying on increasing property values which are now falling very fast and the prediction is that 1 million people will face negative equity in the near future. The Government should consider what incentives or help they can give to that group.</p>

<a name="80603-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="08060383000153"></a>A fully effective compliance regime is vital to ensure that no individual suffers detriment due to their employer failing to help them or attempting to coerce them into opting out of a scheme. We must ensure that that does not happen. There is an understandable concern in the pensions industry that some currently available and very sound pension schemes might be undermined because of the introduction of extremely flexible and low-cost products, which we know are essential. We need flexibility but the Government need to ensure that the mechanisms for levelling up do not result in levelling down elsewhere. I am sure that some of these points will be looked at in detail as the Bill goes through the House. We need to ensure that the Bill fulfils its potential to be of enormous benefit to our population as a whole. Lastly, I agree that information and advice services are essential, particularly for the target group of people for whom this Bill can do so much. We must get it right, as they need this Bill.</p>

<a name="08060383000154"></a><a name="80603-0004.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80603-0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08060383000431"></a>Baroness Turner of Camden:</b> My Lords, I welcome the opportunity to participate in this Second Reading debate and thank the Minister for his detailed introduction to this complex and important Bill. As he said, it is the second part of the Government&#146;s reform of the UK pension system and is based very largely on the report of the Pensions Commission, which was chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Turner of Ecchinswell. That took place against the problems caused by the disappearance of many final salary schemes and their replacement&#151;if they were replaced at all&#151;by money-purchase schemes offering less secure pension entitlement. Stakeholder pensions have not been successful, largely because employers only had to offer access and did not have to make payments to such schemes. People have not been saving enough for retirement, which is hardly surprising in view of the pressures upon those who have to struggle in middle life to pay the mortgage; pension provision is often the last thing they want to think about. Moreover, it has become clear that due to health improvements, which we should all welcome, people are living much longer, so we have an ageing population. The basic state pension does not provide enough to live on unless backed by means-tested benefits.</p>

<a name="80603-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08060383000155"></a>The Government&#146;s new personal accounts scheme has therefore attracted wide support. It is aimed at moderate to low earners who do not have access to a workplace pension scheme, and it places a duty on employers automatically to enrol jobholders in a qualifying workplace scheme, including the simple, low-cost saving scheme: the personal accounts scheme. The Personal Accounts Delivery Authority has had its remit broadened to enable it to oversee the establishment of the personal accounts scheme. That is the main thrust of the Government's pension reform programme, although there is much more detail to be discussed later.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_99"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 99</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80603-0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="08060383000156"></a>The main idea has been supported by consumer organisations, the main employer bodies, trade unions and the main political parties. That is important because major pension reforms are essentially long term and should not be undermined by possible future changes of Government. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, referred to past problems, and I agree with quite a lot of what he said. However, I remind him that Conservative Administrations have not always been very good about collective occupational pension provision. During the previous Conservative Administration, employees were encouraged to leave good schemes in favour of individual private pension provision and had to be compensated later for the resultant losses. I recall that well because at the time I was chair of the PIA Ombudsman Council, which had to deal with those claims.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80603-0005.htm"/>


<a name="80603-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08060383000157"></a>We now have a scheme on which I hope there is wide agreement. However, there are some matters that I would like to raise. An issue that has been raised in the Commons and by a number of organisations is the interaction with the benefits system. Jobholders will have the right to opt out of the scheme. If it seems that individuals who do not pay their 4 per cent contribution reach retirement just as well off, via the benefits system, as those who have paid, there will be an incentive to opt out. It must be made very clear that saving pays. I understand that the Government are aware of this concern and currently have the issue under consideration.</p>

<a name="80603-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="08060383000158"></a>Then there is the position of women, which has already been dealt with by the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, in an interesting and moving speech. Most poor pensioners are women, usually because the state basic scheme is based on contributions and women often have an interrupted work pattern and so do not qualify for a full basic state pension. The Government took certain steps in the previous Bill to remedy that, but did not do so completely, so this House passed an amendment that allowed women to buy back pension rights for the years when they were not able to pay contributions. Unfortunately the Government did not put that into operation and have since declined to do so. The problem of large numbers of women in poverty in old age remains. It has been suggested by many of us that it will continue until the contributory entitlement requirement is changed to a requirement based on residence. The issue will continue to be raised.</p>

<a name="80603-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="08060383000159"></a>Another concern, which I share, is that the new arrangements could result in a certain amount of levelling down. As the TUC has pointed out, the provision of a very good occupational pension scheme costs a great deal more than the minimum 3 per cent proposed for the personal accounts scheme. The Government should do everything possible to persuade those employers still providing final salary schemes to continue them. Where they have been discontinued in the private sector, it has been with direct opposition from the staff concerned, but where those staff have had the collective power and the will to oppose the disappearance of such schemes they have done so&#151;sometimes with success. I applaud them for doing so; future employees will thank them. In the mean time, some employers may try levelling  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_100"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 100</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>down their payments in a good system, in view of the much lower minimum provided for in the personal accounts scheme; they must be discouraged from doing so.</p>

<a name="80603-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08060383000160"></a>I am glad that the Government have chosen the term &#147;jobholder&#148; rather than &#147;employee&#148; to define those entitled to membership of the scheme. I assume that this would cover agency workers who would not, perhaps, be directly employed by the employer. It is important that such workers receive equality of treatment and I assume that that is the Government&#146;s intention. It would appear that some self-employed people would be eligible, including carers, and I agree that every effort should be made to cover the whole workforce, no matter what kind of contractual arrangements they may have.</p>

<a name="80603-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08060383000161"></a>I understand that the PADA has already established a consumers&#146; panel. There is also to be a members&#146; panel, governed by trust law. How will that actually represent members or be established? What connection would it have with trustees? I take it that there would be member-elected trustees. It has already said that trustees will,</p>
<ul><a name="08060383000339"></a>&#147;not be the subject of undue liability in respect of their actions. They will retain an obligation to fulfil their fiduciary duties&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08060383000321"></a>and that the PADA,</p>
<ul><a name="08060383000340"></a>&#147;should be able to pay any legal costs that the trustees incur&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 31/1/08; col. 311.].</ul>
<p><a name="08060383000322"></a>I would welcome hearing the Minister&#146;s explanation of how these various functions and representatives will interact. Trustees are important in ensuring good governance of schemes.</p>

<a name="80603-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08060383000162"></a>Finally, we cannot leave this general subject of pensions without referring to the plight of many present-day pensioners who will not be much affected by the reforms we are discussing. Many of them are women, as I have already indicated. Recent research conducted by Help the Aged indicated that 21 per cent of today&#146;s pensioners, or 2.2 million, are living below the poverty line. Means-tested benefits remain the Government&#146;s key policy for taking pensioners out of poverty. Year after year, the money is failing to reach those who need it most. It is said that some pensioners are too proud to claim benefits, but Help the Aged says that the majority are put off by the assumption that they will not be entitled to anything or by the complexities of the claims process.</p>

<a name="80603-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08060383000163"></a>Help the Aged is calling for three steps that it believes will substantially reduce the numbers living in poverty: the immediate introduction of the earnings link for the basic state pension; the payment of a full basic state pension to all pensioners; and the automatic payment of all means-tested benefit. It urges the Government to utilise the data that they already hold to make direct payments, so that older people can get the money without having to make a claim. The introduction of the earnings link to basic pensions was promised in the last Pensions Bill, but it was not to be until 2012. Even then, there seems to be a get-out clause in the reference to the then-existing fiscal situation. There is no reason why it should not be introduced now. Even so, the basic state pension is a great deal less than it would have been had the earnings link never been dropped by previous Governments.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_101"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 101</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80603-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08060383000164"></a>If the Government&#146;s case is still that that link would mean paying the increase to people who do not need it, the answer is that the Government can claim it back via the tax system. If they still contend that even that would mean some loss to the Treasury, it is a relatively small price to pay for restoring more money and dignity to around 2 million people. This issue was raised during the Commons debate and the Government have not really answered it, certainly not to the satisfaction of many current poorer pensioners. </p>

<a name="80603-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08060383000165"></a>There are many issues which will doubtless be raised in forthcoming sessions on this important Bill, but its main proposals are widely accepted and I hope that it can soon be put into operation.</p>

I remind the House of my interests as the director of a life and pensions company and as a director of companies which provide workplace pension schemes.</p>

<a name="80603-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="08060383000167"></a>The test for this legislation is not the impact it will have on interest groups but what it will do for future generations of pensioners. On those grounds, like others in the debate, I welcome the objectives set out in the report of the noble Lord, Lord Turner, and the legislation that has followed. The issues are in the details enacted in the Bill and I wish to raise a number of points in this debate to which I hope the Minister will be able to respond.</p>

<a name="80603-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="08060383000168"></a>I wish to enlarge on some of the points that have been made about the impact of the Bill on existing workplace pension schemes. As everyone has said, it is important that these are not diluted. They have been an important part of savings in this country&#151;and will be, it is to be hoped, in the future&#151;and yet we have to accept the fact that most employers will not want to run two schemes side by side. Therefore, wherever possible, we must make it possible for them to meet the requirements of the personal accounts within their existing pension schemes rather than having the complications of running separate schemes and the interfaces between them.</p>

<a name="80603-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="08060383000169"></a>The Bill has a number of deficiencies in this respect. First, on the qualifications for automatic enrolment&#151;which, of course, is necessary in order for an existing scheme to fulfil the requirements of the personal accounts&#151;the legislation as drafted has a narrow restriction on the occupational pension definition which qualifies for automatic enrolment. I know this is due in part to difficulties with the European Union distance marketing directive. The Minister alluded to the fact that amendments will be brought forward to deal with some of the issues, which I welcome, but it is important to recognise that not only do we need the legislation to allow existing stakeholder pensions, existing group personal pensions and existing group SIPPs to be eligible for automatic enrolment but also that we need to follow through and ensure that secondary legislation&#151;for example, in regard to the SFA conduct of business rules and the legislation on unfair commercial practices&#151;also aligns with the intent of the Bill.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_102"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 102</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80603-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="08060383000170"></a>We need to look at how the Government intend to provide that these personal pension schemes meet the requirement of employees not having to choose a fund, through a mechanism for a simple default fund, while still allowing personal schemes to encompass the wider choice that many existing members want. We need a great deal more clarity in the Bill in that area.</p>

<a name="80603-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="08060383000171"></a>The second area of difficulty relates to the complex rules envisaged in the Bill on whether an existing scheme provides benefits equivalent to those that a personal account will provide. The legislation is drawn up on the basis of having to meet 8 per cent of qualifying earnings as the reference test. But &#147;qualifying earnings&#148;, as defined, excludes the first &#163;5,035 of earnings but includes overtime, bonuses and commissions. That is completely different from the basis on which earnings on most personal pension accounts and employer contributions currently work. Trying to do such comparisons will create huge complications, particularly for firms with significant numbers of employees close to that threshold and where their earnings are of such a nature that they vary from week to week or from month to month. It will create a huge complexity which, I fear, will lead many employers to decide that it is easier to scrap their schemes and opt for the personal account.</p>

<a name="80603-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08060383000172"></a>Another complexity about which I am not clear and on which I would welcome guidance is whether employers can carry out the comparison once every calendar year and then make up any differences, or whether they will have to make the comparison on a monthly or weekly basis as they pay cheques and make pension contributions. If it is intended that payments should be made on a weekly or monthly basis it would add enormously to the complexity and make it extremely difficult for this to be a workable proposition. I should like the Government to clarify that and, if necessary, amend the legislation to make clear that this can be done on a calendar-year basis.</p>

<a name="80603-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08060383000173"></a>The difficulty here is not just the complexity for the employers but the fact that if employers scrap these schemes, the employee may end up worse off as a result. For example, an employer may be contributing 7 per cent to 9 per cent on their own to an existing scheme. If they opt to scrap that and go over to a personal account where the overall contribution is 8 per cent of qualifying earnings, they can drop their own contribution to 3 per cent and require the individual to make up the difference by contributing 4 per cent. The amount of contribution from the employer can be significantly reduced if they decide to scrap a scheme and go to the personal accounts system.</p>

<a name="80603-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08060383000174"></a>The third area of complication with workplace schemes is the point about targeting, which the Minister mentioned. I was glad to hear him reinforce the idea that targeting is important to limit the scope of where personal accounts compete with existing provision. I was also glad to hear him repeat the commitment that there should be an annual cap of &#163;3,600, but I note that that is not in the Bill. There is a question about whether that number should be in the Bill, as some other numbers are. In addition to that cap, Clause 61, as I read it, also lays open that  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_103"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 103</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>there may be additional payments into the scheme on top of that annual cap, which may or may not be capped by order. That obviously leaves open the option that they may not be capped. I understand the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, that we would want to ensure that there was provision for people who had missed payments to make those up. If that is the intent of the clause, that could be made much clearer in the Bill. If it leaves open the possibility of unlimited payments being made into personal accounts, it opens up a huge area of uncertainty about what their role is relative to existing providers.</p>

<a name="80603-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08060383000175"></a>There is the issue of costs. We want a level playing field between this provider and existing providers. If the costs are truly lower then that benefit should be passed on to consumers, but the Bill contains provision for financial subsidies from the Government to the Pensions Authority. It should be clear that those subsidies, if provided at all, should be limited to the start-up costs. There is the question of whether they ought to be paid back over time, but there should be no question that there could be ongoing subsidies that would lead to a distorted competitive position where in effect we were subsidising one provider against another.</p>

<a name="80603-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08060383000176"></a>There is the issue of the fines that can be imposed on employers who do not adequately meet the tests of whether their provision is better than personal accounts. As I read it, these fines can be imposed without any necessary preconditions having been met. I should have thought there was a case&#151;although I may have misunderstood this&#151;that there should at least have been a compliance notice given to the employer that they had ignored before there was any question of fines. So there are a number of areas where we need to be clear about exactly what the terms of competition are and how we can ensure we are not damaging existing workplace schemes by taking advantage of them to meet these objectives.</p>

<a name="80603-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08060383000177"></a>My second major area of concern is the interaction with benefit schemes and personal debts and the advice requirements around that. There must be, as others have said, a significant risk that for many people who either are low-paid or have large debts, or both, personal accounts will represent a poor&#151;or indeed negative&#151;return relative to other uses they can make of their income. Another complication is raised in the interaction with the savings gateway that was introduced in the Budget, which we need to work though as well. It is not yet clear in the guidance notes.</p>

<a name="80603-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08060383000178"></a>I should be grateful if, at some point early in the debate, the Minister was able to give us some data on the income levels below which the Government currently believe there is an issue of people falling into the benefit trap if they have not saved enough to get themselves above the means-tested benefit, and on how many people, in rough terms, the Government estimate will be in the position where, particularly taking account of debt, they may be taking out a product that is not the best one for them to enrol in, as a result of auto-enrolment. We need some estimate of those numbers in order to gauge what we should do about that.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_104"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 104</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80603-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08060383000179"></a>Following that, we have to take a view on how important it is for people to be made aware of that, and whether the generic advice that the Government are proposing can be adequate to deal with individuals&#146; detailed questions, when they may be ill-equipped to come to their own conclusions. If we want to avoid these becoming big issues, some of the solutions are, as others have said, expensive. One is to raise the basic state pension so that, over time, and as rapidly as possible, means-testing disappears. That clearly has merit. A second option is to concede that money from these pension schemes will not be off-set against means-tested benefits, so that people know that a pound saved will be a pound that they will benefit from in retirement. Both of those options are clearly expensive.</p>

<a name="80603-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08060383000180"></a>There is a third possibility, which the Government might like to consider alongside those, and which the House might consider. This particularly concerns avoiding advice complexities. We do not want to get into a situation where the cost of advice outweighs potential savings and benefits to the individual, or one where the advice burden falls unequally between the pensions authority and private pension providers. It is important that advice can be given, on equal terms, to anyone, whether they are auto-enrolling in a personal pension or auto-enrolling in a personal account. One of the ways to simplify the advice system would be to set out the principle that means-tested benefits in retirement are not entitlements, but discretionary social support for those in need. It would be possible for the Government, in a sense, to take a moral view, and say that means-tested benefits should be disregarded and that individuals should be encouraged to make provision for themselves, with advice given on the basis that that is what they intended to do. Means-tested benefits would then be there as a support mechanism for those who failed to do that, but not as an entitlement that people take into account in deciding whether they should make their own provision. That would be a significant shift in attitude, but it may be worth considering.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08060383000181"></a>There are a number of difficulties with the Bill. There are a number of traps and a lot of detail that need to be worked through as the Bill is debated.

I am pleased that the Government have accepted the Pensions Commission&#146;s proposal in regard to the national pension savings scheme. I rather suspect that the areas of this Bill where we may disagree with the Government could be those where they have chosen to disregard recommendations from the Pensions Commission. We will see.</p>

<a name="80603-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08060383000183"></a>Three key areas have attracted a lot of attention. First, there are personal accounts. We have to be careful that we are not in danger of thinking that one size fits all, and that this will work well for everyone. I am not sure that it will. Secondly, there is the compulsory employer contribution, which I very much welcome. Thirdly, there is the automatic enrolment in pension  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_105"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 105</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>schemes. This Bill will be good for many people, but there will be those who are left behind and left out of the improvements in retirement that this Bill will bring for many. With increasing longevity, pensions are of growing importance to many more people in our community. When the state pension was introduced, it was worth approximately 25 per cent of the average wage. I remember being part of the Carnegie inquiry into the third age in the early 1990s. The pension was then worth about 17 per cent of the average wage. Today, it is worth about 13 per cent. How much longer do we have to go on before we see the state pension being worth very little? This Bill will help stop that happening and will certainly help many people.</p>

<a name="80603-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08060383000184"></a>As I read the Bill, I wondered how much progress we had made. The Bill provides for a 3 per cent compulsory contribution from the employer, 1 per cent through a tax provision from the Government and 4 per cent from the employee. I have always been brought up to believe that the employer pays as a minimum the same as the employee. A reasonable employer pays one and a half times and a good employer twice what an employee pays. The Bill represents a very clear statement of just how much we have gone backwards in pension provision in the UK from what we have had within most occupational pension schemes during the past two decades.</p>

<a name="80603-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08060383000185"></a>I referred to numbers being left out. I join my noble friend Lady Hollis in concentrating particularly on low-income people, the majority of whom are women. The baseline of &#163;5,035 before one is covered by the personal accounts will be extremely detrimental to women, large numbers of whom have more than one job. All of those jobs are low paid, yet the Bill provides no opportunity to bring them together.</p>

<a name="80603-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="08060383000186"></a>When we discussed this matter during the passage of the previous Pensions Bill in 2007, the Minister said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08060383000341"></a>&#147;the Government will commit to looking at the range of options in the coming weeks, including the option to buy additional years&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 24/7/07; col. 695.]</ul>
<p><a name="08060383000323"></a>He did not refer to having multiple jobs. Subsequently, on 17 December, the Minister said that the Government had looked at the matter and that nothing was going to change. The inability of the Bill to provide women with that option to buy extra years&#151;&#147;lost years&#148; would be a better description&#151;linked with the baseline of &#163;5,035, which will preclude many women from being able to contribute to a pension because their earnings cannot be brought together, will prevent substantial numbers being able to provide for a pension in their retirement. As the Bill is so important, we have to get it right here and now. I regret if my opinion differs from that of my own Government, but pensions are so important that you cannot just put them right next year by passing a statutory instrument or further legislation. We have the opportunity to get this right now and we should do so.</p>

<a name="80603-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08060383000187"></a>We have to be careful that the low paid do not fall into a trap because of the possible impact of personal accounts on some benefits. Pension credit, for example, has a &#163;5 disregard, but it has been at that level for  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_106"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 106</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>some years. Is this not an opportunity to deal with that issue now? The possible impact on housing and council tax benefit means that people could believe that, by saving in personal accounts, they could be better off, but when they retire, they will be poorer in net terms. That is where advice is important. We have to make sure that the Act is fit for purpose without causing too many unintended consequences.</p>

<a name="80603-0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08060383000188"></a>Older women in particular may have a problem with the transitional arrangements. The Bill is good for young people and people in their 30s and 40s, but a whole group of people&#151;women in particular&#151;will never feel the benefits of the Bill. A number of us on this side of the House&#151;and I hope that noble Lords on the other side of the House will join us&#151;will propose amendments intended to mitigate some of the exclusions in the Bill for that group of women, both by enabling them to buy extra years and by looking at the lower paid who have more than one job. My noble friend Lady Hollis referred to someone on &#163;12,000 per year being in a much better position than someone who does two jobs each paying &#163;6,000 per year. That cannot be right and we have to deal with that.</p>

<a name="80603-0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08060383000189"></a>I welcome very much the extension of the powers of the pensions regulator, particularly in appointing trustees to pension schemes that are in trouble. All too often, those issues are dealt with when it is almost too late to do something substantial about the scheme. If we could do something earlier, it would certainly help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="08060383000190"></a>I think that the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, talked about giving knowledge and information. This is very important. All too often, people are frightened of going to a qualified financial adviser and there is nothing in between. There are citizens advice bureaux, but many people do not feel that they can get advice there. We need to make sure that when this Bill passes, there are provisions for information to be given to people based on their individual case, because one size does not fit all. That is absolutely essential and it needs money behind it. We cannot expect citizens advice bureaux or other organisations to give advice without being properly funded. They have to be properly funded to be independent, and an independent view is absolutely critical. We should remember the pensions scandals of the past, such as the mis-selling of pensions, when the previous Conservative Government gave people lump sum enhancements to come out of their occupational schemes into money purchase schemes, which led to the mis-selling of many pensions. We do not want a repeat of that, so information is absolutely essential. I do not regard it as a soft option under the Pensions Bill&#151;it is part of the central core. I look forward to the debates that we will have. No doubt the Minister will feel uncomfortable from time to time. However, I hope that he will listen and I hope that he will show flexibility, because the Bill as it stands is not the answer for too many people, most of whom are low-paid women.</p>

Next door are people who have not saved a penny, who get their council tax and rent paid and who go on holiday to the south of France, whereas the couple I know cannot afford to. We have to be careful not to penalise savings&#151;whether for pensions or general savings&#151;and it is vital that a disregard is set sufficiently high to encourage people to save and not be penalised when they retire.

It follows logically from the Pensions Act 2007 and helps to meet a number of concerns raised by my noble friend Lord Turner in his report. As the Minister said, it is intended to create a retirement savings framework that no longer excludes those on low incomes, or those with erratic earnings, and which establishes a framework for savings that far better reflects the increasingly flexible and changeable world of work. Almost no one today has the same employer from the moment they start work to the moment they retire. That gives you a tiny flavour of how fast everybody moves in and out of jobs, even if they are working full time, as they gain more experience and move on to the next thing. But, above all, I hope that this Bill will make it possible for the less well-off, and particularly carers, whether of children, the ill or the aged, to make maximum retirement savings from their inevitably interrupted job opportunities throughout their working lives. As we all know, the majority of carers are women, and it is women who also form the majority of pensioners living in poverty.</p>

<a name="80603-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08060383000193"></a>A vital question that <I>Which?</I> and others stress in their excellent briefings on the Bill is whether carers will be able to join personal accounts and on what terms&#151;and in particular, if they deem themselves self-employed but unpaid, whether they are eligible. That was a point raised by my noble friend Lady Greengross. If this crucial group is really to be excluded from the benefits of this important retirement scheme, it simply beggars belief, and we must clearly go back and look harder at that area.</p>

<a name="80603-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08060383000194"></a>We know that already there are nearly 5 million UK citizens aged 75 and over, and this number will increase by more than two-thirds in the next 25 years. Unsurprisingly, against that background, we are all being encouraged to work and pay taxes and national insurance well beyond today's statutory retirement age, which is anyhow due before long to rise dramatically&#151;and, I emphasise, for both sexes. We know, too, that the state of citizens&#146; finances today is not good, for all the reasons mentioned by other noble Lords. However, equally, as we heard during Question Time earlier, any form of further and higher education except for a very few costs a lot. That has to be paid for. That is something that my generation, thankfully, did not have to pay for; we had that ability for free and could start our savings from that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08060383000195"></a>It is surely sensible, therefore, against that relentless background, to give individual citizens in low-income groups every kind of encouragement to save now, via this limited and means-tested scheme, and particularly those who are currently saving the nation huge sums by their caring responsibilities. Amendments to this Bill to clarify the whole situation will be essential, unless the Minister can reassure the House on this point.</p>

<a name="80603-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08060383000196"></a>It is obviously good news, that the employers&#146; federation, the CBI, is firmly behind the principle of auto-enrolment. I take the point of the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, and have some sympathy with it, when she talks about rather more coming from the individual than from the employer. But that percentage will be able to be paid either to the new personal accounts scheme or to a qualifying workplace pension. It is clearly good news, too, as I think I have understood it, that auto-enrolment is agreed as lawful under EU law. I hope that I am right about that, because I do not think that I have heard many people mention it. But equally, the CBI's emphasis on minimising other costs, reducing bureaucracy and increasing flexibility&#151;and, incidentally, maximum flexibility seems a vital ingredient for all the parties that briefed us&#151;is also right. So, too, is the need, which again the CBI emphasises, for the Government to put in place a targeted support package for the very smallest firms, because some of them will be badly hit.</p>

<a name="80603-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="08060383000197"></a>There is also clearly a need for stronger powers for the pensions regulators, not least to judge the quality of proposed schemes. That was emphasised by the unions and the third sector. There is a need, too, for expert advice on choice of schemes to be available to employees from outside their own employing companies. Above all, there is a welcome determination by everyone involved to ensure that savers get a fair deal, with emphasis on the theme &#147;it pays to save&#148;. One of the suggested amendments from <I>Which</I><I>?</I>, that certainly makes sense to me, is to include among PADA principles a duty,</p>
<ul><a name="08060383000342"></a>&#147;to act in the best interests of prospective members&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80603-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="08060383000198"></a>There are clearly many hours of debate ahead of us as the Bill goes through its various stages. Apart from general support, I am particularly glad to welcome it for two quite different reasons. But, above all, for the opportunities it provides to return to the attack on these other fronts. The first of these has already had full support from noble Lords on all sides of the House, as well as very determined lobbying from <I>Which</I><I>?</I>, Age Concern and, indeed, the People&#146;s Pensions Coalition and the women's pension network. I refer, of course, to the superbly argued amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, during the passage of the previous Pensions Bill, which would have allowed people with interrupted work patterns, mostly of course women who have had caring responsibilities, to buy back up to nine years of national insurance contributions and thus improve their state pension.</p>

<a name="80603-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08060383000199"></a>For the Government, with their otherwise excellent record on support for equal opportunities, not to have followed through the clear hint that was given at the time, that this amendment would be accepted, was nothing short of disgraceful. This time, unless the  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_109"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 109</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Government have realised the error of their ways, it is clear that they will have an even more determined fight on their hands.</p>

<a name="80603-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="08060383000200"></a>Alas, I cannot say that I expect my second additional reason for welcoming the Bill to receive quite the same universal support. I refer, of course, to the current unequal treatment of men and women in pension annuities. But if I fail again, do not expect me to give up the battle&#151;if I am still around&#151;when the next pensions Bill presents itself.</p>

<a name="80603-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08060383000201"></a>I shall make the case as briefly as possible. If equal treatment for men and women is to have any substance, it should surely apply to that portion of an individual's earned retirement pension which the Government rightly require each individual to take as an annuity. That is not the present position; on the contrary. Although a man and a woman will have equally contributed to identical retirement pensions, the annuity sum paid annually to the women is currently less than that paid to the man because of a presumed longer life expectancy, and even that, until last year, has been closing. It is that difference in the annuity payable that is really unacceptable.</p>

<a name="80603-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08060383000202"></a>The suggestion is not that the insurance industry should bear the cost of correcting that inequality, but that the cost of the differentials involved should be spread evenly between men and women. In order to help the state cope with the considerably higher costs of the longer life expectancy that I and other noble Lords have mentioned, anticipated for both sexes, men and women are rightly being required to move towards a higher, but ultimately the same, statutory retirement age&#151;a hike of considerably more years for women than for men. But still they will receive unequal annuity payments. Surely, it is high time to get rid of this unjustifiable sex discrimination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08060383000204"></a>In the United Kingdom and beyond&#151;both domestically and internationally&#151;great attention is being devoted to socially responsible investment. Almost every major institutional investor and international organisation has had to consider the promotion of good governance, sustainable development, human rights protection and climate change. This is in response to rapid growth in transnational corporate activity and recent scandals. Many companies of course have extensive operations around the world.</p>

To their considerable credit, many institutional investors would certainly

Yet there is considerable confusion in the investment community about the extent to which investors can take human rights and environmental, social and governance issues into account when taking investment decisions. There is surely a great opportunity for the Bill, which is designed to create one of the largest pension funds in Britain and by extension a powerful institutional investor, to give an imaginative lead in clarifying the legal position.</p>

<a name="80603-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08060383000206"></a>For this opportunity to be seized, two amendments are necessary. First, institutional investors, charged with investing funds under the new personal pension plan scheme, should be required under Clause 10 to sign up to the United Nations principles on responsible investment&#151;UNPRI, as they are known for short. The UN principles were drawn up as a toolkit for investors to use when considering environmental, social and governance issues&#151;ESG&#151;in their investment decisions. The principles are not prescriptive. They are voluntary and aspirational, and do not dictate what should be invested in, or where and when specific action is necessary.</p>

<a name="80603-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08060383000207"></a>Secondly, institutional investors charged with investing funds under the new personal pension plan scheme should be able to disinvest from or not invest in companies which can be seen from credible information available to the public to have links to crimes against humanity, war crimes or genocide, as defined in the Rome statute of the International Criminal Court and adopted into English law by the International Criminal Court Act 2001.</p>

<a name="80603-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="08060383000208"></a>The UNPRI have already been debated extensively in the Commons both in Committee and on Report, where the Government&#146;s objections to their inclusion boiled down essentially to concerns of cost and simplicity, financial returns for investors and the need for the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority&#151;PADA&#151;to be as free as possible to draw up its own policy on socially responsible investment. Most reasonable people agree that the public pension scheme should be as clear and simple as possible on the costs, system and choices available under the scheme. Signing up to the UN principles would not be contrary to that aim. The evidence suggests that the costs of doing so are relatively insignificant, involving the employment of a quite small number of staff to examine the environmental, social and governance issues that arise and perhaps a subscription to research services. They are also proportionate, considering the good returns that can be achieved with ethical investment.</p>

<a name="80603-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="08060383000209"></a>Rather than damaging the rate of return for investors, paying attention to ESG issues in investment decision-making can improve returns. Last year, the Co-operative Society&#146;s ethically invested fund was the best performing fund in the United Kingdom all-company sector. Mainstream investment can, by contrast, make catastrophic mistakes, as we have sadly seen in the cases of Enron or WorldCom. These mistakes might well have been avoided had there been greater scrutiny of the corporate governance of those companies.</p>

<a name="80603-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08060383000210"></a>It has been widely acknowledged that there will be a default fund, and a limited number of alternative funds, administered under this scheme. One of these

If that is permissible, why not also have one administered under the UN principles with regard to international human rights law? In the other place the Government apparently suggested, by implication at least, that ethical investment based on religious belief is more important than ethical investment on a non-religious basis. Surely that must be highly questionable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08060383000211"></a>Moreover, SRI is entirely consistent with government policy in other areas, including sustainable development, particularly related to Africa; protection of human rights domestically and internationally; and tackling climate change. Surely it is counterproductive for the Government to try to address those other issues while they defend the right of their public pension scheme to invest in companies that make these problems more acute.</p>

<a name="80603-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="08060383000212"></a>The Government have said that they do not consider PADA, the pension scheme, to be the appropriate body to be covered by the UN principles and that this should be the responsibility of the trustee board itself, once it is appointed. However, between now and 2012 PADA will be the authority that will draw up the whole basis on which personal accounts are to be administered. Surely there should be a clear commitment to SRI from the beginning. I reiterate that the UN principles are not prescriptive and are merely a toolkit for investors to use in the decision-making process.</p>

<a name="80603-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08060383000213"></a>The business case has already persuaded many asset owners and managers, with approximately $10 trillion of assets under management, to become signatories to the UN principles. Currently, the UK Pension Protection Fund, the French Fonds de R&#233;serve pour les Retraites and the New Zealand Superannuation Fund are all signatories to the principles. All are large national schemes. It is clear to me that there is a heavy responsibility for the Government to take a similar lead with what will eventually be the UK's largest pension fund, especially given that some UK pension funds and a number of major UK asset managers are already signatories.</p>

<a name="80603-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="08060383000214"></a>The safe-harbour amendment, as with the UNPRI amendment, is permissive rather than prescriptive. It protects investors from legal action in the event that they choose to disinvest from companies with links to disturbing breaches of international human rights law, crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide, as defined in the Rome statute of the International Criminal Court. I need hardly draw the House's attention both to the vital necessity to protect and promote human rights worldwide and to the increasingly critical attention given to corporations working in developing countries which do not have regard for international human rights law in their operations. Crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide can be among the most horrendous breaches of international human rights law. I believe that it is necessary to make it legal for trustees and investors to exercise their judgment in these narrowly defined areas of international criminal law.</p>

<a name="80603-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08060383000215"></a>The Government have repeatedly expressed their commitment to promoting and protecting human rights worldwide. For example, the Prime Minister has described Darfur as,</p>
<ul><a name="08060383000343"></a>&#147;one the greatest humanitarian disasters of our time&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_112"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 112</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="08060383000324"></a>Yet as the Aegis Trust&#151;which has been doing so much focused work on Sudan, and to which I am very grateful for its help in preparing for this debate&#151;has stressed, western investors, including those in the United Kingdom, continue to invest in corporations working in Sudan which do not benefit ordinary Sudanese civilians, which demonstrate no corporate social responsibility regarding the Darfur crisis, and which continue to provide the Sudanese Government with revenue that can then be used to carry out their policy of ethnic cleansing in Darfur. Surely, as the Aegis Trust and others argue, if the Government are truly committed to the ending of the crisis in Darfur, they should want to ensure that UK investment is not fuelling that crisis.</p>

<a name="80603-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08060383000216"></a>Such an amendment would encourage and reward good business practice in relation to breaches of human rights, particularly in developing countries, and thus protect the most vulnerable people in these societies. It would also help to clarify an area of socially responsible investment that is currently unclear, namely whether and when disinvestment is appropriate and permissible. Some experts have argued that modern portfolio theory makes disinvestment permissible. However, trustees and investors remain nervous because of the uncertainty over the applicability of old case law to modern investment practices.</p>

<a name="80603-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08060383000217"></a>The Government have suggested that the burden of the cost&#151;which I have already argued would be minimal and proportionate&#151;would fall on the poorest in our society. I hope that this amendment would achieve the protection of the most vulnerable people in the world, who are subject to the worst human rights violations. The vital security of our own pensioners in retirement&#151;and I take second place to nobody in my commitment to how vital that is and believe I have shown that it will still be protected&#151;should surely never come at the expense of the world&#146;s most vulnerable, deprived and abused people. I hope my noble friend and his colleagues in government will look favourably at what I propose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08060383000219"></a>I think this will be seen historically as a red letter day. It has taken a great many years to put together the work of the Pensions Commission under the distinguished chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Turner, who is not in his place. He has done a remarkable job alongside his other public work on climate change and for the Financial Services Authority. These issues have one thing in common&#151;they require action to be taken in this generation for events 20 or 30 years hence. It is not easy to get this generation to take ownership of those responsibilities, particularly, as people have pointed out, when there is a credit crunch. Some people may say that this is the worst possible time to get people to pay 4 per cent more. I would say that this moment of truth for intergenerational responsibilities has to be taken on the chin, certainly in terms of the price of carbon and living on tick&#151;for example, thinking that if you withdraw equity from your house, &#163;100,000 will appear out of nowhere. These are obvious fallacies of

<a name="80603-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="08060383000220"></a>One thing that shines through all of this is compulsory saving, like Lord Keynes&#146;s post-war credits, which is guaranteed to have a return in the economy. Whatever people say about big government, that is what people are going to trust at the end of the day. So if there is trust and confidence and as long as the economy can develop, both main parties and the Liberal Party would say that that has to represent some sort of consensus and presumption. Without being too awkward, I shall pick up what is perhaps a debating point made by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale. Surely the very fact that it is difficult to sell a product satisfactorily to people with limited resources means that things will be difficult for those people. However, if you look at the analysis made by the noble Lord, Lord Turner, this is one of the ingredients as to why we have arrived at this solution. I hope that this consensus will continue.</p>

<a name="80603-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="08060383000221"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, will, no doubt, comment on the degree to which consensus remains. I very much hope that it still stands between all the parties, although I am beginning to be a bit nervous about it. The degree of consensus may not be quite as strong as one might have hoped, because after the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, mentioned consensus, he spent the next five minutes saying &#147;but&#148; a lot. Perhaps the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, can tell us whether there is still a consensus between the TUC, the CBI, Help the Aged and everyone else, including the Engineering Employers&#146; Federation, which is not normally known for being soft on workers&#146; rights and collective bargaining.</p>

<a name="08060383000223"></a><a name="80603-0006.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80603-0006.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08060383000439"></a>Lord Lea of Crondall:</b> No, my Lords, I do not agree with that formulation. Nearly all the briefings have said that we have a robust consensus within which particular issues have to be sorted out. To make my point, I shall provide a couple of examples of issues raised by the TUC within its very robust support for the Bill. The first relates to the compliance regime. The TUC states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="08060383000336"></a>&#147;An effective compliance regime for the reforms and provisions to ensure the opt-out is not abused by employers are vital&#148;.</p>
</ul>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80603-0007.htm"/>


<a name="80603-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="08060383000224"></a>Therefore, employers must,</p>
<ul><a name="08060383000344"></a>&#147;pay their contributions in full and workers participate as widely as possible&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08060383000325"></a>Secondly, they must not,</p>
<ul><a name="08060383000345"></a>&#147;attempt to influence their staff to opt out of personal accounts (or their own schemes where they provide an alternative qualifying pension scheme) ... Most employers will co-operate fully with the new system, but it is likely that a minority will fail to fulfil their responsibilities&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80603-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="08060383000225"></a>The TUC says that it needs strong sanctions,</p>
<ul><a name="08060383000346"></a>&#147;to ensure that employer non-compliance is regarded as a very serious breach of employment regulations&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_114"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 114</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="08060383000326"></a>It says that the trade unions,</p>
<ul><a name="08060383000347"></a>&#147;recognise that there was a debate in Government about which agency should be the compliance and enforcement body for personal accounts and other existing good-quality employer provided pensions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08060383000327"></a>The TUC thinks that the right decision was made and that the role should be fulfilled by the Pensions Regulator. However, the briefing continues:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="08060383000337"></a>&#147;We look for reassurance that TPR understands that this is a major change in its role. Up to now it has largely been dealing with stable large and medium sized employers responsible enough to establish a pension scheme, with the occasional issue caused by a relatively small number of employers. Its new role will mean that it has to deal with a hugely increased number of employers, many of them small and perhaps less organised, and some seeking to evade their responsibilities&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060383000328"></a>The TUC says that it is therefore very important that the TPR is given a step upwards in its resource and in its ability and competences to access all the data that it needs from other government agencies, such as HMRC, and that it shares data in return. It is also important that it has effective enforcement powers.</p>

<a name="80603-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08060383000226"></a>My other example where there has been robust support for the Bill concerns the debate about the appropriateness of auto-enrolment. The TUC says that it recognises that there are some groups of people for whom saving would not be appropriate or others where there is a risk that they will not benefit from saving. This is not, however, a new issue and it is not specific to the introduction of personal accounts. It says that the language of mis-selling has been used by some opponents of the whole system, but genuine mis-selling has been conducted by companies which were fined for selling inferior products to members of good defined-benefit schemes. Although access to good information and guidance is essential in helping people to plan for their retirement and make decisions about saving, it is not possible to eliminate risk from the system unless either all means-tested benefits are replaced by universal benefits or all pension payments are disregarded in the means-testing. That could happen only if public spending on benefits were massively increased or big cuts were made in benefits. Sometimes these conditions are not spelt out.</p>

<a name="80603-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="08060383000227"></a>The TUC also says that in addition, all calculations that try to assess winners and losers are based on the current means-testing regime, maintaining not only its current structure but also its current level of benefits for many years ahead. This is not something that history suggests is very likely. Critics also undervalue the benefit that savers may see in building up their own pot rather than relying on the uncertainty of future benefits; nor do they take into account the extra tax credits that many lower-paid pension savers will get, as their pension contributions will lower the income used to calculate their tax credits.</p>

<a name="80603-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="08060383000228"></a>Finally, there is always a danger of mixing Second Reading speeches and Committee speeches. In Committee, people often say, &#147;You&#146;re making a Second Reading speech&#148;, and today one might think that noble Lords have made Committee speeches. With this Bill, it is particularly difficult to make a Second Reading speech without making a Committee speech at the same time. However, in juxtaposing Second Reading and Committee speeches, we should not forget that there is tremendously

That has been a remarkable achievement over the past 10 years; I remember that we were talking about the architecture right at the beginning of the Labour Government. Therefore, when we start to look at Committee points, can we please recognise the historic step that we are taking today?</p>

<a name="80603-0007.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="08060383000365"></a>5.23 pm</h5>

My noble friend Lord Oakeshott pointed out that seven Peers of each sex have taken part in the debate. He reckons that such sex equality is always welcome when discussing a pensions Bill.</p>

<a name="80603-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="08060383000230"></a>The Bill has been given a general welcome, for which the Government must be relieved, although it will not necessarily have an easy passage, as many amendments have been signalled. The Bill was published late last year when there were relatively few signs of economic slowdown, but that is changing and the economic climate is certainly getting chillier, as my noble friend Lord Oakeshott and the noble Lord, Lord Lea of Crondall, pointed out. Who knows what the state of the economy will be in 2012, but the Government must be aware that research done for the Bill among stakeholders may already be somewhat out of date.</p>

<a name="80603-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="08060383000231"></a>The Bill was, of course, foreshadowed during last year&#146;s proceedings on the first Pensions Bill, now Act, from the Pensions Commission, and there is broad consensus&#151;although I am nervous about using that word&#151;on the main principles of the Bill, if not on a lot of the detail, as this debate has reflected.</p>

<a name="80603-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="08060383000232"></a>The Pensions Policy Institute has produced useful research, including a stock-take of key stakeholders&#146; views on the main principle of auto-enrolment, which revealed 22 out of 24 organisations in favour. The figure of 90 per cent take-up of auto-enrolment where it exists, compared to 56 per cent where it does not exist, is telling. However, the PPI&#146;s figures also show that not everyone will benefit from a personal account, which has been reflected in all the speeches we have heard today&#151;even those to whom the Bill is aimed; namely, low to median earners. We have heard, too, of the groups at the highest risk of personal accounts being unsuitable. They are probably single people likely to be renting in retirement and having no additional savings. They could fail to qualify for means-tested housing benefit if they have just enough savings in a personal account. The other &#147;at risk&#148; groups singled out by the PPI are in a different category, as they would not be auto-enrolled. They are middle-aged single people on low to median incomes without significant savings who are self-employed.</p>

<a name="80603-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08060383000233"></a>The whole question of the way in which personal accounts will interact with means-tested benefits is one of great uncertainty. We have only just received&#151;yesterday&#151;the department&#146;s own projections about this interaction, which I am sure will repay close study. As we all know, the benefits system is extraordinarily complicated, and in 2012, unless the system is simplified, there could be not only a great deal of confusion  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_116"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 116</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>about whether someone on low to median earnings would be better off opting out of auto-enrolment, but some accusations of pensions mis-selling, as we have already heard. Even the department acknowledges the difficulty of forecasting in this field. It says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="08060383000338"></a>&#147;Estimating the extent of entitlement to different combinations of income-related benefits and how these will evolve over time is a complex task&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80603-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08060383000234"></a>We welcome the Government&#146;s commitment to review the interaction of personal accounts with means-tested benefits and urge them to take appropriate action to ameliorate the situation. One step, of course, towards simplifying the benefits system would be the restoration of the link with earnings being brought forward, as the noble Baronesses, Lady Greengross and Lady Turner, said. What better celebration of the centenary of the introduction of the state pension by a Liberal Government, led by Lloyd George, could we have than an announcement that the link with earnings was to be restored by 2010?</p>

<a name="80603-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08060383000235"></a>This brings me on to the matter of generic financial advice and information and why it is vital for a really good system to be in place by 2012. This has been borne in on me very much recently because I have been carrying out my own highly unscientific survey on attitudes about occupational pensions among people I meet. There is tremendous ignorance around the whole subject of pensions. Not only is there ignorance; there is a curious unwillingness to want to know, as though by finding out what pension provision we can expect, we are hastening old age and retirement, and even death. So many people are deliberately putting their hands over their ears. That is why auto-enrolment is so important. But there is also the other side of the employment coin, and the attitudes of small employers to auto-enrolment, even with its phasing in. It will, after all, place an extra burden on companies employing, say, 15 to 25 people, or even fewer.</p>

<a name="80603-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08060383000236"></a>Let us take the scenario of a small firm in the building trade employing 15 people, including a few migrant workers, in a small rural town. I was told that it is very rare for employees in the building trade to have any occupational pension provision. Will this firm encourage its employees to become self-employed? There are those who have criticised the 3 per cent employer contribution figure as inadequate&#151;particularly the noble Baroness, Lady Dean&#151;but to a small employer, and after all they are the life blood of rural employment throughout the country, any higher contribution, coupled with the extra paperwork involved, may be the straw that breaks the camel&#146;s back, so a balance has to be struck.</p>

<a name="80603-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08060383000237"></a>Some people with no existing pension provision are relying on bricks and mortar, as the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, has mentioned, with the thought at the back of their minds that they can downsize eventually, using the resulting savings in lieu of an occupational pension. And then there are the people who are up to their necks in debt and who are just concerned to get through the next week, let alone the next 30 or 40 years, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, has said. For those people, even 4 per cent of their earnings going towards pension provision will be a burden that they are unable to carry.</p>

<a name="80603-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="08060383000238"></a>High quality generic advice&#151;and ideally personalised advice&#151;is just what all these people need, so I look forward to the Government's detailed plans about how this will be provided. I dread the thought that it may come about with a push-button telephone system: &#147;Welcome to the Government's pensions advice service. Press 1 for information about auto-enrolment; press 2 for auto re-enrolment; press 3 for trivial commutation limits; then perhaps press 4 to make an appointment with a sympathetic psychiatrist&#148;. There must be a really user-friendly free telephone system, using plain English, with enough lines available, especially just before the scheme is due to start in 2012.</p>

<a name="80603-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="08060383000239"></a>As far as face-to-face advice is concerned, I have spoken before about the invaluable service provided by citizens advice bureaux up and down the country. I believe that the Government should fund enough advisers so that every CAB can have trained specialists to deal with the many people who will want to know whether it is right for them to enrol in a personal account, as well as giving advice on all the other benefits to which they are entitled.</p>

<a name="80603-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="08060383000240"></a>This brings me to the question of the amendment which was overwhelmingly won in this House during the passage of the last Pensions Bill, but overturned in the other place, allowing mostly women to buy back missing years of pension contributions in what has become known as the &#147;Baroness Hollis amendment&#148;. I would like to raise a parallel point to this because the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, gave such a virtuoso performance that I do not think her arguments need repeating. My honourable friend in another place, Professor Steve Webb, MP, has been doing some private enterprise on the matter of women being able to buy back contributions&#151;on this occasion in relation to those whom the Government are allowing to do this, owing to the inadequacy of government computer systems between 1996 and 2002.</p>

<a name="80603-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="08060383000241"></a>Extraordinarily, the Government themselves seem not to be contacting these women to tell them that they are eligible, even though they hold all the national insurance records needed. Neither do these women need to find a few thousand pounds up front to pay for their missing years. The Government are allowing them to offset the amount they owe against the money they will receive in the form of cash and a better pension. My honourable friend has even had offers of marriage, so delighted were these women to be contacted by him. He has called on the Government, as I do now, to contact these people officially to tell them about their entitlement, and to extend this system of offsetting to the group of mainly women they did write to in 2004-05 about gaps in their national insurance records, but who have not yet responded. Time is running out for this group, and the Government have all the records they need to contact these people again before it is too late. This time, they should suggest offsetting and they will almost certainly get a good response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08060383000242"></a>This has been a stimulating debate and a good many issues in the Bill have been discussed: auto-enrolment in group pension plans, the impact of the Bill on existing pension provision, annual contribution limits and transfers, and, most importantly, the way the

That is our custom when this elite band of noble Lords who have an interest in pensions matters gathers together for yet another Pensions Bill. My noble friend Lord Skelmersdale rightly reminded us that it has been on this Government&#146;s watch that defined benefit provision has been decimated, and the Bill does nothing about that. Instead, it deals with the different, but important, issue of those with no or inadequate pensions savings and paves the way for the new system of personal accounts. My noble friend&#146;s tour d&#146;horizon included our concerns about aspects of the Bill that reinforce incentives for employers to level down. I know that when faced with the prospect of rewriting existing schemes and payroll programs to comply with the hurdles set out in the Bill, finance directors will be all too ready to lead their businesses towards the easy life of the Government&#146;s personal accounts scheme with its relatively low employer contribution of 3 per cent. We will press the Minister very hard on removing those aspects of the Bill that positively encourage levelling down.</p>

<a name="80603-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08060383000244"></a>Running through the Bill is a lack of clarity about the important issues that will arise as automatic enrolment and the personal accounts system are rolled out. There is a broad consensus behind the ideas that underpin the scheme put forward in the Bill, but I say to the noble Lord, Lord Lea of Crondall, that it may not be robust in the face of the details because, as ever, the devil is in the detail. My noble friend Lord Skelmersdale has already indicated our position on that.</p>

<a name="80603-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="08060383000245"></a>During the passage of the Bill, we shall try to get as much detail as possible from the Government, preferably put on the face of the Bill, but there is a balance to be achieved between the concerns of employers and the aspirations of other interest groups. While there is a broad consensus on the underlying concepts, there is no consensus on the details of implementation, and we should not pretend otherwise because we will be fooling ourselves. As is common with pensions legislation, much detail is left to later rafts of regulations. If we give the Government the huge powers that the Bill creates&#151;and that is a big &#147;if&#148;&#151;we shall want to see the powers counterbalanced by further parliamentary involvement. In this context, I welcome what the Minister said about accepting the recommendations of the Delegated Powers Committee.</p>

<a name="80603-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="08060383000246"></a>Let me outline some of the lack of clarity in the Bill that concerns us. We do not know what the Bill will cost. We know little about the costs of PADA and even less about the costs of the new personal accounts pension scheme and the compliance regime. We do not know how the costs will be recovered and what costs the Government intend to subsidise. The Minister will be aware of the strong opposition from the pensions industry to the unlevel playing field that soft loans or grants for personal accounts would entail. We do not know whether the personal accounts scheme will be  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_119"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 119</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>up and running in 2012. We all hope so, but Mr Tim Jones, the chief executive of PADA, has conspicuously failed to commit to delivery by 2012. If there is any possibility of personal accounts being delayed, we shall want to look at the options for encouraging pensions saving in the interim.</p>

<a name="80603-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08060383000247"></a>Similarly, we are in the dark about the commencement of earnings uprating of state pensions in line with last year&#146;s Pensions Act, the earliest date for which is 2012. We will need to look at how the Bill can be strengthened on this, but I fear that we shall disappoint the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, on whether that should be accelerated to 2010. We do not know how the Government intend to avoid future mis-selling problems due, inter alia, to the impact of means-testing, which has grown massively in scale and complexity in the past 10 years. Most noble Lords have raised this issue today. My noble friend Lord Blackwell asked the Minister some pertinent questions on this area, and I hope he will be equipped by his officials to answer those questions when he winds up.</p>

<a name="80603-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08060383000248"></a>The Government have set up a review&#151;at long last&#151;and have invited the various lobby groups inside that tent, which seems to have bought them off pro tem, but there is no certainty that the review will produce anything other than words. We cannot allow the Bill to go forward unless it reflects that auto-enrolment should not proceed if the pay-to-save issue is not resolved. An obvious link to that is advice for employees on opting-out, on which a number of noble Lords have spoken. We should be clear that the <I>Thoresen </I><I>R</I><I>eview of Generic Financial Advice</I> and its pilot schemes do not deal with the decisions that this Bill will introduce; Mr Thoresen himself does not claim that. I am not clear whether the giving of generic advice in any form will ever deal satisfactorily with the issues raised, or whether the noble Baroness&#146;s traffic lights via the Pensions Advisory Service would be acceptable. We are in something of an evidence-free zone here. If the Government are not worried about that then we certainly are, and want to look further at it.</p>

<a name="80603-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08060383000249"></a>Perhaps the biggest unknown is the economic environment that will surround personal accounts when they are eventually introduced, as the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, has pointed out. Will employers be under extreme cost pressures as the result of high inflation and low or even, possibly, negative growth? That will of course increase the pressures for levelling down. Will employees be able to afford to pay 4 per cent of their wages into a pension scheme, or will they just opt out? I think I can tell the Minister with some confidence that if personal accounts were introduced this year on top of the 10p tax debacle, the opt-out rate would be high. Lower-paid workers simply could not afford it on top of rising tax burdens and rising inflation.</p>

<a name="80603-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="08060383000250"></a>When mentioning lower-paid workers I should flag an issue that I have discussed with the Minister&#146;s officials. The personal accounts scheme has been sold on the basis of 8 per cent going into those accounts&#151;that is, 3 per cent from employers, 4 per cent from employees and 1 per cent from the taxman. In fact it is not that simple as, while the scheme appears to have a nice symmetry at the point where the basic rate of tax kicks  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_120"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 120</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in, some groups of low-paid workers have additional tax reliefs. In addition, those who work for less than a complete tax year, which is probably most likely to affect women coming in and out of employment, will need a special arrangement if they are to avoid paying 5 per cent and missing out on that 1 per cent tax relief. We will be probing that with the Minister in Committee.</p>

<a name="80603-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="08060383000251"></a>Returning to the economic environment, that is much less benign than when the noble Lord, Lord Turner, issued his Pensions Commission&#146;s report, or when the Government issued their White Papers. The Minister is, doubtless, thinking that it will not be his problem in 2012: we certainly hope that the electorate will have passed their final verdict on the current Government by then. We will be subjecting this Bill to the most rigorous scrutiny to ensure that the best does not drive out the good. We must avoid gold-plating. It may be hard enough to get the personal accounts system to take off and to be well received in an economic environment that is not as fortunate as it has been in the past; we must not make that job harder when implementation dates arrive. The Government have recently increased their estimates of the year-one and ongoing costs to employers, especially those to micro-employers to whom these costs are a big concern, but they still look low. We will look critically at the many complexities in the Bill and ask whether they will really help the scheme succeed, or just add cost&#151;especially for small businesses.</p>

<a name="80603-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="08060383000252"></a>The Bill paves the way for personal accounts to be introduced via a special pension scheme. We have concerns about the trustee corporation that will run that scheme, which will be a government quango&#151;credible only if it is independent of the Government. We will need to probe whether the balance between independence and government interference is the right one. For us, the involvement of Parliament is more important than work opportunities for civil servants. There are other detailed aspects of the trustee corporation and the pension scheme that we will need to probe in Committee.</p>

<a name="80603-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="08060383000253"></a>We will also be looking at the changes being made to the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority. We welcome the addition of principles to which PADA must work and we shall work to improve them. We will also look at why similar principles are not also appropriate to the trustee corporation.</p>

<a name="80603-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="08060383000254"></a>A specific issue which we intend to pursue in Committee is that, as my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale reminded us, on this Government&#146;s watch our pensions&#146; landscape has been transformed and defined benefit schemes outside the public sector are now open to relatively few employees. As has been pointed out, the figure is now around 900,000 as compared with 5 million in the mid-1990s. If defined benefit provision is to stabilise, the rules need to be more flexible.</p>

<a name="80603-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="08060383000255"></a>The Minister will be aware of the proposals put forward by the Association of Consulting Actuaries to tackle the rigidity of the current indexation requirements. The conditional indexation approach used in the Netherlands does not provide all the flexibility that would make employers&#151;and in particular their finance directors&#151;feel warm about defined benefit provision, but if conditional indexation helped just

<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="08060383000256"></a>A dog which has not barked in the debate is compulsory annuitisation at 75. We will be returning to this issue in Committee. On annuities generally, the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, about choice at the time of annuitisation were interesting and we look forward to seeing whether robust amendments can, in practice, deal with this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="08060383000257"></a>A dog which has barked loud and clear today is the issue of women&#146;s pensions. We on these Benches fully understand and sympathise with the issues that have been raised, most notably, of course, by the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, who works so tirelessly in this area. But we have to bear in mind that many of the issues have cost tags attached to them. In addition, some of the amendments to the personal accounts scheme that people want will add complexity&#151;and therefore costs&#151;to that scheme. These are difficult areas but we look forward to returning to them in Committee with an open mind.</p>

<a name="80603-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="08060383000258"></a>We support the aim of greater workplace pension provision that the Government are seeking to achieve but, as I have said, that support is not unconditional as to the detail. The Minister should by now be on notice that we on these Benches look forward to a detailed and comprehensive scrutiny of the Bill when the Committee of the Whole House commences.</p>

Given the range of points that have been raised, I shall eschew my formal text and try to deal with as many points as I can. Those that I cannot cover will, I am sure, recur in Committee. I should say to the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, that I am pleased that we are starting the train journey together and hope that we will complete it together.</p>

<a name="80603-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="08060383000260"></a>The noble Lord asked about the positioning of personal accounts in the framework of the Bill. The absolute cornerstone of the Bill is auto-enrolment, not only for personal accounts but for a range of provision. That is why we have started it off and it is right to do so. The noble Lord and the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, challenged the issue of implementation. The first act of the incoming chief executive, Tim Jones, was to review the delivery plans and a summary of that review has been placed in the Library. This work confirms the achievability of a 2012 launch for the personal accounts scheme. Not surprisingly, at this stage some of the factors that will influence progress are uncertain&#151;not least the passage of this legislation&#151;and we will need to monitor carefully the delivery assumptions that we have made. That said, 2012 is our intention and we believe that it can be delivered.</p>

<a name="80603-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="08060383000261"></a>I will not dwell for long on the issue, but I cannot let the challenge go without responding on issues around dividend tax credits and this Government&#146;s record on pensions. The abolition of payable dividend tax credits was part of a wider package of measures designed to improve the long-term investment climate  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_122"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 122</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in the UK. I would be interested to know at some stage when these matters are raised whether in fact it is Conservative policy to reverse that position and increase the rate of corporation tax. We all know that the wider effects on pension schemes were caused by a stock market fall due to the dotcom crash when there was a &#163;210 billion fall in the market value. We know that many firms took contribution holidays in the 1980s and 1990s&#151;on the Conservatives&#146; watch, I may say&#151;believing bullish equity markets to be a long-term trend. There were also rapid increases in life expectancy.</p>

<a name="80603-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="08060383000262"></a>I should also say that the current level of tax relief for pension funds is estimated to be around &#163;17.5 billion in 2008-09. It is this Government who have sought to rebuild faith in pensions. We put in place the Pension Protection Fund, we have proactively protected pension scheme members through the Pensions Regulator and delivered a just settlement on the FAS, as well as setting up the Turner commission and all the good stuff that has flowed from that.</p>

<a name="80603-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="08060383000263"></a>My noble friend Lord Judd, with particular passion, and the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, raised the issue of ethical investment. I repeat what my honourable friend Mike O&#146;Brien said at a national ethical investment reception last week: it is only if institutions and others embrace the concept of good governance and ethical investment that our economy can thrive and that our legacy to future generations will be a positive one. Economic success cannot be regarded as in conflict with social and environmental goals. He said that ethical investment and effective governance of investment decisions attracted much debate in the other place, which it did, and that there is also wide-ranging consumer support for an ethical choice to be included in the personal accounts scheme. Such investment decisions are, quite rightly, the responsibility of the scheme trustee, but we recognise the importance of good governance and socially responsible investment. I am pleased to see that the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority will be consulting on these matters in the autumn. I say to my noble friends that I am not aware that the Government have objected to this at any stage; indeed, our position has been that it is for the trustees to decide because this is an independent scheme. I hope that the consultation on this matter will lead to the appropriate conclusion, which we would all support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="08060383000264"></a>A number of noble Lords&#151;the noble Lords, Lord Skelmersdale and Lord Oakeshott, and my noble friend Lady Turner&#151;raised the issue of levelling down. As I said in my opening remarks, our reforms are designed to complement, not replace, existing employer provision. There are a range of issues, which I identified, that support that. Our research shows that most employers with good schemes support our reforms, and the majority, particularly the larger employers, plan to maintain their schemes at current levels. We are not complacent about the issue, however, and we will continue to track employers&#146; attitudes and likely reactions to the reforms as we move towards 2012.</p>

My understanding is that finance directors are much more sceptical about the costs of ongoing pension provision and are more likely to pull in the other direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="08060383000267"></a>A number of noble Lords, and perhaps I should thank them, raised the issue of voluntary national insurance contributions. I should perhaps express even greater thanks to those who did not raise it. I understand that it is a matter of great concern. The Government have acknowledged the inequity in the system. It is not fair to say that we have simply walked away and reneged on our commitments; a lot of work has been focused in this area. In particular, we have looked at a range of options on the basis of the criteria that we set before Parliament&#151;fairness, affordability and simplicity&#151;but we have not yet identified an option that is well targeted at those women about whom I know my noble friend and others are most concerned. We need to be mindful that buyback does not help people who are heading for pension credit or the one-third of women retiring before 2010, numbering some 250,000, who paid reduced-rate contributions. We should also keep in mind that the opportunities under existing buyback rules enable more than 90 per cent of women reaching state pension age after 2014 to buy back enough contributions for full basic state pension under current arrangements, and that will rise to 95 per cent by the end of that decade.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="08060383000270"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Skelmersdale and Lord Blackwell, and the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, raised the issue of the funding of the scheme. Our shared aim is for personal accounts to deliver low charges and to be self-financing in the long term. Any funding arrangements should not unfairly advantage the scheme; we are very clear about that. We will not know the costs of delivery until PADA has completed the design and begun to engage with private sector suppliers. It is vital that we do not rule out at this stage any options that may later prove to be in members&#146; interests. Obviously, due to commercial sensitivities, we are currently unable to make public much of this work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="08060383000271"></a>A number of noble Lords raised the issue of uprating the basic state pension. I say to my noble friend Lady Turner that there is no get-out in the Government&#146;s position. Earnings uprating will happen; it is enshrined in law. We did that last year. We will do this in the next Parliament. Our aim is re-link the 2012 sum to affordability and the fiscal position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="08060383000272"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, proposed that we should double the basic state pension. The annual cost of that would be something like &#163;150 billion per year in real terms in 2050, the equivalent of 15 pence on the basic rate of tax. Citizens&#146; pensions now would cost something like &#163;10 billion to &#163;20 billion per year, if that were brought in immediately. It is almost impossible for Governments to eliminate means-testing without huge cost; even doubling the level of the basic state pension from 2012 would leave one-quarter of pensioner households entitled to an income-related benefit by 2015. It is simply not that straightforward.</p>

<a name="80603-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08060383000273"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, said that he would test amendments according to whether they over-complicate personal accounts or make them more expensive. That is a good yardstick; I think that was the sentiment expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes. The noble Lord made reference to the scale of means-testing and yesterday&#146;s DWP release. He also said that people need to be helped to buy the most suitable type of annuity. We agree that it is important for people to have the information they need to make an informed decision on annuity purchase. That was a key feature of the Government&#146;s review of the open-market option for buying annuities, on which we reported last autumn.</p>

<a name="80603-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="08060383000274"></a>A number of noble Lords raised issues around generic advice, individual choices to save and the need for good-quality advice. We recognise that individuals who are auto-enrolled will need access to relevant and accurate information, but we do not believe that they will routinely need extensive advice, particularly because of the employer contribution. There is no requirement now that people who join a pension scheme should receive advice. Auto-enrolment, as it exists at the moment, does not introduce any new factors into the decision. As for the Thoresen review on money guidance, the national money guidance service recommended by the review and the Government&#146;s action plan on financial capability will also assess the need to add to the services on offer, as well as those referred to by other noble Lords.</p>

<a name="80603-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="08060383000275"></a>Savings incentives, raised by the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, and my noble friend Lady Turner, are not a new issue. A new issue is not created by this Bill. We need to keep this issue in perspective. Under reasonable assumptions, the majority of those who are enrolled can expect to benefit from having saved. Our reforms will significantly reduce the level of means-testing, and the basic state pension will be worth more than double what it otherwise would be, ensuring a solid platform for saving. Measures in the Bill will further improve incentives to save. Existing policies ensure that those who save can benefit. The savings credit permits pound-for-pound claw-back. Twenty-five per cent of the pension pot can be taken as a tax-free lump sum. Those with very small pots may be able to take the whole of their pot as a lump sum. I am conscious of issues raised by my noble friend and others about perhaps changing or improving those rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="08060383000276"></a>My noble friend Lady Hollis, as ever, raised many challenging issues. I look forward to our debates on them in Committee, but I shall respond to one or two points straightaway. She asked whether personal account  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_125"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 125</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>schemes should allow for some pre-retirement liquidity. The personal account scheme will be a tax-registered pension scheme. Pension saving in the UK is privileged through the tax system. The Treasury rules are quite clear: tax relief on pension saving is not provided to support pre-retirement income, asset accumulation or inheritance. The expansion of access to pre-retirement pension saving would need to be across all UK pension schemes and products and not just personal accounts to avoid severe market distortion. We are aware of little evidence that such allowance would support increased engagement in pension saving.</p>

<a name="80603-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="08060383000277"></a>My noble friend asked whether women will be able to transfer in small pots. When reforms are introduced, there will be a ban on transfers in and out of personal accounts and a contribution cap. These measures are designed to protect the existing pensions industry. However, there will be a review of them in 2017 when the reforms have bedded in. It is clear that the desire of some individuals to consolidate their pension saving will be an important consideration in that review.</p>

<a name="80603-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="08060383000278"></a>My noble friend further asked whether we would allow a lifetime sum so that women can top up their saving. We have not put the amount of the contribution limit in the Bill, because we want to allow the annual contribution limit to operate flexibly. The wide enabling powers will allow for the higher contribution limit in the first year of the scheme&#146;s operation and for a lifetime lump-sum contribution to run alongside the annual contribution limit. We need to consider whether to introduce this additional complexity when the scheme is introduced or wait for the review of the contribution limit in 2017.</p>

<a name="80603-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="08060383000279"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, touched on voluntary national insurance contributions, but also asked, as did the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, how carers can access the scheme. Anyone who joins the personal accounts scheme will be able to continue to save in their personal account even after they leave the workplace or move to an employer that does not offer personal accounts. With the passage of time, job churn, especially among women and carers with fragmented working lives, will mean that a growing proportion of the working-age population will have personal accounts.</p>

<a name="80603-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="08060383000280"></a>My noble friend Lady Turner spoke about the need for a strong consensus and to take a long-term view, which was a very important point. She asked whether the term &#147;job-holder&#148; would include agency workers. I am pleased to say that it does: there is specific provision in the Bill for that.</p>

<a name="80603-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="08060383000281"></a>My noble friend asked about a range of issues around trustees and governance. Like any other trust-based scheme, the personal accounts scheme will be run by a trustee body with an overriding duty to act in the best interests of scheme members. Trustees will be appointed by open competition, in line with the arrangements for any other public appointments. There will also be a members&#146; panel to represent members&#146; views and interests, which will, among broader duties, support the nomination of member-nominated trustees, who will make up at least one-third of the members of the trust.</p>

<a name="80603-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="08060383000282"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, challenged me with a range of very interesting but pertinent points, with some of which I shall try to deal now. He asked about the interaction between the savings gateway and personal accounts. The Government provide tax incentives for shorter-term savings such as through ISAs. The savings gateway is a cash-saving account for those on lower incomes. Following the success of the pilots in promoting saving and financial inclusion, it was announced in this year&#146;s Budget that the savings gateway will be introduced nationally. Savings gateway and the personal account scheme provide complementary vehicles for shorter- and longer-term savings.</p>

<a name="80603-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="08060383000283"></a>The noble Lord asked about qualifying earnings. We will allow annual calculation of contributions. We accept that existing schemes use different definitions. However, it is the amount saved into pensions that counts, not the method of calculation. Employers, payroll providers and scheme representatives recognise that the calculation and checking of contributions will be automated in the vast majority of cases. However, we recognise the concern in this area and we are committed to working with stakeholders to ensure that the duties are communicated to employers as simply as possible.</p>

<a name="80603-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="08060383000284"></a>The noble Lord also asked whether Clause 61 introduces a limit on the amount that can be saved in a personal account. The answer is yes, we will introduce a contribution limit of &#163;3,600 a year with the scheme, uprated by earnings&#151;that is at 2005 prices. He asked whether government subsidies will be limited to start-up costs. The Government have made clear that there will be no unfair subsidy for the personal accounts scheme. Our intention is that all costs, including start-up costs, will be met from members&#146; charges over the long term.</p>

<a name="80603-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="08060383000285"></a>The noble Lord also asked whether compliance notices could be used to encourage employers to comply. There will be a graduated approach to enforcement, from initial reminders to notices and penalties, and there will be opportunities to appeal against the imposition of any financial penalty. I hope that the noble Lord will forgive me if I do not respond in detail to his other points now. I am sure that we will have another chance to discuss them in Committee.</p>

<a name="80603-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="08060383000286"></a>My noble friend Lady Dean spoke with huge commitment on the issue of lower paid workers and asked whether those with multiple part-time jobs would be disadvantaged. We recognise the issue of individuals with multiple jobs but the solutions most frequently suggested by stakeholders&#151;for example, the aggregation of earnings&#151;would have to be compulsory for everyone. That could have perverse consequences in increasing costs for all employers for the benefit of a few people. It is not immediately obvious how the employer contribution could be calculated easily&#151;no mechanism currently exists. Would multi-employers share the cost of the employer contribution? How would that be done? Which employer would take responsibility for contributing to the pension scheme? I hope that my noble friend will see some of the complexities. We know that there are around 400,000 individuals with multiple jobs providing a combined income of more than &#163;5,000 who are not currently contributing to a  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_127"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 127</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>private pension scheme. Of these 400,000 people, around 300,000 earn more than &#163;5,000 year from at least one of their jobs. Around 60,000 people earn more than &#163;5,000 a year from each of their jobs. Around 30,000 individuals aged between 22 and 64 earn less than &#163;5,000 a year from each job and women hold 80 per cent of those jobs.</p>

<a name="80603-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="08060383000287"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, spoke about equal treatment in pension annuities. I am sure that we will debate this matter again in Committee, but I cannot promise a different government view to last time. She asked whether a carer could opt in to the personal allowance scheme as a self-employed worker. It is difficult to see how a carer in these circumstances would be treated as self-employed. However, any carer with a personal account could continue to save in it, even when they were no longer in work.</p>

<a name="80603-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08060383000288"></a>My noble friend Lord Lea spoke strongly in support of the Bill, and I appreciate that. He stressed the importance of the long term in trying to seek consensus, and the importance of the employment protections in the Bill, to which we will add by way of amendment. The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, gave a broad welcome to the Bill, but with some challenges. I appreciate her strong support for auto-enrolment, which is a fundamental part of the Bill. She asked about costs for small employers. We have sought to help by phasing in contributions. I was interested in her vision of telephony.</p>

<a name="80603-0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="08060383000289"></a>On the subject of deficiency notices and Mr Steve Webb, the DWP ran a special exercise and we contacted more than 400,000 people, at a cost of &#163;33 million. In the light of discussions with Steve Webb, we are taking another look at a further 73,000 women whom we did not previously contact but who could benefit for a period before they became entitled to a married woman&#146;s pension.</p>

<a name="80603-0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="08060383000290"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, said that she would try to get as much detail into the Bill as possible. I understand the thrust of that remark, but I am sure she will appreciate that much of the detail has yet to be worked out and, indeed, cannot be worked out, until we pass this Bill and give PADA the authority and powers that we want it to have. The Government review around <I>Pays to Save</I> is not buying off people; it is there for a proper purpose, and I am sure that it will deliver.</p>

<a name="80603-0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="08060383000291"></a>The noble Baroness raised some challenging points about lower paid workers and how the tax system would work. I think that we might leave that to Committee, as it will be an interesting debate.</p>

<a name="80603-0008.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="08060383000292"></a>On risk-sharing, we want good employer pension provision to continue and we want to explore all means of achieving that. However, we do not think that there is a magic bullet and we need to balance the benefits to employers with protection for employees. My honourable friend Mike O&#146;Brien announced during Committee in the Commons that we will issue a consultation paper on risk-sharing in June and consult through a 12-week period.</p>

<a name="80603-0008.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="08060383000293"></a>The Bill addresses the real issues that this country faces, including major demographic change and lack of saving to pay for it; confidence in the pension system; the move away from final salary schemes; and  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_128"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 128</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>pensioner poverty. We recognise those problems and are making one of the biggest changes on pensions in 100 years. We are reforming for the long term. We have an opportunity for a new confidence in UK pensions and there is no better time than now. If we can achieve these measures by 2015 we will see a step-change in saving, with up to 9 million people saving more or for the first time, with total pension contributions increasing by up to &#163;10 billion. This is a multi-billion pound opportunity for the pensions industry and a massive opportunity to transform the savings habits among millions of people in this country.</p>

<a name="80603-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="08060383000296"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, one or two words of explanation are probably called for on why I am moving this Motion. I would not be called one of the usual suspects in this House when discussing equine activities, but I happened to be in the right place at the wrong time to get myself involved in this. A good start is living in Lambourn, which, to those who do not know it, is to jump-racing what Newmarket is to flat-racing. I happen to have a wife who rides and a child who has a pony, and they happen to have a farrier, one Pete Baker, who is an influential member of the United Kingdom Horse Shoers Union. He asked my wife for advice, as she works for an MP in the House of Commons, and then about what should be done in this place. A conversation ensued&#151;and then I realised that there was something in what he said, something of concern that should be addressed.</p>

<a name="80603-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="08060383000297"></a>The basic concern, before we go into detail, is that farriery in this country is regulated by an Act that goes back to 1975. It sets out certain criteria by which this practice can take place and a legal framework that guarantees&#151;as closely as possible; let us not overhype any qualification in this context&#151;or gives a degree of certainty at least that the person undertaking that activity knows what they are doing, no more, no less. Members on these Benches are not usually the ones who cry against European regulations as a matter of course. We are quite enthusiastic about Europe, as a rule. But these regulations interfere with that certainty and that level of reassurance acquired by a long established regulation that allows for an apprenticeship scheme to be gone through and allows people to qualify by other means for farriery. Should we be worried about this? We should if we do not understand what exactly is going on.</p>

<a name="80603-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="08060383000298"></a>We are not asking to cross-reference qualifications. In many other parts of these regulations we accept that somebody can become qualified through practice. I have become dangerously familiar with the 1995 Act over the past few weeks. I have established that this  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_129"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 129</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>principle of &#147;You have been doing the job for a long time; there is no protest against you, so you should come in and be able to do it&#148; is accepted. However, two years would seem to be a very short space of time.</p>

<a name="80603-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="08060383000299"></a>What does training usually mean? It usually means that you are capable of addressing a series of problems and are prepared to deal with things as they happen. Horses are half a ton of nervous muscle, full of flight-and-fight response, which occasionally kill people&#151;not that many, but people get hurt around horses all the time. Farriery means that you are using blades to cut around a part of a horse. There are sharp nails, and bits of hot metal are applied to that horse. Things can go wrong, but the better and more convincing the training, the less likely that is to happen.</p>

<a name="80603-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="08060383000300"></a>What do the provisions address? Somebody after a very short period of experience potentially could come in and start practising. Even taking into account the emotion that the horse may well be a family pet, it is several thousand pounds-worth of livestock that could be damaged. The person who makes a mistake is immediately at risk. One kick can kill, even one from a comparatively small pony. The person holding the animal is at risk. If the farrier has made a mistake and the person is riding that horse on the road, for instance, the animal may well shy and there is a danger that it may slip.</p>

<a name="80603-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="08060383000301"></a>As an aside, I say that the community now accepts hard hats and back protectors. I have a little ongoing fight with my wife that as my five year-old starts to jump she will have to wear a gum shield, as do the jump jockeys. That apparently is a cultural step too far for part of the equine community. But there is a risk. Anything that enhances that risk should be regarded very seriously.</p>

<a name="80603-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="08060383000302"></a>So what do we have? We have the principle of the free movement of labour against whether these people can be safely allowed to do the job. Let us not pretend that the whole of Europe is full of limping horses. There are places where farriery is carried out properly. The concern here comes in the nature and the size of the task, those who have to implement it and the timeframe and resources available for them so to do. You have to cross-reference the skill level across the rest of Europe&#151;the 26 nations&#151;or to go for entrance by experience. That may be two years, but you will be lucky not to have made a mistake within two years of practising something from a very basic level of skill. If you have been dealing with the same horses on a regular basis you may well get away with it over the two-year timeframe. I do not say that you always will, but the danger is there.</p>

<a name="80603-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="08060383000303"></a>We are trying to preserve the reliability of the qualification and name of farrier. Will the Government tell us exactly how they intend to allow us to know how they are implementing this procedure? I have ignored those who have six years&#146; experience and are registered under other parts of the Act; the temporary matter is probably the most immediate. Will the Government allow us to know the processes by which, first, these people are being cross-referenced and, secondly, they are reporting and paper-trailing back those who are qualified through experience?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="08060383000304"></a>How should this take place? The Government may say that it is all on the website. If I wanted to hide something I would stick it in the middle of a website. It would be nicely and safely tucked away without a reference to where it is&#151;&#147;Oh, you can find it; just keep on clicking and you will get there&#148;. It was suggested in the meetings with various officials that it would not be unreasonable for the Government to undertake to tell us where this information will be stored&#151;not us here but those who are the consumer group, through the relevant publications. <I>Horse and Hound</I> stands out; I am afraid to give out the advertising but it is more or less the Bible of the equine community.</p>

<a name="80603-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="08060383000305"></a>The information should be signposted. What is the process we are following? What is happening to the Farriers Registration Council and have the Government assessed exactly whether they have enough resources to carry this out? This group draws its fees from the farriers themselves. It is rather odd that we should pay to allow competition in, but Europe is a funny place and this means the farriers can go across to other nations and practise themselves. How is this going to take place? Will the Farriers Registration Council have sufficient resources to make sure that this change takes place? There is the cross-referencing, the layering and the different types of qualification out there. Which one is better or worse? It may well prove that we do not have the best qualifications. We may have the best registration system but qualification moves on. We do not know and certain places do not have any qualification.</p>

<a name="80603-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="08060383000306"></a>Can the noble Lord show us where the signposts will be and will he make sure that the general public knows, so that there is more faith in the new system about where people are coming and going in the process? It should not be too many people. If the Government take a proactive step now, the slightly chaotic mess we have got into may be averted. What is required is information and clarification. Others may disagree about the nature of these qualifications but I think that, as a minimum standard, the Government must say what they are going to do about signposting information so people can understand what is going on. If there are major problems, everybody will know and we stand a chance of raising sufficient noise to get them corrected.</p>

<a name="80603-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="08060383000307"></a>I hope I have not gone on too long about this. The fact is that there is a real concern in a large part of our leisure sector, where people are dealing with pets and valuable livestock at the same time, and their own safety. If the Minister can tell us how he proposes to minimise any risk of greater integration, I will be very relieved at the end of this debate. I beg to move.</p>

I should declare an interest in that I am a member of the Worshipful Company of Farriers and hence have a specific interest in this.</p>

<a name="80603-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08060383000310"></a>In this country, there are three grades of qualification in farriery. First there is a diploma of the Worshipful Company of Farriers; secondly, there is an associate of that company; and, thirdly, there is a fellowship. All involve intensive apprenticeship, and it takes several years before a person can be recognised as a fellow. Consequently, we have a high level of competence in the farriery profession in the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="80603-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="08060383000311"></a>I recognise that these regulations are part of the treaty of Rome directive on the recognition of professional qualifications. The Explanatory Note accompanying the regulations comments that a full impact assessment has not been prepared as no significant impact is evident, but I completely differ with that assessment of the regulations. As the noble Lord, Lord Addington, mentioned, shoeing horses is by no means a simple or easy procedure. Substantial harm can occur if horses are badly shod. This instrument could also have a significant impact on sectors other than horses. Donkeys, for example, require farriers. They do not wear horse shoes, or donkey shoes, but if they are working on soft ground, their feet need to be looked at periodically. Indeed, the training for donkey farriery is much more rigorous and extensive than that for horses.</p>

<a name="80603-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="08060383000312"></a>The way to avoid the problems which the noble Lord, Lord Addington, and I have identified is to allow only persons holding approved farrier qualifications that are recognised in the United Kingdom to be recognised here. Hence I join the noble Lord in asking the critical questions about policing that he has asked of the Minister. How will this be looked at and regulated? What harm might occur to horses that have been shod by perhaps incompetent individuals who have not gone through the apprenticeship schemes that our farriers in this country have undergone?</p>

All of that adds up to a classic example of the law of unintended consequences. As one picks one&#146;s way through the barbed wire entanglement of regulations and statutory instruments, one comes to a point where the result could not have been intended or imagined and is certainly unacceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="08060383000315"></a>I should like to dwell on the two words &#147;rider&#148; and &#147;horseman&#148;. Riders are people, often with considerable competence, who sit on top of a horse and generally do not fall off. Horsemen know a good deal more than riders about the animal on which they are riding. All horsemen have known for some centuries the four-word truism which is as true today as it was centuries ago: &#147;No foot&#151;no horse&#148;.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_132"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 132</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="08060383000316"></a>To the uninitiated, a horse stands on a lump of bone which has underneath it a piece of metal to protect its feet from the road. Nothing could be further from the truth than that. As all horsemen know, the hoof conceals one of the most complex physical systems in the animal kingdom. Not only is the hoof involved, but underneath it, near to the ground, is the very sensitive sole of the frog. Inside the hoof you have a complicated, complex system of laminae and blood vessels; above that, suspensory ligaments; and, then, a very complicated system of bones that makes up the lower leg. All of that can be made or marred by the farrier. &#147;No foot&#151;no horse&#148; is true, as I have already said, and yet farriery appears to be now classified in the basket labelled &#147;metalworkers&#148;. That seems quite ridiculous. There is clearly, in the minds of officials, a confusion between blacksmiths on the one hand and shoeing smiths on the other, to use the old cavalry definition. A farrier operates in that middle ground between skilled metalwork and considerable veterinary knowledge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="08060383000317"></a>I do not intend to take up too much of your Lordships&#146; time tonight, but looking at protocol 33 to the EC treaty on the protection and welfare of animals which requires member states,</p>
<ul><a name="08060383000348"></a>&#147;to pay full regard to the welfare requirements of animals&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="08060383000329"></a>when formulating policy, it seems to me, first, that that is legally binding and, secondly, that neither the 2005/36 directive nor the supporting regulations that we are looking at tonight appear to have considered welfare at all.</p>

<a name="80603-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="08060383000318"></a>We are here tonight to look at health and safety considerations. It alarms me, as it may alarm other Members of your Lordships&#146; House, to see that farriery is not included as a profession with health and safety implications. The all-pervasive health and safety regime in which we now live&#151;a regime which reaches all the corners of life that other legislation cannot reach&#151;has not seen fit to include it. The dangers posed to horse riders, horse carriage drivers and members of the public on or off the road when a horse is stressed through pain or bad shoeing are quite enormous and cannot be overemphasised. In lay terms, a horse beyond control which is bucking, bolting and lashing out is likely to be a result of bad shoeing, and accidents, of course, will happen. It also seems strange that veterinary nurses are included in the list of occupations with health and safety implications which excludes farriers. When I kept horses of my own and employed both veterinary nurses and farriers from time to time, I would quite willingly put up with a veterinary nurse who had minimum qualifications but I would certainly never go to a farrier who I could not trust.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="08060383000319"></a>As has already been alluded to by other noble Lords this evening, foreign standards vary. We cannot always in all corners of the European Union get to grips with the sort of standards that are being espoused there. To face a circumstance where somebody from the farther reaches of the EU claiming six years&#146; experience can come here and practise full time, or claiming two years&#146; experience can come here and work temporarily, but in which the regulatory authority

<a name="80603-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="08060383000320"></a>The UK has approaching 1.5 million horses and 4.5 million people who ride annually. We have a farriery industry which, I understand, earns itself &#163;250,000 set within a critical part of an equine industry that is worth &#163;4 billion. Yet we are looking at something today which could disrupt much of that industry and those people who use it or are employed within it. I close simply by saying, as I said at the beginning, that I support the Motion proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Addington, to revoke the regulations and I hope that Her Majesty&#146;s Government will cause, in that revocation, Defra, the DIUS and the equine sector to work together to produce workable regulations that meet the clear objectives of the legislation which these regulations patently have not managed to reach.</p>

<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="08060394000004"></a><a name="80603-0009.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80603-0009.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08060394000105"></a>Lord Higgins:</b> My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Addington, on his diligence in researching this matter and on pressing for time to have a debate on it, because the House ought to consider it. I should declare an interest, because my daughter is a veterinary surgeon involved in equine reproduction. I have no financial interest, merely a concern for the welfare of horses generally.</p>

<a name="80603-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="08060394000005"></a>When I first looked at this issue, I was struck by the way that the European directive operated. I have complained on many previous occasions that the Government go around gold-plating European directives. This seems to be the other side of the coin. The directive&#146;s effect is actually to undermine the position with regard to the regulation of farriers. The other thing that surprised me somewhat was the way in which the matter had apparently been looked at by our statutory instruments committee, which decided that there was nothing of particular interest to which it should draw attention. The reason for that is probably to be found in the memorandum produced and submitted to that committee, which is available to your Lordships. On the policy background, it stresses strongly that the purpose of the Farriers (Registration) Act,</p>
<ul><a name="08060394000098"></a>&#147;is primarily to prevent and avoid suffering by and cruelty to horses arising from the shoeing of horses by unskilled persons&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08060394000083"></a>and,</p>
<ul><a name="08060394000099"></a>&#147;to establish a Council to regulate and register persons engaged in farriery&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80603-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="08060394000006"></a>However, the memorandum does not indicate the kind of concern that has been expressed this evening. If I understand it correctly, the main concern is that whereas we have a regulatory system which requires people to undergo training and, effectively, to have qualifications, it is proposed that those from other parts of the European Union with no more than a number of years&#146; experience can carry out permanently the task of a farrier. Indeed, if they are to do that on a temporary basis, they will need only two years&#146; experience. Experience is no guarantee of competence; they may have gone around other European countries for that period and been grossly incompetent.</p>

<a name="80603-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="08060394000007"></a>None of that emerges from the Explanatory Memorandum, which contains a very strange paragraph  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_134"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 134</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that points out that there have been consultations with various bodies involved with these issues. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="08060394000091"></a>&#147;Concerns raised during consultation on these Regulations centred on the level of competence of temporary service providers. In particular, that the Directive significantly undermines the progress made since the introduction of the FRA in ensuring that all those who carry out farriery in GB have been properly trained and have passed a test of competence as a pre-condition to registration&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060394000084"></a>So far, so good. The memorandum continues:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="08060394000092"></a>&#147;However the FRC accepted that the introduction of provisions for the registration of temporary service providers was the best way of handling applicants wishing to provide services on a temporary basis&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060394000085"></a>That is a total non sequitur. The memorandum reflects the fact that concern has been expressed but in no way states how it is to be resolved. Apparently, we have gone along with the proposals in the directive and are implementing it in a way involving dangers that both previous speakers have pointed out. Surely we ought to have an arrangement whereby those who deal with horses in this way are suitably qualified and are subject to registration.</p>

<a name="80603-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="08060394000008"></a>The other matter of concern is that apparently the regulation specifies that no charge may be made for registration. In that case, perhaps the Minister can explain how the process of registration is to be financed. At the moment, that is not at all clear.</p>

<a name="80603-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="08060394000009"></a>Effectively, we should ask the Government where they stood when the negotiations on this directive took place. Were they involved in its drafting? If so, did they support the position that is now in the directive or did they oppose it but were outvoted so that we are now stuck with it? I hope that the Minister can explain the position. Surely we should go back to the drawing board and rethink the matter. It is not satisfactory that unqualified people should be able to register and then practise, with all the dangers that noble Lords who have already spoken have pointed out.</p>

He laughs modestly but I admire the way that he has introduced it because it draws attention to the fact that, once more, we are being saddled with regulations from the European Community that we do not want. That is the sort of point that my noble friend Lord Pearson of Rannoch loves to dwell on and I recommend that he thinks about it.</p>

<a name="80603-0009.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="08060394000011"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Addington, I did not ride horses. Being tall, I was always given the largest horse and I found it all rather terrifying, so I never got beyond hanging on to the saddle with one hand. Most people did not think that that was a very suitable way to go riding, so I did not do too much of it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="08060394000012"></a>I declare an interest in that I am a liveryman in the Worshipful Company of Farriers. That is not a pecuniary interest; if anything, it is a reverse pecuniary interest but it is an interest nevertheless.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="08060394000013"></a>I am worried about this measure because I think that it will lower the standards of farriering. At the moment, farriering in England involves a four-year apprenticeship. A person is then awarded a diploma by the Worshipful Company of Farriers, the purpose of which is to protect horses and the people who look  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_135"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 135</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>after them from the attention of unqualified people. As I understand it, a Frenchman registers and then sets about his trade. In the European Union, a qualified farrier is not assessed, he does not have to take examinations and he is not given a diploma, but the United Kingdom diploma is regarded throughout the world as the gold standard that people should try to achieve. It was brought in by the Farriers (Registration) Act 1975 and was set up to protect horses.</p>

<a name="80603-0009.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="08060394000014"></a>I simply ask why we in the United Kingdom should accept lower standards. We have set the highest standard and other people should be trying to climb up to it, rather than our being made to climb down, all for the purpose of some kind of uniformity. Uniformity should be accepted only if it is for the better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="08060394000015"></a>One thing that frightens me about this whole matter appears in the Explanatory Memorandum. The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, will know this backwards because he must have read it dozens of times but I shall remind him of it. Paragraph 7.3 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="08060394000093"></a>&#147;As the UK government is required to implement the Directive, the consultation on these Regulations did not consult on the principles underlying the Directive or those provisions whose transposition into domestic law leaves no room for discretion at Member State level. The purpose of the consultation was to explain why we are proposing to transpose in the way that we are&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060394000086"></a>It is a funny kind of consultation that consists simply of explaining what we are doing. I put it to the Minister, who is very wise and understanding, that he is imposing on the farriers and the horse-riding fraternity standards which we do not want in the United Kingdom, which are lower than the ones that we have at the moment and which will not do us as a country&#151;nor, I suspect, the European Union&#151;any good.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="08060394000017"></a>As others, including my noble friend, have said, there is great concern among Britain&#146;s 2,500 registered farriers that the regulations have the potential to undermine our high standards. That is an important point because for more than 30 years, the aim of the Farriers (Registration) Act 1975 has been,</p>
<ul><a name="08060394000100"></a>&#147;to prevent and avoid suffering by and cruelty to horses arising from the shoeing of horses by unskilled persons ... to prohibit the shoeing of horses by unqualified persons&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08060394000087"></a>It appears that these regulations, which amend that Act, do exactly that.</p>

<a name="80603-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="08060394000018"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Addington, drew attention to the human health and safety consequences of these regulations. He talked about horses killing. I am not sure about that, but as someone who has occasionally parted company with a horse while it was on the move, which is a most unwise thing to do, I, too, have an interest in ensuring that horses are shod comfortably, at least. We do not want any more accidents than can possibly be helped.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="08060394000019"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior, pointed out&#151;and I, too, am concerned&#151;that the regulations do not appear to have been subject to a formal assessment of the impact on animal welfare, which is normal in these cases. There are a number of issues to be looked at carefully, all of which have been detailed by other noble Lords, so I do not intend to go through them. I urge the Government to look again at these regulations. Between them, the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills appear to have let this particular ball drop. I urge them to work with the horse sector to produce regulations that not only safeguard the high standards for which United Kingdom farriers are justly famous, but are, above all, workable. The regulations before the House tonight are not.</p>

I thank the noble Lord, Lord Addington, for bringing this forward; he should not apologise for not being a horse-rider or for not being as knowledgeable as some other noble Lords who have spoken. It is good that someone outside the particular interest realises that there is a problem.</p>

<a name="80603-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="08060394000021"></a>I understand from the memorandum that the consultation was launched on 7 November 2007 and closed on 19 December. Why was it not a proper 12-week consultation? Clearly it was not, and with the run-up to Christmas perhaps there were not as many responses as there might have been. While I have no particular current interest to declare, I, like many other noble Lords, rode horses and ponies from a tiny age and fell off too many times with resulting broken bones. We were always brought up to make sure that we heeded the importance of having horses well shod. Any horse with a slightly damaged foot is much more likely to be jumpy and not such a safe ride. From a young age, we always had qualified farriers who looked after our animals, which was extremely important.</p>

<a name="80603-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="08060394000022"></a>I gather that concerns were raised during the consultation. How many were there and what happened to them? Did they go to Defra directly, the farriers, or the Worshipful Company of Farriers? It is extremely important to know that.</p>

<a name="80603-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="08060394000023"></a>I reinforce what other noble Lords have said about the qualifications being unequal. Clearly, work experience is not the same as proper professional qualifications. Can the Minister tell us how many of the countries that are likely to have people applying to perform farrier work in this country have different systems? I suspect that there are many, and in some countries there are probably no systems at all. It is important for us to have that information if it is available.</p>

<a name="80603-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="08060394000024"></a>The importance of the safety of riding, particularly in a country where riding is becoming increasingly important, lies at the heart of this short debate. Thousands of children aged four, five, six, seven and eight ride ponies and the last thing we want to do is put any of them at risk purely because we have adopted a directive which lowers the standard that we in this country think is so important. One of my colleagues raised the question about the Government&#146;s stance when this  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_137"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column 137</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was discussed. I hope that the Government lobbied heavily on it. Did they seek a derogation from these proposals? If not, why not? Whereas we normally set the standards and say that everyone must rise to them, it is very odd to have to accept lower standards for those who carry out farrier work in this country.</p>

<a name="80603-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="08060394000025"></a>Lastly, what will happen if someone who comes from abroad is found to be inadequate? Will that person be treated, as our farriers would be, and go to appeal? What happens if that person is found guilty and does not have enough money? I am not sure what will happen if the work is unacceptable&#151;I was going to say shabby&#151;and I seek clarification.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="08060394000027"></a>This is a rather sad debate. We are discussing something that we cannot change. This is an EU directive and the explanatory memorandum says that,</p>
<ul><a name="08060394000101"></a>&#147;the consultation on these Regulations did not consult on the principles underlying the Directive or those provisions whose transposition into domestic law leaves no room for discretion at Member State level&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08060394000088"></a>My noble friend Lord Ferrers is absolutely right about that. Therefore, we are wasting our time talking about it.</p>

<a name="80603-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="08060394000028"></a>We have contracted out our farriery to Europe just as we have contracted out immigration. This is yet another regulation or directive that we simply do not need. It joins the curd cheese regulations, which were debated a few months ago; the drivers&#146; hours regulations; the ladder directive; the very recent regulations which noble Lords enjoyed on mediums and spiritualists, which drew some comment from the Liberal Democrat Benches when they could not believe that they were actually involved in that&#151;sadly they were. Those are regulations that we cannot do anything about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="08060394000029"></a>This evening, I have been struck by the expertise of everyone who has spoken. The noble Lord, Lord Dear, with his detailed knowledge, must have been head of the Birmingham mounted police force in a previous incarnation. He is quite right to say, &#147;No foot, no horse&#148;. Farriers do an invaluable service and save us a lot of money; with good farriery we do not have to call the vet out as often. This country has had a very good farriery service and we still do. As this debate, although sparsely attended, has shown, we are capable of running our own show when it comes to farriery. Why do we need to import these absurd regulations from Europe? We cannot do anything about them. We can make wonderful speeches and we can move ourselves to tears with our eloquence but, in the end, it will not do any good at all. I am sure that the Minister who is an honest and straightforward man, whom I much admire, will admit that we have to put these regulations or directives into law. We have no alternative.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="08060394000030"></a>It is a sad evening when this Chamber, this Parliament, is reduced to asking itself why we cannot run our own farriery industry. I should like noble Lords to think about that and to wonder whether it is right that we

It is deeply depressing and deeply sad, which is why, like my noble friend Lord Pearson, I believe that we would be very much better off out of the European Union and running our own affairs. We have a perfectly good Government&#151;let me rephrase that and say we have a good system of government, the highly respected mother of parliaments and an educated electorate. Why do we have to contract out so much to the European Union? Why are we doing it? The noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, is quite right: it is time we asked ourselves whether we are going down the right road here. I strongly support the noble Lord, Lord Addington, in what he said in this debate, and all the other speakers were spot on in what they said. However, I am afraid that the Minister will tell us where we get off.</p>

I should declare an unpaid interest as I am a trustee of the charity World Horse Welfare, previously the International League for the Protection of Horses, whose concern is for horse welfare throughout the world, and this is a central issue for us. I shall not elaborate because noble Lords have unanimously expressed their concerns on the main issue of standards. Let us be in no doubt that the result of the regulations will be that standards of farrier practice in this country will be to some extent lowered and undermined. We have the best standards in the world, but those standards are not matched throughout Europe. We know that in some parts of Europe, particularly eastern parts, it is difficult to establish what the standards are, and if people come here with certificates describing experience or qualifications, it will not always be absolutely clear what they mean. The issue of standards is at the centre of this. Lowering standards has implications for animal welfare and, as has been pointed out, animal welfare has links to human welfare because of the threats to human health if bad farrier work has been done. I look forward to hearing what my noble friend has to say as he is always individual and constructive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="08060394000032"></a>I should particularly like him to say something on the important point made by the noble Lord, Lord Addington, about information. This change was slipping through with most of our world unaware of it. When I started speaking to people in the horse industry, most of them were unaware that this was happening. If the regulations proceed, there is an obligation on the department or departments to make sure that everyone in related industries is fully aware. For instance, this morning I spoke to the British Horseracing Authority and suggested to it that it might be helpful if it considered whether part of the conditions for licensing trainers should be that they should guarantee to use fully qualified farriers. It may well be if the information is communicated to other parts of the horse industry they can take measures to try to protect standards and animal welfare. I look forward to what my noble friend&#151;who, I say to the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, represents a

Unlike several of your Lordships I have no horse, nor do I ride. Yet one of my daughters-in-law is an enthusiastic, competitive horsewoman, which I suppose is an interest that I should declare. However, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Addington, as have other noble Lords, for laying this Prayer to revoke the regulations. He laid out the argument extremely well, and our debate has been instructive on the issue. I am sure that the Minister will share the misgivings of the many noble Lords who have spoken in this debate who, without exception, have expressed the view that the Government have got it wrong.</p>

My noble friend Lady Byford explained that there had been a relatively short period of consultation before these regulations were laid, from 7 November to 19 December. The Government consulted the Farriers Registration Council, the Worshipful Company of Farriers, the United Kingdom Horse Shoers Union and the National Association of Farriers, Blacksmiths and Agricultural Engineers. Yet, as far as I can see, they did not include the British Horse Society, for example, or the Jockey Club, or the racehorse trainers&#146; association, or the racecourse managers, the Pony Club or anybody else who uses the services of farriers. Nor, for that matter, did they appear to consult the veterinary profession; neither can I find any reference to them asking the Army for an opinion, although as a service the Army has a qualification for a farrier going into civilian life having done service as a trained army farrier.</p>

What safeguard do the Government have in place to ensure the welfare of a horse at the hands of an unqualified, temporary farrier? Is there any way in which these regulations have taken the horse&#146;s welfare into consideration? To press the Minister further, are not horse owners at risk of having their insurance invalidated if their horse is damaged by an underqualified or temporary farrier?</p>

There are 1.35 million horses in this country, and at least 4 million people riding out once a year. The equine industry is worth &#163;4 billion overall, with farriers themselves earning &#163;250 million as a key part of the horse economy. There were 2,455 farriers registered in Great Britain in 2006. These figures emphasise the risks involved, as poorly-shod horses are a threat to animal welfare and public safety. My noble friend Lord Soulsby explained the importance of proper shoeing. The fact that the directive fails to

So we are not talking about something that has just been brought in. I do not wish to flood the House with constituents but it is also worth putting on record the latest figures I have. The total number of farriers on the register is 2,300 and there are 390 farriers without formal qualification or training. So there are 390 UK nationals&#151;untrained, unqualified&#151;doing farrier work. No one has mentioned that. The number of EU farriers on Part 1 of the register is two, and the number of declarations of intention to provide temporary services since October last year, when the regulations came into force, is one. That is the situation in June 2008. I wanted to set that on the record so that one can see the context in which we are dealing with this. There are nearly 400 unqualified, untrained, UK nationals doing farrier work against a total of 2,300 on the register; and there has been a grand total of three EU farriers on Part 1 of the register, including one declaration of intention to provide temporary services, since 19 October last year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="08060394000048"></a>We have to take care&#151;this is the bit that is expected&#151;that domestic legislation complies with European law. This all goes back to the European Communities Act 1972, as I recall from my early years when I was opposing it. I do not now; I support it. Subject to certain safeguards, someone legally established to practise farriery in another member state can provide the same service in the UK on a temporary basis. I emphasise that because it is important. The UK is obliged to implement directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications, which goes right across the professions. That works both ways for people in this country. Some of the measures suggested by UK farriers for strengthening the safeguards are simply not permitted under the directive. For example, we cannot require a service provider to undertake a practical test of their competence. Checks can be made with contact points and competent authorities in other member states about the provider&#146;s legal establishment or the relevance to farriery of his professional qualifications, but access to farriery on a temporary basis cannot be delayed or complicated in any way if the person has provided all the required documentation&#151;that is, to prove that they are legally conforming and operating as a farrier in the other member state.</p>

It requires documents: evidence from the member state and details from the competent authority. Where there is no competent authority, they have to provide the documents to show that they have legally been carrying out a business and, indeed, are doing so because they are only coming here to provide a temporary service. The Farriers Registration Council can limit that for a year, but if they fail to provide the necessary documentation, they would not be able to provide the temporary service. There is a check and balance here, and another which I will come to in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="08060394000053"></a>The main overall objective of this directive is the reduction of obstacles to free movement. It merely makes possible the pursuit of a profession for which a person is qualified on an employed or self-employed basis, provided the activities are comparable. It introduces new arrangements for migrants who want to provide a service on a temporary and occasional basis with the minimum of bureaucracy and red tape. Here is the key part: it places absolutely no obligation whatever on employers or service users to engage a professional from another member state. To the best of my knowledge&#151;as was mentioned earlier, and as I discussed a couple of days ago&#151;it must be perfectly compatible with, let us say, insurance companies putting in terms and conditions that require one to use professionally qualified competent people to do the necessary work. If not, one&#146;s insurance is at risk. Therefore, these are quite legitimate, but no one is forced to employ professionals from another member state. That is an important point.</p>

<a name="80603-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="08060394000054"></a>The directive was largely implemented last October by the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills through the European Communities (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) Regulations 2007. Many of the provisions are carried over from a previous directive on the recognition of professional qualifications. A lot of this is not new. Europe-based farriers have been able to provide temporary services, under the DIUS regulations, by submitting a declaration to the Farriers Registration Council&#151;the UK competent authority&#151;since last October. As I have said, so far, the Farriers Registration Council has received only one declaration. There are only two European farriers currently registered to practise farriery on a permanent basis in the United Kingdom. I do not know which member states they are from. The directive leaves the registration of temporary service providers up to member states.</p>

<a name="80603-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="08060394000055"></a>Having consulted the Farriers Registration Council, we agreed that the best way of managing temporary service providers would be to provide the regulator&#151;the Farriers Registration Council&#151;with the necessary powers to deal with issues relating to conduct. The Farriers&#146; Qualification (European Recognition) Regulations 2008&#151;the subject of this debate&#151;therefore provide for consequential amendments following changes introduced last year by the DIUS, and provide a framework for registering temporary farriers. Revocation of the regulations would not affect the entitlement of European farriers to provide their service on a temporary basis, pursuant to the DIUS regulations, but it would hinder the UK&#146;s ability to implement fully its European obligations. In addition, it would remove our ability to manage these arrangements in a transparent way, and to ensure that any problems can be dealt with by the Farriers Registration Council. That is an important point, because bringing regulations into force allows the Farriers Registration Council to be the regulator for the temporary activities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="08060394000056"></a>Farriery is not a regulated activity in some member states.

The directive defines &#147;professional qualifications&#148; as:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="08060394000094"></a>&#147;(a) qualifications attested by evidence of formal qualifications,</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="08060394000089"></a>Therefore, &#147;professional qualifications&#148; includes professional experience, such as two years&#146; lawful and effective practice of a profession. You have to provide evidence that you have been doing it and carrying it out, even in a member state where there is no competent authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="08060394000057"></a>When making a declaration to the Farriers Registration Council, a temporary service provider must include details of any insurance cover, an attestation that they are lawfully established in their home country, as well as evidence of professional qualifications and proof of at least two years&#146; lawful and effective practice if they come from a state where farriery is unregulated. There are therefore some hurdles even in countries where there is no regulation of farriery. I do not claim that they are as good, but it is not a free-for-all; it is not for any Tom, Dick and Harry to come over here and say, &#147;I&#146;m a farrier. I&#146;ll undercut your prices. I can do the job. I&#146;m OK&#148;. There is a series of hurdles to clear.</p>

They have to be able to prove that. That goes beyond what would be required.

A commitment has already been made by the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills to review the implementation of the directive in October next year. Therefore, it is more or less two years after it came into operation. As I speak, we have only one in the queue, and two operating.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="08060394000062"></a>If sufficient evidence comes to light to show that the welfare of animals is not adequately safeguarded because of a lack of professional training and/or experience in farriery on the part of temporary service providers, we will bring it to the attention of the other department responsible for the regulations. But simply to say that is not good enough: we have the Animal Welfare Act. All the responsibilities of animal keepers are in statute now. We have much tougher animal welfare regulation than ever before. That Act is only one year in being. If we find evidence of the welfare of animals being affected, action will be taken long before the review of these regulations next year.</p>

<a name="80603-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="08060394000063"></a>In the final paragraph of a Written Answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, I wrote:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="08060394000097"></a>&#147;The amendment to the Farriers Registration Act, providing for registration of temporary providers of farriery services in Part V of the Farriers Register, will have a positive impact on animal welfare because it will enable the Farriers Registration Council to take disciplinary action against those registrants, should this be necessary&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 6/5/08; col. <I>WA </I><I>51</I>.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060394000090"></a>In other words, without this regulation&#151;although it arrived here without a long consultation or the possibility of being amended, for the reasons explained by other speakers as well as myself&#151;the UK regulator would have no power to act in those particular cases.</p>

<a name="80603-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="08060394000064"></a>The issue raised by the noble Lords, Lord Donoughue and Lord Addington, is that while the regulators have all been informed about this, it behoves Defra to explain the rules, some of which I have touched on tonight&#151;I stuck closely to the script, because I wanted to get it on the record. For example, recent publications said that, because of a loophole in new legislation, unqualified farriers from other EU countries would be able to practise here. On this point, I have said that a farrier must provide a host of documentary evidence to show that they have been engaged in the profession, even if in a country where there is no regulation. The Farriers Registration Council has to scrutinise these qualifications and all the other information that must be provided. It cannot force a competence test, because that is outwith the regulations allowing professionals free movement within the EU.</p>

<a name="80603-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="08060394000065"></a>We have a good system in this country&#151;people better qualified than me know that it is a far superior system. However, it is wrong to suggest that all the good work that has been done in farrier training by the farrier community is eroded by a directive that opens up the system to abuse and allows people to injure and lame horses with no redress. If the requirement was that everybody with stables would have to employ a certain quota of temporary farriers from countries without competent authorities, there might be a case to make. However, no one will be forced to employ anyone from an EU member state and insurance companies can provide restrictions or extra barriers. As I have said, some member states with very successful and extensive bloodstock industries do not have the same system as we do, and we should not be worried about farriers in those countries coming here. It will be up to individuals as regards whom they employ.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="08060394000066"></a>Because of what has been said here tonight and published recently&#151;I will not criticise individual publications, that would be unfair&#151;I think that it behoves us to set out some of the rules and hurdles that people might have to tackle in order to ply their trade here. This should be better explained. We can do a much better job and I will make that my responsibility. I asked yesterday if this had gone through the other place and it has not. I do not think that it was prayed against. This may be our only opportunity for a debate, but I will ensure that we take steps to explain better the rules and regulations to the industry, so that people are no longer fearful about the welfare of their animals, which is the top priority.</p>

<a name="80603-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="08060394000067"></a>I understand the issue raised by those whom I call &#147;my friends in the Countryside Alliance&#148;, although I am not a member. They make a point about public health, which takes us to the other part of the regulation. I understand that there is a public health issue if things go wrong and horses are treated badly. However, we do not have any evidence from the Court of Justice to bring public health arguments into what is an animal welfare issue. I know that the tenuous link can be made, as the Countryside Alliance has done, but there is no force of law behind that, in such terms that the solicitors and lawyers would argue that there was a public health issue here and that therefore we could use the other aspect of regulations.</p>

<a name="80603-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="08060394000068"></a>I hope that the debate has been useful, both for those in the industry and those outside who watch our events. I shall take steps to ensure that Defra takes this issue seriously, by way of explaining it better. It will not cost a great deal; we do not have many extra resources, but this is an area in which a few pennies spent on better explanation would not go amiss.</p>

Why did this measure come over here in such unpalatable form? Can the Minister answer that here? Perhaps he could write to us on that matter.</p>

The fact is that, although there was a short consultation, 18 months of discussions went on before last November. This is not something that has just appeared out of nowhere. We discussed this matter, and some of the concerns raised were not able to be taken into account in how the directive operates. I think that some of the farriers here said that there should be a practical competence test before you are employed, but it is not possible to do that.</p>

The temporary issue is important; it involves a temporary period, with a maximum of a year.</p>

However, there was one point that he missed, with respect. If the standards in the United Kingdom are higher than anywhere else in the world and if we are now going to allow in people who do not come up to those standards, we are lowering those standards, are we not?</p>

We are trying to encourage free movement of professions and we will buy in, as we do in other professions, whether it is medicine, engineering, science or dentistry&#151;there are all kinds of issues like that&#151;with the need to meet certain basic conditions. In this case, the basic conditions are those that I set out: if you are in a country where there is no competent authority you must still meet a set of criteria and prove that you have been practising in the profession for at least two years. You have to show that you are running a lawful business in another country to enable you to come over here on a temporary basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="08060394000075"></a>It is for others to decide, but there may be the odd one or two farriers who are better than some of our farriers. We have 390 here who are not qualified, in the sense that we are discussing qualifications&#151;those with grandfather rights. One has to ask, who judges those?

<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="08060394000077"></a>I know that the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, is on my side, but praying in aid the great mother of parliaments when we are discussing this under negative procedure, when we can discuss it only after it has gone through, and slowly, means that possibly we are not that perfect all the time in how we handle secondary legislation. That is the conclusion I would draw. The way in which this was picked up by accident at the last minute, by me, suggests that we should look at that situation more carefully in future.</p>

<a name="80603-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="08060394000078"></a>I should have made one declaration of interest. At a dinner party several months ago it was decided that I had won something in Lambourn that was relevant to the equine fraternity. It was decided that I was possibly the most unlikely person in the town to be a jockey. The noble Lord, Lord Dear, with his wonderful explanation of how a horse&#146;s foot works, might possibly challenge me for that if he turns up.</p>

<p><a name="08060371000006"></a>Clause 2 [<I>Objects</I>]:</p>

<p><a name="08060371000007"></a><a name="80603-gc0001.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80603-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08060371000116"></a>Earl Cathcart</b> moved Amendment No. 27:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08060371000099"></a> Clause 2, page 2, line 3, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08060371000100"></a>&#147;( ) In assessing the needs of people living in England in accordance with subsection (1), the HCA shall take particular account of the viability of rural communities.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80603-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000008"></a>The noble Earl said: I have received many briefings from different non-governmental organisations on the plight of rural communities, not least the Countryside Alliance, of which I am a member. Nineteen per cent&#151;or one in five&#151;of the English population live in rural areas. The Government&#146;s definition of rural areas are those with a population of less than 10,000. This does not, however, include the 3.5 million to 4 million people who live in large market towns and districts that are defined as rural, many of which, in spite of their size, are affected by and susceptible to the same problems as their more rural hinterlands.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000009"></a>This amendment would place the HCA under an obligation to take into account the needs of rural communities when pursuing and taking forward their objectives. At Second Reading, a number of noble Lords raised the issue of rural housing. It was heartening that the noble Baroness, Lady Dean&#151;I am sorry that she is not in her place&#151;said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08060371000101"></a>&#147;It is essential that, somewhere within the new system, there is something ensuring that rural housing is not forgotten. It would be so easy to forget it&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 28/4/08; col. 59.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060371000089"></a>When moving the first amendment, I argued that there should be a board member to champion rural housing. It was disappointing that the Minister did not share my view. Maybe we need to come back to this or take up the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Best, to require the HCA to consult a number of organisations whose interests should be represented.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000010"></a>I cannot see that the Minister will object to this amendment, as it follows the conclusion of the Government&#146;s own Affordable Rural Housing Commission. This commission was set up by Defra and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, which is now the Department of Communities and Local Government. The executive summary of the commission&#146;s report stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08060371000102"></a>&#147;It was evident from the urgency with which Ministers asked the Commission to report that both Departments shared the concern surrounding this issue, which is widely held across the political spectrum and throughout rural England&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060371000090"></a>The commission concluded that,</p>
<ul><a name="08060371000108"></a>&#147;to meet the scale of the need in rural communities in all regions, the issue must be addressed in its own right, and with urgency, rather than only after urban needs have been met&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC2"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column GC2</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="08060371000091"></a>That seems to imply that rural housing up until now has been an afterthought. By putting the HCA under an obligation to take into account the needs of the thousands of individual rural communities, with their quite different and disparate housing needs, we can get one step closer to realising the goals of the Government&#146;s own commission.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000011"></a>People in rural areas are finding it increasingly difficult to get on to the housing ladder in the area in which they were brought up or where they wish to work. Many are faced with little option but to move out of their area to obtain a roof over their head. This problem is recognised by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in the report of 2003&#151;five years ago. The report, <I>Sustainable Communities: Building for the Future</I>, acknowledged:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08060371000103"></a>&#147;The availability of housing, especially social and other affordable housing, is a critical issue in many rural areas ... Rural housing is often in high demand from in-comers, long distance commuters, people moving in to retire and owners of second homes and holiday homes. This can squeeze out local people on lower incomes&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80603-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000012"></a>Britain&#146;s rural population is growing. Defra&#146;s report on the population trends in rural areas of England from 1991 to 2001 found that the population in rural districts had risen almost eight times faster than the population in urban districts. Pressure on affordable housing is becoming more acute in rural communities than in urban areas. It is therefore imperative that the Bill addresses this new trend of population movement before it escalates into an even worse situation.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000013"></a>Rural areas cannot continue with the position as it is at present. The Affordable Rural Housing Commission reported that only 5 per cent of housing in rural areas is social housing compared with 23 per cent in urban areas. In 2007, the Halifax Rural Housing Review found that the typical house price in rural areas stood at &#163;246,000 compared with &#163;215,000 in urban areas, &#163;30,000 more expensive. The Government&#146;s commission found that average earnings were &#163;17,400 against &#163;22,300 in urban areas; that is, incomes are &#163;5,000 lower in rural areas. Rural purchasers of housing have to find &#163;30,000 more with &#163;5,000 less income than their urban counterparts. Only this year, the Government&#146;s own rural advocate, the Rev Dr Stuart Burgess, stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08060371000104"></a>&#147;In 2007, there were almost 1 million households in rural England with incomes below the official poverty threshold of &#163;16,492 per annum&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060371000092"></a>Average weekly wages in rural areas are not only much lower than those in urban areas, but the problems of the low paid are compounded by the lack of affordable housing. There are also concerns about the breakdown of community cohesion in rural areas as people are forced to move to cheaper urban housing, which no doubt exacerbates the urban housing problem. In addition, we must consider the problems that are particular to rural areas: the lack of transport, the distance to essential services&#151;not just to post offices, about which we have heard so much of late, but to schools, GP surgeries, dentists and shops. I would be interested to hear from the Minister exactly how she envisages the HCA will tackle these growing rural problems.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000014"></a>Now for a little dig at the Minister. On the first day in Grand Committee, I had to remind her when she was summing up the amendment on the composition of the board, that she had forgotten&#151;I repeat, forgotten&#151;my point on rural areas. I do not blame her, but as the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, said at Second Reading, it is of course so easy to forget rural areas. The Minister responded by saying:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08060371000105"></a>&#147;I am sorry I did not address that point. There will be an amendment later on under which we will be able to explore it, but I am not in favour of a single champion for rural areas. I would hope that the board will achieve this by having a genuine mix of experience, so rural areas will not need a separate champion because they will be championed by the board&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060371000093"></a>She then went on to concede:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08060371000106"></a>&#147;The rural areas must be spoken up for and their interests promoted, but that must be seen as seamless with the work of the HCA&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 13/5/08; col. GC 271.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060371000094"></a>That is the very problem. The system up until now has been seamless&#151;so seamless, in fact, that the activity in rural areas has hardly been noticed.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000015"></a>It is all very well having a genuine mix of experience on the board but, for all that experience, unless the agency is required to give specific consideration to rural areas, urban areas may be given priority at the expense of rural areas, as has undoubtedly happened until now. There is also no guarantee that the mix of experience will include those with experience and understanding of rural areas, which is needed if affordable housing solutions are to be found in those areas.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000016"></a>Moreover, while it is welcome that the Minister argues that rural areas must be spoken up for and their interests promoted, it is less clear what she meant when she said that that must be seen as seamless with the work of the HCA. If it is meant that the needs of rural areas will be given equal attention to the needs of urban areas, taking into account the important differences between the areas, and that those on the board will have the necessary expertise to address both urban and rural needs and the impact of urban developments in rural areas, that is welcome.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000017"></a>However, it is equally open to interpretation that although rural needs will be considered, the bulk of the board&#146;s efforts and expertise will be directed towards urban areas, with the occasional nod to rural areas. Far from being seamless, there must be a clear voice on the board and a requirement in the Bill that both urban and rural areas be treated on their own terms and the differences between the two be recognised. That cannot be seamless. Those are two distinct dimensions of the agency's work and that should be made clear in the agency's statutory functions and reflected in the make-up of the board.</p>

To have neither would neglect one in five of the population&#151;one in four if you count market towns. We all know that we like to support minority groups. In the amendment, we do not seek special treatment; we ask for rural areas not be forgotten but to receive their fair share of attention&#151;a fair crack of the whip. The Minister has already rejected the idea of

I hope that the Government will listen to their own research advisers. I beg to move.</p>

This is not a new issue. I was secretary to an inquiry chaired by His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh, which reported in 1976. It was called <I>Rural Housing: Problems and Possible Solutions</I><I></I>and it came up with a set of conclusions that are very familiar to us today: there was a gross insufficiency of affordable housing in rural areas and we should do more about it. Since 1976, we have had the right to buy, taking out of the social sector an awful lot of the homes in a lot of villages. There are three obvious facts to anyone who pauses for thought on this. First, the amount of council housing in rural areas is often&#151;nearly always&#151;less as a percentage of the total stock than it is in urban areas, so losing any of that council stock is likely to be more detrimental. Secondly, the percentage of homes bought under the right to buy in rural areas has been higher than in urban areas, so it started worse and ended up worse.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000020"></a>Thirdly, house prices in rural areas are higher than in comparable urban areas&#151;as we all know, this is because the middle classes have moved there from urban areas&#151;making the affordability gap more difficult. Thirty-two years after the inquiry chaired by Prince Philip produced its report, his daughter, the Princess Royal, speaking in her capacity as patron of the Rural Housing Trust, echoed the words of her father in the report and said that the affordability gap had now become a housing affordability chasm. Can we address the problems faced by second generation rural communities whose parents were council tenants, occupied tied accommodation or agricultural tenancies, and who find themselves unable to stay in those areas? Can the new Homes and Communities Agency make a difference to the lives of those people or are we really saying that we accept that people in rural areas whose parents were not home owners and who do not have high incomes will simply have to move away and over time will all be replaced? If we do not accept that, can the HCA do something positive about it? How can we reinforce and strengthen the work of this agency to ensure that rural housing gets its fair share of resources and effort?</p>

<a name="80603-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000021"></a>Over the years I have followed the progress of the Housing Corporation&#146;s allocation policies and of its annual approved development programme. There has been an ebbing and flowing of interest in rural housing over those years. I detect that the chair of the Housing Corporation can make a big difference in this area. I remember two who laid special emphasis on rural housing: Sir Hugh Cubitt and Sir Christopher Benson. Under their leadership rural housing targets went up because they took a special interest in it. Under other  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC5"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column GC5</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>chairs the issue was less significant. From that I deduce that the people on the board of the agency, particularly the chair, can make a difference in this area because you either get a champion of rural housing, with a target which reflects that championing process, or you do not. Therefore, there should be someone on the board with a special interest in rural housing&#151;it may not be their only qualification for being on the board&#151;who can champion that part of the HCA&#146;s new role.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000022"></a>Further, the Homes and Communities Agency can make a significant difference to the amount of rural housing that is available through the use of rural housing enablers. In 1992, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, of which I was the then director, joined forces with the Rural Development Commission to ascertain what would ensure that affordable homes were built in small villages by housing associations with support from statutory bodies. I declare an interest as I was a commissioner on the Rural Development Commission at the time. They concluded that the factor most likely to effect this result was to get local people&#151;who are to this day called rural housing enablers&#151;do the hard graft of liaising between: planners; landowners, some of whom are very sympathetic and concerned about the local community; the parish council, which may or may not be sympathetic to start with but needs to hold a lot of meetings about every scheme; the housing associations, which may or may not be interested in building six houses in the middle of nowhere; the local community at large; and the housing and planning departments of the council. All these need to get behind the idea that a small development, which no doubt would be situated a long way away from where the provider, the housing association, is based, should be built. I recall a very nice site on the estate of Sir Marcus Worsley at Hovingham in north Yorkshire, that he said he would be very happy to make available to us. When I told my finance director, he said, &#147;Not another of those ghastly rural schemes where every time we have to change a light bulb or a washer in a tap I&#146;ve got to send someone out and it costs an absolute fortune. There will be local protests and your staff will be tied up. Instead of doing six homes in Hovingham, can we not do 65 in Leeds?&#148;. That was always the cry.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000023"></a>But the answer is &#147;no&#148;. If there is a rural housing enabler in North Yorkshire, someone else can go to all the meetings, get everything teed up and get the planners on side. Then the housing association can step in with its expertise and build the homes. These people are the key. It will not matter whether the Homes and Communities Agency&#151;the Housing Corporation at the moment&#151;has a target of 6,000 homes a year or whatever. If there are no rural housing enablers on the ground to do the preparations for these small developments, it is very difficult to see how they will be accomplished.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000024"></a>Rural housing enablers have been funded through the good work of the Commission for Rural Communities, which picked up on the work previously done by the Countryside Agency and the Rural Development Commission, but that funding is coming to an end. The plan has been for local authorities to pick up the tab and to pay for rural housing enablers instead of the Housing Corporation and the rural agency of the  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC6"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column GC6</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>day doing it. I fear that, in many cases, hard-pressed, cash-strapped local authorities will not find the funds to replace those which the Housing Corporation and the Commission for Rural Communities have been putting up to pay for these rural housing enablers. Instead of the HCA simply setting a target, making available grant and seeing lots of homes being built all over the place, nothing much will happen without the rural housing enablers. The housing associations will prefer the economies of scale of urban development and we will not see these small village schemes taking place.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000025"></a>If the county council is to put up the money, it will have to consider where it will get the extra cash from for a rural housing enabler. Enlightened county councils have said, &#147;We do not any longer give a 50 per cent council tax discount in rural areas for second homes and empty properties. We give only a 10 per cent discount on council tax and will use the balance to fund rural housing enablers and other aspects of rural housing&#148;. But where that enlightened policy is not in practise, it is very difficult for the county council to find the extra funds.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000026"></a>Of course, it is not always very popular. I had to address a meeting in Cerne Abbas, a delightful village in Dorset. There was a plan to build eight rural cottages with a beautiful flint facing, which I am pleased to say now exist; six houses are also to be built in lovely Yorkshire stone in Hovingham. However, when I addressed the public meeting in the Cerne Abbas village hall, it was not only full with 200 people standing nose to nose, but people were also outside and we had to have a loudspeaker for them. But, believe it or not, they did not all turn out to support the eight cottages for Cerne Abbas. To my astonishment, they opposed the housing for local people, which, once accomplished, was a huge success.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000027"></a>It is sometimes difficult for local authorities to stand against this tide and to say that they are going to put money into rural housing enablers to make sure that homes appear in villages. I suggest that the Homes and Communities Agency takes under its wing the concept of the rural housing enabler and does not expect these people to be funded across the country by others. They should be funded centrally where the HCA has a target for rural housing and where it will see its target accomplished if RHEs are in place. At the moment there are about 40 of them, but I fear that number will drift downwards as councils find it difficult to take on the funding.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000028"></a>I support the thinking behind this important amendment, as well as initiatives to strengthen the board to ensure that a champion is in place to set a target for rural housing. I hope that the Homes and Communities Agency will have statutory powers to ensure that rural housing enablers are in place around the country and, more than that, I hope that they will use them. Otherwise, very little will happen.</p>

In some ways there is very little to add to what the noble Lord, Lord Best, said. He brings great expertise to the Committee, for which I am grateful. I share his concerns about the amount of money that will be available to encourage and promote rural housing.  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC7"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column GC7</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>That is why I particularly like my noble friend&#146;s amendment, which calls for the HCA to take particular account of the viability of rural communities. I know that the CRC is doing a review on affordable housing and linking economic affordability with sustainability.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000030"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Best, reflected on more than 30 years of housing. The sad thing is that, with a few exceptions, we are not much further forward than we should be pro rata if one looks at what has happened over those 30 years to housing in urban areas. Clearly there has been much more progress in those areas. It is there to see, so I very much support my noble friend&#146;s amendment. I am quite concerned that the board members, whoever they are, may not necessarily have rural affordable housing at the back of their minds, because it is a very small part of the overall pattern of housing compared with the bigger urban needs. Even more, there should be someone on the board who is recognised for having a particular skill, ability or understanding of what happens.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000031"></a>The other thing to remember is that, within the classification of rural housing, one could be talking about a small hamlet of 100, 70 or 50, compared with 10,000. People living in a community of 10,000 obviously have a greater say, because more people are involved in the community and understand it, than do people in a few villages where only one, two or three affordable houses are needed. I very much have a mind to support the amendment, and I hope that the Minister will take on board my noble friend&#146;s comments.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000032"></a>Two other issues are tied up with this matter. My noble friend has called for the viability of rural communities. I am sure that Members of the Committee will be as anxious as I was to see the announcement in the press this weekend not only that 2,500 post offices will close, many of which are in rural areas, but that 4,000 more may close. If you start ripping out the heart of rural communities, even if they are small, by closing things such as rural post offices and schools&#151;in the same way, the Government currently give more money to children who are educated in urban areas than they do for children in rural areas, in some cases by nearly half the same amount again&#151;there is real proof that, unless someone speaks up for rural communities, they get lost. This is the Government&#146;s problem; rural communities have a very small number of people compared with urban areas.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000033"></a>I hope simply that, if the Minister cannot accept the amendment, the Government will duly consider the best way in the Bill to help and encourage those who want to live and work in rural areas. The Bill is a once-in-a-lifetime sort of Bill. We are setting up the HCA and we should not let this occasion go by without addressing the concerns of rural communities.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000037"></a>Three terms in the amendment struck me. First, there is &#147;particular account&#148;. It is a question of balance, but should the HCA be taking particular account of rural communities? I am not persuaded that that is the way to express it. It should take account, but I am not sure that that should outweigh other considerations. The &#147;viability&#148; of communities is important; that they are capable of independent existence. It should not just be about &#147;rural communities&#148; but all communities. I do not at all disagree with the concerns that have been expressed, but I have reservations about whether this is the way in which to achieve it, because the suggestion implicit and perhaps explicit here&#151;I know that noble Lords who have different backgrounds to mine will inevitably see these things differently&#151;is that other considerations should be secondary. I am sure that is not in the mind of the Government; it is certainly not in mine.</p>

As I see it, the Minister and her colleagues have a great responsibility to ensure that the aspirations of the rural communities are taken account of every bit as much as those in other spheres. We can look at the situation in the rural areas. It might be felt that they can easily be defined, but there is a blurring of the edges, and it is not just about town and country. There are lots of areas in between. The pressure under which housing has been put&#151;we are solely concerned with housing here&#151;over the past 30 or 40 years matches with the aspirations of ordinary people. At one time, they would never have dreamt of owning their own home or being able to rent a good home, but that has grown out of all proportion. I well imagine that most people in this Room are owner-occupiers and they have aspired from wherever they were to owning their own home, and they got it.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000039"></a>Thirty years ago, the need of people in the rural areas that we are concentrating on was to be able to buy their own house, and they bought it; they were given legislation, despite protests. The people in the rural areas were not really concerned about what would happen 30 years later; they were concerned about getting on the housing ladder. They bought the house and quickly sold it to buy another house, and away they went. We must not underestimate what  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC9"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column GC9</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I would call the selfishness of people. It is all very well saying that someone has the responsibility to do things on a grand scale, strategically but, at the end of the day, the people who live in rural areas are every bit as entitled to be as selfish as those who live anywhere else.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000040"></a>It has been said that housing is not the only product in rural communities that has been under attack; post offices have been mentioned. I have previously pointed out in Grand Committee that the attack on rural communities comes from many directions, not least that of the car-borne shopper. There was once an idyllic concept of a rural area, with a baker, butcher and candlestick maker. They were happy until it was discovered that not only could someone have a car, which they had never had, but could travel to the supermarket five miles away, which they had never been able to do. I am not making party political points, but with the affluence that gradually came they decided to exercise their rights, which we would all support.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000041"></a>Given the opportunity of the right to buy, they bought their own house. Consequently, the council house they had happily occupied under a good landlord&#151;the local authority&#151;disappeared. It is the same with shopping and post offices. If we want to stand still in a segment of life, we shall get nowhere. The Minister and her colleagues must ensure that the HCA is peopled by men and women with experience and nous: sense. They would not need to be told by this Committee or anybody else to ensure that people in rural areas get a fair crack of the whip; of course they are entitled to that. If the proposition was that rural people should get a fair crack of the whip, my hand would immediately go up.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000042"></a>All the arguments put forward about the cost of housing and poor level of wages are part of the rural scene. However, I do not think that the Minister will take kindly to the effective segmentalisation of the needs of those in housing: those who live in rural areas and are, by virtue of living there, entitled to more than just a fair crack of the whip. I note what the noble Lord, Lord Best, said: they were not entitled to special treatment, or something above and beyond. However, I hope that when their needs are looked at by the commission and the officers, they will have half a mind, looking back over a period, to ask whether they did right, by those in not only rural but urban areas. Those of us who had the great privilege of representing constituents in urban areas do not need to be told of the misery of constituents in appalling housing. The answer to their problems comes from not a beneficent landlord but hard-headed decisions taken by the Government. Ultimately, the Government will not be short of advice and special pleading. I do not object to that, but somebody will have to make decisions. The greatest decision, of course, will be over the allocation of resources. It will be some time before one gets the proper balance.</p>

<p><a name="08060371000044"></a>It will be difficult for the Minister and her colleagues to do something which marks out those living in rural areas as needing some kind of special treatment. I started out by saying that it is not easy, and the Government will get no credit for it, but I wish the Minister well.</p>

<p><a name="08060371000045"></a><a name="80603-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80603-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08060371000121"></a>Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville:</b> I was evacuated during the war but, if I am allowed to count my grandmother staying on in London during the Blitz, 2007 was the first year in my life in which I did not have a London address.

<a name="80603-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000046"></a>The pressures on affordable housing in rural areas have already been alluded to. To provide examples, I will simply take two cases from the parish of 200 in which we live. First, I have quoted the example of my former immediate neighbour, a retired disabled agricultural labourer, on two previous occasions in your Lordships&#146; House, and this will be the third. He has now gone into sheltered housing. A breeze-block bungalow with a simple roof, in which he lived for really all his life, was put on the market in part because of brownfield site opportunities. The 0.22 acre site was sold for &#163;300,000, the intention being to knock the bungalow down and to put on that site a house that will have four bedrooms, each with en suite bathrooms. We made no complaint to the planning authorities, but it is yet another unit of affordable housing that has been taken away.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000047"></a>In the same way, the son of one of our colleagues in your Lordships&#146; House, totally honourably&#151;I have no complaint whatever about the process&#151;bought two semi-detached cottages that were attached to each other. Those represented two separate pieces of affordable housing in a single parish are now going to be a single house with further extension. Because of the duties that attach&#151;I am not making any fiscal complaint&#151;to the purchase of houses nowadays, there are any number of cases in the countryside where people are buying houses with the specific intention of extending them. They are not buying them because the house itself will fit their needs, but they will add extensions to them. I immediately declare a vicarious mea culpa, since our own house was sold to us by an estate agent under the slogan, &#147;A 17th century shepherd&#146;s cottage interestingly extended&#148;. It did at least win a Civic Trust Award and is not therefore subject to the next complaint, about which I have an incidental question for the Minister.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000048"></a>I go back to the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Howarth of Newport, at the start of this Committee stage. We are seeing in the countryside a whole series of houses that are being given extensions that have only a nodding acquaintance with the  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC11"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column GC11</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>architecture of the original building. The Minister does not need to answer now, but do the planning authorities have any design responsibility to see that there is not a discrepancy between the extension and the original building? At the moment, we are running the risk of acquiring the sort of landscape that they have in Ireland as a result of somewhat relaxed planning laws.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000049"></a>I will revert briefly to the urban experience, to follow up on what the noble Lord, Lord Best, said. In 1987, the Peabody Trust, which was a massive landlord in my former constituency, decided that it was not going to provide any priority to fourth-generation families living in a particular community. The Peabody Trust had estates all over the constituency. It was only going to be decided on economic criteria. I said that I thought it ran the risk of destroying communities that had existed for a very long time, whose strength was their very durability and continuity. I am pleased to say, to the credit of the Peabody Trust, that after 10 years it acknowledged that I had been right, and it established a reasonable quota for people whose families had lived in the area for a long time. In rural areas, we do not have landlords with that degree of control. Therefore, the same instrument cannot be used to provide continuity in affordable housing in the countryside.</p>

<p><a name="08060371000050"></a>I recall a meeting of the All-Party Group on Homelessness and Housing Need, which a number of your Lordships have attended. It was addressed by the director of the Rural Housing Trust, who said that the problem with dealing with one-off schemes in small communities was that the costs were disproportionately high and that they were therefore at a disadvantage.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000051"></a>I end on a different personal note. The late Derek Smith, who was a school contemporary of mine, retired from being a farmer and set up ViRSA, which dealt with rural shops. Before his premature death from cancer, he had become involved in housing as well. I cannot say how strongly I support the thrust and theme of the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Best. When I became a Member of Parliament, Soho, in my constituency, was threatened with massive demolition. It was saved by the creation of the Soho Housing Association in the area, which did a remarkable job of retaining any number of handsome&#151;frequently 18th-century&#151;buildings that would otherwise have been swept away. The rural housing scene requires a sympathetic and interested resource, however that is achieved, to provide support in the same way as the Soho Housing Association did when it was set up. I am very proud of what the association has been able to deliver, and I very much hope that, arising out of this legislation, we will see similar advances all over the country.</p>

I have heard a lot of wisdom in the Committee this afternoon. I am not unsympathetic to the thrust of  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC12"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column GC12</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>what the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, has had to say. I was particularly interested in what the noble Lord, Lord Best, had to say, because it struck a chord with me. I sat here thinking about this and about the ironies of life. The noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, and I are of a similar age, and while he enjoyed the playing fields of Eton as a young man, I enjoyed the strawberry fields of Great Bentley. I grew up in a rural community, and I would wager pretty fairly that I am probably the only Member of this Committee who lived in a rural council house. I might be wrong&#151;I have not checked everyone&#146;s entry in <I>Dod</I><I>s</I>&#151;but I have some personal experience, which is why I have particularly empathy with the points that have been made.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000054"></a>The council bungalow that I grew up in was the product of post-war visionary planning. I know this because the then Labour Government, in their post-1945 period, ensured that we had a massive home-building programme because of national need. I have spotted in the many years since my childhood that the rural council bungalow that I grew up in is repeated in rural communities all over the country. I have seen it many times. That was because the foresight of politicians of an earlier generation. Wise they were, because it ensured that in many rural communities up and down the country there was social affordable housing, which people who worked the land and who came back from the war could access fairly easily and readily and could afford to live in.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000055"></a>How does that affect where we are today? In some senses&#151;this is a housing and regeneration Bill after all&#151;we are talking about the need to regenerate and ensure that we have more than adequate housing and a range of affordable housing in rural communities. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, put her finger on this. Part of her critique of the amendment, with which she and I have some sympathy, was that it may fall down in the use of the term &#147;particular&#148;. The post-war Labour Government did not have to have a particular need to achieve their overall policy objective, which was to ensure that housing was regenerated not only in urban areas but in rural ones. </p>

<a name="80603-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000056"></a>The noble Earl will probably be disappointed with what I have to say, although I hope that he also will be encouraged. I certainly understand where he is coming from. Ultimately, we conclude that the amendment is unnecessary and I will set out why we think that. Simply, the Homes and Communities Agency is charged with the creation of strong and sustainable communities. It will be a national agency with skills, expertise and budgets to meet the needs of people living in all areas of the country&#151;both urban and rural communities. Clause 2 sets out objects for the agency which represent the set of principles to which it must work. Anything that the Homes and Communities Agency does must come back to the principles of providing decent affordable housing alongside the regeneration of all our communities, wherever they are located, with a view to meeting the needs of people living in areas of England.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000057"></a>As I have said, we share the noble Earl&#146;s concern about the viability of rural communities. I think that it is fair to say that all too often these communities have  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC13"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column GC13</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not been sustainable. Young people and young families just starting out find themselves priced out of the housing market in their villages or have to travel a long distance to their place of work. Strong and sustainable communities in rural areas can be maintained only if those families living there can afford to remain there. Members of the Committee have referred to the impact of the right to buy on rural areas. The noble Lord, Lord Best, made the point rather well. He said that the percentage of affordable council housing was lower in rural areas and that the percentage of those houses which were bought under the right to buy is higher; both are true statistically. So we have to take very careful account of that. It is for those sorts of reasons that the Homes and Communities Agency will continue with the national affordable housing programme from one of the transferring organisations, which has targets for rural affordable homes, for social rent and home ownership. The Government have recently announced their target of 11,000 homes to be built between 2009 and 2011.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000058"></a>The agency will be the Government&#146;s foremost delivery agency and will be tasked with delivering strategic housing and regeneration priorities. In practice, the agency will do that by working closely with local authorities to deliver their aspirations for their communities. Local authorities in rural areas will assess the needs for their communities and will, quite rightly, have regard for the viability of those communities. Local authorities in rural areas will set out their aspirations for strong, viable and sustainable communities in their local development plans, in the regional spatial strategies and in their regional economic strategies. They will be knitted together and will have a bearing on how the local authority, as the lead organisation in the area, approaches these issues.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000059"></a>When the Homes and Communities Agency approaches local authorities to plan how to deliver national targets at the local level, these sorts of plans and strategies are the immediate tools which will inform their work and inform the agency&#146;s investment decisions. By working with the local authority at the local level in rural areas in drawing up regional investment plans in partnership with local authorities and regional development agencies, the agency will ensure the viability of rural communities.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000060"></a>There is a desire to specify representation at board level; I understand that. I know that we have had some of this argument, but, picking up the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, on representation on the board, I do not think that it is desirable to specify one particular group. In order to avoid having a board where all the specifics are identified and associated with just one individual, we want to ensure that the board as a whole reflects our priorities, including making sure that there is affordable rural housing.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000061"></a>However, in paragraph 1(3)(a) of Schedule 1, there is a requirement on the Secretary of State to,</p>
<ul><a name="08060371000109"></a>&#147;have regard to the desirability of appointing a person who has experience of, and has shown some capacity in&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08060371000095"></a>a relevant matter. Consideration will clearly be given to this in the construction of the board to ensure that particular interests are reflected in its overall makeup.  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC14"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column GC14</b><br /> <br /></columnNum></p>

<a name="80603-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000062"></a>It is worth making a couple more points here. We will ensure that the agency will be well advised in terms of benefiting from broader advice on issues related to rural regeneration and rural housing. In March last year the Housing Corporation itself was asked to set up and chair the Rural Housing Advisory Group which reports annually to the department. That group is chaired by Candy Atherton, who is a member of the Housing Corporation with special responsibilities for rural housing. The new agency will have the benefit of that continuing work, and members of that group include former members of the Affordable Rural Housing Commission, whose work has been extremely valuable in helping us design our strategy and general approach. Our case is this: we are very conscious of the particular needs of rural communities. The advice, guidance, help and assistance is already in place and will be incorporated into the agency. In terms of board appointments, of course it is going to be one of those issues that will be reflected in how the board is composed.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000063"></a>Finally, on resources, it is worth making the point that currently the Housing Corporation&#146;s programme for 2006-08 allocates to rural districts some 21 per cent of all affordable housing allocations, which pretty much matches the noble Earl&#146;s quoted figure of one in five living in rural communities. We are getting the balance right in terms of funding for that particular housing sector as well. One would expect that to continue over into the new agency, which will be charged with specific responsibilities.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000064"></a>We have had a good debate on a live and current issue. I certainly recognise the strength of feeling and interest, but our approach takes on board many of the noble Earl&#146;s concerns as well as the others which have been expressed without having to go into the business of specifying in the way he suggests. That could have the effect of distorting the general balance in terms of the policy of the new agency.</p>

<p><a name="08060371000065"></a><a name="80603-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80603-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08060371000124"></a>Baroness Byford:</b> Would the Minister like to reflect on his earlier comment when he said that this is a &#147;digression&#148;? I do not think he meant to say those words, but they were unfortunate when we are dealing with the small but very important question of provision for rural communities. I would hate this to go by without that being rectified, because those of us in rural areas have a feeling that that is what is likely to follow.</p>

I took this to be a debate and a discursive opportunity to look at the issue of rural housing, and I certainly do not belittle it. As I explained carefully in my remarks, I do not just share an interest and a passion in this area; it is my origin, so I well understand the issues. I would not want to be misunderstood or misinterpreted.</p>

That is an excellent idea that the Government could take on board and think about. The noble Lord mentioned consulting parishioners and the difficulty he had had in one area in Dorset. The parish council is probably quite receptive to his idea, but when you get to local people, they are all right, Jack, because they already have a house, so they are probably less receptive to the idea of more housing in their rather quaint village. It is very difficult to get across to them that, although they might be okay, there are other people who need housing.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000068"></a>The amendment does not ask for special treatment for rural areas, as I emphasised when I started the debate. We are asking that rural areas receive their fair share of attention. I am sorry that the Minister did not like the amendment, or thought it unnecessary, and did not like the reference to taking &#147;particular&#148; account. I offered that if he did not like our amendment, he could come back with a better one that might give attention to urban and rural areas so that the word &#147;rural&#148; is included in the Bill. The Affordable Rural Housing Commission report was published five years ago and we are still concerned about rural areas. It is all very well saying how concerned we are, but we actually need to get something done. We think that something like this amendment would bring the issue to the attention of the HCA so that rural areas are not forgotten. I am disappointed by the Minister&#146;s reaction to that.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000069"></a>The Minister did not explain how the Government propose to tackle the problems in rural areas. What is going to happen in rural areas? At the moment, very little is happening. They have a long way to go to catch up with urban areas to redress the balance. It is all very well saying that the funding is getting better now, but there is a long way to go to redress the balance. That was slightly disappointing.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000070"></a>Unless the Minister would like to come back with a better amendment, in his view, at this stage I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000076"></a>Amendment No. 41 would include open space as a facility in the reference to,</p>
<ul><a name="08060371000110"></a>&#147;social, religious or recreational facilities&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08060371000096"></a>It is not necessarily regarded as a recreational facility. I think it is more than that. It is certainly part of infrastructure. I do not need to spend long trying to persuade the Committee of the importance to physical and mental health of adequate open space in  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC16"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column GC16</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>otherwise built-up areas. It is an important part of the infrastructure. I would say that it is central. I would like to be certain that it is included. I would like it specifically mentioned, but at least an assurance that that is what is meant would be helpful. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08060371000097"></a>with &#147;transport facilities&#148;. At all stages we ought to establish a level playing field between different types of transport and not assume that roads are necessarily at the top of the hierarchy in all cases. Of course, roads have a very detailed and intricate local relationship with any development, because they go right up to front doors or factory doors and, through the network, they link into main roads, trunk roads and motorways. New developments such as railways would not have that direct relationship, but if we are thinking of the Homes and Communities Agency being involved in eco-towns&#151;I do not know whether we are; perhaps we can tease that out later on planning issues&#151;and talking about ecologically, economically and socially sustainable new settlements, we certainly ought to be thinking about whether railway connections, for example, are possible, even if it involves building new lines.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000079"></a>Nevertheless, there are other forms of transport that have the same detailed and intricate local relationship with housing and other buildings as roads do, such as cycleways and footpaths. I could understand a reference in the Bill to highways, but it says roads. I think perhaps that was put in automatically by whoever drafted the legislation, because there is an assumption nowadays that roads come first and everything else comes second. That is the purpose of the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08060371000080"></a><a name="80603-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80603-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08060371000130"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I shall deal with Amendment No. 36 first. It is grouped with the other amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, which make a small but significant change. The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, would reduce one of the examples in subsection (3) of the types of infrastructure that might be secured by the HCA to &#147;transport facilities&#148; by removing the explicit reference to roads. I appreciate that the noble Lord is concerned that the drafting might limit the HCA to providing only one of any such infrastructure service at any one time or to any one development. I am sure that he would be concerned that if we single out roads in this way, it may skew the focus of the HCA in that direction.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000081"></a>Perhaps I should make it clear that the clause does not require the HCA to deliver roads. While it empowers the HCA to provide or facilitate the provision of infrastructure, it does not require it to do so. I do not believe that the provision will skew the  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC17"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column GC17</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>activities of the agency or divert responsibility for the delivery of roads on to it. The inclusion of &#147;roads or other&#148; merely makes it clear that in this context we consider a road to be a type of transport facility. If we do not say so, it might not be obvious to all that roads should be included. Our intention is to enable the agency to act responsibly. As I said, it must ensure that the housing that it provides forms part of sustainable communities. Part of those communities being sustainable is that they must have the right infrastructure, including roads. That is the purpose of that paragraph.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000082"></a>Next, I turn to Amendment No. 41, which is in this group. It would expand from one set of examples of the types of infrastructure that may be secured by the HCA to emphasise that &#147;recreational facilities&#148; includes &#147;open space&#148;. I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, is concerned that as drafted it may not be obvious to all that open spaces should be included in recreational facilities and that the HCA should be empowered to secure them. I am not sure that is the case. It should be apparent to all that open spaces are a pretty vital recreational facility for all our communities and that the HCA should be empowered to secure them. Perhaps it is worth reminding noble Lords that the definition is what is known as a partial definition. The examples are illustrative, not exhaustive. We have made it clear throughout our policies that we consider open space to be vital to creating sustainable communities and ensuring their well-being. I do not think that we disagree significantly in terms of principles. I would like to give this matter some further consideration and return to it on Report.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000083"></a>Finally, Amendments Nos. 35, 37, 38, 39, 40 and 42 are a small group of amendments that could have significant effect. The effect may be to turn a list of examples of types of infrastructure that is not intended to be exhaustive, but to give a flavour of the sorts of things that we mean, into a narrower list. That is our concern; I am sure it is not the concern of the noble Baroness. Perhaps she is concerned that as drafted Clause 2(3) would have the effect of exclusivity; namely that the agency may, for example, be limited to providing only one of any such infrastructure service at any one time or to any one development. That is not the effect of the subsection as drafted. The definition of &#147;infrastructure&#148; is wide, inclusive and not exhaustive. I am concerned that the amendments may have a slight narrowing effect, as I argued earlier, on the types of infrastructure that the agency can provide. Such an effect would be contrary to their purpose.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08060371000084"></a>I accept that this is a fine point of statutory interpretation. I would like to take some further opinions before concluding on this matter. I would be grateful if the noble Baroness would enable us to give the matter some further consideration and return to it on Report. Perhaps, if the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment, we could achieve some meeting of minds on this point before we next meet to discuss these issues.</p>

<p><a name="08060392000001"></a>Clause 3 [<I>Principal powers</I>]:</p>

<p><a name="08060392000002"></a><a name="80603-gc0003.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80603-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08060392000092"></a>Lord Greaves</b> moved Amendment No. 43:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08060392000073"></a> Clause 3, page 2, line 33, leave out &#147;do anything it considers appropriate&#148; and insert &#147;take any reasonable actions&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80603-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08060392000003"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 44 and 45, which stand in my name in the same group. Amendment No. 49A, tabled by my noble friend, is also grouped.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08060392000004"></a>The reason for tabling Amendment No. 43 is that the wording of the Bill seems to allow the HCA to do anything. Clause 3 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08060392000074"></a>&#147;The HCA may do anything it considers appropriate for the purposes of its objects or for purposes incidental to those purposes&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08060392000062"></a>I was trying to think where the boundaries will lie. Presumably, there will be sensible people on the HCA who will not want to declare war on Singapore, or wherever people may want to declare war next, and that will be reserved to some other body in this country. Nevertheless, it is an extremely wide-ranging power. My amendment would delete the words,</p>
<ul><a name="08060392000080"></a>&#147;do anything it considers appropriate&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="08060392000063"></a>and insert the words &#147;take any reasonable actions&#148; as an alternative.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08060392000005"></a>To some extent, this is a matter of semantics, as usual, and the Minister will say, &#147;All public bodies and anyone exercising powers in public bodies have to behave reasonably and pass the test of reasonableness&#148;. Nevertheless, legislation ought deliberately to curb what may be the wider excesses or zeal of some members of those bodies. Clause 3 is very wide ranging, and I am trying to restrict it a little.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08060392000006"></a>My second amendment, Amendment No. 44, would leave out subsection (5). It, and the next amendment, which would leave out subsection (6), are probing amendments to try to get the Minister to explain to me in words that I can understand what that all means. I have what I think is an old-fashioned view that legislation ought to be understandable by people with reasonable intelligence and a reasonable understanding of the use of the English language. People may disagree, but I consider that I fulfil both of those criteria&#151;without going overboard&#151;and I do not understand what that means.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08060392000007"></a>Clause 4(5) reads:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08060392000075"></a>&#147;Each power does not limit the scope of the powers conferred by section 3&#148;.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="08060392000064"></a>I do not understand what that means at all. It seems to say that the powers in Clause 3 are limitless. Subsection (6) states,</p>
<ul><a name="08060392000081"></a>&#147;the powers conferred by section 3 must not be used to override a restriction imposed on the exercise of a specific power&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08060392000065"></a>That seems to say that the powers in Section 3 are limited by any other specific powers in the Bill and any other statute. I do not understand how the powers in Clause 3, Clause 4(5) and Clause 4(6)(b) relate to each other. Perhaps the Minister can explain that. While she is doing that, perhaps she can explain why subsection (6)(a) states that,</p>
<ul><a name="08060392000082"></a>&#147;subsections (2) and (3) do not apply to the HCA&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08060392000066"></a>when it is designated as the local planning authority. There is clearly some technical reason for that, but it would be nice to understand it. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08060392000008"></a><a name="80603-gc0003.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80603-gc0003.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08060392000093"></a>Viscount Eccles:</b> I wonder whether there is a conflict between Clause 3 and the provisions in Clauses 48 to 50. The HCA will be subject to guidance, which it must take into consideration, and directions, with which it must comply. It also needs a lot of consents. I am intrigued, because I do not remember such a short clause in any of the predecessor Acts of Parliament, from which the Bill is derived, or one that sets this out so baldly. I wonder what would happen if the matter were taken to court by the chief executive, who said, &#147;I do not have to do what you said in this direction, Secretary of State, because I have Clause 2, which says that I can do anything I think is appropriate&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="08060392000009"></a><a name="80603-gc0003.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80603-gc0003.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08060392000094"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> Amendment No. 49A comes from the same thinking as that of my noble friend, and would amend Clause 6 half way down the third page. I propose that the powers to bring about the more effective use of land are referred to as specific. I suggest adding,</p>
<ul><a name="08060392000083"></a>&#147;by the use of the powers specifically set out in this Chapter&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08060392000067"></a>At least two of the terms in the clause are quite wide, although I am less concerned about this one than the other one. What is more effective is a matter of judgment. I am not clear what the criteria are for assessing what is more or less effective in this context. </p>

<a name="80603-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08060392000010"></a>I hope that the Government can assure us that the powers that the HCA will have to rely on are specific, and that we can read Clause 6 as an introduction to the more specific powers that the HCA will have rather than as something which the HCA could rely on without having regard to the detail of the powers that are set out in much more precise fashion.</p>

<p><a name="08060392000068"></a>is far too sweeping. I suspect that if we leave the clause as it is, it will not do the HCA any favours. Part of the concern that people have expressed recently about eco-towns and a whole range of other things comes from a deep-seated anxiety that local views will be railroaded. I know from the work that has already been done in the HCA that that is not the body language or the posture that that organisation wants

If we leave the clause as it is and allow the agency to say that it can do anything that it considers appropriate, we are sending out entirely the wrong message, and it would be no bad thing if a test of reasonableness and reasonable action were built into the Bill. I support the amendment for that reason.</p>

<p><a name="08060392000012"></a><a name="80603-gc0003.htm_spnew14"></a><b><a name="80603-gc0003.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="08060392000096"></a>Lord Dixon-Smith:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has picked up a point that I made at Second Reading about the powers of the Homes and Communities Agency. I argued then that,</p>
<ul><a name="08060392000085"></a>&#147;do anything it considers appropriate&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08060392000069"></a>is inappropriate. That is the only way in which I can describe it.</p>

<p><a name="08060392000013"></a>I do not suppose that the noble Baroness will be minded to concede the amendment&#151;it would be a record if she were to do so; we would strike one up on the board and think, &#147;Whoopee&#148;&#151;but I ask her to take it away and get it properly and legally considered. My concern is the same as that of the noble Baroness, Lady Ford, and my noble friend Lord Eccles. What will happen if something goes to judicial review with the clause as it is worded? I really would like this to be very well tested by professional lawyers before we go any further with the Bill in its present form. I ask the noble Baroness to take that request away. Perhaps she already has a legal opinion&#151;I do not know; I see a piece of paper coming forward. If she has not, it would be good if she could do that and, when she has the result, circulate it to Members of the Committee. This is an extremely serious matter, and every Member of the Committee would welcome an authoritative answer. I am not sure whether I am prepared to take the view of those who drafted the Bill on this, because &#147;They would say that, wouldn&#146;t they?&#148;. I would want an independent view, if at all possible.</p>

The judicial review issue clearly pertains to the present wording, but I shall be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s defence. I only throw into the pot something I have mentioned in at least one other context, the definition of an act of God in Blackstone&#146;s<I> L</I><I>egal</I><I> Dictionary</I>: an act which no reasonable man would expect God to commit.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08060392000015"></a>The Minister knows, because I have already had a conversation with her, that during the Question put to her yesterday in the Chamber by the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, about Otmoor, my mind went to the fact that the chequered field pattern there was the genesis of and inspiration to Lewis Carroll for Alice&#146;s adventures. There is a strong Lewis Carroll element to the wording of Amendments Nos. 44 and 45 moved by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves. If the purpose of legislation is to be pellucid, I am not sure that it is as yet. It is currently worded in a matter of which Humpty Dumpty in those adventures would wholly approve.</p>

<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC21"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column GC21</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80603-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08060392000017"></a>On Amendment No. 43, I entirely take the point on which Members of the Committee have challenged me: why do we need what appear to be wide powers? Why is the language as it is? The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, also asked whether this is subject to legal test, whether we are sure that this is the right language and where the boundaries are. I can answer that fairly simply. Essentially, there are limits in the legislation and existing public law to prevent the HCA from exploiting what could certainly be seen to be sweeping powers. There are four reasons for things being as they are, which I shall outline before I come back to the points raised by other Members of the Committee. I am particularly conscious that there is in some sense support for the amendment around the Committee, not least from my noble friend Lady Ford.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08060392000018"></a>First, Members of the Committee are aware that a statutory body such as the HCA can only use the powers it is given in legislation. If they are not wide or competent enough, the body could unintentionally act ultra vires: outside its powers. I take the point about explaining this in simple language, a challenge I put to my officials as well; I am not a lawyer. In short, Clause 3 works with the rest of the powers in Part 1 to ensure that the HCA is at no risk of acting outside its powers.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08060392000019"></a>Secondly, this is a standard provision in this sort of legislation, which creates a non-departmental public body. For example, the Urban Regeneration Agency was given this power in Section 160(1) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993. More recently, Natural England was given it in Section 13(1) of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08060392000020"></a>Thirdly, there are controls on the power. As with other non-departmental public bodies, these powers are given their limit and extent by the objects of the HCA because they can be exercised only for the purpose of the objects or for purposes incidental to those purposes, and by the specific powers that follow in the rest of the Bill. That is where the relationship between Clauses 3 and 4 is important. Some of those specific powers, such as that of compulsory purchase, can be exercised only on the authority or with the confirmation of the Secretary of State, so that is another safeguard. A further safeguard resides in Clause 4(6)(b), which refers to powers in general by stating that,</p>
<ul><a name="08060392000086"></a>&#147;the powers conferred by section 3 must not be used to override a restriction imposed on the exercise of a specific power&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08060392000070"></a>The specific power is the competent power and the general powers cannot be used to override it. For example, Clause 10 restricts the HCA&#146;s ability to dispose of land, while Clause 22 states that the Secretary of State&#146;s consent will be required before financial assistance is given to any person. Those restrictions are not overridden by the general powers in Clause 3. If, for example, the agency wished to fund a bypass in order to unlock a site that currently cannot be developed, it would first have to obtain the Secretary of State&#146;s consent, either generally or specifically, including for the terms and conditions on which the funding is given.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08060392000021"></a>I turn now to the point raised by the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles. He asked about the relationship between these powers and those other opportunities, shall we say, that the Secretary of State has to direct the HCA to do what she thinks strategically is in the national interest. I explained briefly on our first day in Committee that the relationship between the Secretary of State and the department is to set the policy objectives and broad strategy to determine the number of houses we want and so forth, while the HCA is the delivery agent. Clauses 48 to 50 set out the ways in which the HCA can exercise its functions, and those functions are the powers set out in Clause 3 and the specific powers in Part 1. Clause 3 is limited to the HCA&#146;s objects, so anything the agency does under the specific powers in Clause 3 will be subject to the specific opportunities that the Secretary of State has to make directions and so forth. A proportionate and appropriate series of relationships are set out in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08060392000022"></a>Let us look at the effect of the amendment. I should tell the noble Lord that it would be quite harmful. It sounds reasonable by proposing to substitute what is known in law as an objective test, which is that the HCA should take &#147;reasonable actions&#148; in the eyes of the court for the existing subjective test that the agency may,</p>
<ul><a name="08060392000087"></a>&#147;do anything it considers appropriate&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08060392000071"></a>The noble Lord was right to say that there is a test of reasonableness and that we expect the HCA to act reasonably. If in the unlikely event it is perceived to have behaved in a manner that is unreasonable, it could indeed be subject to challenge in public law by way of judicial review. However, the effect of the amendment in substituting an objective test would in fact invite the courts to reopen the decision itself rather than leaving the decision to the HCA. The courts would be in a position to drive down what would be an objective test. That could be exploited by someone opposed, for example, to a useful project such as a housing scheme and would introduce an element of doubt over the nature of the partnership between the private and public sectors, if we are to get anything done within a reasonable timescale. As we have said many times, part of the purpose of the HCA is to make sure that we integrate and co-ordinate, but the amendment would prevent that happening.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08060392000023"></a>I have heard the concerns expressed about the language here, and I am absolutely sure that I can answer the question put to me by the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith. Yes, this is legally tested and watertight. However, we will look to see whether there is any alternative wording that might not raise the sort of concerns we have heard. I cannot in any sense promise that we will be successful. I will take it away to see whether there is something that we can address and come back to on Report.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08060392000024"></a>There is the even more challenging question about how to explain the relationship between Clauses 3 and 4, raised by Amendments Nos. 44 and 45. I will do my best, but I might have to resort to writing. It is one of those legal formulas that are necessary for clarity in the face of the law and legal challenge, but it is not

The amendment has the potential to restrict the ability of the HCA to deliver what we all want, which is why I cannot accept it.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80603-gc0004.htm"/>


<a name="80603-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08060392000025"></a>I will explain why the general powers are just as important as the specific powers, which reflects what I have just said. The general powers are not somehow going to drive a coach and horses through everything else that has to be done; far from it. Because the HCA can use only the powers given to it&#151;as I have said, we have to make sure that it does not go beyond those powers&#151;Clauses 3 and 4 are very interdependent. They work together with the specific powers in Part 1 to ensure that the powers are proper and complementary. If the HCA had only general powers, by definition it would not be able to undertake specific actions, and the other way round. Clause 3, by giving the HCA a general power to do anything that it considers appropriate in support of its object, effectively fills any gaps that may exist unintentionally in the specific powers in Part 1. It is, if you like, a failsafe opportunity. We cannot foresee situations in which it might be used, but we have to allow for them. It provides the necessary flexibility that we would want to take all its functions across a wide range of ambitions and targets.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08060392000026"></a>Clause 4 has a specific role, because it clarifies the relationship between Clause 3 and the specific powers in Part 1 to make sure that they complement each other and do not cancel each other out or override each other. Subsection (5) clarifies that by providing that the specific powers do not limit Clause 3. We can use Clause 3, as I have said, to fill in some of the gaps, should they be identified. Because the amendment seeks to remove subsection (5), the effect would be that the specific powers in Part 1 could be interpreted as limiting the general power, and it would deny us the opportunity to have the flexibility that we need. It is an important subsection. By its nature, it is rather obscure, but I hope that what I have said will help.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08060392000027"></a>Amendment No. 45 covers the same sort of issue that we are wrestling with, but in a rather more specific context. Clause 4(6)(a) disapplies the HCA&#146;s requirement to exercise its powers for the purposes of its objects where it is exercising any local planning authority functions conferred on it by a designation order under Clause 13. The amendment removes subsection (6). In layman&#146;s language, that means that where the HCA is acting as a local planning authority in relation to all or part of a designated area, those powers have got to be exercised in accordance with existing planning legislation and administrative law principles. The effect of removing subsection (6) from Clause 4 would be that the agency&#146;s exercise of local authority functions would be restricted in any circumstances where its planning laws did not coincide with its objects. The noble Lord might say, &#147;Fine; that is perfectly reasonable&#148;. Unfortunately, it does not actually work like that. Where local authority planning powers are conferred on the HCA in respect of a designated area, it is essential that it fulfils the role of a planning authority, not of a delivery agency, because that is where we may find some genuine conflict in the way in which things would work.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC24"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column GC24</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80603-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08060392000028"></a>For example, imagine that the HCA as a planning authority has to decide on a proposal to deliver a number of houses in a greenbelt location. The proposal is contrary to the development plan and national greenbelt policy. It would not fulfil the requirements of good planning in any sense. As a proposal to increase the supply of housing, just like that, it would not be contrary to the object. It is extremely important that we retain the power so that the primary role of the planning authority does not conflict with the objects of the agency.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08060392000029"></a>I am sure that in exercising its powers, its planning functions, the noble Lord and I are of exactly the same mind in seeking assurance that the agency will operate in exactly the way as any other LPA. That is indeed the case. It will operate like any other planning authority. The amendment would have exactly the opposite effect: whenever the agency operated as a local planning authority, it would be bound to do so within a framework that is fundamentally different from any other local planning authority. Clause 4 has been drafted in terms that ensure that when the HCA operates as a local planning authority, it will have no more or less power than any other authority in the planning system.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08060392000030"></a>I hope that that provides the clarification that the noble Lord sought. The amendments would also delete subsection (6)(b), which prohibits the powers conferred by Clause 3 being used to override a restriction imposed on the exercise of a specific power. Again, that would have very perverse consequences, because the purpose of paragraph (b) is to ensure that the agency does not abuse its powers against the wishes of Parliament. The noble Lord would not want that to be removed.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08060392000031"></a>Finally, I turn to Amendment No. 49A, tabled by the noble Baroness. She asked why we need to do things in this way. I was slightly puzzled by the amendment, which seemed to be aimed at precluding the HCA from using its powers outside Chapter 2 to bring about the more effective use of land, but when she raised her questions, I could see what she was trying to get at.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08060392000032"></a>Perhaps I can explain more about the power to bring about the more effective use of land. Certain pieces of land may not be used as effectively as they could be; if the land was used in different ways, it could provide greater benefit or greater returns. For example, let us think of a centrally located a piece of land that has been derelict. A local community group might have a much better idea for its use, for example, turning it into a community park, with community buildings.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08060392000033"></a>The amendment tabled by the noble Baroness seems to suggest that the HCA should not be able to use the powers conferred on it outside Chapter 2 to do that. That includes Clause 22, which is the crucial clause that allows the HCA to provide financial assistance. It also suggests that all the important powers in Chapter 4&#151;Clause 33, for example, which gives the HCA the power to act to support communities&#151;would not be available. The HCA might also want to act with other relevant persons or bring in other support services under Clauses 46 and 47, but the amendment would preclude it from doing

<p><a name="08060392000034"></a>During Committee in other place, Clause 6 was debated alongside Clause 7, which allows the HCA to provide or facilitate the provision of infrastructure. Assurances were sought that regeneration included social as well as physical development. That is why we provide powers throughout the Bill to bring social and physical infrastructure together. That is why the Bill is framed as it is.</p>

<p><a name="08060392000035"></a>That was a somewhat lengthy explanation, but I hope that it makes it clear. If not, I am happy to write to noble Lords to confirm and perhaps even explain at greater length what I have just said.</p>

As regards my Amendment No. 49A, the noble Baroness is right that &#147;chapter&#148; is the wrong word to use. I should have referred to &#147;part&#148; or perhaps even &#147;Act&#148;. I will come back to that at the next stage because my underlying concern that somehow powers are being given that are not spelt out still remains.</p>

That is reassuring. As regards Clause 4(6)(a) on the designated areas, I tabled the relevant amendment as a probing amendment and the matter has been duly probed. I am entirely happy with the answer that I received. We can discuss whether the HCA ought to have planning powers at all at a later stage. If it is to have them, clearly it has to operate within existing planning legislation, which differs from the objectives stated here. I am grateful for the explanation that was given on that.</p>

<p><a name="08060392000041"></a>However, I am still bewildered by the rest of Clause 4. It seems to me that parts of it are frankly contradictory. I hope that the Minister will look again at the wording to make it easier for most people such as me who are not professional lawyers, or even for some professional lawyers, to understand. Having said that, I am very grateful indeed for the care and attention that the Minister has given these matters and for the contributions of other Members.

<a name="80603-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08060392000057"></a>The noble Earl said: I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 53 and 77. Amendment No. 51 is largely a probing amendment. I have written in brackets on my notes, &#147;depending on the Minister&#146;s responses&#148;. It comes in three parts. The first paragraph obliges the HCA,</p>
<ul><a name="08060392000088"></a>&#147;to consult with, and have regard to the views of, the local authorities&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08060392000072"></a>In other words, it must listen to local authorities. There have already been concerns that the powers of the HCA are too extensive, as discussed on the previous group of amendments, and come at the expense of local authorities. On Second Reading, many noble Lords from all round the Chamber addressed the dangers of top-down government and imposing the will of the Government on local communities. I know that the Minister has recognised the importance of local government and local people in the decision-making process, and on Second Reading stated the importance of local involvement. She and Sir Bob Kerslake recognised that at the useful pre-Committee stage meeting.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08060392000058"></a>We have also heard excellent contributions from the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, on the need for strong leadership and local involvement when dealing with the regeneration of urban areas. Again, that was fully acknowledged by the noble Baroness, so I ask myself in what circumstances there would ever be a need for top-down decision by the Government or the HCA. Is it all just scaremongering?</p>

<a name="80603-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08060392000059"></a>There is an area with potential for top-down decision-making, and that is the 10 proposed eco-towns. The Housing Minister, Caroline Flint, has promised a full consultation so that nothing will go ahead without the backing of local communities. What constitutes the backing of local communities? What if local communities do not want an eco-town? Will the Government, through the HCA&#146;s powers, insist that they go ahead and carry on regardless on the basis that the Government know best? There are already tens of thousands of anti campaigners&#151; 60,000 or 70,000 at the last count, and I believe the number is increasing by 2,000 a day&#151;and the prospect of legal challenges against the building of eco-towns across England. The outcome of the Housing Minister&#146;s full consultation will determine the final 10 sites, but what criteria will be applied to make these judgments? How many locals will have to sign a petition saying no before the Government will think again, or will the approval of the Minister, the developer, the land owner and one man and his dog swing the argument in favour of the new town? Will the Minister&#146;s judgment ride roughshod over local feelings? Will the Government carry on regardless on the basis that they know best? That is the concern.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08060392000060"></a>Critics have claimed that the plans expose the eco-towns scheme as a ruse for allowing housing development to avoid normal planning controls. If I were cynical, I would mention that at least half the 15 sites belong to the MoD, so the Government stand to make hundreds of millions of pounds from the sale of the land. By overriding the planning system, if that is what happens, the sites&#146; values rocket to  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC28"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column GC28</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>development land values. The Government therefore have a vested interest in developing these sites.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08060392000061"></a>According to a recent article in the <I>Sunday Telegraph</I>, the developers of the proposed eco-town site at Curborough, near Lichfield in Staffordshire&#151;incidentally, a former airfield owned by the MoD&#151;have already submitted plans to the local authority, but the plans apparently fail to match the standard set out in the Government&#146;s eco-town prospectus. The article then lists half a dozen or so areas where they fall short. Will the Government, through the HCA, require or encourage the local authority to insist on the developer raising its standards to comply with the Government&#146;s eco-towns prospectus, or will the developer get away with it simply by promising to come back later with environmental features to add to the proposals? If it goes to appeal, will the inspectors back the local authority, or will the overriding desire for new housing water down these green standards?</p>

<a name="80603-gc0004.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000001"></a>Surprising as it may seem, I am not against the principle of eco-towns, provided that they have the support of the locals who have to live with them and provided that they are truly green and sustainable. This part of the amendment is aimed at clarifying how the Government are going to play it. After full consultation, will the Government, through the HCA, listen to local concerns and work with them to achieve the desired number of eco-communities, whether on the Government&#146;s preferred sites or on other sites preferred by the locals, or will the Government bash on regardless and ignore local concerns?</p>

<a name="80603-gc0004.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000002"></a>The second paragraph of the amendment would place an onus on the HCA to recognise,</p>
<ul><a name="080603103000121"></a>&#147;the desirability of preserving gardens and urban green spaces&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080603103000095"></a>I am sure that many noble Lords are aware that often the biggest complaint that people have about new developments in their area, especially in more rural areas, is the so-called phenomenon of garden-grabbing, when a perfectly good house sitting in its own gardens is demolished and a number of new houses are crammed into the space. This can really change the character of an area. Whereas it might be appropriate for urban areas, it is absurd when applied to villages, as such overdevelopment can spoil the way people feel about their street or neighbourhood. It looks cramped and is incongruous.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0004.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000003"></a>I believe that the term &#147;brownfield development&#148; first appeared in PPG3 on housing in 2000. Behind the document was a desire to force planning departments and developers to look at the use of previously developed land before greenfield sites. To this end, local authorities were given targets to meet for the percentage of new housing that was built on brownfield sites. I think it is generally agreed that the principle is good, but, as with everything, the devil is in the detail. It is difficult to argue against the redevelopment of a rundown industrial site in the middle of an urban area, which has the double benefit of sorting out the eyesore and protecting an alternative piece of greenfield land.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0004.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000004"></a>The definition does not stop there. The most contentious issue has always been that brownfield now includes garden land. This has led to the garden-grabbing  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC29"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column GC29</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>headlines. When the PPG was introduced, it was clear that the development of brownfield sites was almost impossible to stop. The priority that has been given to such sites was so high that it was almost impossible to mount an argument that would result in the plans being turned down on appeal. If it was brownfield, it got permission&#151;and very soon. With costs being awarded on appeal, local planning authorities had little option but to approve schemes of garden-grabbing.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0004.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000005"></a>The pendulum has swung too far. Schemes that did not enhance the appearance of the area were driven through in this way. Breckland Council, of which I have been a councillor for the past 10 years, has noticed lately that the preservation of the character of the area is now being given more weight by inspectors and we have won some appeals recently on that basis. These tend to be edge-of-settlement sites, which is a good sign, but in village centres, which are equally valuable, developments are still being allowed on appeal. These spaces are equally important to the character and the appearance of the area, not only in visual terms but also for biodiversity reasons. The green corridors through our towns and villages are being lost, with the obvious degradation of the ecology of those areas. The subsequent effects on wildlife are well documented and, at the same time, there can be a reduction in the quality of life and sense of place that people have enjoyed for years.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0004.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000006"></a>Incidentally, there was an item in the news last Friday saying that a recently completed two-year study has concluded that people&#146;s health is improved by being within a green or rural area, including general feelings of well-being and an actual lowering of blood pressure and feelings of stress. I hope the Minister will feel able to look at this subsection with a view to declassifying gardens as &#147;brownfield&#148; and agreeing to preserving urban green spaces. Our Amendment No. 77 would place a duty on the HCA to monitor and promote the re-use of genuine brownfield sites.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0004.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000007"></a>The third sub-paragraph in Amendment No. 51 deals with flooding and I can link it with Amendment No. 53, which can be viewed as an alternative clause. Both would place the Homes and Communities Agency under an obligation to undertake full risk assessments of flooding of any new development. As a result of last summer&#146;s rain, 55,000 properties were flooded, 7,000 people had to be rescued from the flood waters, 5,000 businesses were flooded, 850 schools were damaged, over 100,000 acres of agricultural land were flooded, 13 people died, 600 were injured, almost half a million people were without water or electricity and transport was brought to a standstill; 6,000 people still cannot get back into their houses and l,400 are living in caravans. Last week, we saw flash flooding in Somerset. We are told by the experts that these are not going to be one-off events but part of a worsening trend.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0004.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000008"></a>Over the past 10 years almost 10 per cent of all dwellings built were in designated flood risk areas and, in 2005 alone, over 21 major planning applications were approved against the Environment Agency's guidelines. There is no doubt that we need to take greater care over where we build our houses and if they have to be built on flood plains&#151;such as  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC30"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column GC30</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Thames gateway&#151;then more thought ought to be going into how we build them.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0004.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000009"></a>In response to last summer&#146;s flooding, the Government&#151;I think it was Defra&#151;appointed Sir Michael Pitt to assess what went wrong, what we might do differently as a country and to identify what changes need to take place. Pitt says that flooding is a &#147;blind spot to society&#148; and,</p>
<ul><a name="080603103000122"></a>&#147;that we should be as serious about flooding as we are when it comes to terrorism or pandemic influenza&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080603103000096"></a>An interim report on his findings has been published with 15 recommendations and over 70 interim conclusions. His final report will be published later this summer, once he has had responses from government and non-governmental bodies. I raise the Pitt report as there is an excellent section in it relating to new buildings and how we might do better as a country to avoid the traumas of flooding.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0004.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000010"></a>Although the review reports to Defra, it has a direct bearing on the Department for Communities and Local Government, and the HCA&#146;s remit in particular. I have no doubt that the Minister and the HCA will be looking closely at the final report with Defra and others to see how the recommendations can be implemented as a matter of urgency as part of their joined-up government.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80603-gc0005.htm"/>


<a name="80603-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000011"></a>One of the conclusions is that the automatic right to connect surface water drainage of new developments to the existing sewerage systems should be removed. This automatic right comes from Section 106 of the Water Industry Act 1991, so this part of the legislation will presumably need amending.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000012"></a>The report also highlights the current complex responsibilities for flood risk management and the need for one overarching body to take responsibility. Currently, drainage management is fragmented among a number of bodies that include the Environment Agency, local authorities, water companies, internal drainage boards, the Highways Agency, British Waterways and private watercourse owners. When something goes wrong, it is all too easy for these bodies to point the finger at each other and say that one of the others is responsible. Indeed, the Secretary of State accepts that,</p>
<ul><a name="080603103000123"></a>&#147;a lot of disparate organisations have responsibility for different bits of the surface water drainage system&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080603103000097"></a>A number of organisations, including the Environment Agency, I believe, supports having one body responsible for all aspects of flood risk.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000013"></a>Incidentally, I understand that the Environment Agency has changed its policy from flood defence to flood risk management. Noble Lords will forgive the pun, but that is a watering down of its resolve in this area. Sir John Harman, the chairman of the Environment Agency, has written a response to the interim review conducted by Sir Michael Pitt stating:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080603103000113"></a>&#147;Some recommendations and interim conclusions require action from us in areas that are not covered by our current legal responsibilities&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080603103000098"></a>He goes on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080603103000114"></a>&#147;Urgent review and consolidation of flood risk management legislation will, however, be needed if your recommendations are to be turned into action. Consideration by Government of a new

</ul>
<p><a name="080603103000099"></a>Here are just two examples of where the Government will need to amend existing legislation if they are serious about dealing with the risks of flooding.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000014"></a>Chapter 4 of the Pitt review deals with the obvious concerns about the large number of properties currently at risk of flooding&#151;95 per cent of Hull is at or below sea level&#151;and the probability of further significant development in flood risk areas. He concludes that there is a need to strengthen and reinforce the provisions of PPS 25 and the building regulations to ensure that flood resistance and resilience measures are fully built into all new developments where necessary. The aim of proposed new subsection (1)(c) is to ensure that the Department for Communities and Local Government works with other departments and bodies to change the rules, regulations and legislation where appropriate, as recommended by the Pitt review as a matter of urgency, and to oblige the HCA to undertake full risk assessments of flooding to any new development. I beg to move.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="080603103000115"></a> After Clause 7, line 5, after second &#147;the&#148; insert &#147;principal&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80603-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000016"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak also to the other amendments included in this group, in which I have three amendments. Amendments Nos. 51A and 53A seek to amend the paragraph in the noble Earl&#146;s proposed new clause that deals with flooding. However, Amendment No. 51B appears in this group by mistake. We seem to have spent many hours looking at groupings over the past fortnight and I do not know why Amendment No. 51B has been included here. However, it is not the fault of the Government; it is mine. In fact, the issues it covers will be dealt with when we come to the amendments dealing with planning, particularly those tabled by my noble friend Lady Hamwee. Therefore, I shall not speak to Amendment No. 51B at all.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000017"></a>The new clause being proposed by the noble Earl is interesting in that it covers a number of issues. I shall speak to the first two paragraphs briefly before I move on to the flooding business. I entirely support the aims of the first part of the amendment, which deals with local authorities. Clearly, the HCA should consult with and have regard to the views of local authorities. That is vital. If the HCA does not work with local authorities, it will be a recipe for conflict and the system will not work. It will be interesting to hear the Minister&#146;s response and whether they think that it worthwhile putting this in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000018"></a>The second part of the amendment in relation to gardens and urban green spaces is a bit of a digression. It is more of a digression than was the rural amendment. In most cases, the HCA will not be particularly involved in the details of giving planning permission for what are, by their very nature, small local developments in gardens. There may be larger developments in urban green spaces where people may build, for example, football stadia. Even so, this matter is for local planning authorities. It is for them  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC32"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column GC32</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to be sufficiently robust in their local plans, and in their local development plan as a whole, to be able to deal with this matter. Those local authorities which say that they have no option but to give planning permission really should look at their own plans, although there have been cases where they have been overridden on appeal. I am not sure that this proposal belongs in this Bill, although it gives a useful opportunity to raise the question.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000019"></a>The noble Earl referred to genuine brownfield sites. The issue here is that often, over the past 20 to 30 years, a local authority has demolished a building&#151;a factory, a mill, an area of dereliction or whatever&#151;and has spent money tidying the area up and making it into a pleasant site. Local people now may think that it is a greenfield site because there is grass growing on it and, consequently, that it is green belt, which obviously is not the case. Some sites are genuinely brownfield sites, in the sense that 25 years ago they were railway sidings, the site of an old mill or whatever, which have been regarded as a local amenity patch since then. When a site changes from being brownfield to a green urban space is a matter of judgment. That can pose an interesting question, but these matters should be resolved at the local level and not by the HCA.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000020"></a>Flooding is a much wider issue than just the projects that the HCA will look at, although by their very nature HCA projects will tend to be larger scale and may be therefore of real significance. I was able to take part in a short debate a couple of weeks ago, which was sponsored by the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, when we were able to go into some of these issues. We have to be very careful not to use phrases like &#147;a presumption against all developments on flood plains&#148;. Development on flood plains is not necessarily a bad thing, although it can be.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000021"></a>The key words in the noble Earl&#146;s second amendment are &#147;resilient and resistant&#148;. Appropriate development can increase the resilience and resistance to flooding or can reduce damage from flooding because it can change the physical arrangements on a flood plain. What matters is whether it is possible to deal with flood risks at all levels; be it a high, medium or low risk. If there are flood risks, the development and the way in which it takes place should deal with those risks in a sensible way.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000022"></a>If you have a choice whether to develop on a flood plain or elsewhere, the odds are that you will develop not on the flood plain, but that does not mean that all development on flood plains is automatically bad just because we are now getting more flooding. The view is gaining ground in this country, especially in some parts of the press, that developing on flood plains is automatically a bad thing. That is not the case. We must develop in a sensible way in sensible places and use that development to manage the hydrological system on the flood plain. That is the purpose of my amendment.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000023"></a>My other amendment merely queries whether the Government really meant to include parish councils, but that is a fairly minor matter, so I shall not pursue

What matters is appropriate, resilient and resistant development, rather than no development at all, and setting up schemes in flood plains to hold water much more than is done now in some places to prevent flooding downstream. That is development of a sort, so development per se is not to be discouraged. What is to be discouraged is inappropriate development. I beg to move.</p>

<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC34"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column GC34</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>president of the Campaign to Protect Rural England and as a resident of south Warwickshire, where one of the so-called eco-towns will be situated, if they are ever built. I take issue with the term &#147;eco-town&#148;, as did the noble Earl. It is a catch-all label used to make something a little bit greener when it may not necessarily be all that green. I prefer the term satellite commuter town, because that is really what they are.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000037"></a>The noble Baroness will probably be aware that the proposals to build eco-towns&#151;I am really speaking about the Long Marston eco-town in Warwickshire&#151;have attracted strong local resentment and hostility at individual and local authority level. That is for all sorts of reasons, but the one I want to dwell on is the question of consultation raised in the amendment. The original proposal to create 15 new satellite community towns was never properly put out for consultation. The decision was taken without consultation. There was no consultation on the Government&#146;s decision to have &#147;about five&#148; eco-towns&#151;the position in one of their papers in May 2007. In September 2007, again without consultation, that was doubled to 10 eco-towns. There was no consultation on the selection of the 15 eco-towns on what is now called the shortlist, and no reasons were given as to why those 15 towns were chosen above any of the others listed.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000038"></a>More importantly, and directly relevant to this amendment, the Government did not consult the relevant planning authorities or other statutory consultees on whether the selected sites complied with the statutory development plans. That seems absolutely extraordinary, which is why this part of the amendment should be in the Bill; otherwise, the HCA will simply be top-down and do whatever it wants, as covered in one of the earlier amendments.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000039"></a>The noble Baroness may be aware&#151;if not, she will be now&#151;that both the relevant district councils, Stratford-Upon-Avon and Wychaven, voted unanimously about 10 days ago not to put forward for planning approval the proposal for an eco-town at Long Marston, which has been quaintly renamed Middle Quinton. How does that square with the obligations that the Government have set out in various codes of practice, in their statutory requirements and in the Cabinet&#146;s code of practice on consultation; or with the Secretary of State&#146;s claim in a press release on 20 May that,</p>
<ul><a name="080603103000124"></a>&#147;the selection of eco-towns&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="080603103000100"></a>is&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="080603103000125"></a>&#147;not a secretive process where decisions will be taken behind closed doors, but one that will be absolutely open and transparent ... Is this a good location or not? What other facilities would the community need? Where should the transport links be placed? Your views on this are vital&#151;because this is the future of your community we are talking about&#148;?</ul>
<p><a name="080603103000101"></a>That was the right honourable Caroline Flint.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000040"></a>I am afraid that so far rather the reverse has happened with eco-towns. There has been no transparency and very little consultation. The Government, in their own planning policy paper, PPS 1, have said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080603103000116"></a>&#147;More effective community development is a key element of the Government&#146;s planning reforms. This is best achieved where there is early engagement&#148;.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="080603103000102"></a>We have not had early engagement; we have not any engagement.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000041"></a>The same document says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080603103000117"></a>&#147;Plans should be drawn up with community involvement and present a shared vision and strategy of how the area should develop to achieve more sustainable patterns of development&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080603103000103"></a>That simply has not happened. I can currently speak only for the Middle Quinton development, but I know, having made contact with the subjects of other proposals, that people there feel equally out of the loop on government consultation. They have little information, and no visits from Ministers, to show them the disadvantages of these proposals.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000042"></a>It is important to use this example to support the amendment, because the intentions may well be there but I am afraid that they do not seem to be happening in terms of facts on the ground. I hope that the noble Baroness will be able to respond to some of the concerns expressed, in particular about the lack of consultation over these so-called eco-towns.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000043"></a>I also take this opportunity to add my voice to the request of the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, on the question of claw-back on the increased value of MoD land. Long Marston&#151;or Middle Quinton, to give it its preferred name by the developers&#151;is MoD land. I am sure that if it is developed, there will be a claw-back, but perhaps the noble Baroness could confirm for the record that the Government will get a cash benefit if MoD land is developed for eco-towns. However, is there not the faintest whiff of the banana republic about this? If the Government are going to benefit financially from giving developers planning permission in the teeth of strong local opposition, there is something a little strange about it; I shall not use the term &#147;banana republic&#148;. It does not resonate terribly well with the people who are involved. With those words, I reiterate my support for the amendment and ask the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, to consider bringing it back on Report so that it is put into the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="080603103000044"></a><a name="80603-gc0005.htm_spnew14"></a><b><a name="80603-gc0005.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="080603103000149"></a>Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville:</b> I thoroughly support the amendment proposed by my noble friend Lord Cathcart, and I should like to add one footnote. The year 2000 may be the first instance of the term &#147;brownfield&#148; being used in legislation or guidance, but it has an older pedigree in strategic and tactical debate. I recall that many years before 2000 a firm was established in my constituency which published a regular newsletter called the <I>Catalyst</I> and offered site-soil analysis services as a preface to planning and site use. Brownfield was very much part of the jargon even then.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000045"></a>I support absolutely what my noble friend and others have said about gardens. There is an element of coincidence in that the noble Lord, Lord Howarth of Newport, who unusually is not in his place, was in another era the Member of Parliament for Stratford-upon-Avon. Although my noble friend Lord Cathcart alluded to gardens in a rural capacity, however one places Stratford-upon-Avon in that regard, my understanding is that the gardens issue is wholly live there. In what is an iconic town, the deleterious effect  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC36"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column GC36</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the development of gardens is very noticeable. However, that is a coincidence.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000046"></a>On flooding, my former neighbour, the retired disabled agricultural labourer to whom I alluded earlier and who was the oldest person in our hamlet who had been born there, said of a private housing development two villages away that, &#147;They&#146;ll rue the day. There&#146;s always been flooding there&#148;, and of course they have. The opportunity cost of maintaining ancient rural knowledge and country lore through the disappearance of farm labourers is worth a parody or even a threnody of Thomas Hardy or AE Housman&#146;s <I>A Shropshire Lad</I>. At the other end of the spectrum from my retired disabled agricultural labourer neighbour, I recall the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, who is normally the soul of geniality and good sense, having one of his rare sense-of-humour failures when on one occasion yet another noble Lord raised the flood risks in the Thames Gateway, where so much housing development has been contemplated and where there does seem to be an element of perversity on which I am sure the Minister will be able to set our minds at rest.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000047"></a>The professional advice on the flood risk, however, seems to be pretty comprehensive. I see a virtue in the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, on the subject of floodplains. Amendment No. 77 is a happy antidote to the gardens problem already described. Moreover, in an era of climate change, it is a potential stimulus to the employment expansion of the expertise to which I referred in the initiative in my former constituency.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000048"></a>Finally, I turn to the caveats that the Minister, Caroline Flint, expressed, to which my noble friend alluded. I think that I am at this moment the only person in the Committee who has served in the other place. The noble Lords, Lord Graham and Lord Howarth, have and they have contributed to other parts of the debate. But there is no moment that a constituency Member of Parliament dreads more than when you are having a meeting on a contentious issue and a person at the back, who almost certainly you recognise, raises the one question that you do not want raised. At a meeting which was reasonably placid until that moment, you can watch the infection run contagiously the whole way around the room. Therefore, if the Minister, Miss Flint, has given the assurances she has, all I that I can say is that I hope that she is not too often on the platform when the disagreeable question is asked.</p>

Over the years, we have had a progressive tightening of housing densities. In the good old, bad old days when life was civilised, when I first began in local government, and my noble friend first began in the business of government in the other place, 10 houses per acre was considered to be high-density development. But now, the standard has been raised to 50 houses per hectare, which is 20 houses per acre, which gives rise to a lot of the pressures and reactions that we are hearing about.

This is a real issue; perhaps the noble Baroness would take it into consideration in her response or give it some thought and come back later. It relates very much to the amendments tabled by my noble friend.</p>

First, I shall turn to consultation and then address back gardens, green spaces and flooding. I made it clear at Second Reading&#151;I do not think that Members of the Committee are in any doubt about our sincerity&#151;that there is no way in which the Homes and Communities Agency will achieve its very ambitious, necessary targets if it does not work in partnership with local authorities.

The invitation went out; we had 57 responses; and we made a judgment on which of those 57 were sustainable. The majority were rejected because they did not show evidence of innovation and sustainability. We are still at a very early stage. These are potential sites; we have to look at each of them to

They must be something that the local community owns, is involved with and is committed to.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000055"></a>The noble Lord will know that we are now consulting on the 15 potential sites&#151;it is sites, not schemes, that we are looking at. That consultation is proceeding alongside an extensive sustainability appraisal and an attempt to draw out a policy statement that will be a planning document to determine whether the criteria that we want for eco-towns will be fully met. If they are not met at the final stage, the planning application will not be sustainable. It will have to meet the material consideration of the planning document, along with everything else, including the development plan.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000056"></a>If a current development plan is not there because the LDF is not ready, the old plan will guide our judgment, as will the regional spatial strategies. The whole point about eco-towns is that they are part of the planning process; they are not extra to or alongside it. I heard what that the noble Lord said about how people feel that they have not been consulted in that instance; I hope that they have. Consultation is of the essence of our planning system and we prepare for it in every way. Consultation is built into all the different stages. It can take different forms. Bidders should be offering their plans in detail to the local community to be scrutinised, challenged and interrogated and local authorities should be doing their job of informing local people about the choice in front of them.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000057"></a>That is the beginning of the process; nothing is a fait accompli. When those decisions are eventually made&#151;I have no idea how many there will be, there could be five, none of us have any idea at this stage&#151;there will be opportunities throughout the process for local people to have their say.</p>

When the policy paper was issued, there was no consultation about whether there should be eco-towns, there was simply some sort of consultation about what they should be. The decision appeared to have been taken that there would be five and then 10 eco-towns. Is the position still that there will be 10 eco-towns? Secondly, the noble Baroness said that local authorities and local people must be involved, but the consultation process ends on 30 June. Two local authorities have stated their position, reflecting the wishes of the people in their community. Does that count for anything in the Minister&#146;s thinking?</p>

On the other point, of course local involvement counts. All the responses that we get from local authorities will be taken seriously. They are an important part of the debate, an important signifier, and will be taken into account. On the question of whether there will be eco-towns, we have said that there will be five by 2016 and up to 10 by 2010. That is where the policy sits.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000060"></a>The point that I want to make is central to the debate as a whole. We need to go back to the principle that planning has always been an accommodation of local and national interests. We have in the HCA an opportunity for the first time to give local authorities a single point of contact&#151;a single conversation. That means that throughout the process we listen very carefully to what people are saying. It cannot be otherwise.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000061"></a>Back gardens are an equally sensitive issue. Simply, I cannot improve very much on what the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, said. We have a special regard for all aspects of green space. PPS 17, which I am sure we will talk about, deals with planning for open spaces, sport and recreation, and sets out guidance and the expectation that local planning authorities will protect all open spaces that communities need.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000062"></a>In PPS 3, on planning for housing, we have for the first time put a new emphasis on the importance of green spaces alongside the importance of access to gardens and housing developments. Nothing has changed for many years in the powers of local authorities to protect gardens. The classification of gardens as brownfield sites goes back to the 1990s. Local authorities have exactly the same powers that they have always had to draw up policies that protect gardens.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000063"></a>PPS 3 gives local planning authorities even greater flexibility on the kind of housing that they wish to see in their areas. It strengthens the tools that local authorities already had under previous policy to turn down inappropriate developments on former residential or garden land. That means that local authorities can set strong and specific local policies that protect gardens in particular areas. For the first time, they can set brownfield targets that apply only to back gardens. They can separate them from other forms of brownfield sites such as derelict land, and can identify the need for gardens and other green spaces in plans for new developments.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000064"></a>I do not dispute that there is a lot of pressure on local authorities these days, but any local authority worth its salt can draw up a specific policy for the protection of gardens, which many have done. There is nothing to stop them doing so. If we were to reclassify them, we would have to take issue with the whole notion of curtilage. I will not weary the Committee with why that is a problem. I am prepared to write a very long letter about the history of curtilage&#151;the relationship between land and buildings&#151;but all I can say is that if you try to reclassify it, you might end up with never being able to extend your house to build a granny annexe. It would cause a lot of problems for people who wanted to make responsible and appropriate changes. I take the point that local authorities must be challenged, if necessary, to take care of these sorts of issues.</p>

<p><a name="080603103000065"></a>I shall deal with flood assessments and Amendment No. 77 at the same time. I have unusually harsh words for the amendment, which is a mixture of the unnecessary and the confusing. It is unnecessary because English Partnerships already performs this task and will continue to do so. The National Land Use Database aims to provide an inventory of the  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC40"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column GC40</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>national stock of vacant and/or derelict land and buildings. Its objective is to provide a consistent and comprehensive up-to-date record of previously developed land and buildings in England that are available for development. I am glad to say that we already have this in hand.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000066"></a>The amendment confuses the brownfield argument. Previously developed land is of course a priority for housing in PPS 3. We have exceeded our national targets. We had a target of the 60 per cent development of brownfield land, and we are now reaching 75 per cent, which is very good. That does not, however, mean using brownfield land at all costs. Developments may be more sustainable in greenfield sites. For example, if a hypothetical application comes in for a care home on a greenfield site at the edge of a market town, where the residents can walk to the local shops, bus station or whatever, there is an argument that that is a more sustainable and appropriate site than building a home on a brownfield site with no access to shops, services and community. So you cannot be categorical and say &#147;brownfield better; greenfield worse&#148; every time. That is the problem of categorising brownfield in this way.</p>

<p><a name="080603103000069"></a>Flooding is an important issue and the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, powerfully raised the issue of its impact. We put forward up to &#163;180 million to try to help with some of those tragic situations; that is vital. The point about PPS 25 is that it gives us, for the first time, a hierarchy of risk, which we identify in terms of where we can build with modification. How do we assess the nature of the risk and what do we have to do? As the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has said, you cannot not build on flood areas in this country; you must assess the risk. That is where the Environment Agency comes in. PPS 25 gives us a much more accurate tool than we have ever had before.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000070"></a>In addition, the Environment Agency crucially works closely with local authorities, which must do the flood assessment with it; that cannot be the job of the HCA. I take the noble Lord&#146;s point, however, that we must make a proper response to the Pitt report.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000071"></a>I am conscious of time. In conclusion, I say to the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, that density is an issue. It exacerbates all the issues we are talking about. However, the challenge is to build for higher densities and include space; think of the Italian piazzas or Kensington crescent. We can do that with intelligence.</p>

I am sorry that the noble Lord is not in his place, but to put it as he did, in terms of a degree of exploitation, was unnecessary and inaccurate. I hope that, after that long debate, the noble Earl will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="080603103000073"></a><a name="80603-gc0006.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80603-gc0006.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="080603103000156"></a>Earl Cathcart:</b> That was a very long and useful debate. On the first amendment on eco-towns, no doubt the Minister read in the press about the noble Lord, Lord Rogers of Riverside&#151;who was chairman of the Government&#146;s urban taskforce or something&#151;talking about eco-towns a couple of days ago:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080603103000118"></a>&#147;I think eco-towns are one of the biggest mistakes the government can make ... They are in no way environmentally sustainable&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080603103000105"></a>He went on to say that the Government should concentrate on the regeneration of towns and cities, rather than developing greenfield sites. He then cited the US Green Building Council, which apparently demonstrated that building more accommodation in a dense urban centre was far more efficient than an eco-home on a greenfield location. He went on to say that there is a need to increase the density around public transport, not creating a new town where you must then create a new transport system. Urban areas already have transport systems and infrastructure in place. By building your eco-communities in an urban setting, you are making use of the facilities and the infrastructure that are already there. I will come back to infrastructure in a moment.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000074"></a>There is an odd argument here. When food prices are going up and we are talking about world food shortages, why are we building on agricultural land? Some of the building will be on MoD land, but why are we building on agricultural land? We should not be doing that. We need our agricultural land to produce food. It cannot be a green, sustainable answer to concrete over our most productive arable land in order to create communities. We live in an increasingly wasteful, throw-away society. Some 750,000 or one million homes are empty. Why are we not concentrating on those? What will be the unit cost per house in an eco-town? It will probably be &#163;80,000 or so per house. What is the cost per unit of getting an empty home back into use? It is probably a quarter of that figure. Given that the Government have a finite amount of money available over the next three years, I argue that their money would be much better spent in ways other than building eco-towns. I think that the sum of &#163;8 billion was mentioned the other day with regard to the money that the Government will allocate to providing affordable housing. At &#163;80,000 a shot, that is 100,000 new homes over the three-year period. If that finite amount of money were allocated to getting empty homes back into use at, say, &#163;20,000 a shot, you immediately have not 100,000 but 400,000 homes in use. That might be a better way to use that money. There are other ways of dealing with this.</p>

Amendment No. 53B seeks to make clear what I understand to be the case from a number of comments already made by the Minister; namely, that compulsory powers are not to be granted in a general fashion, but only for specific cases. If that is so, this is one occasion where that assurance should see its way quite explicitly into the Bill. The use of compulsory powers is a serious matter, and having read this clause a number of times, I can see that it could be read as meaning only on a case-by-case basis, but it could also be read as meaning the grant of powers&#151;I do not know if this is an appropriate use of the phrase&#151;in extenso; rather more than case by case in any event.</p>

<p><a name="080603103000087"></a>Amendment No. 54A, which is grouped, is an amendment to the schedule that deals with compulsory acquisition and is a somewhat narrower point. In what will be new Section 8 of the 1965 Act, substitute Clause (2)(b)(i) and (ii) states that there is,</p>
<ul><a name="080603103000127"></a>&#147;material detriment to the land&#148;</ul>

I hope that I am not being too telegraphic here because I am trying to be as quick as possible. It strikes me that the language used is different, but I am not sure what is meant by those differences. I beg to move.</p>

The first amendment relates to the exercise of the HCA&#146;s compulsory purchase powers. Clause 9(2) sets out that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080603103000120"></a>&#147;The HCA may acquire land compulsorily if the Secretary of State authorises it to do so&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080603103000110"></a>The amendment moved by the noble Baroness seeks to ensure that the Secretary of State&#146;s authorisation can be given only for specific cases. I hope that I can reassure her that the amendment is not required. Compulsory purchase orders can only be applied to land specified in the order. Individual CPOs must be submitted to the Secretary of State for confirmation, and I can assure the Committee that nothing in the Bill will change that. The Secretary of State will not be able to give the HCA a general consent to make CPOs as and when it pleases; they would relate very specifically.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="080603103000089"></a>Amendment No. 54A concerns the compulsory purchase of land belonging to a house. The law as it stands, which I am sure the noble Baroness understands better than me, addresses the situation in which a local authority wishes to compulsorily purchase only part of or a piece of land, perhaps consisting of a park or garden attached to a house, while the owner is able and willing to sell the whole of the relevant land, including the house. According to the current legislation, if the local authority is to be required to purchase all the land, the Lands Tribunal needs to be satisfied that the land cannot be purchased,</p>
<ul><a name="080603103000131"></a>&#147;without seriously affecting the amenity or convenience of the house&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080603103000111"></a>The same provision, including the &#147;seriously affecting&#148; test, is made for the HCA in Schedule 2, so we plan to carry over what is currently there.</p>

<p><a name="080603103000090"></a>I think that the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, was after something rather different from what we initially understood she was seeking to achieve from the amendment. As I understand it, the noble Baroness wanted to secure the difference between &#147;material detriment&#148; and &#147;seriously affecting&#148;. That is a very technical point about appropriate levels of compensation. I would like to take that issue away and examine it so that we can put in writing for her something that explains exactly how we see that technical point and how we judge that difference. I do not want to put something on the record today that is not helpful. I think she is trying to be helpful in seeking clarification with her amendment.</p>

That may even have been prompted partly by the noble Baroness, which might in part answer the noble Lord&#146;s earlier question.</p>

<p><a name="080603103000112"></a>and &#147;material detriment&#148; to the land, and I sent it to his office, because I hoped that that would make it clear what I was after. I am conscious that officials trying to understand amendments that have been put down must have to go through all sorts of mental hoops. I would rather reduce those and be clear. If there is any other mechanism that the Government can suggest for those of us who are raising points that are nearer the technical and political end, I would be very happy to use that mechanism. It is a waste of everyone&#146;s time, and it must sometimes be a waste of officials&#146; energy.</p>

<p><a name="080603106000006"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 54 is grouped with Amendment No. 65, which is a useful  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC45"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column GC45</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>amendment tabled by my noble friend Lady Miller, and Amendment No. 66 in my name. The amendments are about commons and village and town greens and how the legislation interacts with them&#151;and possibly existing legislation.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000007"></a>Amendment No. 54 is a probing amendment to find out how the Government see the HCA operating in relation to land that it acquires. As the HCA does not currently exist, I assume that &#147;acquire&#148; means all the commons and greens that it will possess in the future. If it does not, it is still a probing amendment to find out to what extent the HCA will have to abide by the provisions of the Commons Act and other legislation relating to commons, over land that it owns, including areas subject to designation orders, or whether it will be different. It does not seem that long since some of us spent time in this Room discussing the details of the Commons Bill, as it then was and, as inevitably happens on these occasions, becoming temporary experts in the subject. When it crops up again two years later, you have to remember what it was all about.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000008"></a>The Commons Act 2006 is an important piece of legislation that sets out in great detail a series of provisions relating to common land and town and village greens, including what can be done on them, development rules and restrictions, acquisition and disposal, relevant regulations and so on. It is generally regarded as a good piece of legislation that brings common land legislation up to date.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000009"></a>If the Housing and Communities Agency owns common land, either because it is part of a development it is acquiring land for or if it is part of an area in which it becomes greatly involved as the designated planning authority, will it be bound by the normal rules and regulations relating to common land or can it ride roughshod over them because of its special status? That is the fundamental question to which Amendment No. 54 seeks an answer. The response will let us know whether we need to take the matter further at a later stage.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000010"></a>My second amendment is much more technical, which I think I have understood. It has been researched and put to me by the Open Spaces Society, a voluntary group of experts on commons, and I should declare an interest as an ordinary member. Clause 9(4), (5) and (6) set out the basic provisions relating to commons. Clause 9(5) refers to:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080603106000100"></a>&#147;The power under subsection (2) to acquire land compulsorily includes the power to acquire land compulsorily for giving in exchange for the land or (as the case may be) new rights mentioned in subsection (4)(a)&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080603106000094"></a>It may be necessary, as part of a large development, to take part of a common or green. The amendment would make provision for exchanged land to continue to provide the amenity of that common land in the future, although it might be different land. An area of common might be taken from one place and replaced with another area elsewhere. That is a well understood procedure, and the Commons Act clearly sets out how it should be carried out. However, the advice I have received states that if this is read in conjunction with Clause 9 on the acquisition of land and with Schedule 2 1(1) on the application of the Acquisition of Land Act 1981, the result is that if open space must be  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC46"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column GC46</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>acquired compulsorily, Section 19 of the 1981 Act will apply. Section 19 states that, subject to minor exceptions, the Secretary of State must be satisfied that equivalent land is provided in exchange. If it is not, it may have to be subject to the special parliamentary procedure. At the moment the Bill says that if the HCA compulsorily acquires common land, equivalent land must be provided, possibly by a CPO or other means, in order to provide replacement common land. However, if a local authority owner of an open space should be willing to dispose of the land by agreement, the safeguard is bypassed and there is no requirement under existing legislation to obtain adequate and suitable replacement land. That appears to be re-enacted in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000011"></a>Amendment No. 56 is therefore based on Section 229 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, which states in a simplified form that even if the land was acquired voluntarily and with the agreement of the previous owners&#151;we should remember that commons are owned by people&#151;the fact that it is a common relates to its status, not to the ownership of it. If the owners of a common voluntarily hand over or sell the land to the HCA, the replacement land must still be provided. There appears to be a loophole, and I am advised by the Open Spaces Society that there have been a number of instances where common land has been provided by agreement and it has been difficult to secure the replacement of that land somewhere else in the vicinity. That is why I have tabled the amendment.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000012"></a>It will be interesting to hear the Government&#146;s response. This is a very technical matter. The Minister may have the answers already, but if he does not, I would be delighted if he would write to us. It is an important matter. Obviously it will apply only to a few places on a few occasions, but we must be sure that they are dealt with properly in Bills such as this. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="080603106000013"></a><a name="80603-gc0007.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80603-gc0007.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="080603106000113"></a>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> My Amendment No. 65 is grouped with my noble friend&#146;s amendments, and I concur with all his points. We sat through both the Commons Bill, which as he reminded us was only in 2006, and the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Bill, which gave extra protection to town and village greens. My amendment explores why, when the Government brought in legislation that has provided the useful additional protections for those open spaces they very much needed, we are now setting up the HCA which, according to Clause 9, suggests that it can do anything with regard to planning permission and despite all the other enactments.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000014"></a>The Minister will probably reassure me by saying that the HCA will have to pay regard to issues of protection. As drafted and as I read it, provided that the agency accords with planning permission&#151;it is a planning authority as proposed in the Bill&#151;despite all the things we spent ages discussing and agreeing on in your Lordships&#146; House, it can drive a coach and horses through them. I hope that the Minister will tell me that I am wrong about that.</p>

<p><a name="080603106000015"></a>I am very glad that my noble friend raised Section 19 of the Acquisition of Land Act 1981. It is particularly  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC47"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column GC47</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>important because subsection (2) raises the issue of public consultation and the fact that the Secretary of State must give public notice of her intention so that all interested people can make representations and objections in relation to what will happen, and perhaps,</p>
<ul><a name="080603106000103"></a>&#147;causing a public local inquiry to be held in any case where it appears to him to be expedient so to do&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080603106000095"></a>Sometimes the HCA&#146;s proposals will be controversial and people will need to have their say. My noble friend&#146;s rather neat amendment, applying Section 19 at the very least, is a good opportunity to enable this. </p>

<p><a name="080603106000016"></a><a name="80603-gc0007.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80603-gc0007.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="080603106000114"></a>Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville:</b> I rise with my conscience on my sleeve. I played no role whatever in the Commons Bill and I am therefore extremely grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, and the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer. I drove through that village the other day, having gone modestly out of my way out of sheer curiosity about the noble Baroness&#146;s hinterland. I am grateful to them for their vigilance, not least in this instance.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000017"></a>Perhaps I may explain why. The Wiltshire Record Society publishes an annual volume about something of a statistical or historical nature that has occurred in Wiltshire at any time in the past 1,000 years. In 1982, its volume was devoted to the judicial notebook of the magistrate of the hundred, which our village in Wiltshire was, for the years 1744-49. Either the magistrate or his clerk had kept a manuscript note of every one of those cases. Five hundred cases came in front of him during those five years, at the time when the war of the Austrian secession was going on. They were taking about 100 cases a year or a couple of cases a week. The society has 300 subscribers, including four Japanese universities, and prints an edition of 150 volumes which can be bought by the general public on an ad hoc basis. My favourite general knowledge question to people in the village is: what was the most frequent crime in our hundred between 1744 and 1749? The answer was the theft of firewood. It was patently clear that this was entirely due to the enclosures. I am not saying that that would necessarily be the problem in the 21st century, although there are moments when I wonder. Nevertheless, those who protect these spaces are people to whom we are greatly in debt. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s reply.</p>

<p><a name="080603106000018"></a><a name="80603-gc0007.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80603-gc0007.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="080603106000115"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> Yes, this is an interesting point. Perhaps we should fast forward to 1970 and the great Great Bentley referendum on the future of our village green. Yours truly was once pitted against his mother in a debate on whether we should have a village hall built on our common, Great Bentley village green. She lost the argument and I won, and no village hall was built on our village green. Subsequently, it was built on a village allotment. So this is an issue about which I have some strange historical knowledge. Great Bentley village green is the largest village green in England, as my mother always proudly told me, and has been protected since the time of the enclosures, to which the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, made reference. At the time, I did quite a lot of research on this.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000019"></a>This amendment is extremely impressive and one which I rather enjoy. We should thank the noble Lord,  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC48"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column GC48</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord Greaves, for raising this issue because it is important. Our village green is 42 acres and has been there for well over 200 years. The village fought hard to protect its common land when enclosures took place, and rightly so. Today, the issues are different but equally as important. Clearly, the value of open space in any community is very high indeed. This debate is helpful because it enables us to tease out some of the important issues relating to the HCA&#146;s powers over commons, open spaces and allotments. The Government and I share wholeheartedly the determination of noble Lords to ensure that these provisions are absolutely right, and I hope that what I say will not only demonstrate that but perhaps put some minds to rest. It will also give us a period of reflection in which to ensure that we have got right the read-across between different pieces of legislation. Amendments Nos. 54 and 66 tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, and Amendment No. 65 tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, provide us with this opportunity.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000020"></a>It has been rightly argued that allotments, open spaces and commons should be subject to special protection, and attention has usefully been drawn to our earlier debates on commons. The Government agree about the need for protection, and the HCA will not simply be able to seize any land. It will be able to acquire land by agreement between the parties or by compulsory purchase, but only in support of its objectives. Moreover, if it is by compulsory purchase, the Secretary of State will have to confirm the compulsory purchase order. If the agency is compulsorily to acquire any land forming part of an allotment, open space or common, a different statutory procedure to the standard procedure will be used.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000021"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, referred to the Acquisition of Land Act 1981, which is where the procedure is set out. It requires that a compulsory purchase order relating to the purchase of such types of land must be subject to a special parliamentary procedure that includes a public inquiry and the laying before Parliament of its findings. Allotments, public spaces and commons will remain subject to the highest form of protection in respect of compulsory purchase.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000022"></a>As I have said, we are determined to get these provisions right, and it is fair to say that the amendments have prompted my noble friend and I to consider whether there might be a gap in our proposed legislation. The noble Lord made the case that that might be so, and while we do not necessarily share his view, we will double-check. We propose to take another look at the protection of special land in this Bill with a view to ensuring that we do not inadvertently create a loophole that could undermine the protection of such places. If the noble Lord is content to withdraw his amendment, we will come back to the issue on Report, although obviously there will be discussions between now and then. We will ensure that all the necessary protections are in place because we certainly do not want to undermine the value of commons, allotments and open spaces.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000023"></a>My further recommendation is that if you run into trouble with a campaign, you should hold a local

I would like an assurance that that will continue to be the case.</p>

There are two general questions. First, I am not clear at all about whether, if the HCA owns a common as owner, it is or will be subject, either through the Commons Act, regulations, or whatever, to the same regime as any other owner of a common. If it is not, what are the differences? That is the first question, which underlies the first amendment.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000031"></a>On the second amendment, I am grateful for what the Minister said about equivalent land being provided from a compulsory purchase. The question is whether, if land is not compulsorily purchased but purchased by agreement, it is possible to legislate that the same provisions for equivalent replacement land should apply. That question may not be about the HCA at all; it may be about public authorities generally compulsorily purchasing or acquiring commons by agreement for development. Like the other issues that have been raised, the HCA and the Bill offer a convenient opportunity to raise the issue. If the HCA acquires common land by agreement for development, it ought to provide equivalent common land. The advice that I have from the Open Spaces Society is that that is not in the legislation at the moment. Can that therefore be looked at?</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="080603106000102"></a>&#147;The HCA may not dispose of land for less than the best consideration which can reasonably be obtained unless the Secretary of State consents&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080603106000096"></a>This is a probing amendment to try to find out what considerations might be in the mind of the Secretary of State and, equally importantly, that the needs of the community adjacent to the site&#151;it might be a disused commercial site of some sort that the HCA wishes to take over for redevelopment&#151;in particular can be taken into account.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000042"></a>The business value of the site is always very difficult and subjective. I assume the situation to be that, by and large, the Homes and Communities Agency is not in the business of having a major land bank for development in the way in which commercial developers might. If it purchases a site, it will develop it. That is why it has purchased it, and that would be an entirely natural and normal process. One can see that there might be occasions when some of that site would be seen by the local community as somewhere that might give it the opportunity to have a play area or something of that type in the district, which would diminish the best commercial value.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000043"></a>If you said that an area of 50 yards by 50 yards, which is not a big area&#151;it is perhaps two-thirds of an acre&#151;could be set aside on a site for a play area, that is fine. But if that happens to be in an urban area and the alternative development happens to be residential, that site is worth more than &#163;1 million an acre and that bit of ground is worth, say, &#163;0.75 million, which comes off the overall value of the site. It may be in the interests of the community to have that site sold for less than the best value that could be obtained in order that the community could get a real and genuine benefit from it, even though it might affect only a small part of the site.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000044"></a>We tabled the amendment to explore with the Minister&#151;I hope he will not mind my exploring with him in this way&#151;what might be in the mind of the

Clearly, there are circumstances in which the community interest might indicate that the sum that should be obtained for the site should be less than it appears to be in this subsection. I beg to move.</p>

<ul><a name="080603106000104"></a>&#147;assessed having equal regard to social, economic and environmental benefits&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80603-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000046"></a>The issue of best consideration was debated at some length in the Commons, and I want to pick up some of the points from that debate. The Minister said that the restriction on the disposal of land was needed to safeguard the public purse. It seems to me that the thinking has moved on so that the public purse is regarded as being more than just a matter of immediate cash. Looking not very far into the future, &#147;sustainability&#148; covers far more than just cash, but if that is how the Government are thinking, it will achieve cash savings. I am sure that the Government are not as old-fashioned in their thinking as that seems to indicate. I did not want to put into the collective mind of the Government that even if one is looking only in monetary terms at what is best consideration, the criteria and the factors are more than society accepted in the relatively recent past.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000047"></a>Secondly, the issue of general consent was raised. The Secretary of State has the power to give a general consent. Like the noble Lord, I want to know what factors might be in the Secretary of State&#146;s mind, and what comfort the Government could give on the basis of examples since 2003 of when a general consent has been, or could have been, given to local authorities. What is the current thinking on this?</p>

<a name="80603-gc0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000048"></a>My amendment is perhaps a little tougher than the noble Lord&#146;s, and tougher than I am allowing for in these remarks. I am conscious of the time and the need to make progress, and it may be appropriate to come back to the issue of principle on Report, when Members of the Committee have better understood the Government&#146;s thinking on this. Reading <I>Hansard</I>s, I am not thus far persuaded that the Government&#146;s thinking is where I would want to see it.</p>

Will my noble friend the Minister take this away and have a look at current practice in both the Housing Corporation and English Partnerships? These clauses are a step back from how those organisations currently operate. A couple of examples may be of assistance.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000050"></a>When we were trying to pilot community land trusts over the past 18 months, it transpired that the Housing Corporation could have gifted land to the community land trust in question but the Housing Corporation had no land. English Partnerships had land, but could not gift it to the organisations. We were in a really ridiculous situation. A case study

We had hoped that the new organisation would then have the ability to do what neither of us could do for perverse reasons.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000051"></a>The second thing that strikes me about this clause is that English Partnerships disposes of land at less then the best price, and for good reasons. Sometimes, when we&#151;</p>

<p><a name="080603106000052"></a>I am sorry; I should not say &#147;we&#148;. I have not been with that organisation for six months, but after six years I keep saying &#147;we&#148;. When English Partnerships takes land to the market and evaluates the bids for it, it takes explicit account of the quality of those bids. It does not just sell for top dollar so that any old tat is built on land, taking no account of environmental quality standards, space standards or whatever. It takes that land to the market with a clear development brief, and developers know that they have two hurdles to leap. They first have to leap the quality hurdle, and people will look at the best price thereafter. It is not simply a case of writing the biggest cheque to be able to acquire surplus or EP land.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000053"></a>This clause does not currently take account of, first, current practice and, secondly, what we were trying to do in bringing the organisations together. Will my noble friend consider having another look at this? I am now confused about the intent of these clauses.</p>

<p><a name="080603106000054"></a><a name="80603-gc0008.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80603-gc0008.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="080603106000128"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> I have Amendments Nos. 56 and 57 in this group, as an attempt to provide examples of the sort of circumstances in which it might be sensible for the HCA to dispose of land for less than it can get on the market. I am conscious that the Bill refers to the amount that may &#147;reasonably be obtained&#148;. That is altogether too vague a phrase. What may be &#147;reasonably obtained&#148;? Is it simply the amount of money you can reasonably obtain for open sale in the present market conditions? Or does it take into account exactly the kind of issues that the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, usefully raised&#151;this is a very useful set of amendments&#151;that were referred to by my noble friend and the noble Baroness, Lady Ford? If the purpose of the HCA is to achieve regeneration, it has to be put in the same position as English Partnerships is at the moment.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000055"></a>Looking at it from the other end of the tube at a very local level, I know that English Partnerships disposes of land for nothing, in effect, because it puts it into a regeneration package that the public sector can operate. However, the HCA may not be able to do that. I am probing what &#147;reasonably&#148; means and whether it involves taking account of these other factors, but if that is the case it should be made clear because the phrase &#147;best consideration&#148; suggests an approach based merely on economics. Therefore, my Amendment No. 56 is concerned with regeneration schemes and specifically the ability to dispose of land to local authorities that are involved in such schemes in partnership with English Partnerships, and with the HCA in future, as a means of enabling these schemes to go ahead. If the HCA has always to insist on obtaining the maximum value for the land, a lot of these schemes will never go ahead. I cannot believe  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC53"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column GC53</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that is what the Government intend. The wording of the relevant measure seems to be wrong.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000056"></a>My Amendment No. 57 probes whether a reasonable consideration for land takes account of its existing planning status. It is one thing to say what that land is worth given its existing planning status, whether it be housing, industrial or amenity land. However, on the other hand we know that lots of companies in this country will buy land at its present value and &#147;land bank&#148; it on the basis of what they think might happen in 10 or 20 years&#146; time, or over a much longer timescale. Some land banking is very long term indeed. Companies may be prepared to pay over the odds for amenity land if they believe that they can get planning permission for housing on it in 20 years&#146; time. That is exactly what the big development companies do. They put that land in their land bank and register it in their accounts. The value of the land goes up, contributes to their profits and everybody is happy except the local communities because the land is occupied and owned by a company that may not look after it. The company may just sit on it in the hope that at some time in the future it may be able to develop that land.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000057"></a>The purposes of the HCA should be considered as regards disposing of land to local authorities. Further, the HCA should take account of the existing planning status of the land as opposed to its possible planning status in 10 or 20 years&#146; time that speculative purchasers might take account of. If the HCA cannot dispose of land in appropriate ways to appropriate bodies for less than it can get on the open market, it will not be able to do its job.</p>

<p><a name="080603106000059"></a>I am prompted by the debate about best consideration to ask a question that I do not expect the Minister to be able to answer on this occasion, although I should be interested to hear from him if he is able to follow it up. However, the issue may have come up in the debates on best consideration in the Commons, in which case his advisers may have something to add. In listening to the debate about best consideration, I was conscious of the general principle in charity law&#151;I am not a charity lawyer&#151;that the trustees of a charity have a responsibility to secure the best return or the best price for something that belongs to them in the interests of the charity. I wonder whether there are any caveats or considerations in charity law that influence whether the trustees can take something else into account rather than simply the value of the land. As I say, I am perfectly happy to wait until a later stage for an answer to that.</p>

The Minister in the Commons&#151;this picks up on the points that have just been made&#151;made the point about Clause 4(2) providing that the HCA&#146;s powers,</p>
<ul><a name="080603106000105"></a>&#147;are to be exercised for the purposes of its objects&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080603106000097"></a>As the objects&#151;or objectives&#151;of the HCA under Clause 2(1) include securing regeneration, supporting the creation, regeneration or development of communities and their continued well-being and contributing&#151;this might not have been in the Bill when the Minister made the comment&#151;to the achievement of sustainable development, I am puzzled about whether Clause 10(1) overrides those matters, or whether they in fact temper the term &#147;best consideration&#148;. I hope that question is clear.</p>

<p><a name="080603106000061"></a><a name="80603-gc0008.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80603-gc0008.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="080603106000131"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> This has been a very useful debate, and I am grateful to all participants, who have been very helpful, in particular the noble Baroness, Lady Ford, with her experience of English Partnerships. I am sure that most noble Lords will be aware that, in most circumstances, the agency will be able to dispose of land in any way that it considers appropriate in accordance with its objects or objectives. However, Clause 10 carries on the current requirement for English Partnerships and the Housing Corporation, that if the agency wishes to dispose of land that was acquired through compulsory purchase, it must first obtain the consent of the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000062"></a>Clause 50 qualifies that to the degree that it allows the Secretary of State to issue a general consent setting out the circumstances in which the agency may dispose of land without seeking specific consent in each and every individual case. As I understand it, officials have now begun to produce a draft of what that general consent order might look like. Perhaps, as this is Committee, I will outline what it will cover. The four proposed tests will be, first, that the disposal of land is for the purpose of the objects of the Homes and Communities Agency as set out in Clause 2(1) of this Bill; no surprises there. The second test will be the disposal of land meeting value-for-money requirements, which is fairly straightforward. The third point is that disposal of the land does not constitute unlawful state aid under Article 87 of the Treaty of European Community. Fourthly, the unrestricted value of the disposal should not exceed &#163;400 million for disposals undertaken through an open and unconditional bidding procedure, or &#163;5 million for other disposals.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000063"></a>That is some of our thinking, and we are going to consult on that with key stakeholders. That is where we have got to on the general consent regime. I suspect that in most cases the purpose of the amendments is to provide for more detail to be given on how the arrangements will work in practice. I have given some flavour of that, and I hope I can now give assurances that will satisfy noble Lords in this debate.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000064"></a>First, I shall deal with Amendment No 55. This amendment seeks to place an obligation on the Secretary of State when considering whether to give consent to the HCA to dispose of land for less than best consideration to take into account the benefit to the community where the disposal takes place. In a sense, this amendment pushes at an open door. Of  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC55"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column GC55</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>course, that is what the Secretary of State will want to do and the potential benefits will be part of the proper consideration. But I am sure that the Secretary of State will also want to take into account the cost to the community of selling the land for a lower value than could have been reasonably obtained. I should stress also that &#147;best consideration&#148; is a term with a meaning. Generally it is understood to mean the best market value that can be obtained. Case law shows that matters of wider public benefit may be taken into account only if the benefit has a monetary value that can be assessed. We accept this because without it there would be no transparency of process for the public purse.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000065"></a>The amendment refers only to the benefits that may be brought to a community via a less than best consideration land sale and does not make reference to the cost to it of not obtaining the best possible price. What we have to consider is that every pound below best market value is money that does not go towards the wider objectives of the HCA. Given the significant role that the HCA will have in delivering new homes and generating older places, and working with communities to deliver solutions appropriate to the locality and the needs of local people, it is vital that in choosing to sell for less than the best price, the agency is assured that the wider public benefits it obtains as part of that sale at least offset the benefits that it will not be able to deliver elsewhere due to the lower return. On this basis, we think that Amendment No. 55 is unnecessary and that the current balance in the legislation is probably about right.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000066"></a>Amendment No. 55A in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, represents the other side of the same coin. As I understand it, the amendment seeks to ensure that in determining which offer to accept for land, the HCA should give equal weight to the social and environmental benefits of an offer as it does to the economic benefits. The noble Baroness argues that there are circumstances in which gain for the pure best financial value might not be the right thing to do and we do not disagree with that. However, I can offer an assurance that the amendment is unnecessary because, as we believe we have drafted it, Clause 10 already empowers the HCA not to accept the highest bid for its land subject to the Secretary of State&#146;s consent. We do not want unnecessarily to fetter the activities of the HCA by requiring it to come to the Secretary of State on each and every occasion that it considers it can better achieve best value for public money by selling at a lower than best market price. I am sure that when I mentioned Clause 50 earlier, the noble Baroness will have picked up on our intention to create a general consent by setting out where disposal would fit into the specific circumstances without having to seek an individual consent. The general consent can address issues of wider public benefit, including the need to obtain better value for money for the public sector as a whole as well as ensuring proper accounting and reporting responsibilities, and, as I said earlier, compliance with state aid rules, the raison d&#146;être for which is widely understood by Members of the Committee.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC56"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column GC56</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80603-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000067"></a>Finally, I turn to the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, which I think he described as being probing amendments. The purpose of the first of the amendments, Amendment No. 56, would enable the HCA to sell land at less than best consideration or land which it has compulsorily acquired to local authorities for purposes which meet the agency&#146;s objects without seeking the Secretary of State&#146;s consent.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000068"></a>The noble Lord has argued today and on other occasions that local authorities are best placed to meet the needs of local communities and ought as a consequence to be treated as a special case when it comes to purchasing land from the HCA. I do not have any difficulty with the first part of that argument&#151;indeed, my noble friend has assured the Committee that the agency will be working very closely with local authorities and regional partners to identify the best way to deliver those priorities.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000069"></a>However, I cannot agree that the HCA should have a blanket ability to provide subsidised land to local authorities, which would be the effect of the amendment. I see no justification for local authorities to be able to buy cheaply from the HCA, any more than any other organisation providing community benefits. The HCA cannot itself buy land cheaply and would need to be assured that the discount it was offering to a local authority would provide sufficient community benefit to at least offset the benefit that it would not be able to deliver elsewhere due to receiving a lower rate of return.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000070"></a>Moreover, if the HCA wants to sell land at lower than market price to a local authority because of wider public benefits in pursuit of its objectives, it may do so if it can demonstrate that the benefits have a sufficient monetary value to equal the market price. That is subject to the Secretary of State&#146;s consent, but, as I said, the provision of a general consent will obviate the need for the HCA to seek permission in each case. We have given our commitment to working with stakeholders to provide a general consent that will enable the agency to dispose of land at less than best consideration where we feel that that is appropriate, while also protecting and providing for sufficient financial control to protect public investment. We will of course consult on that.</p>

<p><a name="080603106000071"></a><a name="80603-gc0008.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80603-gc0008.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="080603106000132"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> I understand what has been said about general consent, which is very useful, but I am not clear about what the noble Lord said. When assessing whether a piece of land can be sold to a local authority for less than the open market value, do you have to have a monetary test of the benefits that come from community use, community benefit and so on? I thought that he said earlier that that was not necessarily the case, but he now seems to be saying that it is and that a bogus sum&#151;bogus is my word&#151;has to be put together showing that the benefits add up to the cost of the discount.</p>

The Minister said that the local authority will be deciding. I see a lot of people with extensive local government experience in the Committee and in my experience the local authority sometimes cannot make that choice. The district auditor can make that choice, quite contrary to what the local authority would have chosen. If would be useful if the Minister could include in his letter the guidance that the Government would give the district auditor in this case.</p>

<p><a name="080603106000077"></a><a name="80603-gc0008.htm_spnew20"></a><b><a name="80603-gc0008.htm_spnew21"></a><a name="080603106000138"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I suspect that it is something on which the Audit Commission would issue guidance, rather than the Government, but I take the point. Clearly, to deal with this issue, it would be of value if we set out more detail for Members of the Committee. We must ensure that there is probity in this process, to which I think all of us would sign up.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000078"></a>The noble Lord also has argued that the HCA should be able to take into account the planning status of any land it wishes to sell in assessing bids it receives for that land. In the past, he has argued that the HCA should be able to disregard any bids that are unusually high relative to that planning status, as they are likely to be attempts to &#147;land bank&#148;: to hold land fallow until planning permission can be secured and the value or usefulness of the land increases. In those circumstances, the noble Lord makes the point that going for what may be considered to be the pure best financial value may not necessarily be the right thing to do. The noble Lord may be right and we would agree. However, the amendment is not necessary. Whether land has planning permission, and the nature of that planning permission, is bound to have an impact on its market value. As I have explained, the HCA is already empowered not to accept the highest bid for its land, subject to the consent of the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000079"></a>On the noble Lord&#146;s point about would-be purchasers speculatively paying over the odds in order to land bank, in a sense, that is their business. The HCA can decline the offer either by accepting a lower bid, but one where the public benefits have an assessable monetary value&#151;</p>

<p><a name="080603106000080"></a><a name="80603-gc0008.htm_spnew22"></a><b><a name="80603-gc0008.htm_spnew23"></a><a name="080603106000139"></a>Baroness Ford:</b> Perhaps I may make a suggestion to my noble friend. We are going down a route that may not lead us to a very sensible place. The amendment flies in the face of current practice. It is not unusual for a public agency to put out a development brief on land that does not have planning consent and explicitly expect the developer then, in meeting that development brief, to take account of the planning risk in the price. I go back to what I said earlier: it is really important that, in writing to the noble Lord and the Committee, we should also take account of absolute current practice and past practice because we might inadvertently be causing a real problem in terms of where we get to. I urge my noble friend to do that.</p>

<p><a name="080603106000081"></a><a name="80603-gc0008.htm_spnew24"></a><b><a name="80603-gc0008.htm_spnew25"></a><a name="080603106000140"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I thank the noble Baroness for her helpful intervention. I was coming to that point. We are very conscious of the need to take account of current practice.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000082"></a>To summarise, Members of the Committee should be reassured by the points that I have made about how wider benefits can be taken into account. To pick up on the point of my noble friend Lady Ford, we have a commitment to draw up a general consent regime which is determined to satisfy and to safeguard public assets. We should reflect on the need to protect best practice in this field and take account of the need to ensure that we do not leave a gap that does not help us at all.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000083"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Brooke, asked a question about charity law that I ought to be able to answer, because I remember some debate and discussion about it when we did the Charities Bill twice. That is a slightly more complex question, and it is wide of the debate today, but the position would probably be that it would depend on what the trustees were trying to do in their particular charity. However, if we can find an answer for the noble Lord in due course, we will, and I will write to him on that.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000084"></a>I think I have covered most of the issues. If I have not, I am sure Members of the Committee will remind me; we have already committed ourselves to providing some answers in writing. This has been a useful debate and discussion. I have tried to suggest in my response that there is more flexibility there, and that we can use the general consent approach to provide for that and take into account the issues that the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, have rightly raised about the right conditions for disposing of land and assets at a lower-than-best consideration.</p>

Obviously, he is rather closer to the current Secretary of State. If the

At the very least, however&#151;because I cannot see that we can avoid coming back to this on Report&#151;I ask that the work being done on general consent is shared with noble Lords so that it can inform that debate. That may be asking a lot of officials, but this is a hugely important point. With real respect, the Government might find it easier and quicker to get a general consensus rather than finding that we divide on something when there is actually no division between us on the issues.</p>

<p><a name="080603106000086"></a><a name="80603-gc0008.htm_spnew28"></a><b><a name="80603-gc0008.htm_spnew29"></a><a name="080603106000142"></a>Lord Dixon-Smith:</b> It has been a useful and enjoyable debate, if only because I have my noble friend Lord Brooke advising us not to penetrate too far into the murky mind of a Secretary of State. That seems to be very sound advice. The Minister began with some fairly good capitalist principles, but then wrapped them up in so many layers of obfuscation than we all finished up more confused, rather than having our minds cleared.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000087"></a>There were two issues. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, raised one, which the Minister has not really satisfied us on: whether Clause 10, particularly subsection (1), is in a sense contradictory to, or  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC60"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column GC60</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>overrides, Clause 2(1)(c) dealing with the purposes of the Homes and Communities Agency. We will have to look at that difficulty very carefully. The noble Baroness, Lady Ford, said that the way in which the Bill was drafted appeared to be a step back from what is already actual practice. If that is the case, we must be very concerned about that. With the greatest respect to the Minister, we did not get a satisfactory answer on that.</p>

<a name="80603-gc0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="080603106000088"></a>We will need to return to this issue, if only because we must have clarification. There is not a great deal of division between us, but I do not think that any of us are quite clear on either what the Bill means or what the Government intend. However, for now I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80603-wms0001.htm_head0"></a><h3 align="center"><a name="08060378000002"></a>Burma: Cyclone Nargis</h3>


<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="08060378000014"></a><a name="80603-wms0001.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80603-wms0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08060378000149"></a>Lord Tunnicliffe:</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Douglas Alexander) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80603-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08060378000015"></a>A month has passed since Cyclone Nargis hit Burma on 2 May. While access has improved, the situation remains extremely grave. The UN continues to estimate that 2.4 million people have been directly affected by the cyclone and only 1 million of those have so far received any form of relief. Most of those who have been reached are in the most accessible and least badly affected regions. The official Burmese death toll is 78,000 and 56,000 missing. The threat of further deaths from infectious diseases and malaria is significant. Priority needs are food, shelter, clean drinking water and medical supplies.</p>

<a name="80603-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08060378000016"></a>The delivery of relief goods is increasing. The UN air-bridge between Bangkok and Rangoon is operating. We estimate a total of 237 flights have arrived since the cyclone struck. The first of nine World Food Programme helicopters is now delivering aid supplies to the delta region.</p>

<a name="80603-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="08060378000017"></a>The UK Government&#146;s priority has been, and remains, to ensure that relief reaches those who need it most. To this end, I attended the UN/ASEAN conference in Rangoon on 25 May at the personal invitation of the UN Secretary-General. The conference confirmed the importance of international aid workers being given necessary access to affected areas and the key role to be played by the ASEAN nations in facilitating the international relief effort.</p>

<a name="80603-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="08060378000018"></a>Since the conference there has been some improvement in access. No visas have been refused to UN or international NGO personnel in the past seven days. The Myanmar Red Cross has been able to scale up its operations substantially in the delta. Five international medical teams from countries in the region are now providing support to national healthcare staff in the delta. A DfID team managed to travel to the Irrawaddy delta on 29 May.</p>

<a name="80603-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="08060378000019"></a>However, significant concerns remain. Visa extensions are being granted for only one or two weeks at a time; there have been restrictions on dates of travel and requirements that government liaison officers accompany relief staff. There are still too few relief workers based in the delta.</p>

<a name="80603-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="08060378000020"></a>The UK remains the largest single donor to the relief effort. We have contributed &#163;7 million to the UN Flash Appeal; we have also channelled &#163;6.7 million through international NGOs, including Merlin, MSF Holland and Save the Children. Our humanitarian team, which has been operating in Rangoon for three weeks, continues to play a crucial role in helping coordinate the overall aid operation.</p>

<a name="80603-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="08060378000021"></a>A total of 20 DfID-funded aid flights have now arrived in Rangoon, delivering plastic sheeting and blankets for 250,000 people, hygiene kits and flat-bottomed boats for use in the delta. All these items  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS10"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column WS10</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have been consigned to the UN, NGOs and the Red Cross. We are also transporting 162,000 mosquito nets into Burma.</p>

<a name="80603-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="08060378000022"></a>In addition to our previous commitment of &#163;17 million, I am today announcing a further &#163;10.5 million, bringing our total contribution to &#163;27.5 million. These additional funds will be channelled through the Red Cross, NGOs and local community-based organisations. As before, none of the UK&#146;s assistance will go through the Burmese regime.</p>

<a name="80603-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="08060378000023"></a>While the Government&#146;s immediate focus is to provide immediate assistance to those affected by the Cyclone, this does not diminish our commitment to the restoration of accountable, democratic Government in Burma. It is an indictment of the Burmese regime that they proceeded with their constitutional referendum in the immediate aftermath of this natural disaster. The official results lack all credibility. I am also disappointed and saddened that the Government have once again ignored the international community and extended Aung San Suu Kyi&#146;s detention on 27 May.</p>

<a name="80603-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="08060378000024"></a>Millions of people remain in desperate need. Our priority remains to get assistance to those that need it. To do so, the regime&#146;s promises to the UN Secretary General must be turned into action. Together with the UN, ASEAN and NGOs, the UK Government will be monitoring the situation closely in the days and weeks ahead.</p>

<a name="80603-wms0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_92"></a><a name="08060378000113"></a>The NHS is Europe&#146;s largest employer with  1.3 million people; 5 per cent of the United Kingdom workforce and is often the largest single employer in each of the regions of England. Given its size, the NHS in England is responsible for nearly 3 per cent of UK carbon dioxide emissions and 30 per cent of public sector emissions.</p>

<a name="80603-wms0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_93"></a><a name="08060378000114"></a>In the 10 years from 1990 to 2000, the NHS successfully reduced its building energy use by 20 per cent. As part of the Government&#146;s climate change programme 1998-99, some early targets on NHS carbon reduction from building energy use were set for NHS trusts to reduce energy consumption and improve energy efficiency.</p>

<a name="80603-wms0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_94"></a><a name="08060378000115"></a>The NHS has already made good progress, but there is still much to be done. In the 10 years from 1990 to 2000, the NHS successfully reduced its building energy use by 20 per cent.</p>

<a name="80603-wms0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_95"></a><a name="08060378000116"></a>The strategy recognises that the NHS has done much good work in increasing its sustainability. But also recognises that much more can be done.</p>

<a name="80603-wms0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_96"></a><a name="08060378000117"></a>The purpose of the strategy is to:</p>
increase understanding about the NHS contribution to climate change and the immediate and long-term benefits to healthcare that can be gained from actively managing carbon emissions;establish board level leadership on carbon reduction in the NHS;establish stretching, but achievable, measures for carbon reduction;  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS18"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column WS18</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>describe proposed national, regional and local action to support carbon reduction; give practical, evidence-based, and systematic advice on the means to improve the sustainability of NHS operations by evaluating and sharing good practice;provide a framework to monitor, evaluate and report progress; andensure policy promotes a low carbon NHS.
<a name="80603-wms0002.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_97"></a><a name="08060378000118"></a>The core of this strategy is action. It has highlighted the 10 achievable, practical and sustainability improving, actions, to win the top 10 actions that the NHS will challenge themselves to achieve:</p>
the use of high quality information to help predict different possible trajectories of NHS carbon emissions (an NHS carbon model) to measure progress towards objectives, identify milestones, and guide action;a board approved carbon management strategy for all NHS organisations by 2009; a proposed extension of the energy fund to improve energy efficiency of the existing NHS estate;all our new buildings to be low carbon by 2015 and meet our ambition of zero carbon by 2018;a board approved sustainable travel plan for all NHS bodies by 2010;a target for better waste management to be created and met;sources of carbon emissions to be cut by improving procurement of goods, services and equipment;the pricing of carbon at an appropriate level within the NHS in England; the development and implementation of more effective incentives and policies to support and stimulate real progress on sustainable development; andall NHS organisations to report annually on a key metric as a part of a simple scorecard of sustainable development indicators, to be considered for performance purposes.
<a name="80603-wms0002.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_98"></a><a name="08060378000119"></a>The strategy is the first product of the new NHS Sustainable Development Unit. It forms the first step of a sustainable development programme for the NHS.</p>

<a name="80603-wms0002.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_99"></a><a name="08060378000120"></a>Based on the feedback from the consultation responses, expected by 21 August, it is intended that the strategy will be published in the autumn.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_101"></a><a name="08060378000123"></a>I have today launched a public consultation on proposals to extend the scope of the Railway Heritage Committee. The public consultation, which will run until 5 September 2008, identifies three options to enable the committee to extend its scope to railway related bodies that were overlooked or not in existence at the time of the original legislation. These options are:</p>
for legislation to remain the same;for railway related bodies to voluntarily agree to allow the committee to designate their records and artefacts, or to add further organisations to the original list of bodies covered by the 1996 Railway Heritage Act.
<a name="80603-wms0002.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_102"></a><a name="08060378000124"></a>From previous discussions between the committee and railway bodies, and a response to an informal questionnaire in March, there is a need for such bodies to be brought into the scope of the committee to enable it to fully meet its statutory obligations.</p>

<a name="80603-wms0002.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_103"></a><a name="08060378000125"></a>The consultation also seeks to update its membership to enable it to appoint an archivist. Current legislation restricts the department's ability to attract suitable candidates and appoint members who do not meet the existing requirements of the Public Records Act 1958.</p>

<a name="08060378000127"></a><a name="80603-wms0002.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80603-wms0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08060378000157"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Ruth Kelly) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80603-wms0002.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_105"></a><a name="08060378000128"></a>The Transport Research Laboratory has today published a report, commissioned by my department, on the subject of longer and heavier goods vehicles (LHVs). The report highlights a number of issues that make the implementation of large 25.25 metre LHVs, sometimes referred to as super-lorries, impractical either on a permanent or trial basis. I will therefore not be allowing them on UK roads for the foreseeable future.</p>

<a name="80603-wms0002.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_106"></a><a name="08060378000129"></a>The following issues highlighted in the report have been influential in arriving at my decision:</p>
there is a risk (substantial in the case of 60 tonne super-lorries) of increased CO2 emissions and other environmental drawbacks due to modal shift from rail to road if these vehicles were to be permitted, which would also impact on the viability of existing rail freight services and the potential for future growth;there are serious implications for the management of the road network, as such vehicles would be unsuitable for many roads and junctions;substantial investment (in the order of several billion pounds) would be needed to provide for junction improvements, the protection of bridge supports, and the provision of parking infrastructure for statutory rest periods, particularly if a new nationwide network of dedicated facilities is required;  


<notus-date day="3" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS20"></a><b>3 Jun 2008 : Column WS20</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>there is uncertainty about how efficiently such vehicles could be used, particularly when sourcing loads of sufficient size to make return journeys sustainable;such vehicles would introduce new safety risks; and it is not currently possible for us to mandate tougher safety or manoeuvrability standards that might address some of these issues because of European trade rules.
<a name="80603-wms0002.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_107"></a><a name="08060378000130"></a>The report does show, however, that there could be worthwhile benefits from permitting a modest increase in the length of current articulated vehicles. The department will consider these further in the context of its ongoing strategic work on freight, on which I expect to publish a summary of progress this summer.</p>

<a name="80603-wms0002.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_108"></a><a name="08060378000131"></a>The report will help to inform member states and the European Commission which are reviewing the rules on lorry sizes as part of the logistics action plan to improve the efficiency of transport and logistics in the European Union.</p>

This includes vehicles awaiting minor repairs, or currently in transit to theatres worldwide, but excludes any vehicles undergoing major repair or planned refit. Vehicles known to have been destroyed on operations have also been accounted for. Nine hundred FV430 vehicles are undergoing a major armour upgrade programme to become Bulldog vehicles, 500 of which have now been completed. Twenty-six per cent of unavailable Spartan, Scimitar and Sultan vehicles are currently either undergoing major overhaul or scheduled for refit. The remainder are awaiting a decision on disposal. The out-of-service dates for the Mastiff, Ridgback and Jackal vehicles have yet to be decided.</p>

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_20"></a>Whether, in view of the serious violence and disorder that broke out in Manchester when a big screen showing the ITV broadcast of the UEFA cup failed on 14 May, it will review the exemption for broadcast entertainment in the Licensing Act 2003. [HL3715]</p>

It is therefore difficult to see what added control would have been available had the event been subject to the licensing controls under the Licensing Act 2003, or that such controls would have prevented the disorder that arose.</p>

<a name="80603w0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_421"></a><a name="080603100000500"></a>It remains the Government's position that big-screen television broadcasts in themselves do not cause disorder, but that it is the consumption of alcohol at such events that can lead to problems. Decisions on whether big-screen events should go ahead are the responsibility of the local authority in consultation with the local police, who are involved at an early stage, and event organisers. It is already possible under existing legislation to control consumption and drunkenness in public places. Under the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, it is possible for a local authority to designate any area to which the public have access a place where alcohol may not be consumed. It is also an offence under the Licensing Act 1872 to be drunk in a public place. The Government are confident that the police and local authority in Manchester will ensure that safety and security arrangements provide a controlled environment at any future big-screen events.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_511"></a><a name="080603100000632"></a>Since 1996 police officers have had certain powers of entry to a school in order to search the premises and any person there for a suspected offensive weapon; the permission of the head teacher is not required but co-operation between the head and the police is advised in this and in other circumstances where the police seek access. Members of emergency and other organisations will usually enter schools by arrangement.</p>

Local authorities in border areas retain the flexibility to provide cross-border travel for their own residents at their discretion.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_513"></a><a name="080603100000636"></a>However, the complexity and cost associated with mutual recognition of bus concessionary travel passes in England, Scotland and Wales is likely to be considerable. There are issues around how operators will be properly reimbursed (given the differing arrangements in place), by whom, and whether the terms of the different concessions would have to be harmonised. These issues will be much easier to address once full smart ticketing is in place on all buses.</p>
