<A NAME="80722-01_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Baldwin of Bewdley </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "80722-01_para2"></a>Further to the replies of the Baroness Jay of Paddington on 26th February (HL Deb, cols. 789-792), what progress is being made to broaden the membership of their scientific advisory committees.
<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="80722-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, last year the Chief Scientific Adviser issued guidelines on the use of scientific advice in policy making. These advocate that departments should obtain the best possible scientific advice from all the sources available. As a demonstration of our commitment to these guidelines, we have re-established the Council for Science and Technology with three additional independent members. The guidelines also specifically recommend that membership of expert advisory committees should be kept under review to ensure that an appropriate range of scientific opinion is represented.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-01_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Baldwin of Bewdley: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for his encouraging reply, so far as it goes, while perhaps expressing some surprise at seeing him at the Dispatch Box today despite my best efforts to reword my Question, as prompted by his Whips' Office last week. Can he say how we can learn the names and provenance of any new members who might come on to these committees, which hitherto have been so dominated by pharmaceutical and food company interests? Can he also say what has become of the offer <P>


<a name="column_872"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 872</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which the noble Baroness, Lady Jay, made to me, and through me to others, several months ago to participate in the process of finding new people for the committees?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, with regard to the noble Earl's second question, I am sure that my noble friend Lady Jay is most grateful for any suggestions that he may have sent in. I cannot comment on whether the names will be chosen, because appointments to many advisory public bodies are now the responsibility of the Commissioner for Public Appointments. The names could well be in his department.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-01_para3"></a>Members of the Government's scientific and advisory committees are appointed on the basis of their individual expertise and not as representatives of any one company or organisation. Departments have examined the balance of interests on some of the committees and have taken a number of actions. For example, a public interest representative has recently been appointed to the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment, and representatives from the health food industry, complementary medicine, consumers and the food industry have been appointed as observers to the expert group on vitamins and minerals.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-01_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Addison: </B>   My Lords, with regard to the relevant scientific advisory committee and Vitamin B6, is the Minister aware that the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has not even finished looking at all the detail of the information which had to be submitted to it by 26th June? Does not the decision to restrict the amount of Vitamin B6 that can be sold and taken, about which we have been reading in the papers, mean that the whole consultative exercise is a sham and makes a complete mockery of the entire advisory committee system?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, the Government have a duty to act where they believe they see a danger. Following the public consultation exercise, proposed regulations on Vitamin B6 are currently being considered and an announcement will be made in due course. In addition, the expert group on vitamins and minerals jointly convened by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of Health has been asked to advise on a framework for the safety of all vitamins and minerals. That will take about 18 months to complete and a report will then be published.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-01_spnew6"></A><B> The Countess of Mar: </B>   My Lords, in the interests of transparency, can the noble Lord say exactly how the members of these committees are selected and how the names on the shortlist that is presented to Ministers are chosen? Are they chosen by a civil servant?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, the Government announced recently that ministerial appointments to advisory non-departmental public bodies will in future fall within the remit of the Commissioner for Public Appointments, Sir Len Peach. The commissioner publishes guidance on and audits the public appointments process. The Cabinet Office publication Public Bodies 1997 gives details of <P>


<a name="column_873"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 873</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the executive bodies and the advisory bodies which will in future be covered by this arrangement. Regarding the question of the shortlist, a shortlist is put before Ministers after a fair and open recruitment process, as required by the commissioner. This will involve consultation with other interested parties where appropriate. The shortlist will have been subject to independent scrutiny, either within or outside the Government, by at least one individual. These procedures are intended to open up the whole process, as the noble Countess would like, in order that candidates can make their names known to the department themselves.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Dean of Beswick: </B>   My Lords, is it not the case that, if people who are appointed to these bodies also have a close professional interest in the subject concerned, the bodies may wish to act as self-regulatory bodies? Would it not be better to appoint to these bodies an increasing number of people who do not have a pecuniary or professional interest in the subject?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, the guidelines clearly indicate what the procedure should be. We need to involve the most highly regarded experts in their fields. Those individuals will of course be attractive to commercial organisations and some will inevitably have associations with industry. There are well-established procedures under which members with commercial interests declare them and, if necessary, abstain from discussions. Members' financial or other links with the industry are also regularly published.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-01_spnew10"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, in his first reply, the Minister used the words "the best possible scientific advice". Does he agree that advice in which its givers have a commercial interest, by definition, cannot be the best possible scientific advice?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   No, my Lords. As I said, members of the scientific advisory bodies are appointed on the basis of individual expertise and not on the basis of the organisations, groups or companies which they represent.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-01_spnew12"></A><B> The Earl of Clanwilliam: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister accept the stricture of the Select Committee on Agriculture in another place which said that the Committee on Toxicity treated witnesses on the subject of Vitamin B6 with contumely and contempt? Will the noble Lord ensure that the new committee treats its witnesses with distinction and honour?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that the new committee will treat its witnesses with distinction and honour.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that if, every time any leading scientist or engineer is appointed to an advisory committee, scurrilous remarks <P>

<P>
<A NAME="80722-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Waddington </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "80722-01_para4"></a>When the report of the Advisory Group on Quarantine is due to be published, and how soon after receipt of the report they plan to announce their decision.
<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="80722-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food   (Lord Donoughue): </B>  My Lords, the Advisory Group on Quarantine is expected to report to Ministers very shortly. The report will be published and the Government will hold a full public consultation, which is likely to last two or three months, before making decisions.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-01_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Waddington: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply. Does he agree that we simply have to make progress on this matter because the cruelty involved in keeping dogs in solitary confinement without any exercise, in kennels which we now know from a recent television programme are often woefully inadequate, can be justified only if there is no other safe way of protecting the public against rabies? If there is an alternative, it must be adopted, and adopted quickly. Will the Minister tell Professor Kennedy that there must not be any further slippage in his timetable? We were first of all told that the report would be published in the new year, then in March and then in May. Will the Government publish the report as soon as it is received from Professor Kennedy and then come to a swift conclusion? For the life of me, I cannot see the justification for two to three months' consultation when people have given their advice to the Government over recent years.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, I do not accept any criticism of Professor Kennedy and his committee. The committee was not expected to report in the new year since the membership was announced only shortly before Christmas. Its members have worked very hard and very fast. They have been dealing particularly with the complex area of risk assessment. A number of Members of this House have expressed the need for more scientific risk assessment on other issues. The committee has devoted a good deal of time to that. Given the extensive and serious nature of its report--the fact that six options of risk and cost benefit are being considered--I believe that it will prove to be a valuable report. The committee has worked very hard indeed.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever: </B>   My Lords, as a trial, will the Government consider allowing properly vaccinated, blood-tested and micro-chipped pets of British <P>


<a name="column_875"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 875</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>servicemen and their families in Cyprus to return home without quarantine? Cyprus is rabies free. The present situation is causing great distress to these service families.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, the options being examined centrally include whether to use a system of identification, vaccination and blood testing. The report will give the committee's views on the relative risks involved. If that method is adopted, it should apply to all animals and not exempt groups such as servicemen with pets. As regards Cyprus, our current legislation, which has been in operation for nearly a century, is a blanket measure. One reason why it is difficult to make exemptions for particular countries is that, although they may claim to be rabies free, we have no control over where dogs or cats may have come from en route via Cyprus.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister think of any good reason why successive governments have failed to make an exception for blind people and others who are severely physically impaired, preventing them from bringing their guide dogs into this country, even with proper vaccination certificates, so that when they come here they are unaided by their animals, which are treated as pets? Can the Minister give an assurance that, whatever else happens, there will be speedy consideration of the need to consider that category of person?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, the committee has consulted all the relevant associations which deal with guide dogs for the blind and the deaf. The good reason was that the existing policy was a blanket measure without exemptions. It was considered that any exemptions were a risk and that it was conceivable that a dog to guide a blind person might have been as exposed as any other dog. That is why the committee is looking urgently at alternatives. Perhaps I should declare an interest on this. I have a most beautiful and wicked Jack Russell.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos: </B>   My Lords, will my noble friend bear in mind that the policy established 30 years ago has kept rabies out of this country?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend is absolutely right. That is why the existing policy is one of the six options being examined and assessed in terms of its risk and the relativity of the other options. If the other options have no more risk than the present one, we shall look at them with interest.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-02_spnew7"></A><B> Viscount Brookeborough: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister tell us whether he is having parallel discussions with the Government of the Irish Republic, bearing in mind that the only land border between the United Kingdom and any other country is the one between the North and South of Ireland and, as we are well aware for many other reasons, it is not secure?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, the noble Viscount is quite right. Throughout our reconsideration of policy we <P>


<a name="column_876"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 876</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have kept in close consultation with the Irish Republic. Our officials have discussed the matter with Irish officials. In April I was in the Republic discussing this and other matters with the Irish Minister of Agriculture at the time of the Listowel and Leopardstown races.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-02_spnew9"></A><B> The Earl of Lauderdale: </B>   My Lords, the Minister promised us the report very shortly. How short is "very shortly"?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, "very shortly" is very soon.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Evans of Parkside: </B>   My Lords, will my noble friend give the House an absolute assurance that if the quarantine regulations are to be relaxed in any way whatever, it will be only on the basis that there is no conceivable chance of any rabid animal getting into this country under any circumstances?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, I do not believe that anyone could give that assurance. One cannot give it under the present system. There have been cases of rabid dogs imported under the present system. Our position is that if there is a change, it shall not significantly increase the risk to public health. That is the basis on which the system is being assessed.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-02_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Linklater of Butterstone: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that circus animals from abroad are treated differently from guide dogs for the blind?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, traded and commercial animals operate under their own regulations under the Balai agreement. I do not know whether the noble Baroness is referring to that. Animals for research are treated differently, but they each have strong regulation. In many respects the trade in commercial animals is as strict or stricter.

</UL><A NAME="80722-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor   (Lord Irvine of Lairg): </B>  My Lords, this Question would be better directed to the Derbyshire Magistrates' Courts Committee than to me. These decisions are taken at local level. The proposed changes to the magistrates' courts structure in Derbyshire derive from a scheme prepared by the Derbyshire Magistrates' Courts Committee after consultation with Derbyshire County Council, the paying authority, under Section 56 of the Justices of the Peace Act 1997.

<A NAME = "80722-02_para1"></a>Appeals by the county council against the proposed closures lie to me under Section 56(3) of the Act. Appeals have been entered. I have, however, yet to receive full statements of the cases of both the county council and the magistrates' courts committee. When I receive them I will consider them and come to my decisions. Meanwhile, it is obviously not appropriate for me to say anything further while the appeals are outstanding.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Methuen: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor for his reply. Is he aware of the very substantial objection to these proposals, particularly in west Derbyshire, where the four existing magistrates' courts will be closed leaving people to travel great distances at great disadvantage? Will he please bear that in mind when he comes to his decision?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-02_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, I shall be aware of the full grounds when I receive them. Obviously, I shall consider them fully.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   My Lords, will the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor accept that if the people of west Derbyshire did not commit crime it would be possible to close all the magistrates' courts?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-02_spmin2"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, I shall resist any temptation to pre-judge the issues on these appeals.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </B>   My Lords, can the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor tell us how many other areas of the country have similar appeals currently outstanding? I am conscious that in West Yorkshire there are proposals to close Keighley and Bingley magistrates' court with similar problems of family courts being held further away from where parents and children may be willing to travel. There are similar problems of public transport. Can the noble and learned Lord say whether it is a general problem throughout the country or are these two exceptional cases?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-02_spmin3"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, no. There are quite a few appeals. I shall write to the noble Lord with full details of those that are outstanding and those decided over the past 12 months.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-02_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Hooson: </B>   My Lords, is the noble and learned Lord aware that in rural Wales there have been many complaints about the courts being centralised? Is he further aware that a great deal of public and private money has been lost through cases having to be adjourned because of defendants and witnesses failing to arrive at court owing to lack of public transport?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-02_spmin4"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, I repeat that these are matters for local decision, subject to appeal to me. <P>

Indeed, some 30 bus companies cover the area. Is it not possible to update some of the existing courts to save people having to travel? Courts are best supported and made more available to people if they are sited in the local community. Derbyshire is predominantly rural and it is difficult for people to get to the courts.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, again I resist all attempts of noble Lords and noble Baronesses to have me anticipate the issues in the appeals. The position in relation to Derbyshire is that five courthouses in west Derbyshire--two in Chesterfield; one at Ashbourne; one at Bakewell; and one at Matlock--are being closed and replaced by a wholly new building in Chesterfield, which will consist of seven courtrooms. That is the subject of an appeal to me. Also subject to an appeal to me is that three courthouses in south Derbyshire--two in Derby and one at Swadlincote--are being closed to be replaced by a single new courthouse in Derby, consisting of 11 courtrooms.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-03_para0"></a>When such appeals come to me, I consider each on its own merits in the light of local circumstances. Typically, I address the quality of the existing courthouses and the facilities they offer; the feasibility and cost of bringing the existing courthouses up to modern standards; the efficiency of the distribution of existing court business among the existing courthouses; accessibility for all court users; the extra distance that some court users may have to travel; and the time taken to complete that return journey. When the parties to the appeals give me their full grounds, I shall consider them.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Taylor of Blackburn: </B>   My Lords, is the noble and learned Lord aware that throughout the country there is a great deal of dissatisfaction where courts have already closed? That was done as a cost-saving exercise, but it has not saved a penny. It has cost a lot more and has inconvenienced many magistrates, witnesses and counsel.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-03_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, it must be appreciated that some people feel such an affection for particular courts that they almost constitute themselves as local preservation societies in order to keep them. However, some courts are quite incapable, at economic cost, of being brought up to modern standards, particularly for the disabled. The range of considerations I have already listed are those I apply in considering all appeals.

<P>
</UL><A NAME="80722-03_spmin2"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions   (Baroness Hayman): </B>  My Lords, procedures are in place to ensure that where former railway land has potential for future rail use it can be identified and the freight industry given the opportunity to purchase it. However, we recognise that concerns about property disposals persist. We have therefore asked the British Railways Board to carry out a review of its remaining property portfolio.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Cadman: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that encouraging Answer. In view of the positive messages on this subject in the Government's White Paper, can the Minister tell the House what encouragement and advice are being given to local planning authorities by the Government to enable them in the short-term to make suitable land available for rail freight terminals? To what extent can local authorities be encouraged to invest in rail freight infrastructure?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-03_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the noble Lord's welcome for our review. I should point out that the British Railways Board will suspend land sales while the review takes place in order to give just those interests the opportunity to express views about potential sites. Local authorities already have an opportunity to ask for sales to be put on hold if they think that there is the potential for rail freight use. We are considering revising planning guidance to local authorities, as well as planning guidance at regional level in the regional transport plans. However, we also intend to issue revised planning guidance to facilitate more freight to be moved by rail. When preparing their development plans, local authorities will be expected to consider and, where appropriate, to protect opportunities for rail connections to existing manufacturing, distribution and warehousing sites adjacent or close to the rail network.

<FONT SIZE=3>potential for future rail use. Our views about the potential for rail have expanded since then. We have therefore had to scrutinise whether land can be made available for transport use. My noble friend rightly points out that some areas of land may have no potential for transport use but could be used for other well deserving purposes. The Sustrans scheme, which uses disused railway lines for cycle paths, while maintaining the possibility of using them in future for rail, strikes that balance extremely well.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Burnham: </B>   My Lords, in the light of Mr. Prescott's announcement about discouraging the use of cars, will the Government bear in mind the necessity of producing a great deal of extra space for car parking at rural railway stations?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-03_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, part of the purpose of the integrated transport White Paper is to ensure that we facilitate the use of public transport. We are doing that in a variety of ways, including investing very large sums of money in providing quality public transport. For some people, the ability to leave their car at a railway station will be important, as the noble Lord pointed out. We are considering how to ensure that they can do that--and do so securely. The security of vehicles, and sometimes of drivers, has been a problem in the past.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the Minister's statement that the British Railways Board has been asked to reconsider its holding of railway land. As chairman of the Rail Freight Group, I very much welcome all the rail freight measures in the White Paper. However, can the Minister explain a little more about the timetable for the British Railways Board's review and its consultations with the industry? When might the board be likely to report back to government, as is stated in paragraph 4.35 of the White Paper?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-03_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I am tempted to say, as did my noble friend, "very soon". We are in the preliminary stages. I understand that today we have received an initial response from the British Railways Board about the scope of the review. We shall want to consult relevant interests, but we do not want a long drawn-out process. We need some clarity and to be certain about the portfolio. We should be able to achieve that clarity within a sensible period of time.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Brabazon of Tara: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister say how much land is owned by the British Railways Board? What is its estimated sale value, and what has been provided for in the budget to reflect that sale value? If the land is not sold, from where will that money be found?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-03_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, firm estimates relating to receipts from the sale of railway land were taken into account by the Government. I shall write to the noble Lord with the exact details. One must look at overall transport needs. We have set up two new funds <P>

Assuming that the noble Lord, Lord Cocks of Hartcliffe, moves his amendment it may be for the convenience of your Lordship's House if any noble Lord who wishes to raise a matter on any other part of this report should do so during the debate on the amendment. While that is strictly a departure from our normal procedure we have done it before. It saves time and will avoid the need for two debates.

<P>

<A NAME = "80722-03_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I shall try to be brief in moving the amendment in my name on the Order Paper. Paragraph 3 of the report of the Administration and Works Sub-Committee deals with Old Palace Yard. <P>


<a name="column_882"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 882</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The report merely says that the sub-committee approves the scheme to refurbish Old Palace Yard. Old Palace Yard is basically known as the Members' car park. If we go to the report of the Administration and Works Sub-Committee of 30th June when this matter was discussed the proposal was that a sum of &#163;2 1/3  million be spent on refurbishing this car park and adjacent places. No doubt that decision was regarded as unexceptional at the time but matters move on. I believe that the reputation of this House may be damaged. On Monday the long-awaited White Paper on transport was introduced by the Deputy Prime Minister. In that he makes very great play of the need to remove cars from city centres. If two days later your Lordships say that they are to spend more than &#163;2&#189; million refurbishing the car park at the front of the building, it will be a mistake in perception and public relations. As the work proceeds every taxi driver who goes past will point out this folly to his passengers. The passengers of every bus that passes will grumble to each other. A constant stream of foreign visitors will believe that this is yet another example of the aberration of the British. There is a serious risk that it will not do the reputation of this House any good during this period.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-03_para5"></a>I have said before in debates that I believe that at times we are fobbed off by the Chairman of Committees with the comment that the matter in question has been considered by the relevant committees and brought before this House. Consequently, let us look at what was said at the meeting of the Administration and Works Sub-Committee when this matter was proposed:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In conclusion, it was proposed that the Sub-Committee should examine the proposals in detail before confirming they should go ahead. The Chairman of Committees said that this would be impractical: the proposals had been thoroughly examined and revised by the Sub-Committee and the Advisory Panel on Works of Art and any deferral would greatly delay the project". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-03_para6"></a>It is like a Russian doll. One opens it up to find another one inside. One must probe further and further back to discover the original decision. It is rather like radio astronomy. I hope that in this case noble Lords will make an exception to the good work that goes on and agree to take another look at it for the sake of the reputation of the House. Matters have changed since the original decision was taken. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-04_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, I gave notice to the Chairman of Committees that I intended to speak to this matter. I also raised the matter with members of the sub-committee before the meeting. I strongly support the noble Lord, Lord Cocks, although perhaps for slightly different reasons. He said that it was just a car park. I understand that it also includes the roads outside and opposite. All of that is regarded as Old Palace Yard. I believe that the consultation in this House was far too limited. I obtained all my information from the four pages that were before Westminster City Council. That related to expenditure of &#163;400,000, to which that council was asked and agreed to contribute &#163;100,000. Therefore, I am shocked to hear reference today to the figure of over &#163;2 million. Therefore, the works must include more than those matters which were considered by Westminster City Council.
<P>


<a name="column_883"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 883</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-04_para0"></a>My objection is based on the consultation. There was an exhibition in the Royal Gallery of the very attractive Norman Foster world heritage squares. We were asked to say whether or not we liked them. This proposal represented a tiny part of that scheme. As I understand it, the Government have deferred the works to Parliament Square and Trafalgar Square, yet we propose to go ahead with our part of it. I do not think it is either desirable or necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-04_para1"></a>I am also very concerned about the proposal to surface the area with granite setts. Any woman who walks into New Palace Yard is aware of the need to avoid walking over those granite setts. Anyone who is disabled or in a wheelchair or who uses a walking stick finds it very difficult. If we are to have these granite setts, a sample piece should be provided somewhere so that we can assess whether or not it is a practical and desirable surface for this House. For those reasons, not simply the cost--everything costs the earth, although the works in this Palace are always durable and are carried out to a very high standard--I am greatly concerned about the acceptability or desirability of this change at all. I support the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Randall of St. Budeaux: </B>   My Lords, I rise to make two brief points. One is concerned with the procedure associated with the report that is before the House today to which noble Lords are asked to give their agreement. The document that is before noble Lords is almost incomprehensible. I ask that some brief notes associated with the report be provided.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-04_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, as a former Whip, I understand that it is not in order to speak from the middle of the Gangway.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Randall of St. Budeaux: </B>   My Lords, I apologise for being three inches out of line.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-04_para2"></a>To ensure that the business of your Lordships' House proceeds smoothly, I ask that some notes be included with reports of this kind. Further, item no. 2 makes reference to the House of Lords annual report and accounts. I was surprised to learn yesterday that that information is not available for Peers. Since the Treasury is involved in this and it is not a matter for Parliament alone but also involves government, I believe that the lack of transparency and openness is contrary to the Government's stance. I ask that this information be made more readily available to Peers. I ask also that notes associated with it should be made available so as to make the matter comprehensible. I do not believe that to nod matters through is good for the reputation of this House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-04_para3"></a>My second brief point relates to paragraph 3 of the report of the meeting of the Administration and Works Sub-Committee of 30th June. I should like to draw attention to the new committee referred to in this part of the document. The new committee has responsibility for accommodation and other matters. Because of the accommodation crisis in this House, I ask the Chairman of Committees to request Black Rod to join the Serjeant at Arms in encouraging Peers to use <P>


<a name="column_884"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 884</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the five rooms in your Lordships' House which are now occupied by Members of Parliament. It is only fair to do that. I ask that this happens before the House goes into Recess so that we can get a decision before October.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-04_spmin0"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees:</B>  My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, for giving me notice that she intended to raise certain matters. I shall deal with them in a moment or two. First, let me deal with some of the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Cocks of Hartcliffe.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-04_para4"></a>I am relieved about two matters. First, neither I nor your Lordships' committees have any responsibility whatever for any aspect of government policy. Secondly, I am comforted by the fact that on these committees are members of Her Majesty's Government who are fully able to say whatever they choose. I am grateful for their contributions, as I am for those of the Opposition Front Bench, the Liberal Democrat Front Bench and the Cross-Benches.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-04_para5"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Cocks, is right about the amount; it is &#163;2.34 million. In the light of what has been said, I should remind your Lordships that these matters have been under consideration for two and one-third years. The first mention was made by the Administration and Works Sub-Committee on 5th March 1996 and was included in the works programme considerations in 1997 and 1998. As many of your Lordships will know, the minutes of the Administration and Works Sub-Committee are available in the Library. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Cocks, takes advantage of the availability of that material.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-04_para6"></a>These matters have been before the Finance and Staff Sub-Committee from 12th March 1996, and were included in the public expenditure surveys for last year and for this year on 17th March. They have been under consideration since February 1997 by your Lordships' Advisory Panel on Works of Art and there was the exhibition to which the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, referred in the Royal Gallery on 24th and 25th November last year.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-04_para7"></a>A great deal of consideration has been given to these matters by your Lordships' committees. It will be appreciated, from the dates I have given, that the opportunity has been available for all noble Lords to make known any points about these matters over a considerable period of time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-04_para8"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Gardener of Parkes, referred also to the granite setts. I must confess that when I first heard about them I thought they were the familiar cobbles which are, in laymen's terms, domed or rounded at the top. They are very uncomfortable to walk upon. I know that the noble Baroness, with all her experience of medical matters, has been concerned about whether the new ones will be slippery, whether wheelchairs will be able to negotiate them, and whether they might cause difficulties for ladies in high heeled shoes or for people with bad backs.
<P>


<a name="column_885"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 885</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-04_para9"></a>I am able to bring the noble Baroness some comfort and reassurance. I have gone into the matter rather thoroughly. They are not cobbles of that sort. They are flat granite sets--not slippery--which are perfectly comfortable to walk upon and probably an improvement on the existing tarmac. They last for a long time, will not cause us greater disruption, and, given a long time-scale, will cost less.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-04_para10"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Randall of St. Budeaux, referred to the forms of committee reports. I am always conscious of the need to keep down the amount of paper and material in reports. There is also a saving of cost, which is an underlying principle.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-04_para11"></a>As to the question of notes, that is not our practice. I shall look to see whether there is anything in that particular point but I would ask your Lordships to bear in mind the fundamental points I have just made.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-04_para12"></a>As to the annual report and accounts, those are available to your Lordships. They have been published since 1992 following the Ibbs Report. The 1997-1998 accounts will be published on the day your Lordships' return on 5th October. They will be available there and then. All previously produced annual report and accounts are available immediately. There is no avoidance, as has been suggested.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-04_para13"></a>As to the five rooms to which the noble Lord, Lord Randall, also referred, these have been under consideration by your Lordships' committees over a considerable period of time. They will be kept under surveillance. Once those in another place occupy their new accommodation in Portcullis House I have no doubt that your Lordships' committees will wish to return to this matter to see what additional accommodation might be returned.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-04_para14"></a>I have tried to give as full an explanation as possible. In those circumstances--and bearing in mind the membership of these various committees--I hope that your Lordships will all feel that ample consideration has been given to these matters and that the noble Lord, Lord Cocks of Hartcliffe, will feel able to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Cocks of Hartcliffe: </B>   My Lords, I have always tried in these debates to pay tribute to the assiduity and the conscientiousness of the people who man these committees. I thank them for the contribution they make to the House. I hope that nothing I have said today in any way casts aspersions on them. I have tried to bring to the attention of the House that we have a new situation in terms of the White Paper on transport policy and in terms of this House itself. There are all sorts of people who wish this House ill and who are looking for every possible excuse to denigrate it and its works. We are handing them here a big stick with which to beat us. I commend the amendment to your Lordships.

Page 1, line 23, at end insert (", but no application by a prisoner who is or has been a member of a terrorist or proscribed organisation shall be processed before any application made by a prisoner who is not and has not been a member of such an organisation").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80722-05_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in earlier debates there was a much used phrase, "We must not send the wrong signals". Care has been taken in drafting this amendment and Amendment No. 2 to ensure that the signal transmitted--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-05_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, with respect, perhaps I could ask noble Lords to leave the Chamber more quietly because we cannot hear the noble Lord.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>   My Lords, the signal transmitted by these two amendments could not possibly be regarded as sending a wrong signal to any prisoner or terrorist organisation, not even those who organised this week's mortar attack on Newry Police Station. Whether they were assisted or supplied by the Provisional IRA or one of its many sub-contractors, they are not likely to be greatly intimidated by these two amendments since the prisoners referred to are in a very different time frame. The one thing they have in common is that the terrorist organisations and their numerous do-it-yourself sub-contractors perceive the Bill to be an amnesty. It is pointless to try to alter their perception. It is pointless to shake their belief that as they improve their techniques and increase their atrocities over the next decade the activists within their ranks will run no great risk, even if they are apprehended, convicted and imprisoned. They will be convinced that a future Secretary of State will come to either House and ask Parliament to approve one simple amendment to this Bill which is shortly to become an Act. The amendment would alter the date of the qualifying offence to 10th April 2003. It is a simple amendment: an alteration of date.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-05_para4"></a>Amendment No. 1, and Amendment No. 2 to be moved by the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, creates no hardship or disadvantage for those prisoners who have <P>


<a name="column_889"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 889</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>been convicted of terrorist acts who will benefit from the Bill. Nor does the amendment disadvantage the increasing number of terrorists who have already embarked on a long range campaign--and I quote Mr. Adams--of "doing what they do best".
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-05_para5"></a>The Bill prepares for the very early release of prisoners. There can surely be no great grounds of complaint over consideration being given to applications made by a prisoner who has never been a member of any terrorist organisation and thus qualifies with top marks under the four conditions for priority over all other applicants. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo980722/text/80722-06.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>   My Lords, I shall seek to move my amendment, Amendment No. 2, on which I hope that the House may divide later. I have no wish to prolong proceedings on the Bill since the House has a great deal of important business today. But like the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux, I wish to say a few words about the principle of the Bill as a background to the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-06_para0"></a>One does not have to doubt the good intentions of those who brought the Bill forward, or those who support it. Its objective is to secure peace in Northern Ireland, but it introduces grave injustices. It is part of a process of the appeasement of wicked men responsible for the most appalling crimes. I have a strong feeling, as does the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux, that in the light of the bombs which have been discovered just in time recently, of the mortar attack, and the murder by an IRA body of some kind of one of its own religion--if one can say that the IRA has a religion beyond the religion of violence--sooner or later a government amendment will alter the date in the Bill and bring into its provisions those people who are committing and will shortly commit other such crimes.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-06_para1"></a>There could not be a better example than this Bill of the ends being held to justify the means. The means of this Bill is the reward of criminals; the end is peace. I do not think that we can be too sure that that end will be achieved by these means.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-06_para2"></a>Against that background it is now generally agreed--I realise that Ministers cannot say too much without risk of being held to have prejudiced themselves on the issue--that the treatment of Guardsmen Fisher and Wright always seen as controversial, is now seen as a further and serious injustice. My noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway has done the cause of justice a signal service in the way in which he brought his Motion to the House the night before last. It would surprise us all, I think now, if either by the route which he promoted, or by the Secretary of State's current review, Fisher and Wright were not soon released. Indeed, I am told by journalists that leaks--I hasten to say, no doubt unauthorised--from the Northern Ireland Office say that they will be released before the end of the next month.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-06_para3"></a>As we know--the Minister has told us--he hopes that the release of the terrorist prisoners will commence at the beginning of September. If my noble friend's route is the belt, my amendment is the braces of a belt and braces approach to the matter. We know that the Petition <P>


<a name="column_890"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 890</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will lie upon the Secretary of State's desk in just the same way as does the present review. I doubt whether any of us would wish those soldiers to be left to use the provisions of this Bill to secure their release. But if none of the other three possible routes which were laid out by the Minister leads to their release, they may well be driven, and are entitled, to use the provisions of the Bill. If so, the applications of men in their circumstances should be accorded priority over those of terrorists. Nothing less would be fair.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-06_para4"></a>That is what the amendment would secure. It would also secure an opportunity for Members of another place to consider these matters afresh and express their own view upon them in the light of our debate the night before last on my noble friend's Motion. I think that all of us who were present for that Motion, or who have read the account in the official record, will realise that there are grave doubts about the safety of the conviction of those two men.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-06_para5"></a>It would be helpful if it were not seen to be just this House supporting the review of the conviction and sentence of those two men. It would be very helpful if we could send this Bill back to the other place, amended in this way, so that the Members of the other place could express their view, which I believe would be overwhelmingly akin to that which has been expressed in this House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-06_time0"></A><H5>4 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, it is not possible to speak to either Amendments Nos. 1 or 2 without also speaking to the sister amendment relating to implementation, Amendment No. 13. All these amendments are opposed because they are contrary to the best interests of Guardsmen Fisher and Wright as regards release as soon as possible, as now protected on the Humble Address debate. For it was then accepted unanimously by your Lordships that release under the Clause 3 linkage, to which I objected in any event, was not appropriate and that release under the Royal Prerogative was in no way inhibited. The exposition of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, was a truly memorable, constructive speech.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-06_para6"></a>As regards Amendment No. 13--I do not know whether your Lordships have seen the Belfast agreement--to delay until 31st August--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for giving way. It will save the time of the House and perhaps his energy if I say that I do not intend to move Amendment No. 13.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux, has his name to the amendment, any other noble Lord can move it and I shall be very brief about it. At paragraph 6 on page 10, the document provides that the British and Irish Governments will take all necessary steps to facilitate the decommissioning process to include bringing the relevant schemes into force by the end of June.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-06_para7"></a>One of the relevant schemes is the mechanism to provide for the accelerated process for release--I refer to page 35--which is reflected in Clause 3. The Bill <P>


<a name="column_891"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 891</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>came to this House only at the end of June. The only conceivable reason for postponing an Act beyond the Recess is to afford time in which Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 can be implemented.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-06_para8"></a>I keep coming back to Guardsmen Fisher and Wright because I am much more interested in them than in any other aspect of the debate. As far as they are concerned, Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 directly affect their interests as to release; whereas before, the amendment to Clause 21, which is now Clause 22, was withdrawn in Committee, negatived on Report, albeit supported by my noble friend Lord Cope of Berkeley, if only to make a strong signal for release as soon as possible. That indirectly affected their interests as to release, but the signal is now on its way as a result of the humble Address. The form of the amendments has changed, but the substance remains precisely the same.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-06_para9"></a>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 to Clause 3 import the same type of precondition to the implementation of the Belfast agreement as reflected in this Clause 3 linkage. If this is accepted, it would inevitably deprive the Government of moral authority to continue to foster the peace process. The argument was deployed in Committee on 6th July and at the Report on 16th July and I have no intention of boring your Lordships further by seeking to deploy it on the third time of asking.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-06_para10"></a>I comment not in any sense of seeking to be unkind or controversial, but Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 13 embark on the plotted course of political confrontation. They cannot be accepted by the Government; the Government have made it totally plain that they cannot accept them and why they cannot accept them. I say with respect to my noble friend Lord Tebbit--he knows that I have a great respect for him--who said that the Government would introduce an amendment to this Bill in the Commons, that elephants might fly! The Government will never do it; they have made perfectly plain the fact that they cannot and will not do it. Therefore, to what purpose are these amendments to be supported, if they would hazard peace in the Province?
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-06_para11"></a>In conclusion, in the humble Address debate, noble Lords on all sides of the House decided to eschew confrontation and follow the path of persuasion in the best interests of these guardsmen who, although not named in Amendments Nos. 1 and 2, are inevitably involved. As these amendments cannot serve the best interests of Guardsmen Fisher and Wright, to what constructive purpose shall your Lordships support them?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Renwick of Clifton: </B>   My Lords, this house has devoted many hours of discussion, and rightly so, to the cases of Guardsmen Fisher and Wright, to whom these amendments clearly refer. They have been before us in a variety of guises and I admire the tenacity of the noble Lords, Lord Tebbit and Lord Molyneaux, in pursuit of a good cause, but not the method by which they are seeking to pursue it now.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-06_para12"></a>As others have said, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State is reviewing these cases and a decision can be expected by the end of August. Meanwhile, we have just voted a Petition to Her Majesty asking her to exercise the Royal Prerogative of Mercy <P>


<a name="column_892"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 892</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in these cases, which no doubt will also be referred to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State has the power to order the release of these guardsmen and my noble friend the Minister will have taken the universal conviction from all parts of the House that she should use it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-06_para13"></a>I share the hope of the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, that the two guardsmen will be released before any convicted terrorist receives accelerated release under the provisions of this Bill. I entirely agree with him, the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux, and others that this is an injustice which must be righted and I am convinced that very soon it will be righted.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-06_para14"></a>However, that is not a reason to amend the Bill before us today. The Bill gives effect to an agreement negotiated between the parties in Northern Ireland which affords the best hope for a more peaceful future for the Province than in the previous three decades. We cannot now add new conditions without those two being negotiated with the parties and starting the whole negotiation over again--and that, clearly, we are not going to do.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-06_para15"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, has expressed serious reservations, to say the least, about the agreement. Certainly, he gives the impression that he does not expect it to succeed. But the great majority of the people of Northern Ireland, who voted on the matter, do support the agreement and they very much want it to be given the chance to succeed. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, that the agreement will not end terrorism, as we have all too clearly seen from the actions of groups on both sides, including the tragedy at Ballymoney in the past few days.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-06_para16"></a>However, there is now at last the real prospect of drastically reducing terrorism and public support for it, of reducing these organisations to the character of splinter groups without significant support and of marginalising the men of violence and extremists on both sides, thereby giving the people of Northern Ireland the prospect of a better and more peaceful future. I do not for one moment believe that the House would wish to do anything that would compromise the chances of achieving that essential goal.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-06_para17"></a>I am convinced that there is near universal support in the House for the agreement, as there is for the release of the guardsmen, and that the House will understand that it would be irresponsible to seek to introduce new conditions now. I also believe that it would be wholly inappropriate in any way to link the cases of these two guardsmen, who in the course of their duties made a fatal mistake, to those of prisoners convicted of premeditated acts of terrorism. I very much hope that the noble Lords will, on reflection, decide to withdraw their amendments. I must urge noble Lords not to support them.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Steel of Aikwood: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may say a few words on behalf of my noble friends. I strongly support, as do all my noble friends, the campaign for the release of Guardsmen Fisher and Wright. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, was kind enough to pay a justified tribute to my noble <P>


<a name="column_893"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 893</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>friend Lord Thomas of Gresford for his speech on this subject on our behalf on Monday night. So there is no doubt on that question. Like the noble Lord, Lord Renwick of Clifton, I also admire the tenacity of the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, in seeking yet another occasion to press the case.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-07_para0"></a>However, the fundamental position that we take on these Benches is the one already articulated; namely, that these amendments cannot be supported by us principally because they lay down conditions which are not contained in the Belfast agreement. We must remind ourselves that that agreement, which was finally concluded on Good Friday, was painfully and painstakingly negotiated. No one party should seek unilaterally to make changes to that agreement lest the whole agreement should unravel. Indeed, it is a delicate enough instrument as it is and we should leave it as it is.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bramall: </B>   My Lords, I know that the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, has tabled his amendment with the best possible motives and with the best interests of Guardsmen Fisher and Wright at heart. However, having had that very full debate on Monday night, which ended with the unanimous agreement of your Lordships' House to send a humble Address to Her Majesty asking for the Royal Prerogative of Mercy, and also having been assured by the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, that the full weight of your Lordships' unanimous view would be passed to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, who is in a position to exercise that prerogative, I wonder whether we are not muddying the waters by trying to link in any way the, hopefully, imminent release of these guardsmen with the future release of some terrorists for purely political purposes.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Merlyn-Rees: </B>   My Lords, we should all listen carefully to those who have spoken so far in the debate, and not least to the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, who has led so forcefully in recent weeks on the case of the two guardsmen. The three amendments now before us are linked to the release of the guardsmen and I do not wish to add to the words that have been spoken or, indeed, to the words of warning about voting on the amendments and perhaps passing them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-07_para1"></a>I should like to raise a practical point about the amendments. Amendment No. 1, tabled in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux, refers to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a prisoner who is or has been a member of a terrorist or proscribed organisation", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-07_para2"></a>while the amendment tabled in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, refers, in much the same terms, to membership of such organisations. But how does one prove membership? In my time in Northern Ireland I was advised that membership was usually a makeweight. I had a membership card for the Labour Party in my wallet, but these people do not go around carrying a membership card on their person which will actually prove membership of a proscribed or terrorist organisation. Indeed, such membership is almost impossible to prove. That is a weakness in the amendments which would make it difficult for the Secretary of State when deciding what orders she should <P>


<a name="column_894"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 894</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>make in connection with release. It would be almost impossible to prove the membership of those who are referred to in the Bill. That is another weakness in the amendments, and I hope that the House will take that into account.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord. However, I should point out to him that that is why my amendment also refers to supporters. That is the expression used in the Bill and it is from there that I have imported it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-07_time0"></A><H5>4.15 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Dunleath: </B>   My Lords, I have not spoken to the previous amendments on the subject tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, either in Committee or on Report, as I am aware of the possible complications that such amendments might cause. However, I firmly believe that the mood of your Lordships' House last Thursday showed much sympathy with the amendment as then tabled. Certainly, it had the support of the Opposition Front Bench. It was clear on these Benches at least that the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, intended to withdraw the amendment on Report. I believe I speak for many noble Lords when I say that the confusion that followed, which led to the amendment being negatived, was most unsatisfactory.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-07_para3"></a>I was sorry that other commitments in Northern Ireland prevented me from being present when the humble Address was moved by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, on Monday evening regarding Guardsmen Fisher and Wright. However, I have read the Hansard report with care and I am delighted that there may now be a further lever that can be used to secure the release of these two soldiers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-07_para4"></a>Much has been made, and rightly so, by noble Lords who have served in Northern Ireland of the fact that they might have found themselves in exactly the same situation as Fisher and Wright. I believe the noble Earl, Lord Carlisle, said, "There but for the grace of God go I". It has crossed my mind that the continued incarceration of the two guardsmen could have an effect on soldiers currently serving in Northern Ireland, whereby the implications of their opening fire could just cause that moment of hesitation which would give the terrorists a tactical advantage, leading to the injury or death of a member of the security forces. That would be a truly deplorable situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-07_para5"></a>All of us who have served in Northern Ireland will be aware of the paramount importance attached to the Rules of Engagement as summarised in the yellow card. It is quite clear on this occasion that the warnings were given in accordance with the yellow card to McBride and that, as he chose to ignore them, the guardsmen were entitled to fire at him believing that he was carrying a coffee jar bomb. McBride was offered an opportunity to surrender, which is never, ever given to the many off-duty, part-time UDR soldiers or RUC officers who have been shot, maimed or blown up by the IRA.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-07_para6"></a>Quite clearly, there has been a miscarriage of justice, and it is quite wrong that Guardsmen Fisher and Wright should continue to be locked up in prison. <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>The amendments put forward by the noble Lords, Lord Molyneaux and Lord Tebbit, today give Parliament, both your Lordships' House and another place, an input and a chance to think again; and, indeed, a say in the future of these two soldiers. It is a further mechanism available if their release continues to be unnecessarily delayed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-07_para7"></a>I hope that the Minister will have more encouraging news for us today--more encouraging indeed than the previously announced date for the Secretary of State's review being completed by the end of August. Moreover, can the Minister give the House any reasons whatever why Guardsmen Fisher and Wright cannot be released into the care of their regiment, pending the pronouncement by the Secretary of State?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-07_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Davies of Coity: </B>   My Lords, in opposing these three amendments, I should like to concentrate my arguments on Amendment No. 2. I believe that everyone in this House recognises that the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, has consistently and well-meaningly advanced a crusade on behalf of Guardsmen Fisher and Wright. However, the purpose of my arguments is, it is to be hoped, to persuade the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, to withdraw his amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-07_para8"></a>We have had a debate about the Royal Prerogative of Mercy and there has been widespread support for it. We know that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is reviewing the circumstances. Everyone is sympathetic with the issue surrounding the imprisonment at present of Guardsmen Fisher and Wright; but in our determination to secure their release we should ask ourselves whether we ought to be doing so as a condition of passing a Bill that is in fact intended to bring about peace in Northern Ireland, which we have not had for decades. The noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, used some very emotive terms. He talked about rewarding criminals and drew attention to past crimes. We are all aware of those circumstances. But is it not our objective to prevent criminality in the future and prevent those horrendous crimes occurring again? That is the case we have to address.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-07_para9"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, said that this will be the belt that is added to the braces. I do not share that view. I think that if we attempt to secure the release of the guardsmen as a simple condition of passing this Bill, it will become a propaganda weapon in the hands of those who are opposed to peace in Northern Ireland. I suggest that the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, think hard and long about that. I hope that he will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-07_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rowallan: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Coity, is absolutely right. This is an emotive subject. However, it is most emotive of all for Guardsmen Fisher and Wright who are languishing in gaol when other people may be released. They must applaud the efforts of my noble friends Lord Tebbit and Lord Campbell of Alloway to obtain their release. The noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux, is now trying to do that too. The guardsmen must feel sad that no one thought of them when the Good Friday agreement was drawn up. I hope that the Minister can answer my next question. How was it possible for the Prime Minister of <P>

<P>
<A NAME="80722-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, last Thursday, when a similar amendment was moved, I would have been inclined to support it. However, I think we have to take into account the fact that a Motion was passed unanimously, without a vote, on Monday which attempts to invoke the Royal Prerogative. We must listen to what the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, and others have said; namely, that we must not upset the agreement in any way. They say that the agreement is sacrosanct. I can understand that, but before I decide how I vote today I hope my noble friend on the Front Bench will be able to assure me that that operates on both sides and that if we see this agreement as sacrosanct, Her Majesty's Government will also insist that the Government of the Irish Republic consider it to be sacrosanct too, and that there will be no alteration to the Good Friday agreement by the Government of the Irish Republic. I hope that my noble friend will be able to answer that.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, I support Amendment No. 2, which I prefer to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux, because its wording is more limited and it avoids the difficulty to which the noble Lord, Lord Merlyn-Rees, drew attention. As already stated, your Lordships have discussed the cases of Guardsmen Fisher and Wright several times recently and the Minister is in no doubt about the strong views held on the subject in all parts of the House. In particular, my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway initiated an extremely moving and memorable debate in which an important decision was made by this House. However, like my noble friend Lord Tebbit, I wish to see belt and braces in this matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-08_para0"></a>This is, of course, a much more moderate amendment than the amendment that my noble friend Lord Tebbit moved to this Bill the other night. This amendment would not hold up the whole Bill--that was the point made the other night--but seeks to establish the order in which the cases should be considered by the review commission. The amendment of my noble friend Lord Tebbit does not make it a condition that the guardsmen should be released; it simply ensures that their cases are processed before other cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-08_para1"></a>It has been said that this amendment is contrary to the agreement. I have looked again at the agreement and I cannot see anything contrary to the point made in the amendment. Certainly I do not think anyone has suggested--I do not think anyone would suggest--that it would be contrary to the agreement if the two guardsmen were to be released by another process. I refer to the process that my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway suggested the other night, which the House supported, or the Secretary of State's review, which was in train before that, which might lead to their <P>


<a name="column_897"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 897</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>release. If they were released under one of those processes before anyone else's case was considered under this Bill--as far as I can see, the chance of any case under this Bill having completed its consideration before those processes are exhausted is small indeed-- I do not think anyone in this House would claim that to be contrary to the agreement.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-08_para2"></a>The agreement does not specifically provide for any particular order in which the cases should be considered. Without the amendment the Bill leaves the question to the rules to be introduced under Schedule 2. There will be some rules which will settle the order in which the cases are considered. I take it that no one will complain that that is against the agreement. All the amendment does is settle the order in favour of the cases of Guardsmen Fisher and Wright being considered first. Nor do I believe that acceptance of the amendment would seriously delay the consideration of other cases. I do not believe that the consideration of the cases of Guardsmen Fisher and Wright would take the commission long, certainly not so as to make any serious dent in the timetable.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-08_para3"></a>However, I know that many noble Lords, and indeed others, while wanting to see the guardsmen released as soon as possible, hate the idea that they should be released under the terms of this Bill. They believe that that would equate the guardsmen with terrorists. I share that distaste to some extent and I certainly understand why people think that way. However, I do not think that that should prevent this route being used by the guardsmen, if necessary. It seems to me that under the Bill they are entirely entitled to apply. The Bill requires that a prisoner should be serving a sentence for a scheduled offence, as the two guardsmen are.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for giving way. Of course, they are entitled to apply, but this House has decided unanimously that it is wholly inappropriate that they should.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for my noble friend's confirmation that they are entitled to apply. I shall return to that point in a moment. Certainly, I did not think that the House decided the other night on the method suggested by my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway in preference to another method. The House decided to support the method proposed by my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway--it was entirely right that it should--but that does not prevent the braces being there as well as the belt.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-08_para4"></a>I was saying that the guardsmen are entitled to apply in the sense that they are serving a sentence for a scheduled offence. The other requirement of the Bill is that they should not belong to a terrorist organisation. They do not, and they never have belonged to a terrorist organisation. Therefore, I do not believe that it would take the review commissioners 30 seconds to decide that they were "qualifying prisoners" in the words of the Bill. So the only consideration for their immediate release by this route would be whether they would otherwise serve half as long again as they have already served. I cannot believe that a decision on that would take the commissioners more than another 30 seconds.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-08_para5"></a>Regardless of the fact that other methods of release are being pursued, I do not believe that these men should hold back from applying, when the opportunity offers itself, to be released in this manner. They would indeed be wise to go for the braces, as it were, as well as the belt.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-08_para6"></a>Those who have served the forces of law and order have as much right to benefit from the agreement as those who have opposed them. Most of those who will be released under the terms of the Bill have opposed law and order. They have been terrorists, even though the Bill requires that they should no longer belong to a terrorist organisation in order to qualify for release. Because I believe that those who have served the forces of law and order have as much right as anybody to benefit from the provisions of the Bill, I support Amendment No. 2.

<P>
<A NAME="80722-08_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Brookeborough: </B>   My Lords, the argument has reached such a high level on constitutional and legal matters that it is very difficult to see the wood for the trees. What we are talking about is the release of the two Scots guardsmen as soon as possible. We have been told by the Minister that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland will have made her decision within the next few weeks. Following the humble Address to Her Majesty on Monday, that would undoubtedly mean that this amendment would no longer be required.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-08_para7"></a>However, if one looks at the history of (dare one say it?) the reward for terrorism and what has gone on in the past few years, it would appear to most of us that the appeasement of terrorism has normally been at the expense of most other events. For instance, we have received no weapons and the IRA has now conveniently given them away to splinter groups, so we may never receive them. People in Northern Ireland are afraid that if we do not take a "belt and braces" approach, we shall be let down yet again by what appears to be a reward for terrorism and a delay in all other matters affecting the normal law-abiding people of the Province.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-08_para8"></a>I am inclined to support the amendment for that reason--being, as I hope, part of that law-abiding community, being involved in it and knowing the feelings of people about both this Government and the previous one, who have tended to give something for nothing in return. This time, we want Guardsmen Fisher and Wright, and we have a right to that.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-08_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, I have not spoken on this matter before but, having been a guardsman for 12 years, I believe that it would be nothing less than awful if the two guardsmen had to apply for release under the terms of this Bill. In the 1970s, I was faced with a decision while travelling quickly in a "patchy" country, as it was termed, at night when it was wet, whether or not to drive through a road-block. I drove through it. They did not shoot at me. I am still here today. Had they done so, they might well have been within their rights. Security forces had been killed in that area in the previous week, I was on the list and I could not take that risk.

<A NAME = "80722-08_para9"></a>The guardsmen were doing their best in appallingly difficult conditions. I was horrified when they were condemned, particularly in this country. If they had to stoop to apply for release under this Bill, it would be a blooming disgrace to the British judiciary and all that we stand for.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-08_spnew6"></A><B> Viscount Slim: </B>   My Lords, I feel that we have rather missed the point; namely, to achieve the release of the guardsmen as soon as possible. No timescale has been given. During the debate the other evening we were given four or five options by the Minister. But through the judicial process they could take years. We are trying to secure the release of the guardsmen now. No one from the Front Benches on either side of this House has indicated a way forward so as to do that quickly. I hope that the Minister now has something else to say. Frankly, his remarks the other evening were not impressive. The procedures referred to are lengthy; they could go on for months. This House deserves a speedy reply, and the speedy release of these two very brave guardsmen.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="80722-09_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Northern Ireland Office   (Lord Dubs): </B>  My Lords, I appreciate yet again the strength of feeling shown on all sides of the House about these two guardsmen. They do not need to apply under the Bill. I have explained--and shall repeat for the sake of avoidance of doubt--that the procedures under the Bill are of course open to them. However, the Secretary of State has indicated to the guardsmen that she is currently reviewing their cases. She has also indicated that she will be able to arrive at a conclusion and, if necessary, have consulted the Lord Chief Justice and the trial judge by the end of next month. That is not far away. Of course, every day in custody is too long for people who are detained. But in terms of the Secretary of State's commitment to arriving at a decision quickly, I believe that that is still a clear avenue. I do not believe that it will take years, as the noble Lord said. But that is--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-09_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Denton of Wakefield: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for giving way. He mentioned that the Secretary of State will consult the Lord Chief Justice if necessary. Last week, I understood the Minister to say that that was necessary. Has the situation now changed?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   No, my Lords, it has not changed. If the Secretary of State is minded to release the guardsmen, the procedure is that she consults the Lord Chief Justice and the trial judge. My words, "if necessary", were not necessary in themselves. I thank the noble Baroness for correcting me.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-09_para0"></a>I suggest that these are not lengthy procedures in the scheme of things. I appreciate, as does the Secretary of State, the concern of this House that a quick decision should be arrived at.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-09_para1"></a>Perhaps I may deal with one or two specific points that were made before dealing with the substance of the amendments. There is no suggestion whatever of changing the qualifying date of 10th April. Indeed, this is Third Reading and we should have needed an <P>


<a name="column_900"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 900</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendment to that effect if that were to be on the face of the Bill. There is absolutely no intention on the part of the Government to change that qualifying date.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-09_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, spoke of the appeasement of wicked men. Yes, the terrorists are wicked men. People who bomb, shoot and murder innocent people are wicked men. But this Bill is not an attempt to appease wicked men. It is an attempt to give effect to an agreement that is supported by virtually all the political parties in Northern Ireland--loyalist, unionist, nationalist and republican--as well as by this Government and the Government of the Republic. The intention is to give effect to an agreement. I suggest, as I have before, that without this Bill there would be no agreement. Your Lordships have to decide whether what is at stake in Northern Ireland--the prize of peace--is so important, as I believe it is, that one has to deal with certain measures on the way, about which we all feel very uncomfortable, to say the least.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-09_para3"></a>I was asked by my noble friend Lord Stoddart whether the agreement was even-handed as regards whether all those who supported it should continue supporting it. Yes, of course; we regard the agreement as a complete package. All the political parties, as well as this Government and the Government of the Republic, are bound by it. One of the reasons that the Government resisted some of the amendments suggested at earlier stages is because they would have undermined the sense of integrity of that package. If we were to change the parts of the agreement within our control, we should not have the authority to say to others that they may not change the parts of the agreement within their control. That is why we have to hold the line in the way that we have.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-09_para4"></a>I wish to make three other introductory comments. First, of course, this House has debated the matter on a number of occasions; but we have also come to decisions on a number of occasions. Last Monday we came to a clear decision on a way forward, which was supported unanimously by the House. Secondly, I suggest that the effect of the amendments would be counter-productive: they would not achieve the ends wished for and argued for by the noble Lords who have tabled them. Thirdly, as I have indicated, the Secretary of State is already reviewing the cases.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-09_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Onslow: </B>   My Lords, what is there to review? The facts are known. The Royal Prerogative is a weapon which can be used. Why can it not just be used? We know the facts on this issue. These guardsmen have been locked up and almost certainly should not have been. There are no more facts to know; there is nothing more to review.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, as I indicated on the previous occasion, the Secretary of State has to review several thousand pages. She has had other evidence put before her from the solicitors of the two guardsmen. We have to have a proper procedure, to which the Secretary of State is committed. She is currently following that <P>


<a name="column_901"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 901</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>procedure. I believe that that is a proper way forward, and that is the path that the Secretary of State has indicated that she is following.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-09_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister not agree that this cuts both ways? If the Government wish to preserve the agreement, as everyone does, unusual action--which is available to the Secretary of State--should be taken by the Government. Surely it is not necessary for the Secretary of State herself to read all the thousands of pages? Does she have no staff who can make a summary? I find it extremely difficult to believe that it is not within the power of the Government, and of the Secretary of State in particular, having been offered the solution of the Royal Prerogative, to cut through the red tape and save the agreement without putting the guardsmen to the wholly improper indignity of having it suggested that they might secure their freedom through the Bill. No one wants that, not least the guardsmen themselves, I should think. The Secretary of State has powers, and those powers should be used. We should not be left to feel that we must send a signal to them and the people of Northern Ireland that we believe in good, not ill, through supporting the amendment; we should be given an opportunity to be absolutely certain that the right answer will emerge soon.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-09_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, I understand what the noble Baroness is saying, but we are dealing with the liberty of two individuals who have been convicted in a court. It is no light matter for a Government Minister to override the decision of a court. That has to be done after thought has been given to it. It is not something that can be delegated totally to officials. The Secretary of State herself, as an individual, has an awesome responsibility. This will be one exercise of that awesome responsibility. It would not be easy for me to say to her that the House says that she should delegate the work to an official; that the official should tell her what to do; and that she should then do it. The noble Baroness was not suggesting that the official would order the Secretary of State what to do. It is a serious responsibility. It is not easy for this House to suggest that the Secretary of State should abdicate that responsibility by delegating it to someone else, who would then advise her. She will receive advice, but in the end she has to make the decision. In a case such as this, given the enormous concern that has been expressed and the new evidence that came forward in the debate in this House on Monday, I do not believe that it is a task that the Secretary of State should treat lightly. I believe that she is approaching it in the serious way that this House would wish her to.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-09_spnew6"></A><B> Viscount Brookeborough: </B>   My Lords, the Minister suggested that the Secretary of State had certain procedures to go through and a large number of cases to deal with. He was perhaps implying that there were other cases in the pipeline. There have been procedures over the years for the early release of prisoners. We have spent the last weeks, and longer, discussing special procedures for the terrorists. A condition of this should <P>


<a name="column_902"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 902</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>perhaps be that she should change the order in which she is looking at cases. A measure is already going through for the terrorists: when the Bill goes through, they will be able to use the procedure under it. Among all the cases that the Secretary of State is dealing with, and given the strong feeling on the matter, surely the case of the guardsmen can at least be taken immediately, as a high priority, accepting that the Secretary of State has a great many papers to look at concerning that case.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-09_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, I am not aware that the Secretary of State is currently looking at any cases other than those of Fisher and Wright. If I am wrong about that, I will let your Lordships know. My understanding is that that is the only substantial case that she is looking at. It is the procedure that she follows in regard to the case of the two guardsmen to which I referred.
<P>

<A NAME="80722-09_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Waddington: </B>   My Lords--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-09_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, we are at Third Reading. I understand that this is a very sensitive subject, but no Peer should speak more than once. Noble Lords are allowed to ask the Minister short questions for clarification when he has finished, but one should not continue with speeches at Third Reading and one should certainly not speak more than once.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-09_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Waddington: </B>   My Lords, I shall not detain the Minister for more than a moment. If the Minister has no other cases on her desk at the present time, and as all the evidence in relation to this case is available, why on earth need it take four or five weeks to come to a conclusion? If the will is there, she could surely come to a conclusion tomorrow.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, I do not think that I can add to the answer that I have given. The Secretary of State has many other matters to deal with, as your Lordships will be aware. One cannot simply stop the whole peace process, the work of the new assembly and all the things with which the Secretary of State is involved because of one case, important though it is. Her responsibilities oblige her to do other things, as well. I suggest that she is moving pretty quickly. I assure the House that I shall pass on to the Secretary of State all the arguments that have been put today about the need for expedition. I shall make sure that she is aware of that very quickly following this debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-10_para0"></a>Perhaps I may deal with the substance of the amendments. The amendment spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux, seeks to ensure that prisoners who are not members, or who have not been members, of proscribed or terrorist organisations should have their applications considered first when the commissioners begin their work under the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-10_para1"></a>The question of the listing of applications was considered in your Lordships' House both in Committee and at Report. I explained the Government's view that it was important that the commissioners should themselves establish clear rules for prioritising which cases should be considered first and that they would be <P>


<a name="column_903"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 903</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>required to make known such rules. I suggested that the commissioners would want to take account of matters such as those identified by the noble Baroness, Lady Denton, as well as when the prisoner would be likely to be released if granted a declaration. However, at no time did any noble Lord suggest a priority rule of the kind proposed by the noble Lords, Lord Tebbit or Lord Molyneaux, before the amendments for today's debate were tabled.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-10_para2"></a>Indeed, there are a number of problems and difficulties with each of the amendments that relate to the listing of cases and I shall try to explain those problems for the benefit of your Lordships' House. It is important that we consider the detailed problems. This is the Third Reading of the Bill. It is not as though we were in Committee and amendments could be withdrawn and retabled. This is the last opportunity that the House will have to deal with amendments in this way.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-10_para3"></a>Amendment No. 1 ties the priority of consideration to the idea of membership of a proscribed or terrorist organisation. Noble Lords will be aware that to be a member of a proscribed organisation is a criminal offence under the Emergency Provisions Act 1996 as well as under the Acts of that name which preceded the 1996 Act. In practice, only a small number of those convicted of terrorist offences are convicted of being a member of a proscribed organisation. Very often they will be convicted of other offences. In the absence of such a conviction it would be difficult for the commissioners to find that a person was or had been a member of a proscribed organisation. To do so would be to act as though the person had been convicted of a criminal offence and to treat him less favourably as a consequence when in fact there had been no conviction. Noble Lords will understand that to discriminate in that way without proper legal foundation for the decision would probably not be upheld by the courts. In one sense that may be a technical point, but it is also a point of principle which undermines the effectiveness of the amendment in achieving what the noble Lord wants.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-10_para4"></a>A further problem presents itself with regard to membership of a terrorist organisation. Again the term "terrorist organisation" is a term used in this Bill. A terrorist organisation is an organisation identified by the Secretary of State under Clause 3(8) of this Bill. Whether the Bill should be expressed in the manner in which it is currently drafted is a matter to which I shall return later.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-10_para5"></a>It may be the case that all the organisations specified by the Secretary of State under the Bill as terrorist organisations are also proscribed organisations. In that case no new problem over and above that which I have already identified arises. But if that is not the case and if an organisation is specified by the Secretary of State under Clause 3(8) which is not a proscribed organisation the amendment would place a new responsibility on the commissioners. They would be required to consider whether an applicant was or had been a member of a terrorist organisation.

<A NAME = "80722-10_para6"></a>In that case the commissioners would be required to consider all the applications that they receive to decide which prisoners were members of the organisation or organisations in question and which were not. That would be an onerous undertaking and the amendment would require that it be completed before the formal consideration of any single application. Indeed, this latter fact may delay the consideration of the cases that the amendment is intended to benefit. That is why I suggest that the amendments would be counter-productive.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-10_para7"></a>If that approach were taken, every case would have to be considered against that criterion before any application could be determined. Prisoners and their representatives would want to make representations and present evidence, in particular, because the finding by the commissioners would be relevant to whether a prisoner satisfied the conditions for release. It could take a considerable period of time before any decisions were made at all. Clearly, that is undesirable. It is important that the commissioners are able to get down to the work of considering cases quickly.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-10_para8"></a>In addition to the problems with applying these new tests to the existing state of affairs, both this amendment and Amendment No. 2 would require that the commissioners also give consideration to the historical position of the prisoner--whether at any time in the past he had been a member or a supporter of a proscribed or terrorist organisation. That would greatly extend the investigation that the commissioners were required to engage in. Indeed, the consideration of the order in which cases are to be considered would be made in many ways a more onerous task than the consideration of cases against the statutory criteria.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-10_para9"></a>The amendment spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, would require that applications from members of the Armed Forces convicted of murder committed while on duty in Northern Ireland should be considered first. Of course, it is clear which cases the noble Lord has in mind. Again, there are a series of problems with the amendment. First, in addition to applying the tests that are currently in the legislation, the commissioners would have to decide whether a prisoner was a supporter of a proscribed organisation. As with the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux, that would add new responsibilities to the work of the commissioners.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-10_para10"></a>Secondly, Amendment No. 2 would require the commissioners to decide whether a prisoner was a supporter of a terrorist organisation and to consider such cases after the consideration of applications from prisoners who are members of the Armed Forces. This test, which would be used for setting a priority order, is identical to the second condition contained on the face of the Bill. But that cannot be the case. If the commissioners considered that a prisoner was a supporter of a terrorist organisation, they should not consider the application at a later date; they should refuse the application altogether on the grounds that a condition necessary for release had failed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-10_para11"></a>That raises a further problem similar to that identified in relation to the amendment spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux. As the decision would be likely <P>


<a name="column_905"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 905</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to affect the consideration of the merits of the application and would be based on similar evidence, prisoners would have to be provided with the facility to make representations and present evidence before the decision was taken. As I explained before, if the process of setting the order in which cases were to be considered was amended in that way, setting that order would itself become a major undertaking for the commissioners.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-10_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Bledisloe: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Lord not accept that all that has to happen under the amendment is that applications from members of the services are considered first? There are only two of those. Once that has been done, no further order needs to be cited. The argument in respect of Amendment No. 2 is absolutely inaccurate, though it was correct in relation to Amendment No. 1.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, I think not. But let me finish my case. It is not as simple as the noble Viscount suggests. I have talked about the need to allow prisoners to be able to make representations.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-10_para12"></a>A third problem with Amendment No. 2 is that the amendment considers the priority to be given to two groups of cases--members of the Armed Forces convicted of murder committed in the course of their duties in Northern Ireland and supporters of terrorist or proscribed organisations. What the amendment does not address--to answer the noble Viscount--is the position of applicants who are not a member of either category. Are they to be considered before all other prisoners? After all other prisoners? In parallel with the consideration of soldiers and terrorists, past or present? In that respect the amendment is clearly defective. It is a recipe for confusion and uncertainty designed to weaken or damage the Bill and with it the implementation of the agreement.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-10_para13"></a>These are not technical considerations. We are dealing with rights under law and rights of individuals. We are dealing with the need to have proper processes. If we cut corners, I fear that there will be endless litigation and justice will not have been achieved.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-10_para14"></a>I have set out some of the practical problems behind each of the amendments relating to the listing of cases. In addition, both amendments would require that the commissioners treat prisoners who are or have been members of proscribed or terrorist organisations differently from other prisoners considered under the Bill, whether members of the Armed Forces or not. The agreement draws no distinction between prisoners on the basis of their past or present association, save if they are supporters of organisations that have not established or are not maintaining complete and unequivocal ceasefires in which case the commissioners may not grant them a declaration. The release arrangements are to apply to all prisoners convicted of scheduled offences and sentenced to five years or more or life imprisonment. Within that category no further distinction is made by the agreement and your Lordships' House should not add one at this time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-10_para15"></a>As I made clear, both amendments are clearly defective in detail and wrong in principle. They would bring confusion and uncertainty to the Bill. The <P>


<a name="column_906"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 906</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendments, if accepted, would prevent the implementation of the Good Friday agreement and that cannot be allowed to happen.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-10_para16"></a>Perhaps I may briefly refer to the third amendment mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit. The noble Lord shakes his head to say that he does not want to proceed with it. However, it relates to a different issue and therefore, whatever the House were to decide on the first or second amendments, would have no bearing on the merits or demerits of the third. It would seriously go against the Good Friday agreement.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-10_para17"></a>In conclusion, even if noble Lords wish to achieve what the movers of the two amendments wish to achieve, I would suggest that the amendments will not do that. The amendments are defective, they are counter-productive and they would not achieve the ends aimed for. But, in a wider sense, I would suggest-- I very much agree with the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway--that it is not right in principle to link the release of these two guardsmen with the Bill. The Secretary of State has made clear what she is doing, what she intends to do and how she intends to set about it. Attempting, as it were, to politicise the argument by linking it with the Bill is neither in the interests of the guardsmen nor is it a proper way to proceed with the Bill.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="80722-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>   My Lords, conscious of the urgency and importance of subsequent business, and of the indication given by the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, that he may wish to test the opinion of the House, I beg leave to withdraw Amendment No. 1.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-11_para0"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Tebbit </B>   moved Amendment No. 2:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 1, line 23, at end insert (", but no application by a prisoner who is or has been a supporter of a terrorist or proscribed organisation shall be processed before any application made by a prisoner who is a member of the naval, military or air forces of the Crown serving a sentence of imprisonment in respect of a conviction for murder committed in the course of his duties in Northern Ireland").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80722-11_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I believe it is within my right just to reply briefly to the noble Lord; and I shall do so if I may. I believe that the strength of a case is normally in inverse relation to the length of the speech making the case. The fact is that if the two guardsmen are released by the end of August there will be no application for the amendment. There will be no problems to it. The problem with the humble Address route is that the humble Address will land on the desk of the Secretary of State, who gave her view last October that the guardsmen had not served sufficiently long in prison. What is more, the Prime Minister said on 3rd June in the other place that the Secretary of State would start to look at the applications for release of the guardsmen that day. In fact, as the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, told us, she did not do so until 6th July. So we cannot accept that there is any degree of urgency in the consideration.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-11_para2"></a>The fact is also that it is inconceivable that if the guardsmen are not released by the hand of the Secretary of State their applications under the Bill would be <P>


<a name="column_907"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 907</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>refused. It stands out absolutely clearly that they would not be refused. Despite all the bureaucratic objections--I understand well enough what the Minister was saying--this amendment would make sure that, in the event that the Secretary of State does not release the guardsmen--for obvious reasons, the noble Lord cannot guarantee that she will--their applications would be dealt with as a priority. I cannot, I fear, withdraw the amendment. I beg to move.

<A NAME = "80722-12_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving this amendment I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 4, 6 and 11. These amendments are all concerned with the same purpose. During the earlier consideration of this Bill both in your Lordships' House and in another place, <P>


<a name="column_910"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 910</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>there was some criticism of the use of the phrase "terrorist organisations". It was suggested that the use of the formulation was confusing as there could be organisations that many would consider to be terrorist organisations that would not be identified as such under the terms of the Bill. The point was forcefully put by my noble friend Lord Kilbracken when your Lordships' House considered the Bill in Committee. Noble Lords indicated their agreement with that argument.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-12_para1"></a>The amendments which have been tabled in my name seek to address the problem by replacing each reference to a terrorist organisation by a reference to a specified organisation. A specified organisation would then be an organisation considered by the Secretary of State to be an organisation concerned in terrorism connected with the affairs of Northern Ireland, which has not established or is not maintaining a complete and unequivocal ceasefire. I hope noble Lords will agree to these amendments, which are designed to remove any confusion over the status of those organisations not specified by the Secretary of State under Clause 3(8). I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="80722-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Kilbracken: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for tabling Amendment No. 3 and in precisely the language which I suggested when I spoke off the cuff at Committee stage, and also Amendments Nos. 4, 6 and 11, which are consequential. I think that they do, as he said, remove confusion, make the Bill more comprehensible; and I welcome them.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80722-12_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, some of your Lordships may remember that at Report stage I moved an amendment to Clause 3(5), the purpose of which was to prevent the release of skilled terrorists--say, bomb-makers or snipers--whom the authorities had reason to believe were on the point of being recruited by terrorist organisations in other parts of the world such as Spain, Corsica, the Middle East or the Indian sub-continent. Despite widespread support from every quarter of the House, the Minister rejected it mainly on the grounds that the danger I highlighted was obviated by the provisions of Clause 3(6).
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-12_para5"></a>However, there are two flaws in the Government's argument. The first is that subsection (6) applies only to life prisoners. Therefore, extremely dangerous terrorists who have been awarded determinate sentences of, for example, 20 or 25 years, would not be covered by it. The second flaw is that two eminent and highly experienced legal luminaries--if I may use rather archaic language--namely, the noble Lord, <P>


<a name="column_911"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 911</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord Mishcon, from the Government Benches and the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, from the Conservative Benches, supported my lay supposition that the word "public" might cover only the United Kingdom public, thus leaving the public elsewhere in the world at risk from exported terrorism.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-12_para6"></a>As Amendment No. 3 is a compromise amendment, there is nothing that we can do about the first flaw. The world will still be at risk from released terrorists who have been awarded determinate sentences however evil their crimes. That would appear to be an unfortunate consequence of the Good Friday agreement. But that agreement does not conflict in any way with this very modest amendment designed to overcome the second flaw, or possible flaw. By simply inserting the single and straightforward word "anywhere" for the avoidance of doubt, as suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon--I am grateful to him for that suggestion--it will ensure that the subsection now protects the public throughout the world and not merely in the United Kingdom. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-12_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, I undertook at Report to consider further the matter focused on by this amendment. Noble Lords were concerned that should a life sentence prisoner indicate that he would intend to reside outside the United Kingdom following his release, the commissioners would not be required to consider whether he would be a risk to the public. In particular, the concern was that the "public" referred to in Clause 3(6) did not include the public resident in another country.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-12_para7"></a>Perhaps I may assure the noble Lords that the provision as currently drafted does allow for consideration to be given to the safety of members of the public resident in other jurisdictions. The formulation under consideration is already present in other legislation relating to release and is interpreted in a broad way. An example of this is proceedings before the Parole Board in England and Wales. On occasions the Parole Board will consider the release of prisoners who would be liable to be deported immediately following release from prison. In considering these cases the Parole Board does take account of whether the prisoner would be a danger to the public following release even though it is not the public within the United Kingdom who would be at risk. If the prisoner is thought likely to be a danger, he may not be released.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-12_para8"></a>In addition to there being a precedent for interpreting this provision in a broad way, to amend it may lead to uncertainty in other cases where a similar provision already exists. To take my previous example, if your Lordships' House were to make the amendment that has been proposed, it would be open to doubt whether the Parole Board should take account of the risk to the public outside the United Kingdom. That would clearly be unsatisfactory and is not what is required. As such, I would ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-12_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, as some noble Lords may recall, I have supported similar amendments at earlier stages. I found the Minister's answer reassuring both in the positive sense because he said that <P>


<a name="column_912"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 912</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the provisions, as drafted, apply to the public anywhere, and in the negative sense that this amendment might damage other legislation. Although I think that the point behind the amendment was a good one, perhaps this amendment is not as necessary as it at first seemed.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-12_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, I am heartened by the Minister's assurance that despite the doubts expressed not only by myself, but also by the noble Lords, Lord Mishcon and Lord Campbell of Alloway, at Report, the word "public" does, indeed, embrace the public in the world at large. That is a very important point. I am glad that it has been made clear and that we can rely on it in the future because this debate will appear in print. With that assurance, I am happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

Although it is the Government's view that the amendment makes little difference to the way in which the Bill will operate, the Government are happy to give the further reassurance that is offered by the amendment. Amendments Nos. 8 and 9 are consequential on Amendment No. 7. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="80722-12_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, I wonder whether the Minister can explain something to me. Although I agree that the words "may specify" should be changed to "shall specify", I do not quite understand why it follows that the word "organisations" should become single; hence the need for Amendments Nos. 8 and 9. I should prefer the ultimate amendment to be, "shall specify any organisations".

In view of the high turnout on the Bench of Bishops this afternoon, it seems that repentance is to be valued.

<P>
<A NAME="80722-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley </B>   moved Amendment No. 10:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 2, line 35, after ("account") insert ("all of the following conditions, namely").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80722-13_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I can be brief in moving this amendment because noble Lords who have followed debates on this Bill will know that I have repeatedly tried to convince the Government of the necessity to see the agreement as a whole and not to look solely at page 25 which deals with the issue of prisoners. We have frequently been told by the Prime Minister and others that the agreement should be seen as a whole. We know that nobody likes all of the agreement. The different parties, including ourselves, dislike different parts of it. That is why the agreement has to be taken as a whole. This is my last attempt to get the Minister to acknowledge that in this specific way in the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-13_para1"></a>I have steadily modified my proposals on how that should be done in the direction that the Minister wished. This amendment is weaker than any of my previous amendments on this matter. It seeks to ensure that the Secretary of State takes account specifically of decommissioning--not as one of a number of factors, but as a specific factor. It is not a pre-condition. I am leaving in the words "take into account" which, at an earlier stage, I tried to stiffen up. The amendment does not establish a new linkage, but every part of the agreement is linked. That is what we mean when we say, "the whole agreement".
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-13_para2"></a>The two matters of the prisoners and decommissioning are additionally linked by the fact that they are the two matters which most concern the terrorist organisations. If those organisations become ex-terrorist organisations, they will get their prisoners out; but if they are ex-terrorists, they will not need their arms and should give them up.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-13_para3"></a>I am not suggesting that arms should be given up by saying, "So many prisoners released for so many guns given up". I am suggesting that the two processes should flow in parallel during the two years which both are set to run. As I have pointed out previously, the process of decommissioning is due to be completed in May 2000--two years after the referendum. The process of releasing the prisoners comes to its height in July 2000, depending on when the Bill receives Royal Assent and comes into effect--at any rate, a couple of months after decommissioning is supposed to be completed. It will then be clear whether or not the two processes have moved in parallel; as they should. Nobody--neither the terrorist organisations nor ourselves--should be able to pick out those parts of the process which they may like or dislike. All parts of the agreement should move forward together. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>   My Lords, I shall be brief because the noble Lord, Lord Cope of Berkeley, has amply explained the attitude that he and I have taken throughout our debates on this Bill. As it is presently drafted, we get the impression--the general public would get this impression if they took the trouble to read the Bill--that a sort of selection box is being offered. However, we need something more specific. We need a degree of linkage and unification between the various <P>


<a name="column_914"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 914</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>conditions. Most of all, at this late stage in the passage of the Bill, it would be helpful to have from the Minister a clearly defined explanation of the Government's attitude to the decommissioning of command-and-control structures, and not so much of the actual armaments.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, I, too, am happy to support this amendment which, as the noble Lord, Lord Cope, explained is a heavily watered-down compromise. It would ensure that although there would be no obligation to give equal weight to each of the four conditions, all four conditions would nevertheless have to be taken into account and there would be no question of any one of them being disregarded altogether.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, I respectfully suggest that this amendment goes too far, is too strong and ties the hands of the Secretary of State too tightly. As I understand it, the original linkage was between the release of prisoners and the maintenance of the ceasefires, not between the release of prisoners and decommissioning.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-13_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>   My Lords, I support this amendment. I believe that it is a great pity and a lost opportunity that there is no linkage between the release of prisoners and the surrender of arms other than the Good Friday agreement itself. It seems pretty clear that that may not necessarily be fully observed by all the parties. I believe that this is a missed opportunity.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-13_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, in discussing the previous amendment the noble Lord, Lord Cope, suggested that I had repented, the implication being that I had sinned during Committee and Report stages. I hotly deny that. If on occasions the Government, having listened, feel able to change their mind that is not a reason for accusing them of sinning; rather, the weight of the arguments has had some effect.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-13_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, I accept the rebuke of the Minister. I certainly do not suggest that he has sinned. The Government's change of mind on this occasion, and I hope in relation to the amendment to which the Minister is about to speak, is extremely wise and much appreciated.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-13_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, while I am grateful for the noble Lord's comment he may presume too much as regards this particular amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Cope, has spoken eloquently to this amendment, just as he spoke to similar amendments at Committee and Report stages. The noble Lord will be aware that I understand the sentiment but I cannot support the amendment, which would depart from the terms of the Good Friday agreement, as the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, said a moment ago.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-13_para4"></a>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State made clear during consideration of this Bill in another place that all elements of the Good Friday agreement must be implemented by all parties in good faith. There <P>


<a name="column_915"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 915</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>can be no picking and choosing. If the whole agreement is not implemented then it will simply not work. At Second Reading in your Lordships' House I described the agreement as a package which contained a number of different elements, but which was a package nevertheless. The Government will implement those parts of the agreement that fall to it to implement and will hold the other parties to their commitments. All parts of the agreement must be taken forward together or the whole enterprise will fail and that cannot be allowed to happen. I have set out the Government's commitment to the terms of the agreement, which is shared by many on both sides of your Lordships' House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-13_para5"></a>I turn to the specific terms of the amendment. Subsections (8) and (9) of Clause 3 are drafted to remain faithful to the Good Friday agreement while setting out clearly how the Secretary of State will identify which organisations have not established or are not maintaining complete and unequivocal ceasefires. The four factors in subsection (9) are those identified by the Prime Minister in his speech at Balmoral on 14th May. But they are four factors, not four conditions as the amendment would have it. The Prime Minister was clear that the intention was to explain what was meant by a complete and unequivocal ceasefire that was not a sham or a tactical ceasefire and that he was not establishing new conditions to be satisfied. He was not re-writing the agreement and, with respect to noble Lords, nor should we.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-13_para6"></a>At the same time, the Prime Minister was clear that these factors would be applied more rigorously over time, and that remains the intention. This reflects the fact that there are things that can only happen over a period of time such as the dismantling of terrorist organisations. That was a factor referred to by the Prime Minister which is subsumed within the requirements that organisations should be committed to the use now and in the future of only democratic and peaceful means and that they have ceased to be involved in any acts of violence or preparation for violence. Action such as this should happen in parallel with the release of prisoners as part of the parallel implementation of all parts of the agreement. As I have explained, this amendment would fundamentally change the nature of the test to be applied and would depart from the terms of the Good Friday agreement. I ask the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-13_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, as I expected I have not succeeded in persuading the noble Lord. We have already argued about the precise wording of the Balmoral speech and the use of the word "and" which does not appear in the Bill as drafted and would be replaced by this amendment. We have to rely on the Minister's repeated statement this afternoon that there can be no picking and choosing, that the Government will hold the other parties to their commitments, including by inference the commitment to decommission, and that they expect the different processes including decommissioning to proceed in parallel. We shall hold the Government to that pledge and look forward to seeing decommissioning as well as <P>

<A NAME = "80722-14_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we now move on to Clause 15 which deals with the provision of information to victims. There is a drafting point here that I think ought to be remedied. In Clause 15(4) we read:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for moving this amendment and indicating to me that he intended to do so. I am afraid that I shall disappoint him. I do not believe that this amendment is required, for the reason that I shall set out. Under Clause 15 the Secretary of State is placed under a duty to provide information to victims in clearly specified circumstances. Subsection (4) of this clause is intended to address circumstances in which the Secretary of State has previously discharged her duty by providing information which was accurate when it was provided, but which because of a change of circumstances has now become inaccurate. If the Secretary of State fails to provide accurate information the duty imposed by Clause 15 has not been discharged. Should the Secretary of State become aware that inaccurate information has been provided she remains under a duty to provide accurate information in conformity with the clause.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-14_para3"></a>The amendment is not required as the duty to provide accurate information already exists. As with a previous amendment we have considered today, to write in the specific amendment proposed by the noble Lord would lead to uncertainty in other legislation where similar duties are provided for. I understand the motives of my noble friend but in the circumstances I ask him to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, I thought that the noble Lord, Lord Kilbracken, had done the House another service by spotting this apparent inaccuracy in <P>

<A NAME="80722-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Kilbracken: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the support that I have received from noble Lords who have spoken.

Amendments have been put down and considered. The Government have accepted the merits of a number of amendments and believe that the Bill has been improved as a consequence. Other amendments, which are not compatible with the agreement or which would not have improved the terms of the Bill, have been rejected.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-14_para6"></a>This is a complex Bill which deals with a difficult subject--the early release of prisoners. We have all found it difficult to come to grips with the issues in the Bill. The context of the Bill is more remarkable. All of the prisoners who may be released under its terms could foresee that there could come a time when they would be released from prison anyway. There are few who even a year ago would have believed that the parties in Northern Ireland, together with the two governments, could reach an agreement regarding the future of Northern Ireland. The conclusion of the Good Friday agreement was a remarkable event. I was privileged to be in Northern Ireland at the time of the negotiations and to be present during those long final hours.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-14_para7"></a>In the days and weeks after the conclusion of the agreement there has been a new optimism in Northern Ireland. At times that optimism has been dented by events, such as the disturbances surrounding Drumcree and, very tragically, the murder of the three Quinn children at Ballymoney and, more recently, the murder of Mr. Kearney in Belfast. There is uncertainty as to what will happen in the future but the agreement, which was endorsed by more than 72 per cent. of the people in Northern Ireland, offers a way forward and an opportunity to make such barbaric events a thing of the past; to build a future free from terrorism in which all may participate on equal terms. Tonight I invite your Lordships to play your part in making that future a reality by endorsing the Bill. I beg to move.

<A NAME = "80722-14_para14"></a>That this House do disagree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 1.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-14_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that this House do disagree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 1.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-14_para15"></a>By appearing before your Lordships in a dinner jacket I am not signalling that I propose to make a meal of this amendment. I have an assignation with a Baroness.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-14_para16"></a>When this Bill left your Lordships' House, Clause 1 provided for the setting up of a standing advisory committee on criminal justice and the penal system. The function of the council was to address the important issues of criminal and penal policies dispassionately, authoritatively and constructively. In the words of my noble and learned friend the Lord Chief Justice the purpose of the clause,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"is to provide the Home Secretary and the Government with a reservoir of wise, informed, objective and non-partisan advice on the important and intractable problems which confront him".--[Official Report, 3/3/98; col. 1132.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-14_para17"></a>When the amendment was first raised in Committee the Lord Chief Justice spoke in support, as did his predecessor, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lane, and the former Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, my noble <P>


<a name="column_919"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 919</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and learned friend Lord Lowry. Also two former Home Secretaries, the noble Lord, Lord Hurd, and the noble Lord, Lord Merlyn-Rees, together with the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle, the former Minister of State at the Home Office, and the noble Lord, Lord Elton, the former Under-Secretary there.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-14_para18"></a>The only member of the House who spoke against the amendment was the noble Lord, Lord Henley. At Third Reading the amendment was again supported by the Lord Chief Justice, the former Lord Chief Justice, seven Law Lords, two former Home Secretaries, the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins, and the noble Lord, Lord Hurd, and four former Home Office Ministers. Again, the only voice against, apart from the Minister, was the noble Lord, Lord Henley, who said his party would not be supporting the amendment nor supporting the Government. However, in the event, a significant number of Conservatives voted for the amendment, as did a handful of Labour Peers. It was strongly supported by the Liberal Democrats and Cross-Benchers as well as the only Bishops who voted.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-14_para19"></a>I previously informed your Lordships that I do not take pride in the parentage of this amendment. To mark the centenary of the report of the Gladstone Committee on Prisons on 10th April 1995, a letter was sent to The Times under the joint signatures of inter alios, Professor Sean McConvill, Sir Louis Blom-Cooper QC, the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, Professor Anthony Bottoms, the noble Lord, Lord Callaghan, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, and the noble Lord, Lord Runcie. It stated among other things:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We think that the time is right for an overview on the scale of the Gladstone inquiry, to propound a sound, authoritative penal philosophy". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-14_para20"></a>I have in a number of debates invited your Lordships to make provision for a comprehensive reassessment of a rational penal policy and thereby restore much needed confidence in the system. I was therefore delighted to learn that my noble and learned friend the Lord Chief Justice on two occasions, in two lectures, subsequently endorsed my suggestion. At the conclusion of the annual lecture of the Prison Reform Trust, given by him in June last year, he said that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"if a revived advisory council were able, with the benefit of intensive worldwide research and consultation, to reach authoritative conclusions which commanded the respect of the public and the professional opinion, and if those conclusions were given legislative effect, this Parliament would earn an assured place in the history of this country". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-14_para21"></a>On 8th April, on the occasion of the Second Reading of the Bill in another place, the Home Secretary communicated to Parliament his first thoughts, so to speak, on the amendment. He said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I have considered the proposal very carefully, and, in the light of that consideration, we shall seek to delete that provision in Committee. As I have already made clear, the Bill provides a new sentencing advisory panel and a national Youth Justice Board. We have, therefore, concluded another unfocused body would cause unnecessary duplication and significant delay in dealing with the many problems of the criminal justice system".--[Official Report, Commons 8/4/98; col. 378.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-14_para22"></a>The two bodies which he identified are hardly relevant to the issues we have to consider. The sentencing advisory panel does not advise the Home <P>


<a name="column_920"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 920</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Secretary; it advises the Court of Appeal on sentencing guidelines. As the noble Lord, Lord Hurd, pointed out on Report it operates entirely within the existing law. It does nothing in respect of new sentences or maximum sentences, and nothing outside the existing body of statutes.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-14_para23"></a>The Youth Justice Board is referred to in Clause 35 of the Bill. It is primarily a monitoring body. In a letter from the Home Secretary to the Lord Chief Justice, dated 16th March, of which I was kindly given a copy, the main source of advice is now said to be the Criminal Justice Consultative Council. This was set up as a result of the Woolf Report on prisons, and its function is to reconcile the potential conflicting aims of disparate agencies of the criminal justice system; for instance, the police, the CPS, the Probation Service, and the Prison Service. Its terms of reference, set out in Annex A of the summary of its activities in 1996-97, is to promote better understanding, co-operation and co-ordination in the criminal justice system, in particular by considering reports about developments to and affecting criminal justice, considering other information about the operation of the system, and overseeing the arrangements and special conferences. As Lord Justice Rose, its president, said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It has sought to lubricate the various parts of the criminal justice system". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-14_para24"></a>The council has not been given an advisory function, nor does its present composition or organisation allow it to undertake one. All members, in one way or another, are involved directly with one or other of the agencies. Three Permanent Secretaries are also members--that is, health, Home Office and the Lord Chancellor's Department. As presently constituted therefore the committee possesses none of the elements of independence which are essential for an advisory council.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-14_para25"></a>As regards the suggestion that the existence of the standing council would add to delays in the making of public policy, the Minister, before referring any matter to it, would be fully entitled to impose time limits for the provision of the desired report.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-14_para26"></a>I have in the past made submissions to your Lordships emphasising one area in which the standing council could produce an effective contribution; that is, in relation to the re-education of the public by providing a wider understanding of the limited contribution imprisonment can make to an effective law and order policy. I have done so because of the serious overcrowding which currently exists in prisons, and the projection by the Home Office that the current figure, given yesterday and said to be the highest ever prison population, is over 66,000. That is said to be likely to reach 83,000 within seven years or nearly 100,000 on a worst-case scenario basis. That would mean 20 new prisons at a cost of &#163;2 billion.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-14_para27"></a>Your Lordships may well seek to ask the question: if the standing council had, during the past year, been in existence, what useful function could it have performed? I think that I can give a good example. Some three or four years ago, it was appreciated, particularly as a result of the revelation of the large number of child abuse cases, that there is a tiny minority of dangerous <P>


<a name="column_921"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 921</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>criminals, in particular paedophiles, who may, under existing procedures, be released when they still represent an unacceptable risk to the public.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-14_para28"></a>The previous government sought to cater for that problem with the automatic life sentence introduced by the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997--a provision much criticised by the late Lord Chief Justice and the current Lord Chief Justice. The Act requires a court to impose a life sentence on any offender over the age of 18 who is convicted of a "serious offence" committed after the commencement of the Act if he has been convicted of another "serious offence" before committing the latter "serious offence". The expression "serious offence" applies inter alia to attempted murder, conspiracy to murder, incitement to murder, soliciting murder, manslaughter and other violent offences for which a sentence of life imprisonment can currently be imposed. It is not necessary for the earlier offence to have been committed before the commencement of the Act or that the offender should have been of any particular age.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-14_para29"></a>That section was not brought into effect by the previous government. Therefore one can imagine that if the council existed the Home Secretary might say, "Do I bring this Section 2 into force or is there a better way of dealing with this difficult problem?" I believe that the standing council would have advised the Minister in this way: first, it would have reminded the Government of the White Paper, issued in 1990, entitled Crime Justice and Protecting the Public, where the following statement is to be found:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Government"--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-14_para30"></a>that is, of course, the previous government--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"rejects a statutory framework on the lines of those introduced in the United States, or a system of minimum or mandatory sentences for certain offences. This would make it more difficult to sentence justly in exceptional circumstances. It could also result in more acquittals by juries, with more guilty men and women going free unjustly". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-14_para31"></a>In explaining the wisdom of that statement the council would have pointed out, first, that if the jury is aware that the defendant faces a mandatory life sentence if convicted, it will for that very reason not convict; secondly, there will be refusals by defendants to enter, as they should and would have, pleas of guilty; thirdly, it is not difficult to imagine cases where witnesses, particularly those in close relationships with the defendant and knowing the consequences of the conviction, would refuse to give evidence or would prove unreliable; fourthly, there is the danger of the victim being killed by the offender in order to avoid the risk of detection and subsequent life imprisonment; and, fifthly, in order to be sure of obtaining a conviction there would be cases in which the prosecution would find itself obliged to accept an unrealistic plea bargain.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-14_para32"></a>Next, the council would doubtless have drawn the Government's attention to the observation of the noble Lord, Lord Williams, on the Second Reading of the Crime (Sentences) Bill when he said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The sentencing regime for which we contend should, as many noble Lords have said, be open and transparent; but it is nonsensical to invite a High Court judge to say  'I am sentencing you to life <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_922"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 922</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>imprisonment. By the way, you can expect to serve 18 months'. That is a perversion of the system. It will bring the whole system into disrepute".--[Official Report, 27/1/97; col. 1063.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-14_para33"></a>The Home Secretary would have been informed by the standing council that Section 2 of the Act made no useful contribution to the problems dealing with psychopathic or personality disordered offenders. It does not empower a court to pass a sentence which cannot now be passed in the exercise of the court's discretion; it merely forces the court to pass a sentence which it would otherwise consider inappropriate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-14_para34"></a>The Home Secretary would have been further advised of the following matters. I rely for this upon Dr. Thomas QC, of the Institute of Criminology at Cambridge. He said that the section was pregnant with anomalies. The list of serious offences omits many which might be committed by dangerous offenders, such as arson and possessing explosives with intent. Buggery of a person under 16, although punishable with life imprisonment, is not a "serious offence", although unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under 13 is. Most sexual abusers of children, who are likely to be convicted of indecent assault, indecency with a child, or abducting a child, will fall outside the Act. Some violent robbers will be covered, others not. The man who chooses to use a harmless, but frightening, toy pistol will commit a "serious offence" but not a man who uses a knife or similar weapon.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-14_para35"></a>The greatest weakness of Section 2, considered from the point of view of protecting the public, is that it requires the offender to have been convicted of the first offence before committing the second. The man who is convicted on the same occasion of a series of offences, each of which is a "serious offence" for the purpose of the Act, will not attract an automatic life sentence. In short, the Minister will have been informed by the council, "Don't touch this section even with a bargepole".
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-14_para36"></a>I come next to how the council would have assisted the Minister on providing a much better alternative. The "reviewable sentence" has been referred to frequently over the past few years. It was first mentioned by the 1975 Butler Committee. It has the following advantages over the Section 2 mandatory life sentence provisions. First, it is not limited to repeat offenders. Secondly, it is not restricted to the narrow range of offences in the section, all of which as the law now stands can be punished by prison for life. Thirdly, it requires medical evidence before it can be imposed. Fourthly, it does not run the risk of the criminal deciding to "do in" his victim so as to avoid a life sentence. Fifthly, it does not carry the false label of imprisonment for life which, in 99 per cent. of the cases, is not intended to be effective.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-14_para37"></a>The standing council would have pointed out that analogous provisions exist in Canadian, Australian and New Zealand law. Assuming the Minister would listen to sound advice, the council would have prevented the Minister from bringing into force, as he did in October of last year, this highly undesirable section. On 30th July of last year, the Home Secretary informed the other place:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"My overriding priority is to secure the safety of the public".--[Official Report, Commons, 30/7/97; col. 341.) <P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-14_para38"></a>That, of course, is the overriding priority of any sensible government. However, the deeply depressing and worrying fact is that the Government, by a stubborn refusal to allow the provision of sound advice, so far from securing the safety of the public, are seriously prejudicing it in the way I have mentioned. Accordingly, I invite noble Lords to be convinced that a standing council would make an important contribution, in particular to securing the safety of the public. I beg to move.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-14_para39"></a>Moved, That this House do disagree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 1.--(Lord Ackner.)

<P>
<A NAME="80722-14_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St. Johns: </B>   My Lords, this matter was indeed debated fully in this House in Committee on 3rd and 30th March. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, remarked, courteously but carefully and forthrightly, my noble friend Lord Henley provided valuable support to the Minister on that occasion--perhaps it was invaluable since I believe he was the only person to provide that support. I recognise that some of my distinguished noble friends supported the noble and learned Lord's amendment on that day.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-14_para40"></a>I am still not entirely convinced by the case made by those who would wish to see a standing advisory council established. Like my noble friend Lord Henley, I have taken note of the fact that the council would be advisory. But I am also aware that Ministers could find themselves more bound by an advisory body than the noble and learned Lord at present anticipates.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-14_para41"></a>Like my noble friend Lord Henley before me, I cannot offer my support to the noble and learned Lord. I remain of the view that it is up to the Government to make their own case on this matter. I shall not support either the Government's Motion or the noble and learned Lord's Motion.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   My Lords, this side of the House supported the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, when he moved the amendment during the passage of the Bill. Nothing has changed that would convince me otherwise. He will continue to receive that support.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-15_para0"></a>Despite reading Hansard of another place, it is unclear why the clause was removed. It is deeply regrettable that the Government have not acceded to the weight of support from Members of all parties in this House for a standing advisory council. The idea also had widespread backing from external organisations involved in penal affairs and criminal justice.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-15_para1"></a>In recent years there have been some regrettable instances in which policies on crime and the penal system have appeared to be driven by political opportunism and other considerations. A notable example was the "prison works" policy. We are seeing today in this country the result of that policy with one of the highest ever prison populations.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-15_para2"></a>A standing advisory committee would provide an independent, expert and non-partisan voice, drawing on the expertise of a range of agencies and individuals involved in criminal justice and could be an important influence in producing balanced and practical policies. <P>


<a name="column_924"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 924</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>It is all about advice. No one is dictating. No one would dare to. It is no good saying, "We have the Criminal Justice Consultative Council". One has the greatest respect for the noble and learned Lord, Lord Rose, and the work of the Criminal Justice Consultative Council. But it is a body which reacts to circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-15_para3"></a>We are asking for a sensible government carefully to weigh up any recommendation which comes from a source such as a standing advisory council. They do not have to accept everything. Despite the Government's protestation, the provision will not delay any reforms. The Government would be free to enact whatever reforms they see fit to introduce. They do not have to wait for the views of the advisory council. However, a regular flow of considered advice and proposals from such a body would assist a reasonable, listening government to produce practical policies to reduce crime and do justice to both victims and offenders.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-15_para4"></a>The Government's main counter-argument--it was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, in earlier debates in this House--is that they have many other sources of advice. We welcome that. They also have advice, including committees and task forces, which they establish to advise on specific areas of policies--a welcome sign indeed. It is true to say that there have been some good examples of such groups. I refer, for example, to the Home Secretary's task force on new justice, and the working group on vulnerable and intimidated witnesses. All have done interesting and valuable work.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-15_para5"></a>But such groups are established by the Government to decide only on issues about which they want advice. That happens often because of immediate, short-term considerations. None has an overall, broad responsibility for examining the criminal justice system and the penal system as a total. It is therefore important that there are mechanisms to ensure a regular flow of advice and accommodation to the Government on the operation of criminal justice and the penal system, including advice on issues of great importance to those working in the field but which may not be high on the Government's list of immediate practical imperatives.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-15_para6"></a>I do not seek to support a Division of this House on this matter. However, I wish to make it clear that we on this side of the House will continue to harass the Government until such time such a body is in being. I believe that the way in which matters of criminal justice have been implemented in the past is far too important to be left simply in the hands of the Home Office.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Beloff: </B>   My Lords, future historians examining the weakness of the Blair Government may come to the conclusion that their primary weakness was an unwillingness to listen to advice from the people best qualified to give it. It would seem to an ordinary layman such as myself that if the leaders of the legal profession overwhelmingly suggest that a body of the kind proposed would be of value in a very important aspect of our national life, a wise government would take that into account. I am not surprised that they do not do so. When they legislate on universities, they ignore the <P>


<a name="column_925"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 925</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>opinions of those engaged in university teaching. That list could be extended. I am disappointed that the noble and learned Lord does not wish to press the matter to a Division. If he did, I should no doubt wish to support him.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, I wish to observe to the noble Lord, Lord Beloff, that the maxim that power is delightful and absolute power absolutely delightful is not confined to a Labour Government, nor to a Conservative Government, nor, I dare say, to a Liberal Democrat Government. It is a universal maxim of those who exercise power.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-15_para7"></a>Twenty five years ago, I had the privilege of working as special adviser to the Home Secretary, Roy Jenkins, for two years. Much as I admired his great wisdom and that of his senior advisers, I became completely convinced of the need for an independent standing advisory council on penal reform for the reasons cogently expressed today by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, and my noble friend Lord Dholakia.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-15_para8"></a>For those reasons, which I shall not repeat, it is extremely important for a Home Secretary, his Ministers and senior advisers to have access to the best advice they can obtain from a wholly independent body of well-informed specialist advisers. They do not have to take the advice, but there is nothing they need fear in obtaining it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-15_para9"></a>I therefore believe that the right course to take is to urge the Government to think again and hope that it does not become necessary to ask another place to think again. Unlike others on my Benches, such is the strength of my feeling on the matter that if it were pressed to a Division--I hope that that will not be the case because I hope that the Minister will be able to accept the situation--I should have no alternative but to support the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, this is the third time I have tried to explain why the Government do not want to see the re-establishment of a standing advisory council of the type specified by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner. I see the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, sitting in her place. As she formerly had responsibility for Home Office matters, we can respectfully agree, one with the other, that the one thing one does not lack in the Home Office on any occasion of this kind is an abundance of advice. Often there is too much of it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-15_para10"></a>I shall be as brief as I can because I know that other issues of great importance are to be discussed later. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, specified a large volume of advice which would have been given to the Government had such a body been set up. He specified it dot, comma, colon and semi-colon. By definition, the advice which the noble and learned Lord believes the body would have provided is already available.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-15_para11"></a>In Committee, the noble and learned Lord said that crime is a difficult and complex problem. Of course it is, and that is why we have introduced this Bill. We <P>


<a name="column_926"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 926</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have had the youth justice task force and when the Bill becomes law we shall have the youth justice board. The noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, pointed out that nothing has changed. It has. For instance, there is an admirable report dealing specifically with vulnerable and intimidated witnesses. It was produced promptly, efficiently and with access--I say that to the noble Lord, Lord Beloff--to all the relevant expertise that was required. It was an admirable document, praised on all sides and produced quickly.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-15_para12"></a>That was not always the case with the body which is now the subject of dewy-eyed nostalgia in your Lordships' House. According to our records, the council produced nine reports in all. It took about two years to produce most of them and it produced only one between 1970 and 1977. If one wants to talk about reports which may attract public support, perhaps I may indicate what was contained in its last report (February 1978) on sentences of imprisonment. I address my remarks in particular to the need to obtain public support for penal policy. That report recommended the dramatic reduction of the maximum penalty for offences such as rape and buggery with a child under the age of 16, unlawful sexual intercourse, incest with a girl under 13, wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm and burglary. Curiously, those recommendations were not accepted by the government of the day.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-15_para13"></a>Therefore, simply having a specialist body will not necessarily bring about the desired conclusion to which the noble and learned Lord referred. Perhaps not entirely surprisingly--I do not know whether it was coincidental--the then Home Secretary, now the noble Viscount, Lord Whitelaw, decided not to reappoint the body in January 1980. Since that time it has had no existence.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-15_para14"></a>I revert to the noble Lord's comment that nothing has changed. That is not so. Yesterday we announced the crime reduction strategy. That is based for the first time on comprehensive research evidence of what actually works. It was produced by Mr. Nuttall, who works in the Research and Statistics Directorate of the Home Office. They are independent conclusions. I say with great respect that it is worth reading that volume to see what quality of expertise is presently available.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-15_para15"></a>We simply do not see the advantage of resurrecting this body. We can obtain objective and informed advice which is provided in a more flexible and responsive way. The noble Lord, Lord Henley, indicated that he had severe doubts about the practical utility of such a body, particularly bearing in mind his valid point that at the end of the day it is for the Government to take responsibility for penal and criminal policy. If it is needed, plenty of advice is available.

<A NAME = "80722-15_para16"></a>A number of noble Lords mentioned the Criminal Justice Consultative Council, presently chaired by Lord Justice Rose. We believe that there is virtue in amending its terms of reference. We are in discussion about amendment. One that we have in mind is along the lines of,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"giving such advice in relation to the co-ordination of the criminal justice system as may from time to time be made by Government". <P>

<A NAME = "80722-15_para17"></a>The noble and learned Lord referred to experience abroad. We are aware of that. We know the sentencing regimes in the countries he mentioned. One needs only to read any journal from any institute of criminology to have ready access to such information. We have the Trial Issues Group and reports from Her Majesty's Chief Inspectors of Prisons and Probation. I do not believe that the present chief inspector or his immediate predecessor could have been said to lack independence--perhaps to the occasional intense displeasure of some people in the Home Office--or an independent view, or the determination to give advice whether it is welcome or not.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-15_para18"></a>We have the Law Commission, which has particular expertise in the substantive law, and I pay all credit to its work. As regards efficiency and effectiveness, we have the National Audit Office and the Audit Commission. As a result of this Bill, we shall have the sentencing advisory panel. Of course it operates within the structure of the Court of Appeal Criminal Division, but those decisions are published and readily available to those who deal with these matters within the Home Office. We now have the Standing Committee on Home Affairs in another place. It is a new committee which goes about its work in an extremely effective way. Therefore, we shall have careful research produced by an authoritative body.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-15_para19"></a>We believe that ample advice is available. The estimates show that it will cost not far short of &#163;500,000 a year to operate a standing council. We have to look for added public value, to use the current jargon. With the best will in the world, and listening carefully to everything that has been said on so many occasions and in such detail, we do not believe that there is added public value in investing another &#163;0.5 million in another body when we already have so much advice available to us.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80722-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, perhaps I may make our position clear. As the noble Lord will be aware, there is still a strong belief on these Benches that the Government would be wise to accept the suggestion of such an advisory council. However, before the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, makes any calculations of his own in that respect, I should again stress that we do not think that such an advisory council can be forced upon the Government. Therefore, although we have made our position clear on the principle, we would not be able to support the noble and learned Lord if he pressed the matter to a Division tonight.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-16_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, as always, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord McNally, for his courtesy in indicating the precise position of the Liberal Democrat Benches.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Williams, commenced his speech by saying that the advice is already available to the Home Secretary. He spent no time at all in dealing with the advice which I say would have been given by an independent council relative to the automatic life sentence, which he <P>


<a name="column_928"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 928</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>castigated when he was in Opposition. The noble Lord gave no form of justification as to why his Government, knowing that they were hotly criticised not only by the legal profession but also by the judiciary and academics, brought it into effect. Moreover, the noble Lord gave no explanation as to why the "reviewable sentence", which was suggested way back in 1975 by the Butler Committee and used to a greater or lesser extent in Commonwealth jurisdictions, is not to be put in place here. Therefore, the noble Lord has established that the advice which is already available lacks the status to persuade the Home Secretary to do the sensible thing.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-16_para0"></a>It is easy to ignore silent advice because there are not likely to be any critics if you do not accept it, and the general public do not know what the advice was. However, if you have a committee of status which is independent, and which would publish its advice as it should do, then you cannot turn a deaf ear to such advice without being prepared to justify it. It must be a great luxury for any Minister to enjoy to be able to refuse firmly advice which is sound and which should be listened to. I do not think that that ability would exist if the standing council were brought into existence. That is why it has been so strongly resisted. I do not believe that the Government should avoid having the views of this House expressed in regard to their refusal to adopt what I suggest is an entirely sensible approach to an independent organisation. Therefore, I seek the views of the House on my Motion.

<A NAME="80722-16_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 2.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-16_para6"></a>This is a small, technical amendment. When the Bill was before your Lordships' House, the Government were concerned that this should be a local order used to tackle anti-social behaviour in a particular area, which would be granted by a local magistrates' court to prohibit that behaviour in that area only.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-16_para7"></a>That is still the case. We intend the orders to remain local but in discussions in another place it became apparent that to restrict the application of the order to a single local authority area in every single case would be unnecessarily restrictive where a single pattern of behaviour might spread over two or more adjoining areas. That would be unwieldy, costly to operate and inefficient.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-16_para8"></a>Therefore the amendment was proposed to avoid that kind of situation. It was accepted in another place. I hope your Lordships will be able to accept it, particularly as it contains the safeguard that all relevant authorities in the areas affected must be consulted before an order is sought. We would not expect an application to go forward without explicit agreement from all concerned.

(b) shall be so exercisable during a period so specified;

and references in that subsection to a specified area and a specified period shall be construed accordingly.
<BR>
(3) If a constable has reasonable cause to believe that a child or young person found by him in a public place in a specified area during a specified period--
<BR>
(a) is of compulsory school age; and
<BR>
(b) is absent from a school without lawful authority,
<BR>
the constable may remove the child or young person to designated premises, or to the school from which he is so absent.
<BR>
(4) A child's or young person's absence from a school shall be taken to be without lawful authority unless it falls with subsection (3) (leave, sickness, unavoidable cause or day set apart for religious observance) of section 444 of the Education Act 1996.
<BR>
(5) In this section--
<BR>
"local authority" means--
<BR>
(a) in relation to England, a county council, a district council whose district does not form part of an area that has a county council, a London borough council or the Common Council of the City of London;
<BR>
(b) in relation to Wales, a county council or a county borough council;
<BR>
"public place" has the same meaning as in section 15 above;

<P>

<A NAME = "80722-17_para1"></a>This amendment gives the police an additional power to take truants back to school or another place designated by the local education authority for that purpose. It is part of the Government's package to tackle school exclusions and truancy which the Prime Minister announced in May when he launched the Social Exclusion Unit's report on this subject. It will be used in support of local multi-agency efforts to tackle truancy in which the police, schools and local education authorities identify and discuss local problems and draw up strategies to deal with them.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-17_para6"></a>These amendments relate to the City of London and its arrangements. The Common Council of the City of London is not a local authority as defined in Section 270(1) of the 1972 Local Government Act. Clause 17 as currently drafted means that the duty to consider crime and disorder implications of all decisions applies to Common Council only in its capacity as a police authority, and not in its capacity as a local authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-17_para7"></a>This is an unintended anomaly. The new obligation will apply to all local authorities in England and Wales. The exclusion of the Common Council was accidental. The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that the obligation therefore applies to the council in both its capacities.

<A NAME="80722-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 6.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-17_para11"></a>This is a most important matter which relates to a question which your Lordships will recall was raised by the noble Earl, Lord Carnarvon. It deals with a gap which I think was generally perceived to exist in the law concerning those who wear face coverings to avoid identification, in particular on occasions of public violence or demonstrations. Your Lordships will remember that when the noble Earl raised this matter I undertook to have further consultation with the Association of Chief Police Officers and others who had an interest in the matter. It was not possible at that time to have an amendment properly drafted because there were some difficulties in your Lordships discussing it at that stage. Accordingly it was introduced in another place.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-17_para12"></a>Amendments Nos. 6, 7, 8 and 108 go together. Amendment No. 6 empowers a police officer to demand the removal of, and to seize, face coverings. This is potentially a far-reaching power and therefore it has the safeguard that it is exercisable only where authorised by an officer of at least inspector rank where he reasonably believes that there will be violence or weapons are carried. This is intended to make the police more effective in dealing with people who wear masks to avoid being identified when they carry out violent offences.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-17_para13"></a>Amendment No. 7 provides for regulations to be made for the retention and disposal of seized face coverings. Amendment No. 8 gives a power of arrest for someone who fails to comply with a demand to remove his or her face covering, and corrects an anomaly in arrest powers in Scotland. Amendment No. 108 extends the face covering measures to Scotland.

<A NAME="80722-18_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Advocate   (Lord Hardie): </B>  My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 9. In speaking to this amendment I shall, with the leave of the House, speak also to Amendments Nos. 10 to 13, 82 and 83.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para1"></a>These amendments relate to racially aggravated offences in the Bill. Amendments Nos. 9, 10 and 11 relate to Clause 25, which is the provision affecting England and Wales. Amendments Nos. 12, 13, 82 and 83 relate to Clauses 30 and 88, which are the equivalent provisions for Scotland. All these amendments are designed to clarify the test of what amounts to "racially aggravated" for the purpose of these offences.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para2"></a>I am sure that no one would wish a perpetrator of racist attacks to be let off the hook because of the attacker's ignorance about the victims' racial group: for example, because the attacker thought that his victim was Pakistani and the victim was from Bangladesh. These amendments will put that issue beyond doubt. They make clear that, regardless of which racial group the perpetrator believes the victim to belong to, an offence will be "racially aggravated" if racial hostility or motivation is proved.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para3"></a>The Government are aware of the concerns of some noble Lords and religious groups as to whether these offences will cover an attack made, for example, on a Moslem. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary has met Moslem community leaders to discuss this issue. We believe that in practice most cases which may appear to have a religious element will also have a racial element. We do not believe that when the perpetrators of these offences attack Moslems they do so because of hostility towards the tenets of Islam. They do so because of racist hostility towards the victim and towards the ethnic minority groups that are associated with the Moslem faith in this country.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para4"></a>The test of what amounts to "racially aggravated" for the purposes of these offences requires that the racial hostility is wholly or partly a motivating factor. It follows that if part of the hostility is racist, then the offence is covered by these provisions, even if there is <P>


<a name="column_935"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 935</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>also a religious hostility. This amendment is designed to make that absolutely clear. The religious element is immaterial where racism forms even a part of the motivation of the offence. We believe that this provision will cover the vast majority of cases which involve the Moslem community. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="80722-18_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Young: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that this House do disagree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 14. At the same time I wish to speak to Amendments Nos. 98, 107, 108, 140 and 237.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para15"></a>The issue before the House is not party-political. Noble Lords from all parts of the House have been good enough to indicate support for me, for which I am extremely grateful. Many would have signed this amendment had that been allowed. Nor is this some religious Right-Wing plot, as has been suggested to me. I speak as an Anglican. However, I know that I have the support of Roman Catholics and members of the Welsh nonconformist Church. I was very grateful that the noble Lord, Lord Jakobovits, indicated his support for me. I have been approached twice by the secretary-general of the Moslem Council of Great Britain, representing 600 mosques, to say that the council is entirely in support of this proposal. And of course there are many others who have no religious convictions at all who also support what I am doing.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para16"></a>I think we all greatly welcome the firm statement from the most reverend Primate of all England, the Archbishop of Canterbury, that he cannot support the reduction in the age of consent to 16 and the fact that he set that out so clearly in his article in this morning's Times.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para17"></a>There are two issues before the House today. The first is a constitutional issue, the other an issue of substance. Your Lordships will recall that the Crime and Disorder Bill began in this House. It then went to the House of Commons, but not until Third Reading was this amendment to lower the age of consent introduced. It makes an important social change, and one that is contentious, though not on party-political lines. Interestingly, the amendment that preceded it, again at the last possible opportunity, was on football <P>


<a name="column_937"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 937</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>hooliganism, which is of quite a different character and is an issue on which there is wide agreement that something needs to be done.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para18"></a>The amendment before us today was tabled in another place on 11th June and debated on 22nd June. It was debated for only three hours. Whether or not it is true, as one Labour Member of Parliament told me, that the debate was deliberately fixed by Mr. Mandelson to coincide with the World Cup and in particular the England versus Argentina match, I cannot say. But what is undoubtedly true is that the amendment was never considered either in Committee or on Report in either House of Parliament. So there has been no opportunity at all for detailed consideration of this change in the law and of the issues involved.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para19"></a>So rushed has this whole business been that the Long Title of the Bill had to be amended in order to make it possible for this amendment to be tabled at all. Many would think that the amendment has nothing to do with the main purposes of the Crime and Disorder Bill. I regret to say that that has come from a Government who tell us regularly that they are committed to transparency and openness.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para20"></a>What is the consequence of all this? Noble Lords will be aware that two amendments to the Commons amendment are tabled for debate in this House this evening. That suggests that the amendment as it stands, even if one supported the principle of lowering the age to 16, is not satisfactory.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para21"></a>Secondly, a very important amendment was moved in another place by Mr. Joe Ashton. Perhaps I may remind the House of what his amendment said. The amendment proposed that instead of "sixteen" there should be inserted:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"sixteen years (except when one party is in a position of authority, influence or trust in relation to the other, in which case both parties must have attained the age of eighteen years)".--[Official Report, Commons, 22/6/98; col. 755.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para22"></a>That amendment in the other place was lost by only 40 votes. That seems to show that very many of those Members of Parliament who voted to lower the age of consent to 16 were concerned as to the consequences for vulnerable boys and girls who were being looked after away from home. The figures quoted by Mr. Ashton were taken from the Utting Report, published last November, which indicated that there are some 200,000 children living away from their parents. It sets out those groups which are probably most vulnerable and most at risk, including those in children's homes and foster care, and of course particularly in penal institutions and remand homes, as well as children in schools, and hospitals, and disabled children.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para23"></a>Replying to the debate, the Home Office Minister, Mr. Alun Michael, had this to say, particularly on the amendment proposed by Mr. Joe Ashton:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is particularly important to protect those who are vulnerable, and those who are in care ... Even before [Mr. Ashton] tabled his amendments, we had acknowledged the need for changes in the law ... Our priority is to protect the vulnerable and to reinforce the duty of professional care. We are looking carefully at what needs to be done but we must get it right. I have discussed the issue with my right hon. Friends the Secretaries of State for Education and Employment and for Health, and we have made it a matter of <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_938"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 938</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>priority. We have set up an interdepartmental working group to identify the additional safeguards needed to prevent those who are unsuitable to do so from working with children. That group will also identify the measures necessary to protect 16 and 17-year-olds who may be vulnerable to abuse by those in positions of trust".--[Official Report, Commons, 22/6/98; col. 787.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para24"></a>That statement has been reinforced by a very helpful letter sent to me by the noble Lord, Lord Williams, for which I am most grateful. I was also most grateful for the discussion we had some two weeks ago. Perhaps I may quote from his letter:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I very much share your concerns on the issue of protection for this vulnerable age group, both boys and girls. This is something the Government take extremely seriously. You may be aware of the new interdepartmental working group". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para25"></a>The letter goes on to say:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It will be looking at the problem of abuse of trust, which has been the focus of much concern in the debate over lowering the age of consent and also more widely at safeguards to prevent unsuitable people from working with children. It holds its first meeting on 30th July and has been tasked to report by the end of the year".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para26"></a>Not only do we have the amendment proposed by Mr. Joe Ashton, we also have the response by Government Ministers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para27"></a>I do not doubt for one moment the sincerity of the noble Lord, Lord Williams, or of the Government Minsters who have spoken on this matter and their concern for this group of young people. What I do find extraordinary is that the Government have accepted an amendment, passed by the House of Commons, to lower the age of consent to 16 and have at the same time immediately recognised that it is seriously flawed and that it is necessary to set up a working party to deal with those young people most at risk. I ask myself, as a simple person: how can they allow this provision to go forward on to the statute book in this unsatisfactory state?
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para28"></a>Perhaps I may look at what it seems to me would be the timetable of the interdepartmental committee. The committee will report at the end of the year, in December, presumably. Its report must then be considered. Legislation will have to follow, no doubt not in the next session of Parliament but in the one after. That means that for at least two years those vulnerable young people--those are not my words but the Government's words--will be at risk. I look to those who intend to vote today to lower the age of consent to 16. They will be voting for a piece of legislation which, on the admission of all those who have studied it closely, is flawed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para29"></a>Perhaps I may say to the noble Lord, Lord Williams, that I recognise that the Crime and Disorder Bill is a very important Bill for the Government. I recognise, too, that it has a great deal of cross-party support. I say to him in all sincerity that no one hopes more than I do that it will be successful in dealing with juvenile crime. I believe I speak for everyone in the House on that matter. But we are not talking about the whole Bill; we are talking about one amendment tacked on to the end of it, which the Government admit contains a serious flaw.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para30"></a>I should therefore like to suggest to the Government that they should take the amendment back and bring forward their own Bill to reduce the age of consent to 16 in the next session of Parliament, or whenever they <P>


<a name="column_939"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 939</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>feel it to be appropriate; or, if they prefer not to do that, that they should invite a Member to sponsor it and allow it government time. That would have the advantage that it would deal with the problems which are to be resolved by the interdepartmental working party. It would therefore give everyone an opportunity to look in detail at the consequences of this piece of legislation, because we should have a Bill before us which would have a Committee and a Report stage. I profoundly believe that that would be the best way forward. It would give us an opportunity to get the legislation in the right form and a form which--I hesitate to say this in the presence of so many Law Lords--would perhaps be more easily interpreted and workable.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para31"></a>I turn now to the issue of substance. The fact is that the public at large do not want the age of consent lowered to 16. Polls show that over 70 per cent. of the population are against it. I have been deluged with letters. In my entire public life I never before remember having to spend over an hour each day simply opening letters, 98 per cent. of which support my view. They come from teachers and from doctors. I have even had letters from homosexuals supporting my view. But mostly they come from parents. It would not be an exaggeration to say that parents are very worried about this matter, to the extent that some are quite fearful about what is happening. One of the most tragic letters I have received was from a father whose young son went off to America, contracted AIDS and died in unpleasant circumstances, including going blind.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para32"></a>I believe that this is the thin end of the wedge. I know that many homosexual organisations say that they are not in favour of lowering the age of consent to 14, but some are. It will lead to a demand for gay and lesbian marriages and for the right for such couples to adopt children.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para33"></a>I understand that the Government are already considering repealing Clause 28, which prevents local authorities promoting homosexuality in schools. As it is, we see the most dreadful leaflets being distributed outside school gates. Parents are very concerned about this. I speak as a mother and a grandmother; we are family people. Parents mind very much indeed the prospect of their children being taught about homosexuality. They do not think that it is something which should be taught in schools. If we really have regard for public opinion, that is something we must take into account.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para34"></a>It is said that this whole issue is one of equality. I do not myself believe that there is a moral equivalence between heterosexual and homosexual relationships. Furthermore, I think that boys and girls are not equal in emotional development. I believe it is a very doubtful argument to bring equality into this issue at all. In many respects it simply does not apply; we are not talking about equal things.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para35"></a>If we did want equality, in an ideal world, I would be quite consistent and say that we should raise the age of consent for girls to 18. We are not in that world, so it does not work as a proposition, but I would not wish it to be thought that I am in any sense being inconsistent.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para36"></a>There are many things I could say to your Lordships today, but I shall conclude now. I have put down this Motion to disagree with the Commons amendment because I believe that it is wrong in principle. I have been reinforced in that view by the letters I have had and by people stopping me wherever I go and saying: "You are standing for something. You must stand up for what people think and for what good parents want for their children".
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para37"></a>The amendment as it stands is, in my opinion, flawed. It would at this stage be quite wrong for your Lordships' House--even for anyone who believes in lowering the age of consent--to vote for what is bad legislation. It is clearly not wanted by the public at large, who are fearful about what is happening to society. We know perfectly well that homosexual practices carry great health risks to young people.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para38"></a>I hope tonight that the overwhelming majority of your Lordships will support me in the Division Lobbies. We shall be exercising our constitutional right to ask the other place to think again on this matter. There is much to think about.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-18_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Mallalieu: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may declare an interest at the outset. I am the mother of two young teenagers. In my work as a criminal barrister I have encountered more sexually abused children of both sexes than I care to contemplate. I strongly support the Commons amendment and disagree with what the noble Baroness, Lady Young, puts forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para40"></a>Those who oppose the change of law say that the present law is necessary to protect young people. But I believe that it does precisely the opposite. Homosexual activity involving teenagers is a fact of life. There is no law which can stop consensual acts carried out in private. Even if every policeman in the land were put on the task, accompanied by torchlight vigilantes led by the noble Baroness and her supporters, that could not be done; it could not be policed or prevented.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para41"></a>The effect of the criminalisation of these acts for those who are male, homosexual and aged between 16 and 18 is to drive them to secrecy within the homosexual community; to isolate them; to cut them off from seeking advice, guidance and help from family and friends, from doctors and, on occasions when sexual attentions are or have become unwelcome, to cut them off from the protection of the police and the authorities. All sexual activity is a health hazard. Young people need to be encouraged, not discouraged, from seeking information and help when they need it. The present law effectively puts a section of the community--young, gay men--beyond the pale and, far from protecting them, it denies them the protection which the rest of us enjoy.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para42"></a>Within a short distance of this Chamber, tonight and every night for those who care to look, the failure of our present law to protect the young from sexual <P>


<a name="column_941"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 941</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>exploitation can be seen in the numbers of very young prostitutes of both sexes for sale on our streets. The law has done little to help them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para43"></a>The reality is this. Regardless of the law, homosexual experimentation between young men has always taken place and always will. Those who fall in love or fancy that they have done so, whatever their sex, will express their love as they feel right and not necessarily as the law permits. The present law does not prevent them from doing it or protect them; instead, it makes them into criminals.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para44"></a>The view I have just expressed is shared by the majority of the organisations who are most directly concerned with the young--the NSPCC, the British Medical Association, the National Association of Probation Officers, Barnardo's and Save the Children to name but a few. When all the evidence suggests that sexual orientation is fixed in both sexes by the age of 16, what an extraordinary law we have which says to young people, "You are sufficiently mature to take a sexual partner of one sex, but not of the other".
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para45"></a>I understand the concerns expressed by the noble Baroness for the vulnerable. As a parent, of course I understand them and feel them myself. For that reason I am pleased that the Government are exploring ways to prevent unwelcome sexual attentions which are equally offensive, whether the victim is a man, a woman, a boy or a girl and, indeed, protection for those in positions of trust. If the law needs to be strengthened, that must be done. But that is a separate matter from the matter we are discussing tonight.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para46"></a>A new generation today has a very different attitude towards homosexuality from ours or that of our parents. It is no longer a subject which cannot be spoken of openly. It is no longer seen as a matter of choice any more than being right or left-handed is a matter of choice. A cold shower, a good beating or a spell of hard labour in Reading Gaol are no longer seen as the answer. This modest change in the law does no more than give effect to reality, common sense, equality and tolerance. "Tolerance" does not mean permitting things of which one approves; it means accepting the right of others to choose to do things of which one disapproves.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para47"></a>To those who have been saying, as they have in the past few weeks, that the Commons amendment would send the wrong message or signal from this Parliament, I ask this question: who do they believe will listen to that message? I doubt that a single young person will either embark on or postpone sexual activity as a result of this debate or its outcome. Nor, I am bound to say, do I believe that predatory older men, bent on seducing their juniors will be changing their invitation from the traditional, "Come and see my etchings" to "Come and read my copy of the Crime and Disorder Act".
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-18_para48"></a>We are talking to one another in this House, but outside the world has already moved on. And so should the law. We claim to have equality before the law; we do not have it. This amendment merely brings it a small step nearer.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80722-19_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Quirk: </B>   My Lords, what we are talking about is widely billed in the media as only to do with lowering <P>


<a name="column_942"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 942</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the age of homosexual consent. Those are the very words in the current issue of our own House Magazine. But that is not so, at any rate for me.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para0"></a>The issue is whether, for young boys and young girls alike, we should legitimise anal intercourse. In my view, the Commons amendment that we are discussing was hasty and irresponsible; based on spurious sound bites about personal freedom and sexual equality. In fact, of course, on the issue of equality, we have had sexual equality since 1994 when it became legal for men and women to indulge in anal intercourse from the age of 18. The Commons amendment to the Crime and Disorder Bill does not introduce a new sexual equality; it merely extends the 1994 equality down from 18 to 16. The equality argument therefore goes out of the window. The issue for me is whether we protect 16 year-olds from a dangerous practice, just as we try to protect them from, say, alcohol with the 18-year rule or from tobacco with widely publicised health warnings.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para1"></a>If, by law, we protect motorcyclists from head injury, we must give thought to protecting the sexually active from anal injury, and the dangers are very real. A book published last year by Jeffrey Satinover--a doctor of medicine and a health science expert--spells out those dangers and I make no apology for his explicitness. He says,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Anal intercourse ... traumatises the soft tissue of the rectal lining [which is] nowhere near as sturdy as vaginal tissue ... Even in the absence of major trauma, minor or microscopic tears in the rectal lining allow for immediate contamination. The body has a strong barrier between bloodstream and the extraordinarily toxic and infectious content of the bowel. Anal intercourse creates a breach in this barrier for the receptive partner"--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para2"></a>who might, given the Commons amendment, be a girl of 16--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"whether or not the insertive partner is wearing a condom". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para3"></a>Dr. Satinover goes on to quote another medical expert's book on sexually transmitted viral hepatitis, which I shall spare your Lordships from hearing about. He specifies another dozen terrifying diseases--including cancer induced by anal warts--to which practitioners of anal intercourse are put at what this Dr. F.N. Judson calls "particularly high risk".
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para4"></a>Whether those who voted for the amendment in the Commons were aware of these terrible risks, we in this House must certainly not ignore them. It is bad enough that young men and women of 18 already face these risks, with what degree of easily available information I know not. But what possible justification do we have in July 1998 for hurriedly extending exposure to such risks of 16 and 17 year-old girls and boys, teenagers at their most sexually inquisitive and exploratory?
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para5"></a>By all means let us encourage youngsters to take full responsibility for their behaviour: but first--at the very least--let us be sure they understand what such responsibility entails. Have the Department for Education and Employment and the Department of Health instilled such understanding?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-19_spnew1"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Winchester: </B>   My Lords, I rise to speak in support of the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Young. I represent the statements of the House of Bishops of the Church of England published <P>


<a name="column_943"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 943</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>on 21st June and, as the noble Baroness, Lady Young, mentioned, many of your Lordships will have seen the Archbishop of Canterbury's article in The Times today, which she accurately quoted. I am sure the House will understand his decision that he needs to stay in Canterbury today with the Lambeth Conference and so cannot be here himself.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para6"></a>I want to draw your Lordships' attention to two aspects of the context in which all in Britain today discuss, and in which some of us have to consider, legislation on matters such as those before us in this clause. First, and pervasively, there are strong pressures upon people of every age--and not only upon young people--towards and deeper into sexual activity really as a mark of maturity, of being a fully human person, almost as a human right. Very powerful voices combine to rule out restraint, chastity and saying "no" as undesirable--even unnatural. Secondly, the assumption is widespread--it is almost axiomatic--that homosexual activity in general is as appropriate and as desirable as heterosexual activity. It is for anyone to choose between them as equal options, as it were, on a supermarket shelf.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para7"></a>As the House of Bishops said in its statement a month ago:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Pressures are at work to legitimise any and every lifestyle irrespective of any difference of value and quality between them".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para8"></a>That, with all respect to the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, is the kind of wrong message which I judge it is right to oppose. The statement of the House of Bishops continued:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Our Christian faith teaches that sex is a gift of God for the enriching of our lives within the context of marriage. Rightly used, it has a sacramental quality which speaks of the abiding, permanent and sacrificial love of God for us. It ought not to be treated casually and outside a strong framework of moral values". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para9"></a>I believe that Parliament should be very wary indeed about deserting the wisdom in these matters not only of the Christian faith but of the other major faiths too, of which the noble Baroness, Lady Young, has already made brief mention, and from representatives of which we may hear later in the debate. I believe that we should not take a step which, along with others, will have the effect of further undermining the position of marriage in our society and that we should not collude with, still less approve of, the climate to which I have pointed by voting in a way which will be reported as "Lords back gay sex at 16". The sub-editors will for once be right; and who would want to back sex at 16 for anyone?
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para10"></a>Then there are two particular arguments, in addition to those more general ones, for not lowering the age of homosexual consent to 16. First, and especially in relation to subsection (1) of the clause inserted in the other place--the previous speaker referred to this at much greater length and in much greater detail than I intend to do--the medical risks and the risks to physical health of at any rate a substantial proportion of homosexual sexual activities are significantly greater than those for heterosexuals. Notwithstanding the advice of many professional bodies--I respect both their professionalism and the particular aspects of care to which they draw attention--I, with many others, am not convinced that even today all or even most young <P>


<a name="column_944"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 944</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>people are so clear by 16 about their orientation that there is no risk of their opting prematurely, encouraged by the sexual supermarket to which I referred, into practices and into a culture from which they may later find it difficult to emerge.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para11"></a>I believe that these are strong and clear grounds for rejecting the notion that the reduction to 16 of the age of homosexual consent is simply an issue of justice and that, overall, for the reasons I have adduced, the discrimination that offends some--and understandably when that word is used--in holding the age of consent at 18 is justified.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para12"></a>Lastly, I believe that we shall both care more for young gay people and care more for young people in general by holding the age of consent at 18 than by reducing it to 16, with all the risks to those still younger that I believe will follow such a reduction.

<P>
<A NAME="80722-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   My Lords, I am delighted to contribute to the debate from the Liberal Democrat Benches, although I wish to make it clear that my contribution is made in an individual capacity and in no way reflects the collective views of my noble friends.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para13"></a>I welcome the debate and I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Young, on giving us this opportunity by raising her concern about the inclusion by the Commons of this amendment. I say straightaway that I value the noble Baroness's contribution, but I do not subscribe to her point of view. I know she made a constitutional point that the amendment was not part of the Crime and Disorder Bill when it was introduced in your Lordships' House. I see nothing procedurally wrong in that. In fact, the joy of working in this House is to use every available opportunity to confront the Government and others; and we do so without giving advance notice about supplementaries which often follow Starred Questions. I should add that had I thought of it at the time--I regret that I did not--I would have introduced an amendment similar to the Commons amendment at the appropriate time when the Bill was before the House. I shall explain my reasons why.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para14"></a>I appreciate that your Lordships' House has a great tradition of instigating debates of real concern. This is one such debate. We may fundamentally disagree with colleagues but we value their contributions. Their contributions are no less valid than others. But, having said that, perhaps I may add that I value the Commons amendment. It is timely and deserves the support of your Lordships' House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para15"></a>Of course there are moral, religious and other grounds which may be cited, and are being cited, as reasons for not lowering the age of consent to 16. I shall listen to this argument very carefully, as I have done in the past. I do not profess to be an authority on this subject, but although I have been less than one year in your Lordships' House, I do know about discrimination; I do know about equality; I do know about crime; and I do know about criminality. These are the points on which I wish to build my case in support of the Commons amendment.
<P>


<a name="column_945"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 945</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para16"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Young, talked about public opinion. I ask noble Lords this question: who in 1965--35 years ago--would have ever believed that this country would have three separate pieces of race relations legislation if one had simply decided to act on public opinion? In the past four decades who would have believed that we would have legislation about gender equality, the termination of pregnancy and about homosexual practices in private between consenting persons? Is it that we follow public opinion or do we lead it? These are the debates of the past which made us the envy of the civilised world. Today's debate is another such opportunity where we need to take that particular lead.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para17"></a>We may reduce burglary, but we do not get rid of burglars because we have anti-theft laws. Equally, we do not lock up old ladies to stop mugging in the streets. To use the power of the law to impose our own values on others will not necessarily work. No law can command respect if it discriminates between homosexual and heterosexual partners in a consenting relationship. The law must be an unequivocal statement of public policy. It brings the law into disrepute if it discriminates between sexuality and sexual preferences based on consent.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para18"></a>On the one hand we say that we accept heterosexual relationships by consent for those who are 16 years and over. We do that because we all feel comfortable with it. But then we say that we do not accept homosexual relationships by consent of the same age group. When a law discriminates between different groups of people on the grounds of their sexuality, then it is indeed a bad law. Laws will be obeyed if people feel comfortable with them: bad laws will be difficult to enforce.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para19"></a>To deny equality in law to those whose sexuality is not a norm to many of us does not lend credibility to our case against the age of consent. No one can dispute that we have an unequal age of consent. The Commons amendment is a measure to ensure that discriminatory legislation, which puts male homosexuals in the United Kingdom at risk of becoming prisoners of conscience, is removed and our legislation is brought in line with international human rights standards.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para20"></a>Can we genuinely put our hands on our heart and say that the present legislation has prevented consenting homosexual relationships between 16 and 18 year-olds? Do we really wish to criminalise this group of people? Already many of the provisions--whichever way they are dressed up in the Crime and Disorder Bill--will result in many more youngsters in a custodial situation. Do we really want to add to that number by criminalising some of our young people because they have had consenting relationships with their partners? Do we genuinely believe that young people will not indulge in sexual relationships until they are 18 years of age?
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para21"></a>Perhaps I may quote the British Medical Association.
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The average age at which homosexual men have their first homosexual encounter has been found to be 15.7 years and changing the current law is unlikely to affect this". <P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para22"></a>The BMA goes on to add:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There is no convincing medical reason against reducing the age of consent for male homosexuals to 16 years and, in fact to do so may yield some positive health benefits. Young men will be enabled to seek help and advice without fear of prosecution; and support groups and organisations for homosexual men will be able to provide younger men with support and free education". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para23"></a>Earlier I mentioned my fear of criminalising young people. Homophobia arouses some of the worst reactions in some human beings. I have in the past served as a member of the board of visitors for a prison for many years. I have visited many prisons and also institutions where young people are detained. One of the least known facts is about male rape in prisons. Homophobia is rampant and the treatment meted out to those whose sexuality is suspect is extremely harsh. Sexual bullying of the worst kind often goes unnoticed. I have seen the plight of many who fear to complain. If we deny equality in the age of consent, then we may either create martyrs who will make a public stand against a law of which they disapprove or else we may lead them on the slippery path of a criminal conviction and all that goes with it. The present law is impractical to enforce and this is clearly borne out by the low level of prosecutions brought in the courts.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para24"></a>So what sort of message are we sending out today? On one hand we are saying that heterosexuality is the norm and the law should be used somehow to discourage homosexuality. We subscribe to the principle of equality. We avoid discrimination on the grounds of race, sex, or sexual orientation, but when we examine the policies of our various institutions and their ideals, what do we find? We find again and again that we are prepared to discriminate against homosexual relationships based on consent between 16 and 18 year-olds. That is sheer hypocrisy.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para25"></a>We have, of course, a few priorities to balance and I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Young, for that. The first is the duty of the state to offer protection to those who are being abused sexually. We must have a legal remedy available to those who suffer unwelcome or inappropriate attention. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, who has already indicated about setting up an inter-departmental working group to look at this issue. I am satisfied with this arrangement.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para26"></a>I conclude by saying that it is often necessary to look out of the window and to discover how society has moved on over the past few decades. I do not always subscribe to the views expressed in the Daily Telegraph. But let me pick up one sentence that I would like to put in defence of my case:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"No society can legislate out of existence sexual behaviour of which the majority disapproves". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para27"></a>Of course, I am selective in the quote I have used but this practice cannot be unfamiliar to the Daily Telegraph. Moral values forced on others by law can be counter-productive. I look upon the Bishops' Bench to provide the leadership, which recognises a loving, caring relationship. We do not want to condemn those whose sexuality is different.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para28"></a>The Churches and other religious establishments cannot remain immune from the everyday realities of sexual behaviour in our young people. We require a <P>


<a name="column_947"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 947</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>programme of public education based on recognition of homosexual and heterosexual relationships; a programme based on a safe, loving, caring and responsible attitude to sex. We may argue about the key decision as to the age at which people can be responsible for their sexual behaviour, but evidence clearly demonstrates that we are right in setting this at 16.

<A NAME="80722-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mishcon: </B>   My Lords, the year was 1954. The Home Secretary was David Maxwell Fyfe who eventually graced the Woolsack in your Lordships' House. I received a letter--I have yet to become reconciled to its terms--from the Home Secretary, I then being a rather young chairman of the London County Council. The letter read, "I am thinking of setting up a departmental committee to inquire into the law relating to homosexual offences and prostitution. I can think of no one better than yourself to serve on such a committee". I replied, obviously, saying that I was honoured by that invitation. Your Lordships may remember that that committee became known as the Wolfenden Committee. We reported a couple of years later. I think that your Lordships will agree that that committee does not deserve the description "reactionary" because we led the way in a statute which, for the very first time, made homosexual acts between consenting adults in private legal, as against illegal.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para29"></a>I think that I owe it to the fellow members of that committee, since I believe that I am the only surviving member, to quote at least a couple of paragraphs from that report--I know that I shall have your Lordships' consent--and then sit down. The first quotation relates to our discussion of what the criminal law was all about. Your Lordships will appreciate that we are not talking in terms of morals at the moment; we are talking in terms of the criminal law. We said--I think that this quotation is apposite:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"To define it as 'an act which is punished by the State' does not answer the question: What acts ought to be punished by the State? We have therefore worked with our own formulation of the function of the criminal law so far as it concerns the subject of this enquiry. In this field, its function, as we see it, is to preserve public order and decency, to protect the citizen from what is offensive or injurious, and to provide sufficient safeguards against exploitation and corruption of others, particularly those who are specially vulnerable because they are young, weak in body or mind, inexperienced, or in a state of special physical, official or economic dependence". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para30"></a>Having come to the conclusion that our recommendation ought to be what I summarised a moment ago, we then discussed the question of the age of consent. That is the second and last quotation with which I intend to bother your Lordships. We stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There must obviously be an element of arbitrariness in any decision on this point; but all things considered the legal age of contractual responsibility seems to us to afford the best criterion for the definition of adulthood in this respect. While there are some grounds for fixing the age as low as sixteen, it is obvious that however 'mature' a boy of that age may be as regards physical development or psycho-sexual make-up, and whatever analogies may be drawn from the law relating to offences against young girls, a boy is incapable, at the age of sixteen of forming a mature judgment about actions of a kind which might have the effect of setting him apart from the rest of society". <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_948"></a>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para31"></a>Perhaps I may pause in that quotation for a moment. In discussions about equality, one has to recognise--this is factual; it does not mean that one is unsympathetic or intolerant--the difference between normal and abnormal; and there is no equality between normal and abnormal. We continued:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The young man between eighteen and twenty-one may be expected to be rather more mature in this respect. We have, however, encountered several cases in which young men have been induced by means of gifts of money or hospitality to indulge in homosexual behaviour with older men, and we have felt obliged to have regard to the large numbers of young men who leave their homes at or about the age of eighteen and, either for their employment or their education or to fulfil their national service obligations, are then for the first time launched into the world in circumstances which render them particularly vulnerable to advances of this sort". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-19_para32"></a>The report goes on to say that, on balance, we came to the conclusion that the contractual age--the age at which one should be able to understand agreements and other relationships--which was then 21, was the correct age. Obviously, since that date, the age of majority has been reduced from 21 to 18. That is now the age at which an adult can enter into contractual relationships. I think that it should end there.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80722-20_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, as the widow of a public school headmaster--as such, I well remember the Wolfenden Report and was deeply appreciative of the quotations given from that report by the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon--I should like to support my noble friend Lady Young and to disagree with the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu. It is true that my husband was headmaster of a single-sex school, but what I am about to say applies equally to mixed-sex schools.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-20_para0"></a>The head of a boarding school--or, indeed, of any school--is responsible in every way for the children under his or her care--and children are what we are talking about this evening. Sixteen is a really difficult age, bringing new ideas, new feelings and perhaps the urge to experiment. All these are normal and natural. I know that my husband took a liberal view when coping with the many difficulties faced by the adolescents under his care. Of course, he took appropriate action at the rare times when he knew that there was danger of serious corruption, but to have the age of homosexual consent lowered from 18 to 16 for both sexes would have caused my husband and, I venture to say, heads of boarding schools today, endless difficulties.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-20_para1"></a>As for the pupils, whereas a single, possibly experimental incident can most certainly occur, on the whole it is not the beginning of a lasting orientation. Lowering the age of homosexual consent would, I believe, thoroughly confuse children of both sexes.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-20_para2"></a>I need only touch on the thoroughly unpleasant thought of a 16 year-old who is sexually approached by a master to make my point--and that intolerable situation could have far more lasting results from every point of view. I simply cannot understand the reasoning behind what I consider to be a thoroughly retrograde step.

<A NAME = "80722-20_para3"></a>Perhaps I may finish by quoting from one of the many letters that I have received on this subject:
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Jakobovits: </B>   My Lords, I face a dilemma. While I strongly object to lowering the age of consent, I cannot agree to retaining 18 as the age of consent as if after 18 such conduct is legitimate and morally acceptable. But I do agree that under the age of 18 the moral and physical dangers are far greater. Perhaps we have already conceded too much under pressure from the gay lobby. Public opinion is being manipulated by insistent use or misuse of euphemisms. One speaks about "gays". I like to think of myself as a gay fellow. I enjoy gayness. I object to others appropriating that term. Similarly, "lifestyle" is being abused these days. Even the word "partner" which once had a very innocent meaning is abused. The word is now understood in a very different sense. The word "homophobia" is an addition to our vocabulary which is intended to shape new attitudes and uproot existing moral order.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-20_para5"></a>These are all terms to whitewash what is morally unacceptable to the vast majority of the citizens of this country and elsewhere. We should not aid and abet this abuse of language. Until recently the language to describe such behaviour evoked abhorrence, for instance, by associating such practices with the depravities of the biblical city of Sodom or the pagan Greek island of Lesbos. Today clothing is used to reveal and language to conceal or obfuscate. It used to be the other way around: language was meant to reveal and clothing to conceal. Legislators should not fall into the trap of deception by the misuse of words.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-20_para6"></a>More fundamentally, legislation now threatens to become both inconsistent and undemocratic. To explain, if it is argued, as it has been this evening, that acts between consenting adults should not be branded as wrong or criminal, why retain bigamy or incest as actionable offences, as they still are? Homosexuals demand their civil liberties alongside all other citizens. I am the first to concede that demand so long as it does not harm others. But a tiny dissident minority of under 5 per cent.--perhaps under 1 per cent. according to the latest studies--cannot demand that the other 95 per cent. or 99 per cent. must accept and treat as equal violations of the moral code which, after all, has distinguished civilised life for millennia.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-20_para7"></a>The present Government in particular claim to pursue moral policies, even in foreign affairs. Shall moral standards be demanded in Sierra Leone or other parts of Africa while our own country and in our schools it is no longer the fashion to live by a moral code? In these turbulent times of rising crime and divorce rates, overflowing prisons and the unspeakable misery in millions of broken homes, do we really want to raise youngsters who care only to have a fling, seek no <P>


<a name="column_950"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 950</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>enduring lifetime loyalties, and recognise no moral code and, in the end, no legal code? Britain already has the highest divorce rate in Europe. Add to that the toll of death from AIDS and other debilitating diseases spread mainly by loose living. Do we want to open the floodgates of suffering even further?
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-20_para8"></a>I have no illusions about our capacity to reverse history. For the time being, we shall not revoke the Wolfenden Report of 1956 to which reference has been made; nor shall we alter the Sexual Offences Act 1966 which legitimised homosexual and other unnatural acts among consenting adults. I say that those trends shall not be reversed for the time being but I am convinced that such violations of the laws of God and nature cannot endure in the long run. I profoundly believe that human progress in the long run is inexorable. Maybe sooner rather than later the moral progress of humanity at large will once again be resumed and what is good and decent will prevail.

<P>
<A NAME="80722-20_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, I so completely agree with the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, which combined compassion, common sense and humanity, that I wonder how I can say anything further to assist the House in deciding the great question now before noble Lords. The question before us is whether we should disagree with the democratically elected Chamber of Parliament on a question of basic rights and freedoms.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-20_para9"></a>Speaking as one Jew to another, I say with great respect to the noble Lord, Lord Jakobovits, that it is extremely dangerous for any minority to speak in the language of majoritarianism. In particular the Jewish Members of this House should perhaps remember that Hitler and the Nazis persecuted not only the Jews and gypsies but also homosexuals. No doubt the Nazis who did so represented a strong majority in Nazi Germany. No doubt it is also true that at the moment those who propose to disagree with the Commons consider that they have a moral majority in the country at large based on opinion polls. I do not believe that basic rights and freedoms should be decided on the basis of majoritarianism or the outcome of opinion polls.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-20_para10"></a>There is one matter that I should draw to your Lordships' attention. No one else has done so. We will not be debating this matter and deciding the question entirely within the confines of this Chamber. What we say and do this evening will be read and studied with interest by the European Court of Human Rights when it comes to decide the pending case of Evan Sutherland. We are as bound in international law by the European Human Rights Convention as is another place, our courts and the Government. If we decide to disagree with the Commons amendment--which seems an entirely plain, simple and workable amendment, restoring equality and nothing more--we shall disable the Government from being able to comply with our international treaty obligations. It will be virtually certain that we shall once more be condemned by the European Court of Human Rights. By a commanding majority, the European Commission of Human Rights has looked at all the arguments and has found that there <P>


<a name="column_951"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 951</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is no objective or reasonable justification for maintaining a higher minimum age of consent to male homosexual than to heterosexual acts. There is discriminatory treatment in the enjoyment of the applicant's right to respect for his private life. The case has gone to the European Court; it is being delayed by the determination and outcome of this vote in your Lordships' House. Unless the Commons amendment is passed into law, it is a virtual certainty that the court will uphold the European Commission's opinion.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-20_para11"></a>Perhaps I may tell your Lordships what that opinion was. The Commission observed that current medical opinion is to the effect that sexual orientation is fixed for both sexes by the age of 16. Men aged 16 to 21 are not in need of special protection because of the risk of their being recruited into homosexuality. The commission noted that the British Medical Association had found that the risk posed by predatory older men would appear to be as serious whether the victim is a man or a woman and did not justify the differential age of consent.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-20_para12"></a>The Commission observed that even if there may be some young men who, after the age of 16, may require protection, it is not a proportionate response to the need for protection to expose to criminal sanctions not only the older men who engage in homosexual acts with a person under the age of 18, but the young man himself who is claimed to be in need of protection.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-20_para13"></a>As for society's claimed entitlement to indicate disapproval of homosexual conduct and its preference for a heterosexual lifestyle, the Commission found that that did not constitute an objective and reasonable justification for inequality of treatment in the criminal law.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-20_para14"></a>Those are the findings of the great majority in the Commission. I have no doubt that they will be followed in the court. Every word that your Lordships say this evening will be taken into account by both sides.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80722-21_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mishcon: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord has a specialised knowledge of the procedure in the European Court of Human Rights. He knows that it would not be the first time that a court of human rights has differed from the preliminary findings of the Commission. He will also know that the Commission will largely be going out of existence very shortly and a new court formed at the end of this year, which may take an entirely different view.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-21_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne: </B>   My Lords, both points made by the noble Lord are correct. He is perfectly right that one cannot say with certainty that the court will follow the Commission. It is also right that there are 40 new judges of whom 20 come from the old court and the Commission. I am simply giving my forecast based upon the reasoning of the Commission. It is worth no more nor less than that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-21_para0"></a>The matter has been best summed up by someone of great political experience in a speech in another place. He said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Let us be clear about the issue before us tonight. It is not at what age we wish young people to have sex. It is whether the criminal law should discriminate between heterosexual and homosexual sex. <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_952"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 952</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>It is therefore an issue not of age, but of equality. By supporting equality, no one is advocating or urging gay sex at 16 any more than those who would maintain the age of consent for heterosexual sex advocate that girls or boys of 16 should have sex. It is simply a question of whether there are grounds for discrimination. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"At present, the law discriminates. There is no doubt about the personal misery that such discrimination brings to young people frightened to admit their own sexuality and of the fear of imprisonment and to any man who is homosexual and who knows that the criminal law treats that in a different and more incriminating way".--[Official Report, Commons, 21/2/94; cols. 97-98.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-21_spnew2"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Bath and Wells: </B>   My Lords, I speak as one of a minority amongst my colleagues on these Benches. Having listened to the speeches, it is important that it can be seen and understood that not all religious people feel the same way. I understand and respect the conclusions of the majority of my colleagues. I agree with much that the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury wrote in his article this morning. I particularly appreciate his encouragement that those who hold different views according to conscience should be able to speak.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-21_para2"></a>This matter is tremendously important. It affects an often marginalised minority. Homophobia may be a new word but it is not a new experience; it is deep-rooted and long-lasting. It affects young people in particular. As always, we need to exercise special attention because of the power of the majority--special attention to justice and the avoidance of discrimination, as with all minorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-21_para3"></a>I speak after many years of talking with homosexual people about these issues and, within the limitations of my own understanding, acting as a counsellor to many. I have studied the Bible for 40 years and I have a deep reverence for the teachings of Jesus Christ. It is the model for my life, like many in your Lordships' House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-21_para4"></a>This amendment poses us a serious moral difficulty. It reduces the age of consent for anal intercourse, which is quite unacceptable. I agree that it is often both dangerous and demeaning for both heterosexual and homosexual people. At the same time the amendment offers an important, overdue and much-needed opportunity to reduce the threatening and unjust discrimination against gay people. They may be a minority; they are very rarely heard in the gatherings where such decisions are made; they may not be heard but perceived.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-21_para5"></a>Although I am chairman of the Children's Society, I do not speak on its behalf this evening. But that society is committed to being non-discriminatory in its work. I have had the opportunity to speak to the society staff who are working specifically with young gay people and they have influenced my thinking. People who wish the age to be kept at 18 talk about protecting young people during the maturing process. One of my regrets about the whole debate is that no image is given to homosexual young people as to how they might constructively lead their lives. The concentration is always upon anal intercourse.
<P>


<a name="column_953"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 953</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-21_para6"></a>Of course there are people who are ambivalent and uncertain in their teenage years. Some people are ambivalent and uncertain throughout their lives. Those uncertainties about identity can be just as strong for young heterosexual people. It is amazing how often in the debate one can say, "And this would be the same for heterosexual people." We load on to that minority a burden of moral responsibility, a burden of pressure from society, yet hardly seem to pay attention to the immoralities of heterosexual people, the abuse of children by heterosexual people and the abuse in families by heterosexual people of young children. I cannot help but feel that there is a scapegoating procedure going on here which is not new in history and not new in our society.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-21_para7"></a>I share with my colleagues concern over the way in which sexual intercourse, for so many vulnerable young people, has been detached in their minds, it seems, from commitment, mutuality and understanding. For such young people there is a degree of protection at law under the child protection provisions if they are used as they could be. Perhaps after the working party they will be strengthened in that regard.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-21_para8"></a>It is my hope that the child protection procedures will be used, as has happened in several projects around the country, in the defence of child prostitutes and that the pimps and clients will be prosecuted for their behaviour and not those young people who have often become what they are because they have themselves been victims of abuse.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-21_para9"></a>As well as those who are ambivalent about their sexual identity, who are undecided about it, there are many older boys--are they really young men?--who by the time they are 16 are convinced they are gay. The workers to whom I have talked in the Children's Society say that because of the difficulty and uncertainty involved in accepting that they are gay, most homosexual young people have often been made to think much more deeply about their identity than their friends who are heterosexual. Few people I have met have chosen to be gay, but rather accept it as a difficult journey.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-21_para10"></a>A young person who suspects that he is gay will often disguise his feelings for fear of ridicule and because he himself cannot accept the fact. It is not so difficult to know if one is attracted to one sex or the other. We have mentioned public schools. We must recognise that the segregation of the sexes has played a part in history in those misunderstandings. For the person involved, it is a daily fact of life as to whether they are attracted to their own or the opposite sex.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-21_para11"></a>At the moment, the 16 or 17 year-old gay has to deal with the problem of prejudice and criminalisation. That is not a small matter. It is a fear that spreads, not in a preventive or helpful way but into every corner of his self-respect and the attitudes of others. We should encourage young people who perceive themselves to be gay to establish a realistic, loving ethic. They need to be able to talk about it free of fear as do those who are still ambivalent. They need education and discussion without prejudice and without fear of punishment.
<P>


<a name="column_954"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 954</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-21_para12"></a>As long as we give them no support or recognition, they will find it difficult to set about their lives, to make faithful relationships. The option of marriage, so blithely suggested, is not an option for someone who understands himself to be gay. Indeed, many marriages have fallen foul of that precise idea because people have come to understand their orientation in later life.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-21_para13"></a>We leave those people in an unchaste world, without a recognised ethic to live by or aim for, except chastity. It is wrong that in the amendment what might be expected of intimacy between two homosexual people is defined so often as anal intercourse which I continue to believe to be wrong, physically damaging, and all the other things that have been mentioned.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-21_para14"></a>The homosexual sub-culture is caused partly by the experience of ghettoisation, reinforced by legal sanctions. In our efforts to prevent people from becoming gay, we often end up by endorsing the prejudices and the risks they run by criminalising them. The moral dilemma remains for me in the amendment. Do we vote to take an important step to tackle inequality and discrimination? That would be voting in favour of a moral implication of which I cannot approve. We are presented with an imperfect package: to accept it or to reject it involves a wrong action. It is doubtful whether it has been well constructed and well made.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-21_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Longford: </B>   My Lords, Sir Winston Churchill was asked a good many years ago, "Which side were you on in the Spanish Civil War?" He replied, "Both sides." That roughly applies to the position I have taken in homosexual debates over the past half century. I was interested to hear from my dear friend Lord Mishcon that he is the last surviving member of the Wolfenden Committee. I was the only person who was ready to touch the report when it came out. I opened a debate in this House in favour of it. Other than those who spoke in the debates in both Houses, no one was anxious to be associated with the report. So, as one might say, I have a few ancient medals. Professor Rowse once said to me that my trouble was that I had had no homosexual experience. I do not know how far that applies to other Members of the House. Looking around, I do not know. All my best friends at Eton are dead, so they would not be here!
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-21_para15"></a>I have no prejudice against homosexuals except in the sense that I am profoundly grateful that none of my eight children, 26 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren has shown homosexual tendencies so far as I am aware. If they had shown them, I should have loved them just the same but felt an extra compassion because I regard homosexuality--it is the concept that annoys them most of all--as a sickness. A sickness is a great handicap in life. One does not blame people for a sickness, so I do not blame them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-21_para16"></a>However, when it comes to practice, that is another matter. Of course I was profoundly moved by the last speech, when someone has worked so hard on behalf of these unfortunate people. But, from a Christian point of view, homosexual practice is sinful. No one can doubt that, surely. We know that adultery is sinful. All sex outside marriage is sinful in Christian teaching. In that sense, homosexual conduct is sinful.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-21_para17"></a>We then come to the law. I still agree that I did the right thing in opening the debate in favour of the Wolfenden Report. I cannot agree with the noble Lord, Lord Jakobovits, although I have a tremendous respect for what he said on the subject. Somehow or other one has to strike a balance between the freedom to develop ourselves and vulnerability. We need to protect certain people.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-21_para18"></a>To put it crudely, if someone seduced my daughter it would be damaging and horrifying but not fatal. She would recover, marry and have lots of children (as some such people do). On the other hand, if some elderly, or not so elderly, schoolmaster seduced one of my sons and taught him to be a homosexual, he would ruin him for life. That is the fundamental distinction. I must repeat my conviction: as regards rent boys (about which I know, not from first-hand but second-hand experience) one can ruin a person for life by treating him as a homosexual object when he is in his teens.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-21_para19"></a>I draw a distinction. There is no doubt about that distinction. I am sorry if the feminists--I always call myself a feminist--say there is no distinction. There must be a distinction because of the point I made. A girl is not ruined for life by being seduced. A young fellow is. That is the distinction. I support the amendment.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-21_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Habgood: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry that noble Lords have to hear yet another voice from the Church of England, even if I am now on the other Benches. I have spent much of time as a bishop trying to mediate between opposing positions. The fact that your Lordships have heard two very different accounts from the Church of England is not dishonourable; it is mature. I do not think that anyone can enter fully into this debate without realising that we are debating an agonising subject in which there is no clear right decision. If we feel that it is entirely clear cut, I think that we have not understood the argument.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-21_para20"></a>I was delighted when the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, mentioned the Wolfenden Committee. It is probably not known generally that, prior to that commission, the Church of England produced an unpublished report on homosexuality. It was that report which recommended that the homosexuality between consenting adults should no longer be a criminal offence and gave the green light to the government of the day. So the Church of England has long been involved in this and does not have the anti-homosexual stance which is nowadays sometimes pinned on it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-21_para21"></a>We have surely no wish to victimise homosexuals, still less to criminalise them. Yet despite that, I have an unease about lowering the age of consent still further. There are too many examples in the past of well-meaning legislation which has had undesirable and unexpected effects. We may accept that we lower the age of consent to 16 now, but in practice it gives the green light to 14 year-olds; and we are going down a slippery slope.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-21_para22"></a>The reason why I believe we should be cautious--we may not agree to this amendment but to some of the others--is that none of the reasons given for a change <P>


<a name="column_956"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 956</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>seems strong. The first reason we were given with great eloquence is that young people are practising it anyway. That does not seem to me a good reason for changing the law. Indeed, I do not see how a Government could follow that argument when they are trying to do exactly the opposite as regards smoking.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-21_para23"></a>The second reason given is what one might call the medical advice argument: that only if homosexuality at 16 is made legal will young boys be prepared to talk to their doctors. I think that that reason is inconsistent. That inconsistency is often indicated quite blatantly. For example, are 16 year-old boys generally firm in their sexual identity, or are they not? If they are firm in their sexual identity, it seems to me that there should be no problem about discussing the matter with some wise adviser at any age, without having to indulge in particular sexual activities in order to discover that they are homosexual.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-21_para24"></a>On the other hand, if they are not firm in their sexual identity at the age of 16, many people have warned that that fluidity of identity might be put under pressure if the law were to be changed. One of the arguments has always been that boys mature later than girls. But there is a fluidity. One cannot be certain at the age of 16, and therefore one does not want to encourage anyone to get involved in a homosexual lifestyle at that age. But one cannot have it both ways. Either they are mature, or they are not.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-21_para25"></a>The third argument which has been discussed considerably in this debate is about equality. Equality is of enormous importance. I refer to equality between girls and boys, and between homosexuals and heterosexuals, all of whom are equal as persons, and all of whom have equal rights in large areas of life. But, in terms of sexual activity, boys and girls, and homosexuals and heterosexuals are not equal. That is the whole point. They are different. To treat them as though they were equal is, I believe, to open a door to changes further down the line which could be highly undesirable. If the equality argument works, there is no reason for saying that homosexual partnerships should not be able to adopt children, or be treated in all respects as marriages. We need to ask ourselves whether that is the kind of recognition that we want to give. There are deep differences.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-21_para26"></a>Finally, I believe that the argument about discrimination contains a large element of logical muddle. There are circumstances in life when we need to discriminate. The key question is: when is discrimination wrong and when is it necessary? Perhaps I may dare to take an example from your Lordships' House in the appointment of life Peers. How is that difficult decision made by whoever makes it? We might properly say that there should be no discrimination on grounds of race, sex, colour, sexual orientation or anything of that kind, because those are not relevant to the duties of a Peer. But there ought to be discrimination on the basis of ability, experience, public service and so on because those qualities are relevant.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-21_para27"></a>Applying that argument, when should we discriminate on the issue of homosexuality? We should not discriminate in employment and in terms of a whole raft <P>


<a name="column_957"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 957</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of human rights in society, but we should discriminate precisely on the issue of sexual activity because that is most relevant to this particular distinction.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-21_para28"></a>To claim non-discrimination in this context is to beg the whole question. In fact, it is to argue in a circle. It is like saying that we must not be discriminatory about somebody's record of public service when inviting them to become a public servant; or that we must not discriminate on grounds of sexual orientation when we are discussing homosexual practice. The argument is viciously circular.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-21_para29"></a>Such matters cannot be decided on the basis of some general principle of non-discrimination. They have to be decided on the basis of moral argument and on the weight of the evidence, not on some blanket appeal. It seems to me that the evidence in this case is not clear-cut. That is why I believe it is wise to be cautious and to make sure that this discussion is not the end of the process but the initiation of a process which will produce more balanced legislation in the slightly longer run.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

It is not entirely plain, simple and workable because your Lordships have fallen into confusion over it.

<P>

<A NAME = "80722-22_para1"></a>The decision of another place was made after a debate introduced at Third Reading without any of the normal preceding discussion in that place.

<A NAME = "80722-22_para2"></a>I believe that what we have here has accurately been described by my noble friend as a defective amendment which your Lordships were prevented from discussing in Committee and returning to points again and again, over perhaps a day or a day-and-a-half, as we would expect on an issue of this kind--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-22_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, what is wrong with the amendment is that it will expose, for instance, girls of 16 to buggery without the act of so treating them being illegal. It will expose boys of 16 to exploitation by older men without those men being the subject of the criminal law. I hear what the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, says so forcefully on that and I also hear what the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Bath and Wells so movingly says. I, too, am on the rack; I see the difficulty. Together with the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester, I believe that the balance goes in favour of the law as it is, unless we can achieve something better. We cannot achieve something better by the process in which we are now engaged. It is clear that we must have either something which many of us believe to be dangerous and defective or we must stick with the present law. The only way out of the difficulty is another measure in another Session, properly introduced in one House, going through all its stages in that House, then brought to the next House and going through all its stages there. That is what Parliament is designed for; that is what it should do; and that is what my noble friend is giving it an opportunity to do. I ask your Lordships to support her.

<FONT SIZE=3>wishes to ask my noble friend Lord Williams of Mostyn a question. I do not believe that that will take long. The two protagonists--the noble Earl, Lord Russell, and the noble Lord, Lord Annan--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-22_spnew14"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   There are three!
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-22_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, I understand. I was going to suggest that we heard only two, but I think that we should now hear only one.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-22_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, for his letter in relation to protecting 16 and 17 year-olds from abuse of trust. I am pleased that the Government are taking seriously the issue of vulnerability and the need to ensure that the young are adequately protected.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-22_para3"></a>The Minister's answer may show some of your Lordships how to vote. We know that young boys and girls can be very vulnerable in care homes, boarding schools and even prisons. Can the Minister say when the group's recommendations will be enshrined in legislation? There is a worrying situation with the increase in prostitution among young boys and girls; indeed, the age range is getting younger and younger. HIV and AIDS still constitute a great danger in the younger age group of homosexuals. I feel that teachers should be able to give advice to children on these difficult and sensitive issues. Would it not be wise to try to get the safeguards in place first so that a safer message goes out from this House?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-22_spnew21"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, with the greatest respect, the situation has become impossible. I think that we should hear the noble Lord, Lord Annan, followed by the noble Earl, Lord Russell, and then we should proceed as I suggested.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-22_spnew22"></A><B> Lord Annan: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord the Leader of the House. Indeed, it is very good of him to allow me to take part in the debate. There is one reason why we should not overturn the Commons amendment, which I do not believe has been mentioned. We all tend to be much older than those in the other place. Moreover, the other place also has another advantage; namely, it now has a large number of women in it. Over the years, I have noticed that women are much more understanding and less shockable about sexual affairs than men very often are.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-22_para4"></a>On the question of whether 16 year-olds are mature, I think that, in some ways, they are not so self-sufficient as my generation was; they have too many labour-saving devices. But, at the same time, can we really doubt that <P>


<a name="column_960"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 960</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>boys and girls are much more mature physiologically and mentally than they were at the time, for example, of the Wolfenden Report--safe sex, seduction and homosexuality are openly discussed in schools and in public life. Indeed, television programmes, newspaper reports, magazine articles and the Internet pullulate with descriptions of courtship and foreplay, and sexual activity is analysed interminably. That simply means that people are better informed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-22_para5"></a>That brings me to my second point. Of course, I am delighted with the Government's response to Mr. Joe Ashton's proposed amendment. However, it is important for us to remember that, while we have all been appalled by the recent revelations of abuse of children and by the distressing plight of those who leave home, live on the streets and have to rely on their wits, none of that will be altered or made better by agreeing to the Motion standing in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Young: the same evils will continue to flourish however we vote tonight. Therefore, let us not confuse paedophilia with the age of consent. The monsters who abuse their trust as wardens of children's homes would have done so, whatever the age of consent may have been.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-22_para6"></a>I am puzzled by the speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Quirk. I recognise that the issue of anal intercourse arouses extremely strong feelings of revulsion; indeed, people are horrified to appear to condone such acts. However, I am bound to say that sociologists of sexual behaviour declare in their researches that such acts are practised between married couples as well as between homosexual partners. He seemed to suggest that anal intercourse should again be made illegal for everyone of whatever age.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-22_para7"></a>When discussing a Bill in 1994, the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, reminded us that such acts between men and women are often threatened to be brought out in court in order to secure a higher settlement in a divorce case; in other words, if you accuse your partner of such an act, he will shun the publicity and agree to pay more. However, I hope that the House will bear with me if I conclude my remarks by describing what happened in 1967 about this particular problem. At one stage of the Bill's proceedings the late Lord Dilhorne taunted the then Archbishop of Canterbury by asking him whether he favoured legalising the act of buggery. On Third Reading he still persisted and moved that the act of sodomy should be removed from the Bill. He brought upon himself this retort from the late Lady Wootton:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I ask myself what are the opponents of this Bill afraid of? They cannot be afraid that these disgusting practices will be thrown upon their attention because these acts are legalised only if they are performed in private ... I can only suppose that the opponents of the Bill will be tormented by visions of what would be going on elsewhere. Surely, if that is so, that is their own private misfortune, and no reason for imposing their personal standard of taste and morality on the minority of their fellow citizens". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-22_para8"></a>I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Young, on the powerful speech with which she introduced the debate. I also admire her as a former Leader of the House as regards the skilful way in which she has marshalled a great body of support behind her. <P>


<a name="column_961"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 961</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>However, I ask myself whether in fact in the end--not, of course, today--the late Lady Wootton's view of such matters will not prevail.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="80722-23_spnew2"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Earl Russell!
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-23_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, again, with the greatest of respect, I do not think it helps anyone if noble Lords just shout across the Floor of the House. If my noble friend Lord Stoddart feels that his contribution to this debate is as essential as he seems to suggest, no doubt the House will be polite enough to listen to it after we have heard from the noble Earl, Lord Russell.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-23_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, when the noble Lord, Lord Habgood, asked on what grounds it is proper to discriminate, he went to the very heart of this debate. I was reminded of a passage in Lord Baden-Powell's Scouting for Boys which I first read when I was 13. A Japanese applicant for the Army was turned down because of his bad teeth and he reported thereafter that one was nowadays expected not only to kill the enemy but also to eat him. Of course, Lord Baden-Powell, explained afterwards that good teeth were relevant to fitness to be a soldier and that cradling a rifle against one's teeth when one had an abscess was not always reliable.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-23_para0"></a>Therefore, we have to ask what forms of discrimination are proper to the nature and purpose of the criminal law. Here we come to the questions raised by the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon--the Finality Jack of this debate, if I may so describe him. As I understand it, the criminal law is designed to protect us against injuries inflicted upon us by others. I accept the legal maxim volenti non fit injuria (to a willing person there is no injury done), but it is not the purpose of the criminal law simply to say, "I'm going to prohibit it because I dislike it". It is not even the purpose of the criminal law to say, "I prohibit it because I disapprove of it".
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-23_para1"></a>There is practically no one of us in this Chamber who does not take part in one activity or another which some of our fellow subjects would like to ban. I speak as a smoker. I concede against my own interest that those who would wish to ban my activity have a much stronger case to make than the case made by the noble Baroness, Lady Young. However, before the House goes down that road, I shall ask noble Lords to consider what they will feel about those who would wish, as many of us have in years past, to ban the consumption of alcohol in any form whatever. As soon as one says, "I'm going to ban it because I think it is wrong", one is on a very slippery slope. The only valid ground for banning things is because they inflict harm on other people who do not wish it done to them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-23_para2"></a>I hope the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, will forgive me for saying that I listened to her speech with a certain pride. My first attempt to argue the case for <P>


<a name="column_962"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 962</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>non-discrimination was over the admission of women to the Oxford Union. Your Lordships may not now believe that that created quite as much moral outrage as this proposal has done. I remember Mr. Brian Walden, when he was president, being asked what reasons there were against the admission of women. He replied, "There were no reasons; there are prejudices". I do not ascribe my success in getting that through to my own oratory, nor even to Paul Foot's discovery of his gift for satire, which was the high point of the debates, but for their realisation that they would have to debate it every year until they agreed to it. They thought at first it was a fate worse than death. If having the noble Baroness in the presidential chair is a fate worse than death, then death is a great deal less alarming than I supposed! Talking to a good many of your Lordships, I have noticed that there is some confusion about the concept of a sexual orientation. There is a sense of people being able to choose. I do not think they remember what St. Augustine of Hippo said; namely, that sexual feelings are not under the control of the will.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-23_para3"></a>Probably about 10 per cent. of your Lordships who are listening to me are left-handed. Attempts have been made to make out that left-handers are unequal. If anyone doubts that, they should think of the meanings attached to the word "dexterous", and even more to the word "sinister". When I was young there were still parents who used to attempt to make their children right-handed by smacking them until they were. All they ever succeeded in doing was producing a stammer. Many people hesitate for a long time before they know whether they are right or left-handed. It does not mean they are waiting to choose. It means that the development is not yet complete and that it has not yet emerged. I believe a sexual orientation is much more like that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-23_para4"></a>The BMA states--and I agree--that a common feature of these factors that cause a sexual orientation is,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"that they operate at a much earlier age than 16". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-23_para5"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, said there was no equality between the normal and the abnormal. Suppose he had worded that, "There is no equality between the usual and the unusual". That is a very different statement. I think the second statement would be more material to the case.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-23_para6"></a>We have had an argument put forward about equal moral authority. It is difficult for all of us to concede equal moral authority to things of which we passionately disapprove. That is why parliamentary debate is so difficult. That is why the recognition of the concept of a loyal opposition in politics took nearly two centuries to learn. We have learnt in Parliament that the way to deal with profound moral disagreement is by agreement on the rules of engagement. That is the ground on which I believe the noble Baroness, Lady Young, and I are in complete agreement. That is the common ground between us on moral matters. I think that is what John Stuart Mill was groping for. I do not think we can say that things are immoral simply because we happen to disagree with them; still less can we ban them simply because we happen to disagree with them.
<P>


<a name="column_963"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 963</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-23_para7"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Quirk, that all sexual activity carries some medical risk but that does not appear to deter most of us. My sister-in-law, who used to be assistant editor of the Lancet, assured me that the medical risks of celibacy were even greater.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-23_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Quirk: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Earl for giving way. I assure the House that I shall speak briefly. This is an argument of reductio ad absurdum. I was not arguing on the grounds of prejudice, and I was arguing not on the grounds of equal danger. I was simply quoting medical authorities that showed that anal intercourse was very much riskier than vaginal intercourse. That, I think, is undeniable.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-23_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, if the noble Lord had listened carefully to me he would have observed that I did not attempt to deny it. I said that danger does not normally deter people from the only type of sexual activity to which they are drawn. I think that goes for all of us.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-23_para8"></a>Much of this debate has concentrated on the amendment moved in another place by Mr. Joe Ashton. Here I think the noble Baroness, Lady Young, and I have a good deal of common ground. As my noble friend Lady Thomas of Walliswood said to me when we were discussing this matter, non-discrimination is a basic Liberal principle. Preventing the abuse of power is also a basic Liberal principle. But that is wide of the issue of this amendment because the need for protection applies to homosexuals and heterosexuals equally, as indeed Mr. Ashton conceded.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-23_para9"></a>I think the noble Baroness and I agree that Mr. Ashton's amendment was too widely drafted. I must declare an interest in that view. Being married to a former pupil and after 35 years of happy marriage I am quite unable to bring myself to believe that we did anything wrong. There are two categories where I think we should concentrate the protection. One is those who are in loco parentis and the other is those who use fear or favour derived from an official position to obtain sexual favours. I think that is roughly the ground of our agreement. I hope that the noble Baroness will correct me if I am wrong.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-23_para10"></a>The Government wish to tackle this within the context of a review of sexual offences. Since we have also the review of the Equal Opportunities Commission of the law on sexual harassment which must be fitted in with the rest of the jigsaw, that seems to me to make sense. We cannot do it in this Bill. Mr. Ashton's amendment criminalised sex between people who are nevertheless free to marry. One cannot leave that to be the case; it must be changed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-23_para11"></a>I believe the Government are totally sincere in the undertakings they have given not only because I believe they are honourable men and women but also because it goes along with the way the work is going, and it goes along with their own interest. I accept the assurances Mr. Michael and others have been given. But if by any chance I should be wrong, I give an assurance to the noble Baroness, Lady Young, that if the Bill on sexual offences comes before us and it does not have any such protection, if she and I can agree on the draft of an <P>


<a name="column_964"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 964</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendment on the lines which we have discussed--and I believe we can--I shall put my name to it together with hers. To that I believe the Government might listen.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-23_para12"></a>It is easy to be too over-protective of the young. By sheer chance I was reading last weekend a speech made in another place which argued about a Bill to prohibit marriage in Oxford and Cambridge heads of houses. The speaker said that the mere sight of women was so exciting that young men became quite unable to study. I know that is not true. That is being over-protective. I fear we may make the same mistake again today.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-24_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, in spite of the fact that the noble Lord the Leader of the House was contemptuous of any contribution which I might make to this debate tonight, nevertheless I shall make it. There are some of us in the Labour Party who still believe in democratic debate and free speech. I am sorry that there were some murmurs of dissent from this side of the House. I always thought that we believed in democratic debate and free speech, and that is precisely what I intend to embark upon.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-24_para0"></a>When this matter was debated in 1994, I took the view that the age of consent should be the age of majority. As the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, pointed out, that was the view taken by the Wolfenden Committee. I have not changed my mind since then. I believe that it is perfectly legitimate for the House of Commons to insert the amendment; but it is just as legitimate for this House--since it is the only second Chamber that we have--to disagree with that amendment. It is a democratic right under our constitution to do so. So it presents no constitutional problem at all. Bearing in mind that it was the result of a Back Bench Motion in the House of Commons and not a government Motion, it is legitimate for a Back Bench Motion in this House, as moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Young, to be carried in this House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-24_para1"></a>I wish to make one or two other points. I heard Ben Bradshaw this morning on the "Today" programme implying that this was a party political issue and that we were to discuss a Tory amendment and the Tories were against the lowering of the age of homosexual consent and the Labour Party was for it. This is not a party political issue. It is a cross-party political issue. There are people of both parties, and none, who take differing views on the amendment. Let us make no mistake about that. To suggest, as Mr. Bradshaw did, that the Motion of the noble Baroness, Lady Young, is a Tory attempt to throw out the Commons amendment is incorrect. As I say, it is supported by Members of all parties, and none. Indeed, it is not sensible of him, in the face of the large majority of people in the country who are against lowering the age of consent for homosexual acts, to suggest that it is only the Conservatives who speak for that large majority. That is not sensible in party political terms. I hope that my noble friends will take note of that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-24_para2"></a>It has also been suggested that the issue is only a religious issue. It is not. It is a moral issue which concerns all of us, religious or irreligious. I am not religious. However, I believe that it would be a mistake to agree to the amendment passed by the House of Commons.
<P>


<a name="column_965"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 965</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-24_para3"></a>It is also suggested by those who favour lowering the age of consent that those who oppose it are homophobic. That is an insult to heterosexual people, the majority of whom do not want the Commons amendment carried. I am not homophobic in any way. I do not dislike or hate people of a different sexual orientation from the normal, so long as they are adult and know what they are doing. It is not a question of homophobia; it is a question of people having a differing view.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-24_para4"></a>I believe that we should continue to protect young people between the ages of 16 and 18 from being seduced into what is undoubtedly an unnatural practice and one which may have an enormous and possibly detrimental effect on them for the rest of their lives. It is surely not unreasonable to be concerned about that. That does not mean that one is homophobic. My noble friend says, "Yes". It is not homophobic to want to protect young people between the ages of 16 and 18. I say it from my own experience. People who have a different sexual orientation from mine, if they are adult, are entitled to have that orientation and to practise it. That is my view, and it is the view of many others who support the noble Baroness, Lady Young.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-24_para5"></a>Those who support the amendment say that they demand equality before the law for homosexual acts. But there is no equality between heterosexual and homosexual behaviour. One is the natural order of things; the other is not. Indeed, if nature had intended otherwise, it would undoubtedly have constructed the human body differently. It is young adolescents about whom we must be worried. We are sending them conflicting signals. On the one hand, sexual licence is being encouraged, and on the other there is increasing concern about rape, paedophilia and other sexual problems. The Commons amendment will only serve to confuse society even more, especially young people.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-24_para6"></a>We must also ask: what is the next milestone? Is it to lower the age of consent to 14, or 12, or to what age? The case for lowering the age of consent for homosexual acts to 16 has not been made out beyond any shadow of doubt. Therefore, in my view the benefit of the doubt should be given to the continued protection of 16 to 18 year-olds. For that reason I shall support the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-24_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St. Johns: </B>   My Lords, in speaking to this amendment and to the Motions of my three noble friends, I do not seek to persuade my noble friends or other noble Lords to vote in a specific manner. There is no party Whip on these Benches on this issue. It is a free vote. In that spirit, I shall not indicate my personal views.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-24_para7"></a>In advance of speaking in this debate I explained my role to my three noble friends and gave them a copy of my speech. I believe that my task today is to attempt to assist your Lordships on a difficult matter of principle and practical politics. This issue makes us reach deep into our psyche. It makes us examine our views on morality and the manner in which we believe society should function.

<a name="column_966"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 966</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-24_para8"></a>In considering the matter before the House, we have to weigh a number of different considerations before arriving at a decision. First, there is the point of principle. At what age do we believe it right for the criminal law to provide that it is lawful for homosexual men to have consenting sex in private? At present, the age is 18, and the new clause provides for that age to be 16.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-24_para9"></a>Secondly, but closely allied, do we believe that it is right to provide for a different age of consent for heterosexuals and homosexuals? The new clause would provide for the homosexual age of consent to be the same as that for heterosexuals.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-24_para10"></a>Some have argued that homosexual and lesbian practices are not another and an equivalent normality; that they are practices that are not only different from heterosexual behaviour, but should also not be ranked as equal or equivalent to it. Others argue that a belief in equality on this issue does not involve the recognition that all people are equal with each other--that the clause addresses equality before the criminal law.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-24_para11"></a>Thirdly, there is the question of our treaty obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, soon to be enacted directly into British law, to which reference has been made. Our existing provisions were the subject of a report of the European Commission of Human Rights, adopted on 1st July last year, which allowed an application to the European Court of Human Rights from Euan Sutherland that the provisions were in breach of Article 8 of the convention relating to privacy when read together with Article 14 relating to discrimination. It is true that the report was fairly trenchant. It does not mean, of course, that the case would be decided that way if it came to court. Nevertheless, the Government then applied to stay all proceedings on the basis of an undertaking that they would provide for an early vote on the subject in Parliament or, failing that, that they would allow for a resolution in another place and for legislation before the end of the next session.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-24_para12"></a>Fourthly, I believe that there is a wider point of legislative principle here. Should we legislate in order to try to change human behaviour, or should we legislate to try to regulate how we know--or perhaps how we think we know--that people will behave? This is the very judgment that we exercise each and every time we debate a new Bill or a new regulation in this House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-24_para13"></a>Fifthly, but closely allied to that judgment--it is a practical example of it--there is the question of public health, which many have raised tonight, in particular protecting the health of young people from sexually transmitted diseases, of which AIDS is the most deadly. Some argue that by reducing the age of consent one would encourage dangerous practices that could lead to AIDS. Others argue that, by taking homosexual practices out of the criminal law for those aged between 16 and 18, it would be possible to give further protection to young people by making it more possible to teach them how to protect themselves from sexually transmitted diseases.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-24_para14"></a>Deep concerns have been expressed tonight about the situation of young people of the ages of 16 or 17 who may need protection from those who might exploit their <P>


<a name="column_967"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 967</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>vulnerability. My noble friend Lady Young referred in her opening speech to the fact that the Government have set up an interdepartmental group to deal with issues underlying such concerns. Can the Minster tonight give the House some details about the work of this group? For example, can he confirm that it will cover such issues as the definition of a position of trust, the scope of occupations to be covered and the definition of those who need to be protected? I look forward to the response by the Minister to the points raised by my noble friend Lady Young.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-24_para15"></a>Finally, the House will be well aware of the vote in another place, which has already been mentioned. I do not believe that noble Lords are ever indifferent to what happens in another place, although they may differ in the weight that they choose to give to that vote in arriving at their decision tonight.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-24_para16"></a>I began by making it clear that we on these Benches are not subject to any party Whip on this amendment. I said that I would attempt to be impartial in my review of the arguments. I hope that noble Lords will accept that I have made my best efforts to avoid partiality. In that spirit, when it comes to the vote, on this occasion I shall abstain.

Many of them will read what your Lordships' have said with sad incredulity. Of course, we have a free vote on this matter. It was a free vote in the House of Commons: 363 to 129. If the point is raised that Mr. Joe Ashton's amendment was lost by only 40 votes, I say, "363 to 129".
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-24_para17"></a>Further, to his great credit--because I recognise the difficulties that there may have been for him-- Mr. Hague said on earlier occasions that he supported this proposition, as did Mr. Ashdown, and as did the Prime Minister.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-24_para18"></a>I am grateful for the consideration that the noble Baroness has given me, because we have discussed these matters. I am also grateful to the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury, who was good enough to talk about these matters, and to the noble Lord, Lord Rowallan. The noble Baroness said, "This is what good people want". Does the list of good people not include the right reverend Prelate, the Bishop of Bath and Wells, who spoke so movingly? Does it not include the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, a beacon of decency in this place? Does it not include the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the Family Planning Association, the Children's Rights Development Unit, the National Association of Probation Officers, the British Association of Social Workers, the Royal College of Nursing, the National Children's Bureau, Barnardos, the NSPCC and Save the Children? Are not all those organisations, which I have taken at random from a longer list, made up of good people who care? On these occasions honourable people can honourably disagree.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-24_para19"></a>Perhaps I may say a personal word. My father was the headmaster of a church school in North Wales and a lay reader in the Church in Wales. I imagine <P>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 968</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I absorbed by osmosis the beliefs and, I daresay, the prejudices of that society and that age. But I changed my mind. I thought that I should not be ruled by past prejudice.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-24_para20"></a>There is a moral imperative to the law or it has no virtue and it has no place with us. The moral imperative is equality before the law. It is a matter of pure indifference to me--I mean that literally--whether it is equality for children of 16, for women, for a black man trying to get work, for a Jew or for a Moslem. If that moral imperative fails because the social equation which is contended for tonight does not allow for it, so that equality dies and falls away, the whole purpose and virtue of law is gone and we shall no longer be a civil society.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-24_para21"></a>We shall all reflect on what has been said with a good deal of passion and persuasive force. We shall read these debates in five years' time. I shall give a reminder of something that many of us will recognise. I started at the Bar, not before the flood, but in 1965. At that time it was a regular experience for us to see men, dragged to court for private sexual behaviour, treated with such cruelty that I can only remember it with abiding shame.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-24_para22"></a>Let us remember that not only is there a world outside but that the world changes. Try to have a discussion with an intelligent, wilful child of 16 and see whether we can prescribe for such children, and wonder whether we ought to discriminate in this way.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-24_para23"></a>This is not a flawed amendment. At the same time, we take our duty to vulnerable children seriously. Perhaps I may point out the bleak, implacable proposition. The criminal law presently gives no protection to a girl between 16 and 18 who is vulnerable; who may be preyed upon by an older man. We should not forget that. The purpose of this review--I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, who raised it--is to see whether or not we are fulfilling our obligations. I do not believe we are. There are girls in care between 16 and 18 who are subjected to heterosexual approach. There is no protection for them from the criminal law.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-25_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, I believe I am right in saying that there is protection for them from anal intercourse, otherwise known as buggery. That will be removed by this amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-25_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, if the noble Lord, Lord Elton, had caught my remark he would have heard that I said accurately that there is no protection for them from the heterosexual predator who is older. I repeat, that is a correct statement of law.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-25_para0"></a>They are in care. They are in positions where trust can be abused. They are in boarding schools. There may be social workers, doctors, policemen who prey on them. That is why we believe we must look at this question distinctly. Has society a duty to provide for the protection of the vulnerable between 16 and 18 in respect of those who are in a position of trust and possible abusive authority over them? That inquiry has nothing to do with this amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-25_para1"></a>Because we have taken our duties seriously does not mean or imply that it is a flawed amendment. The group will report by the end of the year. Of course, I cannot <P>


<a name="column_969"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 969</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>say when legislation will be introduced, but there is no reason why it should not be initiated promptly. We want to define a position of trust. We want to see which occupations should be covered. We want to see who should be protected, in what circumstance and whether the protection should be more than exists at present, which is simply disciplinary sanction or dismissal; and whether or not the criminal law should have a proper part to play in that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-25_para2"></a>What are we considering? I beg your Lordships' pardon. What should we properly be considering? It is not whether or not any of us believe that homosexual activity at 16 is something we would wish for ourselves or for people we know. It is not a question of whether we want a girl of 16 years and one day to be taken out to a nightclub by someone who is wealthy and to be seduced. The criminal law gives her no protection.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-25_para3"></a>I find it remarkable, sometimes rather dismal, that constantly put before your Lordships is the spectre of the older man seducing the boy. But no thought is given to the older man seducing the girl, who may be just as vulnerable in some circumstances. The fact is that all early sexual activity is going to be full of peril because it is adventurous; it is new; it is novel; there are no real parameters apart from parental instruction and religious advice which may or may not have an effect. So people are feeling out towards adulthood, towards changing experiences. Do we wish them to be criminal? To take the example of the noble Baroness, Lady Trumpington, do we want the two boys at a public school between the ages of 16 and 18 to be hauled off to court and imprisoned--criminalised? If yes, say "Yes". But not before you think carefully.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-25_para4"></a>I heard someone behind me say, "Yes". Try to imagine the cruel harm that would do. I have known it at first hand, as have other noble Lords here, and my noble friend Lady Mallalieu expressed the matter much more eloquently and better than I ever could.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-25_para5"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, was good enough to indicate to me, by giving me a copy of her remarks, what she intended to say. She rightly pointed to the European Commission on Human Rights. It is more likely than not, as the noble Lord, Lord Lester, pointed out, that we shall be found to be in breach in that regard. Will it not be disappointing if the massed opinion of your Lordships' House comes to a conclusion--which is possible--that your Lordships wish to act in a way that is not consistent with the principles of human rights as enunciated in the Convention?
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-25_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, "Oh" will not make the point go away. It is very recently that your Lordships adopted the principle of incorporation which, subject to protections for the media and religious organisations, received a virtually unanimous passage. So "Oh" will not make it go away. And simply lying down, keeping the eyes firmly closed and pulling the duvet over the head will not solve this problem. We <P>


<a name="column_970"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 970</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>need to protect vulnerable young children and we must be imaginatively reflective and careful about how we produce the consequence we all want.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-25_para6"></a>This has been--this has not been written down for me--a genuinely interesting debate; informed by passion and illuminative of some people's views, thoughts and passions. The one thing we cannot do by law, in this society or any other, is to produce a state of perfect innocence. It is too late now to try to legislate to say that the apple should not have gone to the Garden of Eden and that the serpent should have been stopped. What we are dealing with, I hope, is a series of compromises in this very difficult area which should be based on a conscientious approach where, I repeat, honourable people can honestly differ.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-25_para7"></a>The question is--I think that the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, identified it properly--whether it is right to discriminate in law, whatever one's private feelings may be--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-25_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Davies of Coity: </B>   My Lords, during my noble friend's response to the debate he has referred to equality under the law. He has just made reference to the question of discrimination. I recognise that we are talking about an age of consent. I wonder whether my noble friend can help me out on this question. Is it valid and justified to argue the question of equality and discrimination when we are debating a situation where one activity is considered natural and another is considered unnatural?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-25_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, it is indeed precisely the point that was made earlier. If one has a society which claims to be civil and civilised, one has to have regard--a proper regard--to the fact, and honour the fact, that other people may have different views about how they wish to live their lives. It is the mark of a decent society that the minority can be cared for--cared for properly--by the majority which may in its own view have a happier life. I do not know. But we must not be prescriptive about things beyond the decent limits.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-25_para8"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, rightly identified the question. Is it right to discriminate in law against young men aged 16 and 17 for engaging in homosexual activities and to criminalise them? Is it right to look to a conclusion, to which we shall soon be coming, that will be discriminatory and in breach of the European convention--our international treaty obligation, as the noble Lord, Lord Lester, pointed out? I cannot see that it can be right. If it cannot be right, I for one will not support it. I refuse to abstain. I shall vote against the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Young.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-25_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Young: </B>   My Lords, I should like to start by thanking all those noble Lords who have been good enough to support me this evening. If I do not say anything about all their speeches, I hope they will forgive me. But the hour is late and I do not want to speak at too great a length.
<P>


<a name="column_971"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 971</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-25_para9"></a>We have had a valuable debate, but it would have been far more valuable if it could have been at the Committee stage of the Bill when we could have had more time to go into the different questions. I think that the second quotation of the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, from the Wolfenden Report said it all. I tried to write it down but, alas, I could not get it all. However, I think the two points that stood out were that there is always an arbitrariness about ages for all kinds of things in the law; and on this. As I understood it, at the time that the Wolfenden Committee produced its report it determined that the right age was 21, the age of majority. It should now be 18, which is regarded as the age of majority. That encapsulates the argument we have had this evening.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-25_para10"></a>We had a superb moral argument from the noble Lord, Lord Jakobovits, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester. The noble Lord, Lord Jakobovits, was quite right when he said that it is a moral code that distinguishes a civilised society and that we forget that at our peril. Was it not the psalmist who said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"What is man, that thou art mindful of him?" </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-25_para11"></a>He is different from the animals; and, listening to some of these debates, I sometimes wonder whether we really recognise that point.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-25_para12"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester quite properly drew our attention to the dangers in all this of downgrading marriage, which is the normal way of living; and for those who are fortunate enough to enjoy a happy marriage, the happiest way of living. It is something that parents want for their children--to grow up, to marry happily and to have children. It is not a homosexual relationship that they wish for.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-25_para13"></a>We touched on this big issue of what the result of a vote tonight will say to the public at large. I always admire the speeches of the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, and I can see why she is such a superb barrister. But I do not believe that the idea of sending a signal is a joke. A lot of social legislation has cumulatively sent a very bad signal to society at large. What it will say if we agree that the age of consent should be lowered to 16 is the point that has been made by its supporters: that it is just as good to have a homosexual relationship as it is to have a heterosexual one and, moreover, to have one at the age of 16, and because everybody is doing it it does not matter. I do not accept any of those arguments. It is the duty of good parents to bring up their children so that they do not have fixed homosexual relationships at 16 or, indeed, fixed heterosexual relationships at that age. It is a very young age. People can grow up a great deal and have very different views in the years that follow.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-25_para14"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Annan, that I have had a lot of letters from young people supporting what I am doing. To say that all young people think that the age of consent should be lowered is simply not true. No public opinion poll has been taken on the matter, but it is simply not true. No doubt opinions among young people are divided, but I can only tell the noble Lord that I have had a lot of support from young people for what I am doing.
<P>


<a name="column_972"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 972</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-25_para15"></a>I turn to the noble Lord, Lord Williams. He quoted a great many organisations in support of the Government. I can only say to him that not one of them, with the notable exception of the BMA, has had the courtesy to send me a brief despite the fact that I have asked for one. I would have been perfectly prepared to talk to any of them about these issues. They failed to send me a brief. My time is limited and I have not had the opportunity to telephone them all. I would respect people far more if they were prepared to discuss their views openly with their opponents instead of acting in this rather underhand way.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-25_para16"></a>I also dislike very much being told that I am ruled by past prejudices. I have been called quite a lot of things over the past day. I suppose that is all part of political life. I have learnt to take it. I shall dine out on most of the stories for a good many years to come. I was slightly shocked when the noble Lord, Lord Lester, came quite close, I thought, to suggesting that we were adopting Nazi tactics. I hope that that was not his intention but if it was, I hope that he will withdraw it. We are as entitled to our point of view as anybody else.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-26_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that when the noble Baroness reads what I said she will see that it is quite clear and unambiguous. Of course I was not suggesting anything of the kind. I was dealing with the argument based on majoritarianism and pointing out the dangers of an approach, especially from a member of a persecuted minority.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-26_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Young: </B>   My Lords, I will accept the apology from the noble Lord, Lord Lester.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-26_para0"></a>I am all in favour of the working party that the noble Lord, Lord Williams and his colleagues are setting up. I believe that that is right. The fact that it is required illustrates what is wrong with the position that the House of Commons has left us with. Of course, we must help vulnerable boys and girls. I accept all the points that have been made about children at risk. Just because people are at risk now does not mean to say that we should add to their number. That does not make the position any better.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-26_para1"></a>I return to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Elton, which is really the one that I made at the start of my remarks. I stand by my statement that I believe that this is a flawed amendment. I believe that the Government have admitted that it is. Therefore, it ought to go back to the House of Commons for its further consideration.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-26_para2"></a>But this is an issue of principle. I have stood up on this issue only because I care very much for young people. I have been blessed in my life to have a happy family life--to have three daughters and five grandchildren, and to have been in the academic world where I can say that, quite literally, hundreds of young people have come through my house for one reason or another. I like and care for young people very much. Today, I feel that I would be failing in my duty if I did not say that I believe that lowering the age of consent in these circumstances without proper parliamentary scrutiny would be quite wrong--wrong constitutionally <P>

Clause 24 [Attestation of constables]:
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-27_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth </B>  moved Amendment No. 1:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 11, line 30, at end insert ("(which reproduces the form of declaration set out in Schedule 4 to the Police Act 1996).").<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-27_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving this amendment, I shall speak to Amendment No. 3.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-27_para6"></a>At Second Reading the Minister told the House that the Bill changes the declaration of office to be made by RUC constables to one broadly similar to that used in Scotland, adding that it was in line with other changes in recent years to oaths and declarations throughout England and Wales. He said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Outdated and ... complex language has been eliminated and clear, simple wording used".--[Official Report, 18/5/98; col. 1358.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-27_para7"></a>He quoted the declaration given at Schedule 2 to the Bill and said that it was clear, simple wording. The note to that schedule repeats it with the important addition that it,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"does not contain any reference to the Sovereign or any reference to Her Majesty's subjects. This formulation goes some way to meeting nationalist concerns. At the same time, the fact that it is copied from another UK jurisdiction should soften the impact for Unionists".--[Official Report, 18/5/98; col. 1362.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-27_para8"></a>I shall not rehearse at this stage the arguments advanced against the proposal nor the Minister's replies at Second Reading except to say again that Catholics <P>


<a name="column_977"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 977</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>rather than nationalists have not been deterred so far from joining the RUC by the need to swear allegiance to the Queen, who is, after all, the head of state in Northern Ireland, any more than members of the Armed Forces or of the other place. If they are fewer than we and the RUC would wish, it is because to join is to become with one's family a lifelong target of the IRA. However, I recognise that there may be much to be said for a simple clear affirmation. So, instead of using the form of oath used, it seems, in Scotland, I merely propose the use in Northern Ireland of the form of declaration used in England, and revised as recently as 1996. Policemen in Wales also use either the English version or some Welsh version which contains exactly the same commitment to our Sovereign Lady the Queen.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-27_para9"></a>The participants in the Belfast agreement acknowledged that the present wish of a majority of the people in Northern Ireland is to maintain the Union and accordingly that Northern Ireland status as part of the United Kingdom reflects and relies upon that wish. Unless the Government's chief concern is for those nationalists who do not accept the statement in Annex A to the Belfast agreement--that Northern Ireland in its entirety remains part of the United Kingdom, rather than for those both Catholics and Unionists who do--there should be no difficulty in using the form of declaration which is already acceptable in two rather than one of the other three jurisdictions in the UK. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-27_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>  My Lords, I am pleased to rise in support of the noble Baroness. Although it is wearying to have to consider two important and contentious Northern Ireland Bills on the same day, with an extremely important and even more contentious matter concerning the welfare of 16 and 17 year-olds sandwiched in between, it does at least enable us to adopt a balanced approach.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-27_para10"></a>Those of us who wish to modify--or as we would describe it "improve"--the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Bill, are constantly frustrated at being reminded that almost any change would run counter to the Good Friday agreement. No such inhibitions apply to the Police (Northern Ireland) Bill, which has nothing at all to do with the Good Friday agreement.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-27_para11"></a>The Bill which we debated earlier today is widely perceived, not only in the Province, as favouring men of violence on both sides, although loyalist terrorists enjoy little support from the unionist community at large. Most other aspects of the Good Friday agreement are perceived as favouring the republican/nationalist community in particular. Voting patterns in the referendum bear that out. Whereas 99 per cent. of the broadly nationalist community voted for the agreement, barely 50 per cent. of the broadly unionist community did so. Even that 50 per cent. was heavily influenced by a lavishly financed campaign of propaganda and spin doctoring.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-27_para12"></a>Although the violence at Drumcree cannot be excused, it can perhaps be partially explained by a growing fear that the dice are increasingly loaded against the broadly unionist culture, tradition and ethos. <P>


<a name="column_978"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 978</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>This amendment gives us the chance to redress the balance somewhat and give heart to those who support the Union, irrespective of religion. It also fulfils the requirement of "parity of esteem", which has been much talked about recently in Northern Ireland and in the Irish Republic, in that the political minority in the north--that is to say, the non-unionists--will be treated in exactly the same way as the political minority in the south--that is to say, the non-nationalists--who when they join the police in the south have to swear allegiance to the Irish Republic, whatever their innermost feelings may be.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-27_para13"></a>The revised wording meets the criticism of the noble Lord, Lord Holme of Cheltenham, that the existing 19th century loyal oath is out of date. Therefore, I hope that the Liberal Democrats will feel able to support these excellent and fair amendments.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-27_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>  My Lords, I wish to support the group of amendments, in particular Amendment No. 1 moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Park of Monmouth. In view of the established fact that the oath required of policemen in the Irish Police Force pledges loyalty to the state and to the government, which is rather unusual and might not have been accepted in total by many members of, for example, the Metropolitan Police during the previous parliament, it is odd that a change which was designed to give confidence to terrorists--who, incidentally, murdered around 300 RUC men--departs from the much proclaimed desire for uniformity within what is referred to usually in the Good Friday agreement as "the island of Ireland".
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-27_para14"></a>No doubt the Irish Government played their part in removing yet another manifestation of Britishness which, after all--and we have to face this fact--is the main objective of the Good Friday agreement. It is said that members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary have no particular view one way or the other, so the question then arises: what need is there for the declaration, not the oath, which terminates with the words,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I will faithfully discharge the duties of the office of constable"? </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-27_para15"></a>Why would a young recruit for the RUC apply for an application form, fill in the form, collect references, undergo a series of medical examinations, complete the various other forms and attend at least several interviews, if he did not intend to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"discharge the duties of the office of constable"? </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-27_para16"></a>Would it not be fair to assume that, having gone through all that difficulty and having undertaken all those onerous duties, he had every intention of discharging the duties of a constable?
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-27_para17"></a>Are such words not implicit at, for example, the conclusion of a Sainsbury's interview panel? Would it not be assumed that such an applicant for a post in a Sainsbury's store would discharge his duties at the checkout point in the supermarket as an unspoken understanding that he would want to retain his job, which surely would be his main consideration? So, if necessary, he could cheerfully repeat that phrase as regards discharging his duties as a Sainsbury's employee. With that rather cynical comment, I wonder <P>


<a name="column_979"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 979</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>whether it is too late to suggest the deletion of Schedule 2 on the grounds that it is completely unnecessary, irrelevant and inapplicable.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-27_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>  My Lords, I was interested in the proposal put forward by my noble friend Lady Park of Monmouth in Amendments Nos. 1 and 3; namely, to replace the present proposed Northern Ireland declaration in the Bill with the present English declaration. However, I have ventured to put forward an alternative which appears on the Marshalled List as Amendment No. 4. I have attempted to use up-to-date language as we were urged to do by the Minister, though I hesitate to suggest that it is a modernisation. I am beginning to think of that as a derogatory term rather than anything else, as it is used so frequently these days to describe all kinds of things.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-27_para18"></a>My alternative draft seems to me to have several advantages. In the first place, it contains a reference to "Her Majesty the Queen" because she is the constitutional head of state and because, in this United Kingdom, the Crown is above party, above government, above opposition and above every other division in our society; indeed, it is the focus of loyalty for all. However, at the same time, I recognise that some citizens of Northern Ireland hope for a change in the status of the Province so that it can become part of the Republic at some stage. Of course, that is an entirely legitimate hope for people to cherish.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-27_para19"></a>The Belfast agreement and the Bill, which is now before another place, make provision for this to occur if the majority in the future should wish for such a change. That is why my draft amendment refers to the,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Queen and her legal successors". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-27_para20"></a>I have not put forward the phrase which is used, for example, in your Lordships' House--indeed, as we have heard this afternoon when we had more Introductions--namely:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Her heirs and successors according to law", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-27_para21"></a>Instead, my amendment refers to "her legal successors". Of course, I hope that her legal successors in Northern Ireland will in due course be her heirs. But it may be that her legal successors become--under the legislation being considered--the Republic of Ireland.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-27_para22"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux, indicated, the Garda are much more answerable to Ministers than we in the United Kingdom think desirable for impartiality. There is a big difference as regards philosophies relating to how to control the police. But be that as it may, the phrase "her legal successors" seems to me to cover the different eventualities and therefore to take out of the declaration, as modified, the idea that it is a totally unionist affair.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-27_para23"></a>The other, perhaps novel, word in my draft is "impartiality". I think that every new constable should have the necessity for impartiality impressed on him on his first day in the force. The RUC is exceptionally impartial in the way it has carried out its duties over many years. I worked closely with it when I was a Minister responsible for security in Northern Ireland and therefore I know that is the case. However, that is obvious to anyone. The most recent example of that has <P>


<a name="column_980"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 980</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>been Drumcree, where the RUC upheld the law and the decisions which had to be taken. But that is only the most recent example. Over a longer timescale one can consider the successes it has had in bringing to justice loyalist terrorists. It has achieved greater success in that regard than in bringing republican terrorists to justice. I think therefore that the RUC is extremely impartial, but I also think it is no bad thing that a constable should affirm that impartiality on starting his career. The RUC is an extremely effective and staunch force. We should take every opportunity to pay tribute to it. I pay it that tribute.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-27_para24"></a>As regards duties, I have slightly adapted the words of Clause 18. It seems to me that a draft along the lines I have suggested might serve the Minister's purpose of using up-to-date words, and at the same time fulfil the other purposes which other noble Lords have suggested in the course of our earlier debates and this evening.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-27_time2"></A><H5>10 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-27_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Fitt: </B>  My Lords, on this Third Reading it may be appropriate to look back at the events of the past few weeks and to consider the activities of the RUC. These amendments may appear technical but noble Lords should give their opinions of the RUC.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-27_para25"></a>For many years in Northern Ireland the RUC has been a bone of contention between nationalists and unionists. I speak as one with a nationalist background. There have been occasions in the past when the RUC has appeared to carry out the instructions of a unionist Minister of Home Affairs. Whether that was the case is open to argument. I lived in Northern Ireland for many years and fought many elections in which the RUC was asked to carry out the edict of a unionist Minister of Home Affairs. In so doing it engendered the hostility of the nationalist community.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-27_para26"></a>On the question of the oath, I do not think that many members of the RUC--over many years I have known many of them personally--will lose any sleep about swearing an oath of loyalty to the Queen or to the sovereign. For many years the unionist government in Northern Ireland deliberately inserted the oath of loyalty to the Queen. I remember, as a member of the Belfast Corporation many years ago, that before anyone obtained a job as a dustbin man in the city of Belfast he had to sign an attestation that he swore loyalty to the Queen. To obtain many other menial jobs an oath of fidelity to the Queen had to be sworn. It was not because the authorities wanted a person's fidelity to the Queen; it was meant to prevent people of a nationalist background applying or being given a job, because many refused to sign an oath of loyalty in order to get such jobs. That went right through the Civil Service in Northern Ireland and the police.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-27_para27"></a>We have heard a great deal today in relation to the sentences Bill about the new agreement. The Good Friday agreement, as it is called, was essentially an agreement between nationalist Northern Ireland and unionist Northern Ireland. Had it not been for the agreement between the majority nationalist party-- the SDLP--Sinn Fein and the majority unionist party, there would not have been any agreement.
<P>


<a name="column_981"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 981</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-27_para28"></a>I had some difficulty in restraining my remarks in relation to the sentences Bill. The Secretary of State has been handed a very hot potato in relation to Guardsmen Fisher and Wright. The decision that she will have to take will be purely political. Nationalist Ireland, from every Catholic viewpoint and perspective, from leaders in the Irish Times, from the Catholic Church and the SDLP to Sinn Fein all believe that Guardsmen Fisher and Wright were guilty. This is a balancing act. If the Secretary of State decides, on a response from the Queen, that the guardsmen should be released, it will infuriate one community. If she does not release them, it will infuriate the other. Again, the question of the oath comes into that balancing act.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-27_para29"></a>Is it necessary for the oath to be taken by members of the RUC? I honestly do not believe that it is. For many years, but recently in the public mind in relation to Drumcree, the RUC has proven beyond all possible doubt that it is acting in the interests of all the people of Northern Ireland. No longer can members of the nationalist community condemn the RUC as a sectarian force. No longer can members of they say that it is acting in a biased way against the minority nationalist community. The RUC will have to overcome some hurdles, perhaps in days, perhaps in weeks, in order again to assure the people of Northern Ireland that it is the impartial force that I know it to be.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-27_para30"></a>I have in front of me an extract from yesterday's edition of the Irish Times reporting a statement by the RUC that this year there were 122 paramilitary shootings in Northern Ireland, both by those in the loyalist community and the IRA. Anyone who has any contact with Northern Ireland knows that those alleged punishment shootings have led to deaths. They have been carried out by loyalist paramilitaries and the IRA. Not only have those organisations been welcomed into the Assembly. Some have won seats. On the New Lodge Road the other day, a young man named Kearney was cruelly and brutally murdered by the IRA. Under the terms of the agreement those who support such terrible atrocities should not be given ready access to the newly established Assembly.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-27_para31"></a>I understand that on Monday evening in the House of Commons the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland said that she will have to find out for certain who was responsible for carrying out that dreadful murder. I understand that from the New Lodge Road, North Queen Street area where the murder took place, the police who were on the spot saw the life blood drain from that young man. They are in no doubt that the murder was carried out by the IRA. They will give their report to the Chief Constable. The Chief Constable will consider what his experts saw on the New Lodge Road that night. He will then tell the Secretary of State that he is in no doubt that it was the activities of the IRA.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-27_para32"></a>What then will the Secretary of State do? Will she accept the word of the Chief Constable with all the evidence that he has at his disposal and take steps to prevent members who represent the IRA from taking their full place in the Assembly? Or will she try to rejig the whole situation? From her point of view, she does <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>not want anyone to be thrown out of the Assembly. She wants to keep the Assembly on an even keel and in that we may have the beginnings of conflict.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-27_para33"></a>I sincerely hope that we do not face that conflict. I believe that the RUC, as has been proven conclusively over these past weeks, is acting in the interests of everyone in Northern Ireland. It should have the full and absolute support of every Government Minister in Northern Ireland. That is why I say that it is not necessary to have the RUC swear an oath of allegiance to the Queen. That would give those who are opposed to the RUC a reason for objecting to it and saying that it should not give an oath of loyalty outside of Northern Ireland.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-27_para34"></a>The only oath that may be necessary is for RUC men to swear their allegiance, if that is necessary, to the people of the state of Northern Ireland. That should be sufficient. It would take away another stick which could be used by the opponents of the RUC to try to depict its members as being openly sectarian. I do not believe that the RUC is sectarian. I believe that its activities over these past weeks prove that conclusively. I do not want to hear ever again any criticism from the nationalist community that the RUC is a bipartisan force.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-28_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>  My Lords, I agree with my noble friend Lord Fitt in what he said in relation to the RUC; about its bravery over many years and the way in which in recent weeks it has demonstrated its even-handedness and impartiality. It has done so in difficult circumstances when its members have been shot at, threatened with blast bombs and generally been abused by one group of people. It demonstrated its wish and willingness to apply the law in an even-handed manner. The way it has behaved is to its credit.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-28_para0"></a>As noble Lords will be aware, this Bill seeks to bring the declaration of office made by RUC constables to a form broadly similar to that used to affirm constables in office in Scotland. The effect of the amendment in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Park, would be to replace that wording with the English version. The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Cope, would introduce a hybrid version, an expanded, extended Scottish version or a somewhat modernised English one. I think that is a fair way of describing it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-28_para1"></a>However, the Government's position has been carefully considered and is firmly based on four key points. First, the change spells out, simply and clearly, that a person taking up the office of constable will faithfully discharge its duties. Simplicity and clarity in such a context are important. Secondly, the wording follows that in use in Scotland, as has been mentioned. The Scots wording has been used from time immemorial. Scotland is part of the United Kingdom, with cultural features shared with Northern Ireland but not with England or Wales.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-28_para2"></a>Thirdly, the Policy Authority for Northern Ireland, the body charged with representing the views of the community there on policing, itself recommended, after long and detailed consultation, debate and consideration, a move to the Scots formulation.
<P>


<a name="column_983"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 983</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-28_para3"></a>Fourthly, this change is in line with recent changes to other declarations across the criminal justice system in England and Wales, as well as in Northern Ireland--for example, to the juror's declaration and to the QC's declaration. Perhaps I may give an example. The oath (or affirmation/declaration) taken by jurors has been changed to read:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I swear by Almighty God that I will faithfully try the defendant and give a true verdict according to evidence." </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-28_para4"></a>The previous version included a reference to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"our Sovereign Lady the Queen". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-28_para5"></a>It seems to me that this is a sensible change that introduces an element of clarity to something that was complicated and perhaps old-fashioned.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-28_para6"></a>As noble Lords may also be aware, the Belfast agreement, accepted by the majority of Northern Ireland political parties and subsequently endorsed by the people, introduces the idea of a pledge of office for Assembly members. Again, the pledge is written in simple but none the less effective terms. It requires Assembly members to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"discharge in good faith all the duties of the office", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-28_para7"></a>and, among other things, promotes the idea of service to the community.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-28_para8"></a>To move at this time, and at this stage in the life of the Bill, against the arguments of clarity and simplicity, against the Police Authority's carefully considered and expressed view, and against the trend of changes to declarations elsewhere in the criminal justice system, would, I suggest, be bordering on the perverse.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-28_para9"></a>I have listened to the views of those noble Lords who say we are removing the reference to "Her Majesty" as part of a drive to remove the unionists' British heritage. I do not believe that that is the case. It would be nonsensical to believe that changing the wording of a declaration used in Northern Ireland to one used in Scotland attacks a "British" heritage. It would be naive to believe that dropping a few references to our Sovereign would buy out deeply held political beliefs in the nationalist community.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-28_para10"></a>The Government believe that the new form of declaration represents a sensible change and remains the most appropriate form of wording presented to date for Northern Ireland's circumstances at this time and for the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-28_para11"></a>Perhaps I may briefly touch on some of the points that were made in the short debate. The noble Baroness, Lady Park, referred to the oath in England and Wales and suggested that it had been revisited in the Police Act 1996. That was not the case. The Police Act 1996 was merely a consolidation Act and could not have been used to change the oath. The noble Baroness will appreciate that point. It is not true to say that the oath was revisited in 1996 so far as England and Wales is concerned. That may be a technical point, but I make it for the record.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-28_para12"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux, asked a question by analogy with a Sainsbury employee. Constables are not employees and the Sainsbury example is not, therefore, a correct comparison. A constable must make a declaration before he can hold the office of constable. <P>


<a name="column_984"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 984</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>This concept is of ancient origin and applies throughout the UK. All constables have to be attested; they would not be constables if they were not. That is the difference. That is why we have the form of wording that we are now suggesting.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-28_time0"></A><H5>10.15 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-28_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>  I am grateful to the noble Lord, but I come back to the necessity for what I call the Sainsbury arrangement. The constable would have had to sign his application form, which would surely commit him, at the end of the process of appointment, interviews, and so forth, coming back to the only meaningful phrase in the declaration--not the oath--to discharge the duties satisfactorily. That is the same as the Sainsbury employee would do. It is implicit, once he signs his application form, has the interview and complies with all the other regulations, that he is prepared to discharge honourably whatever duties may be required of him.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-28_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>  My Lords, I am not sure I quite followed all the intricacies of the noble Lord's argument. A constable must make a declaration because that has to go with the office of constable. It is different from being the employee of another organisation, where it does not have that relative importance. The declaration is taken at the end of training and it shows that the recruit has taken on the office of constable and assumed the statutory responsibilities attached to that office. That goes quite a long way towards meeting the noble Lord's point.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-28_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>  Yes, it is broadly unnecessary; that is right.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-28_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>  My Lords, I did not say that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-28_para13"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Cope, suggested including the concept of impartiality in the oath. There is a difficulty with that. Impartiality is an important concept but it may not be appropriate in the declaration. Constables have to use an element of discretion. If one puts the word "impartiality" into the oath one might have the unintended effect of overriding the constable's declaration. Perhaps I may give an example of that. We would not wish a constable to deal with an elderly person who might have been inadvertently shoplifting in the same way as we would wish him to deal with a professional shoplifter. So we have to give the constable an element of discretion which, to a limited extent, might be seen to be overriding the concept of impartiality if that were put into the oath.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-28_para14"></a>I think that we are moving in a sensible direction. As we approach the next millennium it is our wish to underpin the aim of the police service in Northern Ireland with a straightforward declaration in keeping with those in the rest of the criminal justice system and appropriate for Northern Ireland circumstances. That is what Schedule 2 to the Bill seeks to do. Accordingly, I invite the House to reject the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-28_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>  My Lords, I thank noble Lords who have supported me in this amendment. <P>


<a name="column_985"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 985</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I defer to the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, in his great knowledge of the situation in Northern Ireland. I very much respect him. But I really do believe that many in the RUC, like the majority, Catholic and Protestant, who want to stay in the UK, do attach importance to belonging and to having a unifying symbol. They have joined a service. When you join a service, you normally expect to have a central point to which to look. I accept that, maybe one day, the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Northern Ireland government may prove to be that unifying factor. But I believe that it does need to exist.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-28_para15"></a>However, in the light of the Minister's usual careful and courteous reply, I realise that I have failed to persuade him. I urge the Government at least to consider leaving the decision on the question of the form of the affirmation to the Patten Commission. Incidentally, there will be no reason why it should not be taken in Irish. The form of the oath means quite as much to the RUC as it does to any putative nationalist recruit; and indeed far more. I urge that the matter might be reconsidered by the Patten Commission in the whole context of the needs of a most admirable force which deserves the very best. We are all agreed on that. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-28_para16"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-28_para17"></a>Clause 75 [Commencement]:
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-28_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley </B>  moved Amendment No. 2:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 39, line 21, at end insert ("but there shall not be appointed under this section, except as necessary to bring Part VII into operation, any day less than six months after the publication by Her Majesty's Government of the report of the Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland, appointed under the agreement set out in Command Paper 3883.").<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-28_para18"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment attempts to postpone the coming into operation of most of the Bill--not the part dealing with the ombudsman but the rest of the Bill--until after the Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland--the Patten Commission--has had the opportunity to report and its report has been considered. When the Bill started its course through Parliament, the situation was different. That was before the agreement was reached and before the decision had been taken to set up the Patten Commission, let alone before it had actually been put in place, as it now has been.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-28_para19"></a>It seems to me that some aspects of the Bill should not be pursued at this stage until the Patten Commission has had an opportunity to report and suggest what it believes should be the way forward. When the responsibilities of an organisation like the RUC and bodies such as the Police Authority and others are reorganised, the cost is enormous both in time and money. It is a great distraction to all concerned when there is great organisational upheaval.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-28_para20"></a>In the case of the RUC that is at a time when it has to continue to deal with all kinds of incredibly difficult situations such as we have seen recently, as well as dealing with the most vicious terrorists. Much as we would like to hope that those will be modified as time goes on, as the agreement and the Assembly begin to do their work, there will be a considerable amount of terrorism, violence and difficulty for the RUC to deal <P>


<a name="column_986"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 986</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with for quite a long time. Some terrorists have not accepted the agreement and will continue to pursue violence for political reasons. In addition, the rackets continue, which also involve violence.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-28_para21"></a>When the RUC has such a difficult and vital job to do it is unwise to subject it to long periods of continuous reorganisation and change. It can be damaging to morale. Without necessarily urging every detail of this particular amendment on the Government, I suggest that when considering which parts of the Bill should be brought into effect and at which stage, Ministers think carefully about the effect on the work of the Patten Commission because it is very important for the future acceptability and work of the RUC that the commission is able to give the matter proper consideration and to make recommendations which can then be considered and put into effect. But those recommendations may well mean further upheaval.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-28_para22"></a>First of all, the Patten Commission will have to undertake its considerations during one period of upheaval, and that may be followed fairly quickly by more upheaval following the recommendations of the commission. That is why in putting this Bill into effect the Government should think carefully about its various sections and the timing. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo980722/text/80722-29.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-29_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>  My Lords, in Committee some of us expressed unease over the possibility that, as the noble Lord, Lord Cope, has said, we might have to return to the proposals in this Bill after the Patten Commission reports in perhaps a year's time. That remains a valid consideration. It would make good sense to avoid something like a repeal of this Bill, or large portions of it, after Patten reports.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-29_para0"></a>It may be that the commission's work can be accelerated so that the report may be completed and published in perhaps six months rather than the 12 months originally envisaged. It will have been accelerated in its work because of recent events. It has to be recognised, if not officially admitted, that the appointment of the commission was a gesture to those who demanded confidence-building measures or sending signals--which I suppose is the Northern Ireland equivalent of "Cool Britannia"--to various terrorist groupings to keep them on board the circus.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-29_para1"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Fitt, raised the question of what is likely to happen to the known IRA gang which murdered a Catholic republican, a former neighbour of his, in north Belfast. Perhaps I may venture to inform the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, that the procedure is not quite what he envisaged. The chief constable will receive all the forensic and evidential reports and he will make a judgment. He will report that judgment to the Secretary of State and probably--although one cannot forejudge--as the noble Lord envisaged, it will be found to be the work of the IRA. That has broadly been admitted by those in the know on the republican side.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-29_para2"></a>Having reported, the chief constable's job is finished, but the Secretary of State does not then direct the offending organisation--in this case, the IRA--to move out of the Assembly. She invites the Assembly, by cross-community consent, to assent to the expulsion of <P>


<a name="column_987"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 987</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the offending organisation. It would be well nigh impossible to get the required cross-community consent within the membership of the Assembly. Therefore, I am afraid that the provision is almost null and void. I would not like the noble Lord to be too encouraged by the possibility of any of that happening.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-29_para3"></a>I am sufficiently cynical to believe that the premature publication of probable scales of salary and allowances for some Assembly members worked wonders in terms of confidence-building even before the referendum--and certainly in advance of the Assembly elections!
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-29_para4"></a>More seriously, a second reason for the establishment of the Patten commission was the clamour for a wide assortment of local or community police services, as opposed to the one monolithic structure that we have at the moment. The law and order crisis of the past few weeks demonstrates the wisdom of the retention of a unified structure for Northern Ireland, all over the Province.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-29_para5"></a>It is widely recognised that the Army and my old regiment, the Royal Air Force Regiment, provided the Royal Ulster Constabulary with indispensable back-up. All those elements, through close co-operation, upheld the civil power in Northern Ireland in a way which the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, and I might not have envisaged being so successful even three or four years ago. That could not have been achieved had the General Officer Commanding had to consult and relate to a multitude of what one might call a "do-it-yourself" grouping of community police services. A complete breakdown was avoided by reason of the chief constable and the GOC, their respective staffs and their men on the ground participating in a command structure for which there will be a continuing requirement in view of the regrettable resurgence of terrorism in the past 10 days or so by groups mistakenly referred to in the news industry as "dissident groups", but which are really terrorist subcontractors, supplying the muscle which has been so rewarding in wringing concessions from successive governments.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-29_para6"></a>Finally, I hope that the Secretary of State and the Minister will quietly whisper to Mr. Patten that events have dramatically altered his job specification and the terms of reference of his commission. It might also be prudent to consider whether control of intelligence-gathering in Northern Ireland should be restored to the chief constable. In Great Britain, with its multiplicity of constabularies, it may be that the role of MI5 may be successful and may still be required, but that would not be of advantage except where we have a single, compact police force working with the Army in support of the civil power.

<A NAME="80722-29_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Fitt: </B>  My Lords, I feel compelled to support many of the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux. That may seem strange, given our respective political backgrounds. The noble Lord referred to some rumours which have abounded in Northern Ireland recently, that we are to have what is called community policing. Those rumours have circulated, particularly from the nationalist areas, and <P>


<a name="column_988"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1998 : Column 988</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>particularly from West Belfast and, on some occasions, from Derry. The rumours are that some released terrorists who have given up terrorism may now want to take part in the legitimate policing of their own areas. All I can say to my noble friend is that, if the activities the other day on the New Lodge Road and the knee-cappings and brutal beatings that have taken place over the past few years are an indication of the way that these people would carry out community policing, it leaves all of us in a state of great despair.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-29_para7"></a>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-29_para8"></a>
My noble friend may not have all the answers because these matters will be referred to the Patten Commission, but recently organisations representing the police force had a meeting with the Prime Minister at Downing Street. What he said indicated that he had full confidence in the RUC as at present constituted. I take succour from what he said at the conclusion of that meeting.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-29_para9"></a>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-29_para10"></a>
What my noble friend can say this afternoon is that there is absolutely no validity in the rumours abounding in Northern Ireland of any attempt to set up community policing, because if it is done in West Belfast it will be done in East Belfast and Portadown. If one imagines what community policemen with paramilitary records would have done at Drumcree only last week given their activities in the past, that would rule out any chance of such people having any part to play in the legitimate police service in Northern Ireland.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-29_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>  My Lords, the effect of this amendment would be to delay, with the exception of the provisions of Part VII, the commencement of this Bill. That is clearly the noble Lord's intention. While I accept that many of the key features of this Bill are identified in the principles set out in the Belfast agreement and in the terms of reference for the independent commission, I do not agree that it is either prudent or necessary to delay commencement pending the outcome of Patten. The commission will be considering the essential ingredients of sound, effective and widely supported policing arrangements for Northern Ireland. I believe that this Bill will be a cornerstone of those considerations.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-29_para11"></a>
As I have said many times before, this Bill is a building block on which other improvements to policing can be made. Noble Lords will be aware that this Bill contains key reforms on police structures. It clarifies the roles and responsibilities of the Secretary of State, the Chief Constable and the Police Authority. It introduces significant planning and objective-setting mechanisms, and it introduces reforms on police ethos which are evolutionary rather than revolutionary. In essence it puts into statute structural changes upon which, should it consider further change necessary, the commission can build.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-29_para12"></a>
This Bill also introduces important financial reforms. The Chief Constable is to be given day-to-day control of finance so that he can manage his resources and devolve responsibility to local commanders. This is the current practice in Great Britain. It will allow for better local services while at the same time introducing proper managerial and financial accountability. These provisions were arrived at after extensive consultation and there is widespread support for many of them.

I am sure that when the commission considers these reforms it will take account of the debates that we have had in this House and those that have taken place in another place.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-29_para14"></a>
In reply to a comment by the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux, I shall ensure that Mr. Patten's attention is drawn to the deliberations of this House so that he understands the concerns that have been expressed today and on previous occasions when the Bill has been before noble Lords. I am confident that the commission will take account of the positive comments made on the Bill on Third Reading and at Report stage in another place.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-29_para15"></a>
The people of Northern Ireland deserve the best possible policing services. I am confident that the Bill will improve efficiency, effectiveness and accountability and as a result increase confidence across the whole community.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-29_para16"></a>
I should like to deal briefly with some of the specific questions that have been asked. I believe that the implication of my noble friend's remarks was that paramilitaries might serve with the RUC. As the Prime Minister said in an article for the Newsletter on 18th April,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There is no question of ending up with a police force that is at a local level run by ad hoc bodies of terrorists of paramilitaries". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-29_para17"></a>The Government have said that they will not ignore the basic standards and principles of policing to which they as a government are committed. Those convicted of serious offences (whether scheduled or otherwise) are not to fit to be in the police. This is foreign to our thinking. I hope that the noble Lord will accept that as an emphatic reassurance.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-29_para18"></a>
The noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux of Killead, asked about intelligence gathering. It is my understanding that intelligence gathering is under the control of the RUC and that there is no intention to change that. Of course, the Patten Commission may have other views, but that is the position at the moment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-29_para19"></a>
There are important reforms in this Bill that Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary has endorsed. It would be a retrograde step to put all the reforms on ice and say "Let us wait for Patten." These are important changes which perhaps seem overdue. They will increase the efficiency of the police in Northern Ireland and, as such, are to be welcomed. Delay on the basis proposed is unnecessary and I invite the House to reject this amendment.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722-30_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>  My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 15. I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 15, 16, 18, 22, 24, 25, 26, 28 and 29. The Government wish to ensure that the duties contained in Clauses 35 to 37 for providing youth justice services and youth offending teams and the formulation of an annual youth justice plan secure the input of both police authorities and chief officers of police.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-30_para4"></a>
Amendments Nos. 15, 16, 25 and 26 therefore provide that, alongside police authorities, probation committees and health authorities, chief officers of police are placed under a duty under Clause 35(2) to co-operate with local authorities in securing the availability of the youth justice services set out in Clause 35(3), and are entitled under Clause 37(2) to be consulted by local authorities on youth justice plans.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-30_para5"></a>
Amendments Nos. 18, 22 and 24 provide that the duty under Clause 36(3) to co-operate with local authorities in establishing youth offending teams should be put on chief officers of police rather than police authorities. This recognises the operational nature of decisions about the deployment of police officers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-30_para6"></a>
Taking into account those changes, Amendment No. 28 includes chief officers of police, together with local authorities, police authorities, probation committees and health authorities within the relevant authorities from which the YJB will be able to obtain information for the purposes of monitoring and advisory functions under Clause 38(5) and, if necessary, a report on the discharge of the new duties under Clause 38(8). Amendment No. 29 defines chief officer of police. These amendments underline the role which both police authorities and chief officers of police will need to play if the new structure is to be delivered.

<P>

<A NAME = "80722-30_para7"></a>
I turn to Amendments Nos. 17, 19, 20, 21 and 23. Clause 37 requires local authorities to draw up an annual youth justice plan setting out how youth justice services and youth offending teams are to be provided and funded. Under the Bill as currently drafted, each agency will pay directly for its own staff seconded to the youth offending teams and for the services and other resources it makes available. The youth justice plan will therefore amount to a combined inter-agency budget.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-30_para8"></a>
The Government believe that there is value in allowing local authorities and the other agencies greater flexibility in the way in which youth offending teams and youth justice services can be funded. This means enabling the local agencies to contribute to a pooled budget or common fund. This will assist effective inter-agency working and help strengthen the joint ownership of the youth offending team arrangements, which will be important to their successful operation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-30_para9"></a>
Amendments Nos. 17 and 23 to Clauses 35 and 36 will therefore allow local authorities with social services and education responsibilities--together with the police, probation committees and health authorities--to make payments towards expenditure incurred in the provision of youth justice services and by, or for the purposes connected with, youth offending teams, by contributing to a fund, established and maintained by the local authority, out of which the payments may be made.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-30_para10"></a>
Amendments Nos. 19, 20 and 21 to Clause 36 will allow scope for the fund to be held by one or more local authorities. There will not be a requirement that a common fund is established or that, where one is, apart from the local authority, all the relevant local agencies must participate. That will be a matter for them to determine.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-30_para11"></a>
Amendments Nos. 27, 30 and 116 are technical. Amendment No. 27 amends subsection (6)(a) of Clause 38 to make clear that an order under that subsection amending the functions of the youth justice board may add a new function or remove an existing one, as well as altering an existing function of the board. By virtue of subsection (3) of Clause 101, such an order will be subject to affirmative resolution. Amendment No. 30 amends subsection (2) of Clause 42.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-30_para12"></a>
Amendment No. 116 amends paragraph 11 of Schedule 2 to clarify the authority of the Secretary of State to fund the YJB. Amendment No. 148 amends the Superannuation Act 1972. It is consequential.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-30_para13"></a>
Amendments Nos. 149, 150 to 154, 176 and 177 are consequential changes to existing legislation.

I speak also to Amendments Nos. 41, 42, 87, 171, 172, 173 and 229. Amendment No. 40 is consequential on the new clause introduced by Amendment No. 85 which sets out the calculation process for two or more sentences. Part of it relates to extended sentences and it is therefore necessary to refer to that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-31_para10"></a>
Amendments Nos. 41, 42, 173 and 229 reflect the need to ensure that all offenders given extended sentences who are recalled to a prison supervision period are treated fairly and equitably.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-31_para11"></a>
These amendments introduce a new Section 44A in the Criminal Justice Act 1991 and make necessary consequential amendments to the relevant provisions which will provide specifically for the re-release of offenders who are recalled during an extended sentence. It will ensure that all such offenders will be eligible for the same consideration for re-release on licence regardless of the length of their sentence.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-31_para12"></a>
Amendments Nos. 87, 171 and 172 ensure consistency by providing that those on extended sentences who are not re-released until the end of their extension period are subject to a period of supervision until the end of their sentence in the same way as any other offender released following recall. Nothing makes any fundamental change. They simply ensure that there is no inconsistency in the way that extended sentence prisoners are treated.

<P>

<A NAME = "80722-31_para17"></a>
On Amendment No. 43, in some cases the treatment requirement of a drug treatment and testing order may be for a period in a residential rehabilitation unit to be followed, say, by attendance at a non-residential day programme. Amendment No. 43 therefore clarifies the court's powers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-31_para18"></a>
On Amendments Nos. 44 to 46, 49, and 118 to 123, as the Bill stands such an order may be made and administered only by the court which convicted the offender. There have been discussions with Association of Chief Officers of Probation (ACOP), which is a strong supporter of the order, on what will happen if an offender lives so far from the convicting court that review is unlikely to be practical. For instance, if a person in London is convicted and given an order in Leeds the treatment arrangements must be available in London but the review hearing is before Leeds. That is an absurd waste of expenditure and therefore these amendments are to correct those possible anomalies. It means that a court acting for the area in which the offender resides may be made responsible for administering the order if the court making the order thinks fit and does not itself act for that area.

<A NAME="80722-32_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>  My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 50. This group contains Amendments Nos. 50 to 53, 124 to 126, 144, 147 and 231. They are technical amendments to clarify provisions relating to reparation orders, action plan orders and a supervision orders. Amendments Nos. 50 and 52 adjust the clauses concerning reparation and action plan orders so that the two provisions properly refer to custodial sentences by including specific mention of Section 53(1) of the 1933 Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-32_para2"></a>
This means that a reparation or action plan order cannot be made when the court imposes a sentence under that subsection; namely, detention under Her Majesty's pleasure. Amendment No. 51 follows up a question during the Commons Committee stage about whether a compensation order should be available in conjunction with a reparation order. That was a well made argument and we decided to give it effect. That is what the amendment does.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-32_para3"></a>
Amendments Nos. 53, 126 and 147 clarify the position regarding a curfew order under Section 12 of the 1991 Act as a possible action for dealing with a breach of a supervision order, an action plan order or a reparation order. This ensures that proper arrangements are in place should an offender fail to comply with a curfew order which has been given because of a breach of one of the three orders which I mentioned.

This group of amendments deals with the following circumstances. Amendments Nos. 85 and 86 provide greater clarity over how multiple sentences imposed on a prisoner relate one to another. The courts indicated that they wanted a clear statutory framework. Therefore, these amendments provide that a sentence imposed by a court after a prisoner has been released, but while he is still within the overall term of the original sentence, should not be aggregated with the original sentence or ordered to run consecutively. The new sentence will, however, be aggregated with, and may run consecutively to, any order returned under Section 40.

This group includes Amendments Nos. 58, 94, 114, 191 to 195, 209 and 210. This group deals with detention and training orders and makes a number of adjustments. Amendment No. 58 makes further provisions for the new detention and training order and how it will interact with other custodial sentences, which might be given at a different time. It sets out the arrangements which the courts will have to follow when sentencing someone already under a custodial sentence to a further period of custody.

The new custodial provisions which will be introduced will be available in the first instance only for 12 to 17 year-olds. Clause 69(2)(b)(ii) is a discretionary power which allows the <P>

As the Bill is currently drafted, that provision can be exercised simply by a commencement order.

Amendment No. 225 has been grouped with the above amendment. They are technical amendments which are designed to deal with an unintended effect of Section 49 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 on the courts' powers to confiscate the proceeds of crime. Under the 1988 Act, the magistrates' court, except for a very limited range of offences, has no power to make confiscation orders. The Crown Court has extensive powers to order confiscation when it convicts a defendant, but its powers of confiscation are not presently available where an offender is committed for sentence, which happens quite often. Amendment No. 61, with its brother, is designed to deal with that anomaly.

I wish to speak also to Amendment No. 226, with which this amendment is grouped. As will be well known to your Lordships' House, there are creatures in the world sometimes related to notorious football clubs in the Liverpool area who are football hooligans. These amendments give the police a power of arrest to deal with convicted football hooligans who breach, or try to breach, restriction orders under the Football Spectators Act 1989 designed to prevent them going to matches overseas. The amendments increase the maximum penalty for breaching the order.

Despite the small number of noble Lords present tonight, I am sure they will all have been dismayed at the appalling behaviour of just a few people among the thousands who attended the World Cup. I hear "noises off" from noble friends who say those people are not Scottish supporters. I must admit I did not carry out any kind of survey of nationality of those people but, as ever, I trust to my noble friends' judgment on that matter. I certainly think the behaviour on that occasion was a far cry from my own experience when my aunt took me to see Arsenal play when I was in my early teens.

The behaviour I have mentioned is also a far cry from the behaviour of the vast majority of supporters who watch matches. I am sure noble Lords will join me in congratulating the many football clubs which have done so much to make football a safe, family, spectator sport. I welcome the fact that the Government have accepted that there should be a stronger penalty for those who breach restriction orders; one month has proved not to be enough, six months is a more appropriate maximum period. I support the amendment.

<A NAME="80722-34_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>  My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 78.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-34_para5"></a>
I wish to speak also to Amendments Nos. 79 to 81 inclusive. Amendment No. 78 is a technical amendment which clarifies that, when a court makes a drug treatment and testing order, the treatment requirement may be for residential or non-residential treatment, or a combination of both.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-34_para6"></a>
Amendment No. 79 allows a court to cite an offender to appear before it when it hears an application by the supervising officer for amendment of a drug treatment and testing order. This means the court will be able to dispose of the application directly without the need for a further sitting. Before amending or revoking a treatment and testing order, a court must first hear the offender and supervising officer.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722-34_para7"></a>
As presently drafted, the Bill would only allow the court to cite an offender once a decision had been taken to revoke the order. This would in practice mean the court having to sit twice, first to hear the application, then to hear the offender. This would be a waste of time for the court. We wish courts to be able to dispose of applications without the need for further sittings. The proposed amendment facilitates this. The two remaining amendments are consequential on Amendment No. 79.

In this group are Amendments Nos. 96 and 167. Amendment No. 167 extends the power that the Secretary of State already has under Section 27(4) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to require the police to record on national police records convictions for offences specified by regulation to cautions as defined in the 1997 Act and to reprimands and warnings under Clause 61. Amendment No. 96 sets out a definition of "caution" for the purpose of the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722w01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The law (European Council Directive 92/12/EEC and the Excise Duties (Personal Reliefs) Order 1992, SI No. 3155) lays down minimum indicative levels for alcohol and tobacco; travellers who import quantities in excess of these from another member state must be able to satisfy a customs officer that this is not for a commercial purpose.
<P>

<P>
<UL>What has been the cost in terms of loss of revenue of the tax relief granted on contributions to personal pensions since they were introduced; what is the current annual cost; and what would be the cost of extending such tax relief to contributions to SERPS.[HL2762]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722w01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The annual cost of income tax relief at the basic rate for the employee part of the national insurance rebate for those contracted out of SERPS into appropriate personal pensions is shown in the table below. The additional cost of tax relief if all those currently in SERPS contracted out of SERPS and into personal pensions is tentatively estimated at around &#163;300 million each year at 1998-99 levels of earnings.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722w01_para1"></a>Contributions made by individuals to personal pension schemes also enjoy income tax relief, and if an employer contributes to a personal pension, the contribution is allowable as a business expense and is not regarded as income or taxable benefit of the employee. The total cost of income tax relief for contributions to personal pensions including retirement annuity premiums and FSAVCs is published annually in Inland Revenue Statistics.

Gastro-intestinal infection with pathological strains of E.coli (as with other organisms) may arise from a variety of sources. The source of infection can usually only be established through active epidemiological investigation of cases to identify potential exposures. A causal link must then be confirmed by comparing the exposure histories of those who became ill with others who did not and through bacteriological investigation of cases, foodstuffs and food preparation staff and sites.<P>

In England and Wales, all laboratory isolates of E.coli 0157 from the Public Health Laboratory Service and the NHS are referred to CDSC for confirmation and further typing. In the five years 1992-1996 CDSC investigated 39 outbreaks of E.coli 0157 in England and Wales, with the following results:<P>

<A NAME = "80722w01_para5"></a>The majority of cases in the community are isolated cases or small outbreaks affecting a single household
or family. These are investigated locally by health authority and/or local authority environmental health staff, but comprehensive national data on sources of infection, follow up and fatality are not available.
Mortality
<P>

<A NAME = "80722w01_para6"></a>The source of infection is often unknown at the time a death is certified. In addition patients may die of a variety of complications, and the original infection may not be the certified cause of death. As a result, routine mortality statistics are not a reliable measure of deaths due to food poisoning.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722w01_para7"></a>E.coli infections may be coded to a variety of codes using the International Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision (ICD9) depending on body site and source of infection, if these are specified. None of the codes are specific to the 0157 strain. "E.coli food poisoning" would be coded to 005.8--other specified bacterial food poisoning. Scrutiny of the cause of death text would be necessary to identify the infecting organism and the strain (where this level of detail is supplied). ONS have cause of death text in electronic form for deaths in England and Wales since 1993, and Scotland since 1996. There is no cause of death text available in electronic form for Norther Ireland. Searching paper records for earlier years is not practicable given that the information which could only be retrieved at high cost would be of poor reliability.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722w01_para8"></a>England and Wales
<P>

<A NAME = "80722w01_para9"></a>There have been no deaths certified as due to E.coli food poisoning with or without mention of strain 0157 in the years 1993 to 1997 inclusive. There were 12 deaths certified as due to gastro-intestinal infections with E.coli (ICD-9 code 008.0). Of these, six mentioned the 0157 strain but none specified food as the source of the infection.

<P>

<A NAME = "80722w01_para11"></a>The recent outbreak of food poisoning by Eschericia coli 0157 in Scotland has been the subject of extensive investigation by a committee chaired by Professor Hugh Pennington. This enquiry established that there had been 18 deaths from the effects of E.coli 0157 infection acquired through the ingestion of contaminated meat. There were no recorded cases of food poisoning from E.coli 0157 in Northern Ireland between 1988 and 1997.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722w01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside's (NMGM) Ei8ht Pass was devised by the museum Trustees as the best way of reconciling the balancing of their books with maximising access. It allows unlimited visits to all eight NMGM venues for one year, for a cost of &#163;3. Children, senior citizens, the unemployed and the disabled pay &#163;1.50. This is a socially sensitive charging regime and the indications are that the public overwhelmingly regard the pass as excellent value for money. The funds raised have allowed NMGM to keep all eight attractions open for seven days a week.

<A NAME = "80722w01_para12"></a>The introduction of the pass represented a major challenge for NMGM and the remarks in the departmental annual report reflect the smooth and effective way in which the scheme was launched.

<A NAME = "80722w02_para1"></a>Over the past year funding constraints have meant that the number of FCO staff in the UK and serving overseas has been significantly below the level of numbers permitted under its Authorised Establishment and required for the job in hand.

We believe this will be more productive than a single-step approach in dealing with nuclear weapons, which have played a much more prominent part in the military thinking and planning of their possessors than chemical and biological weapons have done.

<P>
<UL>Further to the Written Answer of the Baroness Hollis of Heigham on 6 July, when the minimum wage will come into force; whether cut-off levels for benefits, including council tax and council house rent levels, will be increased correspondingly; and whether they have given consideration to the impact of the minimum wage on welfare to work.[HL2690]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722w02_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Social Security   (Baroness Hollis of Heigham): </B>  There are no plans to make changes to the cut-off levels for benefits as a direct consequence of
the introduction of the national minimum wage.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722w02_para2"></a>The impact of the national minimum wage on council tax levels is expected to be negligible. The Government maintain a strong influence on the level of council rents through the ring-fencing of the Housing Revenue Account (HRA) and the rent guidelines assumed for the payment of HRA subsidy. Effects on costs are more likely to influence the levels of services offered rather than rents, and the impact of the national minimum wage will be only one of a range of influences on the costs of providing services to tenants.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722w02_para3"></a>However, following the Government's Comprehensive Spending Review of housing, local authority rents will be increased by 1 per cent. in real terms next year and by 2 per cent. in real terms in each of the following two years. Part of the increases in rents will be available for increased revenue expenditure on maintaining the stock. In addition, tenants will be given more say in how their homes are <P>

<P>

<A NAME = "80722w02_para4"></a>The National Minimum Wage is a key element in a range of policies introduced by the Government to help make work pay. Those on the New Deal will be treated in the same way as other workers of a similar age undergoing training. The Working Families Tax Credit, which is central to this Government's welfare to work strategy, will make work pay for a further 400,000 families, by guaranteeing a minimum income, above and beyond the level of the minimum wage.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722w02_para5"></a>The structure which we are proposing for the minimum wage is therefore consistent with our aim of getting people from welfare to work.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722w03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   The Crime and Disorder Bill will provide courts with more appropriate custodial remand and sentencing powers to deal with the most serious and persistent young offenders. To complement these changes, the Government have undertaken a review of all forms of secure accommodation for young offenders and young people held on remand. The Government believe that present arrangements for the provision and management of secure accommodation are inefficient and incoherent and are in need of reform. The review of juvenile secure accommodation was completed at the end of March and the Government have decided now on a programme of further work to be undertaken, a summary of which has been placed in the Library.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722w03_para1"></a>The main focus of this further work involves extending the role of the new Youth Justice Board for England and Wales, expected to be in place by October this year. The Crime and Disorder Bill already provides for the Youth Justice Board to advise on the setting of standards for secure accommodation for remanded and sentenced juveniles and to monitor the delivery of those standards. The Government have decided in principle to extend this role to include the commissioning and purchasing of secure accommodation for juveniles on remand and under sentence. This additional function will enable the Youth Justice Board to provide a much-needed central focus for the delivery of high quality secure facilities for remanded and sentenced young people. Subject to the outcome of further detailed work, the Government envisage that it should be possible for the Youth Justice Board to take on the function of commissioning and purchasing secure accommodation by April 2000. This will involve making an order under Clause 42(6) of the Crime and Disorder Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722w03_para2"></a>A priority for immediate action is to improve the standard of care and quality of regimes in accommodation currently used for those remanded and sentenced as juveniles. Ninety per cent. of these young people are held in Prison Service accommodation. The Prison Service is already working on the development of new regime standards for juveniles and is planning to pilot improved regimes in two establishments, Werrington and Huntercombe Young Offender Institutions. Proposals to help achieve greater separation of juveniles from adult prisoners are also being taken forward. This work will pave the way for the introduction of the detention and training order contained in the Crime and Disorder Bill, which will involve a programme of improved education and training to tackle offending behaviour, undertaken partly in custody and partly in the community.

<P>
<UL>What is the outcome of the review of arrangements for the release of prisoners on temporary licence.[HL3004]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722w03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   Following a review initiated by the Director General of the Prison Service, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary has decided to make a number of changes to the arrangements for release of prisoners on temporary licence, to support the Government's policy of developing constructive regimes for prisoners. The current system, put in place in 1995, has significantly reduced the numbers of temporary release failures, and the stringent risk assessment process will remain in place in order to ensure protection of the public. The Prisoners (Return to Custody) Act 1995 made it an offence to fail to return to custody after a period of temporary release. However, the current system places too great a limit on opportunities for governors to develop activities aimed at supporting constructive regimes and preparing prisoners for resettlement in the community.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722w03_para4"></a>From 1 September, governors will be able to develop challenging activities for young offenders outside the establishment, including schemes such as the Duke
of Edinburgh Award Scheme. Young offenders will be allowed limited participation in team sports in the community, where they are able to represent the establishment and build local contacts. Many establishments already undertake reparational and community work, and overnight stays away from the establishment will be permitted for selected young offenders where this is necessary to support such projects.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722w03_para5"></a>A number of measures will assist prisoners in finding work or training on release and in maintaining family ties, factors central to reducing reoffending. Short term young offenders will be eligible for release on facility licence for interviews to obtain housing or employment on release, and for hostel assessments. Prisoners aged 18-24 will be eligible for release on facility licence, including overnight stays where necessary, for employment related interviews under the Government's New Deal scheme. Further opportunities will be made available, for both adult prisoners and young offenders, to gain experience of employment prior to release. The current restrictions on prisoners obtaining paid work in this community will be amended to allow governors greater freedom to develop "working out" schemes, to allow prisoners experience of regular employment. Release on resettlement licence will also be extended for young offenders once they have reached the latter stages of their sentences to assist in their resettlement in the community.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722w03_para6"></a>Consideration will be given to extending some of these changes to all adult prisoners if the evaluation suggests that it is safe to do so.

<UL>What was the outcome of the investigation into Home Office officials' handling of the Mary Bell case.[HL3003]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722w03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My right honourable friend the Home Secretary has now received the Permanent Secretary's report into the circumstances in which Home Office officials had for some time known of the possibility of a book from which Mary Bell would profit financially but had not informed Ministers. This was, at his request, an investigation to identify lessons for the future, not a disciplinary inquiry.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722w03_para8"></a>Since her release in 1980, Mary Bell has remained under life licence under the supervision of the probation service. Throughout this period, officials in the Home Office Lifer Review Unit have received regular reports from the probation officers responsible for her supervision. These have frequently included accounts of attempts by literary agents and the media to induce her for substantial sums to tell her story. Indeed, there are records of such approaches to her even before she left prison.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722w03_para9"></a>The probation service is responsible for supervising those subject to life licence and for reporting, on a regular basis, on each individual to the Lifer Unit on their progress. The service has a particular responsibility to ensure that the public is protected from people who have previously committed very serious offences. Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Probation has received a copy of the report of the investigation carried out by the Chief Probation Officer of the Durham Probation Service into their handling of Mary Bell's case, and offered my right honourable friend his own independent assessment of it. In the light of this, my right honourable friend is satisfied that the probation service kept Home Office officials properly informed of the plans to publish a book. Given the exceptional difficulties of the case, it is also clear that the service has played a major and positive role in helping Mary Bell keep to the conditions of her licence in the 18 years since her release.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722w03_para10"></a>Between 1984 and 1987, Home Office officials were informed that Mary Bell had become interested in producing her own account and had spent some time preparing a manuscript. The supervising probation officer notified them of discussions with a literary agent in 1985 about a possible autobiography. Officials advised the probation officer that the Home Office did not favour publication but had no power to prevent it and would not attempt to put pressure on Mary Bell. Ministers were not informed of these developments and, in the event, the project foundered. Officials heard no more about the possibility of a book until August 1995, when they were informed of her renewed interest in producing her own account.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "80722w03_para11"></a>The probation service notified officials in January 1996 that serious negotiations were under way between Mary Bell, Gitta Sereny and a literary agent. In July, they were informed that a contract had been signed and an advance payment made. Officials responded to these developments along the same lines as their predecessors more than a decade previously--namely, by questioning the wisdom of the venture but confirming, correctly, that they had no power to prevent it. Great care was taken throughout to try to protect, through maintenance of an injunction long in force, the anonymity of Mary Bell and her family, in the interests of her young daughter.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722w03_para12"></a>Following a probation service letter of 6 March this year, advising that the book would appear shortly and was likely to arouse controversy, officials recognised the need to forewarn Ministers. Because their information was that serialisation of the book would not begin until 2 May, they did not, in the event, do so until 23 April, by which time (unbeknown to them) news of the book was already emerging. The initial briefing to Ministers concentrated on the contents of the book, and did not make it clear that officials and the probation service had known about the contract from the outset. Ministers were given a full brief on the history of the case only on 30 April, the day after newspaper serialisation had started and some days after widespread controversy had arisen over the financial benefit to Mary Bell.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722w03_para13"></a>The Lifer Unit of the Prison Service Headquarters is responsible for casework on nearly 4,000 life sentence prisoners and around a further 800 lifers now on supervision under licence in the community. Their primary task is to ensure that the lifer system operates in a way which minimises risk to the public. They bear a heavy load and my right honourable friend is satisfied that he has been very well served--as, he believes, have his predecessors--by the conscientious advice they provide on the exercise of his statutory powers in individual cases. The possibility of financial benefit to Mary Bell for a book about her crimes did not involve questions of public risk or any breach of the law or the terms of her life licence. Officials accordingly concluded, as early as 1985, that there was nothing they could do to prevent it and did not therefore believe it necessary to submit to Ministers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722w03_para14"></a>Ministers are entitled to expect that officials will try to spot events involving their cases which are likely to arouse controversy and provoke concern over the adequacy of the law. My right honourable friend believes that officials acted in this case throughout in good faith and in accordance with a correct interpretation of the law. With hindsight, it is clear that there were a number of occasions on which Ministers might reasonably have been informed of developments in the Mary Bell case. The Permanent Secretary has accordingly recommended to my right honourable friend procedural and other improvements which will help to guide Home Office staff in assessing future cases where Ministers may need to be kept informed of developments, even where there is no question of the exercise by them of statutory powers. He and the Director General of the Prison Service are specifically preparing revised internal operating procedures for the <P>

<A NAME="80722w04_wqn3"></A><B> Lord Dholakia </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether under the Crime and Disorder Bill the proposed statutory obligation on the police service, education service, health service and social services departments to supply members for youth offending teams should be met by seconding staff part time rather than full time in appropriate circumstances.[HL2763]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80722w04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   The Crime and Disorder Bill [HL] places a duty on local authorities with social services and education responsibilities to establish a youth offending team or teams for their area. Local authorities will be required to do this in partnership with the police, probation service and health authorities, which will be under a reciprocal duty to co-operate. Each youth offending team must include at least one of each of the following: a police officer, a local authority social worker, a probation officer, a nominee of the chief education officer and a health authority nominee.
<P>

<A NAME = "80722w04_para2"></a>It will be a matter for each agency to determine, after local consultation, the basis on which its staff are seconded to a youth offending team. It will be possible for staff to serve on a part-time basis within a youth offending team where this is considered appropriate in local circumstances. It may, for example, enable an individual to combine service within the youth offending team with related work within his or her own agency, or extend the number of staff members, and thereby the range of skills and expertise, available to the team. Whatever approach is adopted, the overall commitment of staff and other resources which each agency makes to the work of youth offending teams and the delivery of youth justice services will, in all cases, need to be such as properly to discharge the duties placed on it under the Bill.

<A NAME="80722w04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   The work to establish the central database is being taken forward by a working group which has been set up under the auspices of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) Administration of Firearms and Explosives Licensing Sub-Committee. The Working Group is in the process of finalising the detailed user requirement for the database. Once finalised the user requirement, which will allow better identification of the likely costs, will be submitted to the ACPO Police National Computer Steering Committee and the Police Information Technology Organisation to assess the operational priority of the database. This is expected to take place before the end of the year.

<P>
<A NAME="80722w04_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   Records are kept of the number of firearm and shotgun certificates on issue. Other than in Northern Ireland, where there is no distinction between a firearm certificate and a shotgun certificate, individuals may hold both firearm and shotgun certificates. The statistics for 1997 for England and Wales are not yet available, so the figures given relate to the position as at 30 December 1996. Within these constraints, the figures requested are given in the tables.
