<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Islwyn </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-01_para0"></a>Whether they have had any recent discussions with Corus on the future of the British steel industry.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister for Science, Department of Trade and Industry   (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </B>  My Lords, both the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry have held discussions with Corus at the highest level and will continue to do so. It would not however be appropriate to disclose the details of commercially confidential discussions between Ministers and private companies. The Government will continue to take all the steps they can to try to secure jobs in the steel industry.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Islwyn: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister recognise that the steel industry is of basic importance to the nation? Does he further recognise that at Llanwern there is a highly trained, skilled and adaptable workforce which is being treated badly? For months the future of those jobs has been hanging like a gossamer thread, with no consultation whatever. As the Government are so enamoured with Europe, why have they not signed up to the directive on information and consultation? Further, what are they doing about the large quantities of dumped steel which are arriving from Russia and the eastern bloc? America and China have taken action. Must we go cap in hand to Brussels before we can take action?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I am more than happy to agree that the steel industry is a key part of the British economy and that it is extremely efficient. Between 1998 and 1999 alone, it increased productivity from 533 to 571 tonnes per person, which is well above the levels in Germany and France.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-01_para1"></a>As regards the directive, we believe that we should not accept it while there are procedures for consultation. We also believe that we should maintain the flexibility which exists in this country. Furthermore, if there is any, the Government would be only too keen to see any evidence of dumping and charges so that they can take appropriate action.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Lord take on board the fact that Corus shed some 2,000 jobs in Wales last year and that thousands more <P>


<a name="column_554"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 554</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>job losses are expected? What plans do the Government have to replace those jobs or are they at a loss on this?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I am well aware of the significant redundancies which have taken place in the steel industry in the past months. It is a bitter blow for people in that industry. If further job redundancies are announced shortly, we shall take the action that we have taken in similar cases to ensure that we create jobs in the area and enable people to search for new jobs.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Shore of Stepney: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that although the steel industry is more efficient and competitive than it was two or three years ago it is faced with bankruptcy? Given those circumstances and the fact that the Government recognise that the principal problem is the misalignment of the euro and the pound--indeed, the whole international community recognises that the euro is undervalued--cannot the Government think of short-term ways of compensating Corus so that its long-term capacity and presence will remain and be secured? That would help to meet a relatively short-term difficulty.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, as far as I know, Corus is not faced with bankruptcy, although it is having to take serious action. We have spoken to it about the amount of action that we can take commensurate with the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty, but it has made it clear that that will not affect its position on saving plants or jobs. We are taking all the action we can to help, but longer-term problems exist.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   My Lords, I recognise that it is mainly for Corus to solve its own problems, but there are issues which the Government can take up and I hope that they are doing so in their discussions. First, following the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Shore, can the Government persuade the company to take a long-term, strategic view? Circumstances vary from time to time and it would be harmful if we now disposed of steel capacity which we could need in the future. Secondly, in view of the forthcoming climate change levy, which will have a major impact on the steel industry as an intensive user of energy, cannot the Government seek to postpone its effect on that industry or modify it in other ways?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, we hope that Corus will take a long-term view of the matter because, undoubtedly, the major issue is the exchange rate. A movement of 10 pfennigs in the exchange rate has an impact of some £80 million on the company's profitability, which is substantial. Since last December, when the two chief executives left the company, there has been a movement of about 10 pfennigs in the exchange rate; so considerable movement is already taking place. We very much hope that the company will take a long-term, not short-term, view of the situation. As to the climate change <P>


<a name="column_555"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 555</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>levy, in terms of the overall picture and particularly the exchange rate, the levy is a comparatively small amount and is the sort of issue that could be considered in any kind of small package.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Marsh: </B>   My Lords, can the noble Lord give the House an indication of how many tens of billions of pounds have been put into the coal, car and steel industries in recent years? Does the Minister agree that none of that money has been successful in reversing the trend?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I do not believe that I can give the figure that the noble Lord requests. I agree that as a long-term solution such subsidies do not rectify situations which are due to an uncompetitive position. As I hope I made clear, Corus has had an amazing record in increasing productivity. We very much hope that short-term considerations will not play an overwhelming part in this particular situation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Brookman: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that it is the substance and outcome of discussions between the Government and Corus which are important? Can the Minister tell the House about the company's response to the package put together by the National Assembly for Wales, which I believe is supported by the Government, to maintain the current plant configuration? Does the Minister also have a view as to the recent announcement by the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation to set up a consortium to purchase the plant at Llanwern if the worst comes to the worst?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I do not believe that I can go into the details of discussions. However, as I hope that I made clear, there was a package which was subject at least to preliminary consideration. It was made clear by the company that that would not affect the situation that it faced in relation either to plants or jobs and, therefore, that it could not correct that situation.

<A NAME="10130-01_spopq1"></A><B> Lord Renton of Mount Harry </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-01_para2"></a>How soon they expect the extra public funds being made available to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to lead to positive improvement in the financial position of farmers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food   (Baroness Hayman): </B>  My Lords, while farm incomes in the United Kingdom have been severely depressed by global factors such as world commodity prices and exchange rates, and the aftermath of BSE, the Government have taken a variety of measures to assist farmers financially. Since <P>


<a name="column_556"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 556</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>1997 we have injected some £1.2 billion into the sector to provide agrimonetary compensation, assistance to hill farmers and offset SRM inspection and cattle passport charges. This supplements the £3 billion paid annually in direct CAP payments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Renton of Mount Harry: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for that Answer. I declare an interest as chairman of the Sussex Downs Conservation Board. Does the Minister agree that despite all of that there is still no sign of a "positive improvement in the financial position of farmers"? Does the noble Baroness recall the observation of the chairman of the Hills Task Force last week in the West Country that there remain a number of barriers to farmers who cannot find their way through the system? Is not the first task of MAFF to try to make all the new green schemes (for want of a better expression) more easily comprehensible to the ordinary farmer and see the money allocated to them more quickly?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-01_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I have sympathy with the point raised by the noble Lord, although there are some sectors of the industry, particularly pigs and to a lesser extent poultry, where there are signs of an upturn. Overall, the industry has had a terrible time over the past few years. However, the very substantial individual grants and assistance provided by the Government, particularly agrimonetary compensation, have helped the financial position of individual farmers. As to the availability of straightforward information about schemes under the rural development plan, for example, assistance to those who seek to diversify, or advice to small farmers, all those matters are in hand and we shall continue to take them forward.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister do her best to ensure that there is an end to stop and go in the assistance given to farmers who convert to organic methods? Will the noble Baroness bear in mind that more than half the organic food consumed in this country is imported and that conversion normally means a reduction in total production?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-02_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, we have put a considerable sum of money into support for organic farming in recognition of its environmental benefits to the country. That sector has expanded. For example, in 1996-97 support for organic farming amounted to about £374,000 a year. This year we plan to spend £18 million on organic farming, which is 50 times as much as before. That steady expansion will continue under the ERDP.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, can my noble friend say more about the Government's rural development programme and the likely future financial benefits which will flow to farmers?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-02_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, we put great emphasis on the rural development programme. We have an ambitious programme that involves <P>


<a name="column_557"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 557</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>expenditure of £1.6 billion over the next seven years. That allows us significantly to expand existing schemes and introduce new measures to aid rural enterprise, vocational training, processing and marketing, and energy crops. All of that allows the industry to be sustainably redirected in future. One of the sadnesses is that the historic underspend on agri-environmental and rural development measures is responsible for the very low allocation of EU funds to this particular budget.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister acknowledge that pig farmers are likely to lose £26 million unless it is claimed under the outgoers and ongoers scheme by the end of March? Further, will the Government ensure that the necessary legislation is passed in time to claim that sum and that it is used in advance of the pig levy scheme to compensate pig farmers whose livelihoods have been affected by swine fever or related restrictions?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-02_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, two different issues have to be separated. One is the implementation of the levy that will add 25 per cent, 25 pence in every pound--the industry levy--for those who are affected by swine fever. The MLC has finished its consultation. We have every intention of taking that matter forward quickly. The other is the pig industry restructuring scheme, announced in the action plans for farming. It has taken much longer than we wanted to get EU approval. However, the outgoers element was open for applications on 4th December last year and the ongoers element was opened on 22nd January 2001. We have £40 million available for the scheme in the next two financial years. We are determined to ensure that the scheme achieves its objective.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   My Lords, are the Government considering a pension scheme for the many small farmers who will go out of business? I have in mind a bond scheme--a bond issued for a certain number of years which can be cashed by the farmer. And what are the Government prepared to do to help the marketing organisations improve their position against the buying power of the supermarkets and others? It is important that the marketing position is improved to the level of, say, that in Denmark.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-02_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, there is a difference between bond schemes for people who are going out of an industry and pension schemes per se and, indeed, the outgoers scheme in the pig industry restructuring scheme where, obviously, the financial consequences have to be considered. As to marketing, one of the main thrusts of policy with Nick Brown as Minister of Agriculture has been to try to join up the food chain in particular sectors and to recognise the impact on producers right through the chain to retailers. As the noble Lord will be well aware, because I know of the close interest he takes in milk-related issues, we have set up the Milk Task Force as part of the <P>


<a name="column_558"></a>

<A NAME="10130-02_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Thomson of Monifieth </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-02_para0"></a>What discussions they are having with the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission in the United Kingdom about planning future developments of the scheme.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-02_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, the commission has now submitted to the Secretary of State for International Development its report which she requested, which is a review of the Commonwealth Scholarships and Fellowships Plan and its contribution to international development. This makes a number of recommendations for improving the effectiveness of the CSFP and enhancing its contribution to development. The Secretary of State will be meeting shortly with the chairman of the CSC to discuss these findings and their implementation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Thomson of Monifieth: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the recent report of the United Kingdom Scholarship Commission, which was submitted to the Commonwealth Education Ministers in Canada, provides dramatic factual evidence of how many of those who received United Kingdom Commonwealth scholarships have gone on to take up leading positions in their own countries? To use the department's phrase, "Many of them have become trainers of trainers in their own country". Will the Government therefore explore positively how we can build on this British success story and adapt the scholarship scheme to meet the needs of the modern Commonwealth?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-02_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, a report on the CSFP was discussed by Commonwealth Education Ministers at their triennial conference in Halifax. They made a number of proposals to change the administration of the scheme which were designed, for example, to raise the profile of the plan to increase the number of participating countries; to expand its flexibility; to improve communication and overall co-ordination; and, in particular, to strengthen partnerships in the nomination and selection of candidates. The DfID's review of the scheme has come up with a number of recommendations which dovetail with that. We shall be looking at those recommendations. Obviously the Secretary of State's meeting with the chairman of CSC will be important in that respect. We will then come forward with recommendations as to how we can ensure that the scheme dovetails with our development objective.
<P>


<a name="column_559"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 559</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-02_para1"></a>I agree with the noble Lord as regards the substantial impact that the scholarships have had. It is pleasing to know that 95 per cent of participants from developing countries continue to work in those countries after the scholarship has been completed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-02_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister join me in welcoming the steps taken by the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission in recent years to promote genuinely shared provision between UK universities and those from developing countries. Does she agree that measures such as split-site qualifications have immense potential to raise long-term capacity in recipient countries as well as benefiting the individual scholars?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-02_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, we agree that some of the developments--for example, split-site qualifications--have been very successful. Some of the review's recommendations will go further down that road. We are looking to develop the long-term capacity and skills of students from developing countries so that they can make a contribution to the development of their own countries, either when they return to those countries or through the process of split-site education.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister think of any way of assisting potential scholars in countries where there is no freedom of expression, bearing in mind that in the past the CSFP was based on the principle that nominations come only from governments? Will the Government consider the possibility that nominations could be made by qualified NGOs of suitable recipients in countries such as Zimbabwe where there is a lack of freedom of expression?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-02_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, that is a matter which the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, raised with me in November last year. It is true that at present national agencies in each Commonwealth country are responsible for submitting nominations. So candidates who are, for example, persona non grata in their own country are unlikely to be nominated. In the review of the scheme we are considering, in consultation with the Hugh Pilkington Charitable Trust, whether changes should be made to address that problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-02_para2"></a>The noble Lord talked in particular about NGOs. A limited number of applications from DfID local offices, local NGOs and agencies working with groups such as refugees could possibly be submitted directly to the CSC in London. We are currently looking at that possibility.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Howell of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that education and learning are the hoops which bind our commonwealth together and give it more power and influence in the global context?

<FONT SIZE=3>Commonwealth would have much more prominence? Yet it seems that the numbers in the Commonwealth Scholarships and Fellowships Plan are shrinking. Can she tell us when, in line with government rhetoric and declarations, that will be reversed and we shall see more people involved under the scheme?

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-03_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, perhaps the noble Lord is not aware that the UK is the largest contributor to CSFP. We have provided two-thirds of total awards under the scheme over the past three years. The noble Lord will recall that DfID has prioritised the whole area of basic education because of our commitment to meeting the universal primary education target. In the past three years we have spent £500 million in developing countries on promoting universal primary education. So the Government have certainly put their money where their mouth is.

<P>
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-03_para0"></a>Whether a parent has the right to know if and when a daughter aged 16 or below has been given the "morning-after-pill" by her school.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </B>  My Lords, where a school nurse provides emergency contraception she works within the same legal framework and government guidance as other health professionals providing contraception to under-16s. They must always encourage the young person to involve her parents, but the nurses' professional code states that, if the girl refuses, confidentiality must be maintained unless there are serious child protection issues.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister say how many school nurses are available to the 4,000 secondary schools on a daily basis? Does he not agree that parents can be made responsible for misdemeanours of their children in school and yet do not have the right--I believe that is the import of the Minister's answer--to know when medication is being given to their children aged between 11 and 15 years. Does the Minister agree with that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I do not have figures for the number of school nurses. I will find out if they are available and let the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, know. Certainly, nurses play a very important role. I believe that in relation to sex education they can play an invaluable role in advising young people.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-03_para1"></a>No school would introduce such a scheme without full consultation with the parents. Existing government guidance to schools makes this clear. The guidance for health professionals issuing contraception to girls under 16 makes clear that they <P>


<a name="column_561"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 561</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>must, first, encourage the young person to involve her parents. At the end of the day, if that young person is not willing for the matter to be discussed with her parents then the health professional has to use his or her own judgment. Surely, that is the most appropriate way forward if young girls are to be encouraged to come forward to speak to nurses about these issues.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Walton of Detchant: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Lord agree that the Family Law Reform Act states very clearly that consent given by a young person of 16 is as valid as if given by an individual of full age? Further, does he agree that during my term of office on the General Medical Council in the 1980s that council agonised over this issue following the Gillick judgment? Eventually the council came to the conclusion that if a doctor were consulted by a young person under 16 about issues relating to contraception then it was the doctor's duty to try to persuade--particularly a young girl--to consult her parents about that matter. If that young girl adamantly refused to do so it was the doctor's duty to preserve her confidentiality even if he did then prescribe for her. Does the noble Lord agree that that applies equally to school nurses?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Walton, puts the matter accurately and effectively. The point I make is that the advice that school nurses and other health professionals can give to young people can often encourage the young people to have the confidence to go and talk to their parents. That is what we would all wish to happen. If that young person is not prepared to do so the school nurse and other health professionals cannot turn that person away. They have to use their professional judgment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may follow up the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Walton. Can the Minister confirm that the guidance issued to schools is entirely in line with the Gillick case decided in 1985, that the Government see good sense in that case and have no intention to change it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord is right. The circumstances that he mentions go back to the Gillick judgment and the Fraser guidelines, as they have been called. I can assure the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, that the Government have no intention of making any changes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-03_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Knight of Collingtree: </B>   My Lords, did the Minister in his speech winding up the debate last night imply--when suggesting it did not matter whether chemists could judge accurately whether a girl asking for the pill was 16 or not because doctors gave contraceptive devices to girls under that age--that the Government intend shortly to abolish the age of consent or lower the age of 16?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, it is some hours since we had that debate. I do not recall making any such remarks. I made it clear that the minimum <P>


<a name="column_562"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 562</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>guidelines laid down by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society have to be followed by pharmacists in exercising their judgment in relation to the sale of emergency contraceptives to women of the age of 16 and over. Pharmacists who are in breach of those guidelines are subject to the disciplinary procedures of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society. I fail to see how the noble Baroness could possibly take from what I said any intent to change the law on the age of consent.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-03_para10"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10130-03_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: For the reassurance of the noble Lords who are leaving the Chamber, this is a modest amendment that probably will not lead to a <P>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 563</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>clash of intellects across the Floor of the Committee. Unless noble Lords have a serious interest in the Bill, they are wise to leave.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-03_para12"></a>The Bill sets up a new regulatory authority to be called the security industry authority. The amendment suggests that it should be called the security activities authority. The point being made is that this authority will regulate a good many activities that are not generally considered part of the security industry. So far "the security industry" has not been a very carefully defined and understood term and many people would not know what the definition covers.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-03_para13"></a>The British Security Industry Association has a number of large and small firms in its membership. It covers many of the activities that are to be regulated by the Bill. One of the activities is wheelclamping. As the Bill stands, it will cover wheelclamping by private individuals who are not any part of what one might think of as the security industry. It covers private detectives. In some senses they belong to the security industry, but one has to define it very widely to include them. It covers keyholders. Those often are some of the large and well-known firms in the industry. But it also concerns door supervisors--"bouncers", as some people call them--who frequently are not part of the security industry as such. "Bouncers" and wheelclampers are covered whether or not they are under contract to a large firm. In-house door supervisors and in-house wheelclampers are covered. So the Bill is extremely wide in terms of the coverage of the new authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-03_para14"></a>It seems to me that it might be sensible to think of a different name which indicates that the authority will not only regulate the security industry itself but also these extraneous activities. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-03_spnew11"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   Perhaps I may add a few brief words of encouragement to my noble friend in respect of his incisive amendment. Clearly, this is a way to illustrate the fact that the Bill has a wider application than merely to those who work full-time in the private security business. A number of other people will be affected. The arguments put forward so convincingly by my noble friend also apply to a later amendment relating to the Long Title of the Bill. The Long Title states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Make provision for the regulation of the private security industry".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-03_para15"></a>
However, the Bill goes wider than that. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's response to my noble friend's suggestion on that issue.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Cope, for the clarity of his explanation of what he described as a very modest amendment and one which he thought would not be too intellectually taxing. That probably means that I can cope with it.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-04_para0"></a>The noble Lord is right to say that a diverse range of security activities are undertaken by the private sector, some of which are regulated under the provisions of the Bill. But the umbrella term "industry" is well-used <P>


<a name="column_564"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 564</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and widely accepted and is probably the term that is best understood. For example, it is used by both the main trade associations--the British Security Industry Association and the Joint Security Industry Council. It is also the case that during the consideration of the Bill and in the discussions that have taken place inside and outside the House the notion of it being called the security industry authority has become widely known and probably widely accepted as the most likely and perhaps most useful title for that agency.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-04_para1"></a>I do not believe that we should accept the amendment, although I can see that there might be a desire to try to think up another term. What we have proposed satisfies most people. It is certainly the clearest and most easily understood term. Therefore, at this stage, I do not think there is any useful purpose to be served by accepting the amendment. I certainly did not find anything particularly persuasive in what he said, although I thought that it was an interesting set of observations.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-04_para2"></a>I have another concern about the noble Lord's suggestion. The insertion of the word "activities" may give a false impression that the regulatory body will cover something wider than the private security industry. Some might even see it as covering the Security Services. That would give a very false and misleading impression.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-04_para3"></a>For all those reasons, I cannot accept the amendment. I urge the noble Lord to reconsider his position and withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   I certainly would not wish to give a false impression, particularly not with regard to the Security Services. At the same time, it seemed to me that the Title of the Bill gives a false impression in another direction. However, I do not think that it is a significant enough matter to pursue. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-04_para4"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-04_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Astor </B>   moved Amendment No. 2:

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 1, line 12, after ("of") insert ("people employed wholly or predominately as").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-04_para5"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10130-04_para6"></a>The noble Viscount said: In moving this amendment, I wish to speak also to Amendments Nos. 9, 10, 11, 12 and 46. The amendments are concerned with narrowing the definition of who will come under the Bill. Although the Minister was reasonably clear at Second Reading, there is certainly some confusion about whether a person's job is full-time in security or part-time. The Minister said that in-house providers are not subject to regulation in general. However, since then we have had rather confusing messages. My amendments seek to define who will come under the Bill and to get the Government's thinking on this issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-04_para7"></a>It is important that the new authority should be responsible for those who are full-time or predominantly employed as security operatives. What is the position with a barman in a pub? Frequently, barmen exclude people from pubs. Some pubs have people who look after security but many pubs do not. <P>


<a name="column_565"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 565</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>In that instance, they should obviously not be covered. At Second Reading the Minister said that to some extent the Bill will catch publicans. We need to know to what extent and how that will work.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-04_para8"></a>Amendment No. 2 seeks to add the words,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"people employed wholly or predominantly as",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-04_para9"></a>
security operatives. Amendments No. 9 seeks to include the words,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"as a principal part of his employment".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-04_para10"></a>
Amendment No. 10 is very similar. Amendment No. 12 refers to Schedule 2 to the Bill. Amendment No. 46 narrows the definition in Paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 2, which also allows ticket collectors as well as firemen to maintain discipline.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-04_para11"></a>There has been a great deal of correspondence from various sections of the industry. I am sure that the Minister will have received it. There are those who wish to extend the provisions as wide as possible. Some wish to do so for no doubt thoroughly proper motives while others see it as a wonderful business opportunity. There are also those who seek to ensure that industry is not faced with costly over-regulation as a result of this worthwhile Bill. We support the aims of the Bill, but we want something that will work. This has to be handled with a reasonably light touch. Too heavy-handed an approach will not work.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-04_para12"></a>I am sure that the Minister will respond by saying that much will depend on how the new authority conducts its business; namely, that the proof of the pudding will be in the eating. I agree that that is the case and, of course, we shall be addressing the point in later amendments. However, the authority will need to take careful account of what is laid down in the Bill because the provisions of Clauses 1 and 3 will form the basis of the authority's guidelines.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-04_para13"></a>We feel that these are important issues. It is necessary to define exactly who will be included in the definitions so as to ensure that those for whom the provisions of the Bill will be unnecessary and for whom the Bill would become merely a "burden on industry" are not affected. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-04_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   My noble friend has tabled a bevy of amendments, all of which are designed to achieve much the same aim. A great deal of harmony exists between the parties on this Bill. At Second Reading, the Minister went to some lengths to reassure the House that that he, too, did not wish to see the legislation and, to an extent, the authority brought into disrepute by having to impose considerable burdens on those for whom security duties were merely incidental to their primary activity. We have taken careful note of those assurances.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-04_para14"></a>Given that, the Minister will need to put forward a strong and convincing case to explain why such groups will not be affected by the Bill. The amendments tabled by my noble friend seek to make the position much clearer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I am grateful to both noble Viscounts for their contributions to these amendments and for the clarity with which the noble <P>


<a name="column_566"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 566</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Viscount, Lord Astor, moved his amendment. His concluding comments summarised his position; namely, that we need to strike a balance between proper regulation and the need to avoid over-regulation. That probably forms the parameter of this debate and I accept the point. I hope that I can offer the reassurances sought by the noble Viscount. Perhaps I may address each of the amendments in turn.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-04_para15"></a>As regards Amendment No. 2, we feel that other relevant provisions already contained in the Bill as currently drafted already take into account the level of activity which a security operative would have to undertake before a licence was required. Definitions of the activities which will require a licence are carefully listed in Schedule 2. They provide for the exemption of a number of different employment categories. Exemptions are also provided for those who carry out security activities incidentally to their main employment. There is no question that the authority would wish to impose the licensing regime on individuals who do not have significant security-related duties. We believe that the Bill as drafted will work effectively to cover that point.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-04_para16"></a>I turn now to Amendment No. 9. Here again the Bill already takes account of the aim of this amendment, which seeks to exclude from regulation those individuals whose security-related activities are incidental to their main employment. Again, those are listed in Schedule 2 to the Bill. We have no desire to make the regime inflexible and unworkable and to that end we believe that the current drafting works well.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-04_para17"></a>As regards Amendment No. 10, we believe that the Bill already takes into account the main objective of the amendment and that we are on common ground here. We feel that a significant measure of flexibility has already been built in to respond to this point.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-04_para18"></a>A similar argument could be put forward as regards Amendment No. 11. For regulation to be effective, we think that it is important that those who own or operate companies need to be held accountable. If this amendment were to be pressed, it would exclude directors and partners who do not themselves directly carry out the designated activities. We think that that would shoot a hole through the import of the Bill. Evidence has been gathered of companies which have been established by individuals who have criminal records, some with convictions for violence and drugs offences. Although they themselves may not be directly involved in the provision of security services, I cannot believe that the noble Viscount would wish to exclude such people from the remit of the Bill. It is vital that these individuals should be weeded out of the industry and prevented from establishing themselves in it in the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-04_para19"></a>We consider that the licensing of directors and partners will form a fundamental part of the effective regulation of the industry. Licensing will apply to directors and partners not directly engaged in the activities of a security operative but who are directly responsible for the company or those carrying out such activities.
<P>


<a name="column_567"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 567</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-04_para20"></a>As the Bill stands, the security industry authority will be able to identify and remove criminality at any level within an organisation. This will be a major benefit both for the industry as a whole and for the public. Furthermore, I am sure that noble Lords opposite will be aware that the licensing proposals have been welcomed by the industry. For those reasons, I shall not be able to accept Amendment No. 11.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-04_para21"></a>I turn now to Amendment No. 12. Schedule 2 defines the activities of security operatives which are subject to regulation by the Bill. Paragraph 1(1) of the schedule makes it clear that the activities referred to are those undertaken by "a security operative". The relationship between Clause 3 and Schedule 2 is made explicit by Clause 3(4). That subsection confirms that Schedule 2 defines the activities that are also to be treated as security operations for the purposes of the Bill. Thus the addition of a further reference to Schedule 2 within the text of Clause 3, as proposed in this amendment, is entirely unnecessary. I hope that, with this explanation being put on to the record, noble Lords will feel able to agree to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-04_para22"></a>Finally, I turn to Amendment No. 46. Paragraph 2(5) provides an important clarificatory exemption from the need for a licence as a manned guard. Similarly, important exemptions are made in paragraphs 2(4) and (6). These provisions are designed to ensure that the definition of "manned guarding" used in paragraph 2(1) does not inadvertently take into regulation activities which have nothing to do with the private security industry.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-04_para23"></a>An example of where the exemption in paragraph 2(5) would apply is the teaching profession. Teachers maintain order and discipline but clearly are not part of the private security industry. Without the text which this amendment seeks to delete, it will be less unambiguously clear that teachers--and perhaps people leading holiday expeditions--are not covered by the provisions of Schedule 2. It is important that readers of the Bill should have the minimum possible doubts as regards which activities are included within its scope. I am afraid that this amendment would increase uncertainty and for that reason I am not able to accept it.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-04_para24"></a>I hope that these explanations will persuade the noble Viscount to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   I should like to return to Clause 3(2)(f) which Amendment No. 11 seeks to delete. This states that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a director of any body corporate ... engages in licensable conduct",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-05_para0"></a>
if any of his fellow directors do so under the provisions of paragraphs (a) to (e). A large engineering firm, for example, may hire a private security firm to man the gates and to provide manned guarding at night. That activity is covered by the Bill and would require a licence. Given that, the personnel director or manager in charge of security for the engineering firm as a whole <P>


<a name="column_568"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 568</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would also require a licence. Under paragraph (d), he will be acting as the supervisor to those engaged in a relevant activity. The guard may belong to Securicor, but the manager is responsible for him as regards his work at the engineering company. For that reason, the manager or the personnel director would also require a licence simply because he is responsible for making sure that the security industry firm does its job. That means that, under paragraph (f), every director of the engineering firm must have a licence.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-05_para1"></a>This appears to apply to just about every company quoted on the stock exchange, and many that are not, because there is a kind of escalation. The guards may be employed by Securicor, Group 4, Reliance, any one of the large firms. The engineering firm--though it could be anything: a chemical firm or whatever--supervising those people is definitely caught under paragraph (d). Therefore, under paragraph (f) every other director of virtually every firm will require a licence. I cannot believe that that is what the Government intend, but it seems to me, reading these paragraphs together, that that is how everybody will be caught.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-05_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   This matter has caused concern in industries across a wide range of activities. For example, the cinema industry has expressed concerns very similar to those expressed by my noble friend, Lord Cope of Berkeley, in connection with paragraph (d). I understand--the noble Lord the Minister will correct me if I am wrong--that the industry is exempt from some other provisions of the Bill in the day-to-day conduct of its business. But if a cinema company brings in security guards for a premiere, or some other special event, there will be a burden on the person within that cinema company who contracts with the security company in that that person will need to be licensed. This would be a very good opportunity for the Minister to clarify his understanding of the implication of paragraph (d). Basically, the question is this: does it mean that any company that hires a security company must itself be licensed?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I am grateful to noble Lords for their further clarification of the amendment. Perhaps to say that we are at cross-purposes would be to use the wrong term, but there may well be a misreading of the clause, because it is certainly not our intention that the personnel director of the engineering company in the example given by the noble Lord, Lord Cope of Berkeley, would have management responsibility for the security staff at the gates of the company's premises, nor that that director would need to be licensed. We are talking about the management of the security company itself, not of the engineering company that is contracting those working for that company.

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 569</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-05_para2"></a>I hope that that clarifies the point. I shall be more than happy to provide further chapter and verse in correspondence if noble Lords wish, but I hope that I have dealt with the point clearly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-05_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   The Minister has dealt with Amendment No. 11 to a degree. What he is saying, as I understand it, is that anybody who uses a firm will not be covered by the provision; it is only in the firm doing the security work that the director is covered. That is fine as far as it goes, but some very large companies contain individual companies--wholly owned, associated or whatever--that have contracts between themselves. Therefore, it is perfectly possible for there to be large organisations that in certain circumstances carry out security work in a plant that they perhaps do not wholly own. Whatever the reason, it seems in principle that if they could be covered it must make sense for liability to attach only to those who are, as it were, licensed people themselves. Paragraph (f) seems to extend the responsibility to those who will not be licensed by the new authority. That seems wrong in principle.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-05_para3"></a>I accept the principle that if one is involved in the security industry and is a licensed person, whether an individual, a partner or a director of a company, one should be responsible, and that that licensed person must be the responsible person. But it seems wrong to extend that responsibility perhaps even to a non-executive director of a security firm and make him or her responsible for the activities of the managing director or someone else in charge. That is in fact what the Bill does, and it is a step too far.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-05_para4"></a>I hope that the Minister will consider the matter, because we shall want to return to it at a later stage. I cannot believe that it is the Government's intention to extend that responsibility further than necessary, bringing in a whole class of people. I am all for making those who come within the orbit of the security industry authority become licensed, making them responsible in a corporate, individual and partnership way, but there must be some ring-fencing or the matter will become very difficult.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-05_para5"></a>I do not find much on which to disagree with the Minister as regards my earlier amendments. As he said, it is very much a matter of how the new authority will work. The more I listened to what he said--and I shall read it carefully in Hansard--the more I realised that we shall have to examine Schedule 2 more carefully, and perhaps look to add detail there. The schedule can be changed by the Secretary of State by order. Therefore, it can be changed in any direction, in effect depending on the Secretary of State of the day. We shall want to make sure that Clause 1 says what it means to say and what the Government mean it to say. There is a tendency in the passage of legislation for the Government to say "This is what we think the Bill says. If we have got it wrong, we shall change it by order later". We should like to try to avoid that and get Clauses 1 and 3 right before the Bill leaves the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-05_para6"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for his answers. We shall return to this issue. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<A NAME = "10130-05_para8"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10130-05_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: We now come to the question of inspections. We propose adding the words in the amendment because the first point on inspections is that the inspectors employed by the authority will presumably not only inspect those who have licences, or are clearly engaged in activity which requires a licence, but will also, at the margin, look to see whether some people who do not have licences, and are not necessarily clearly engaged in licensable conduct, are engaged in conduct for which they should have a licence. Therefore, the inspectors will be able to check up on them and fine them if necessary, or ensure that they obtain a licence. If the inspectors find themselves rejected, as it were, by a firm that they think may require a licence but does not have one, they may have difficulty.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-05_para10"></a>This question also raises more general points as to who and what the inspectors will inspect. Some in the industry have called for what they describe as mandatory inspections, which I take to mean that there would be a regular inspection once a year, or at some such period, of everybody with a licence. But that would be enormously expensive and not necessarily essential. We are all keen--I know that the Government are, as we are--to keep the regulations in proportion to the difficulties in this field.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-05_para11"></a>The question of who and what will be inspected makes a difference to the number of inspections required. We know that several hundred thousand people will require licences. There are various estimates, but 300,000 is widely suggested. To have any reasonable inspection, even ongoing, of 300,000 people and the companies they work for, spread around the whole country, will take quite a large force of inspectors. That in itself will be reflected in the cost of the whole regime, which will fall on the industry. It would be helpful to know what kind of inspection is envisaged by the clause giving this duty to the authority. Flowing from that, how large a team of inspectors, roughly speaking, do the Government anticipate will be required to carry out this duty? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-05_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   As I understand it, the amendment seeks to extend the authority's inspection function to those suspected of being engaged in licensable conduct. It seems to me to be a novel device for expanding the remit of the security industry authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-05_para12"></a>We take the view that the security industry authority already has more than enough powers and teeth to enable it to carry out its inspection function using the provisions contained in Clause 18. After all, these powers would allow a person authorised by the authority to enter premises and to carry out inspections of the documents of any person appearing to be a regulated person. I suppose that "appearing" in these terms could be construed as being in some way similar to "suspected". This refers, broadly, to someone who has, or the authority believes ought to have, a licence. We <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>consider the powers to be sufficient for the effective enforcement of the licensing system. For those reasons we do not think that the amendment is needed.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-05_para13"></a>The White Paper looked at this question and suggested a low estimate in terms of numbers. We do not want to see a massive inspectorate but one which is proportionate to the size of the problem. In constructing the inspectorate we shall, of course, talk very carefully with the private security industry. If we were to expand the remit of the authority in the way suggested by the noble Lord's amendment, we would push those numbers up. As the authority will be financed through fees collected, that would tend to lead to an excessive burden on the industry. That is not what we want. We need to keep the numbers in proportion.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-05_para14"></a>We expect the number of inspectors to be at the lower end of the range. I cannot be precise on numbers today. However, I undertake to take the matter away and do more research. Obviously, in constructing the size of the inspectorate, we shall consult carefully with the industry. In the light of those reassurances, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<A NAME="10130-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   I am not sure whether the Minister was hinting that if my amendment was rewritten to say something like "persons appearing to be engaged in licensable conduct" it would be more acceptable. I am not trying to hold out any particular credit for the drafting used in my amendment as opposed to other drafting, but the Minister's words seem to indicate the difference between Clause 18, which allows powers of entry to premises owned or occupied by any person appearing to be a regulated person, and Clause 1 where it is only persons engaged in licensable conduct who are to be inspected. There appears to be a difference between the two clauses, the difference hinted at in my amendment. We may try again with different drafting to see if we can bring this matter into line. At this point, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="10130-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall now repeat a Statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health. The Statement is as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "10130-06_para3"></a>"With permission, I wish to make a statement about the inquiry into events at Alder Hey Hospital, Liverpool.
<P>
</UL>

<a name="column_572"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 572</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para4"></a>"I am today publishing the report of the inquiry into the Royal Liverpool Children's NHS Trust, known as the Alder Hey Hospital. I am publishing alongside it two further documents: first, the Chief Medical Officer's census into the extent of organ retention in the NHS in England; secondly, the Chief Medical Officer's recommendations for reform of organ retention procedures. All three documents are now available in the Vote Office.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para5"></a>"I am grateful, Mr. Speaker, for your agreement that the parents affected at Alder Hey should also have access to copies of the report.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para6"></a>"I should like to record my thanks to the chairman of the Alder Hey inquiry, Mr Michael Redfern, QC, and his fellow panel members, Dr Jean Keeling and Mrs Elizabeth Powell, for conducting this difficult inquiry.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para7"></a>"The inquiry was established in December 1999 following evidence to the Bristol inquiry that a large number of hearts from deceased children had been retained at hospitals in the NHS.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para8"></a>"Alder Hey was one such hospital. It is a world-renowned hospital, treating 200,000 children a year. For many years, the hospital has made use of human hearts for research and teaching. The Redfern report says that,
<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>'there are now more than 1,600 living children who would have died in infancy or childhood without the improvements in surgical techniques and care which were pioneered in Liverpool'.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-06_para9"></a><P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "10130-06_para10"></a>"But as the inquiry report makes perfectly clear, many of these hearts were obtained without consent. According to the report, in addition to over 2,000 children's hearts, there are large numbers of brain parts, eyes taken from foetuses, over 1,500 stillbirths or foetuses and, perhaps most disturbingly of all, a number of children's heads and bodies.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para11"></a>"The Redfern report reveals,
<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>'a lack of respect and a failure to appreciate the circumstances which led to the taking of human material'.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-06_para12"></a>
For example, the report cites entries about foetal material labelled with the words: 'neck deeply lacerated. Pull it to pieces sometime and reject'.
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "10130-06_para13"></a>"Some of these entries date back many years. The number of organs retained by Alder Hey increased dramatically in the seven years following the appointment by the hospital and the University of Liverpool of Professor van Velzen in 1988. He was appointed as chair of foetal and infant pathology in the department of pathology.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para14"></a>"During van Velzen's time at Alder Hey between 1988 and 1995, he systematically ordered the unethical and illegal stripping of every organ from every child who had had a post-mortem. He ignored parents' wishes, even when they told him explicitly that they did not want a full post-mortem, let alone the retention of any of their child's organs.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para15"></a>"According to the report, van Velzen lied to parents; he lied to other doctors; he lied to hospital managers; he stole medical records; he falsified statistics and reports; and he encouraged other staff to do the same.
<P>
</UL>

<a name="column_573"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 573</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para16"></a>"For any parent the death of their child is a tragedy. To bury that child, to grieve, to hold precious their memory over the years is how many families gradually come to terms with their loss. It is hard to imagine the trauma and anguish which each of the Alder Hey parents faced when, many years later, they discovered that their child's body had not been buried intact as they believed but had been stripped of its entire internal organs, leaving the body as a shell.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para17"></a>"This happened not to one set of parents in Liverpool but to several hundred. The hospital and the university now admit that they will never be able accurately to tell parents what happened to every organ of every child between 1988 and 1995.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para18"></a>"What we do now know is that the vast majority of organs which were taken were never used for medical research. Parents cannot even take comfort in the knowledge that their children's organs were used to help other children. It is clear from the report that the understanding of cot death--for which Professor van Velzen was funded--was not advanced one iota by his practice of stripping of organs from children.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para19"></a>"The question in the minds of parents and of others is how van Velzen got away with it for so long. The answer is that the hospital authorities and the University of Liverpool failed to monitor his practices and failed to take action to stop them. Numerous complaints were made. Problems were not properly investigated. Action was not taken.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para20"></a>"These failures were compounded by the incompetence and insensitivity of both the hospital and university authorities once the truth did begin to emerge. The hospital seemed overwhelmed by events; the university simply turned its back on parents. Some parents faced up to four funerals as different organs from their children were returned to them at different times. The pain caused to the parents by this dreadful sequence of events is unforgivable. I am deeply sorry for the wrong that was done to them, their families and their children. Those who did wrong will now be held to account.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para21"></a>"The inquiry report says that Professor van Velzen must never be allowed to practise again in this country. I can tell the House today that he has been referred to the General Medical Council for disciplinary action. I understand that he has been summoned to appear before the GMC later this week. I can also tell the House that the inquiry report has been referred to the Merseyside police and passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions. They will determine whether criminal prosecutions should now proceed.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para22"></a>"Four NHS staff--including the current chief executive of the trust--have today been suspended. Their employers will now consider appropriate disciplinary action. The role of other NHS staff will be examined by their employers. The doctors criticised in the report have been referred to the General Medical Council. Other staff have been referred to the Council for Professions Supplementary to Medicine.
<P>
</UL>

<a name="column_574"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 574</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para23"></a>"My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment has asked the president of the council of the University of Liverpool to review the evidence in the report and to take appropriate disciplinary action. The current acting chair of the trust board is today leaving the trust, along with two non-executive directors whose resignations I have today accepted. I have today appointed Angela Jones as the new chair. It is right that the trust should have a fresh start.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para24"></a>"Alder Hey Hospital relies on its dedicated staff. They have been as shocked, as we all are, by these events. I want to thank those staff today who, through these difficult times, have continued to provide treatment and care for children from Liverpool and elsewhere. The action I have taken today should assist those staff to re-establish the hospital's relationship with the community it serves. I am confident that Alder Hey can recover and rebuild its reputation as a leading national and international centre for specialist paediatric care.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para25"></a>"What the report describes as 'the exceptional practice of van Velzen' between 1988 and 1995 made Alder Hey unique. But elsewhere in the NHS it is clear that organ retention without relatives' full knowledge and agreement was widespread. The recent national summit on organ retention organised by the Chief Medical Officer, Professor Liam Donaldson, confirmed that this was also the experience of parents in many other parts of the country.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para26"></a>"Professor Donaldson's census shows that 105,000 organs are retained across the country. Poor standards of cataloguing and record-keeping mean that these figures may not be wholly accurate. Twenty-five thousand hospitals account for 88 per cent of the organs. At least 16,500 of these organs and tissues have been retained in apparent contravention of the law because they came about as a result of coroners' post-mortems where the organs should not have been kept beyond the time needed to establish cause of death. As at Alder Hey and Bristol, the coroner's system across the country has proved ineffective in this respect. The current law and post-mortem consent forms are both ambiguous. They talk of taking tissues when in fact they often mean taking organs. They record 'lack of objection' rather than positive consent.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para27"></a>"In the last four years the Government have made an unprecedented effort to better protect patients. The changes we have already introduced and the reforms that are still to come enjoy widespread support among both patients and doctors. The NHS is full of good doctors, not bad ones. Our reforms are aimed at supporting them to become even better: a new statutory duty of quality on every NHS trust; independent inspection through the Commission for Health Improvement; annual appraisal of doctors linked to period revalidation; reform to self-regulation to make it faster, more open and more accountable.
<P>

<a name="column_575"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 575</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para28"></a>"Now we need to go further. The CMO census, the consultation we have had with parents and the medical profession and the reports from Bristol and Alder Hey have formed the basis for Professor Donaldson's recommendations for reform. I am accepting them in full. The major proposals are as follows.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para29"></a>"First, I am establishing a special commission under the chairmanship of Margot Brazier, Professor of Law at Manchester University, to oversee the return of organs and tissues from around the country to their families should they wish to have them. We have made sure that parents seeking more information today can obtain it by contacting the NHS Direct telephone helpline.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para30"></a>"Secondly, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary has set in train a review of the coroner's system so that we can learn the lessons of what went wrong at Alder Hey and elsewhere.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para31"></a>"Thirdly, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment will establish a review of the accountability and management arrangements between NHS trusts and universities where senior staff are employed on joint contracts.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para32"></a>"Fourthly, we will ensure that all NHS trusts provide support and advice to families at the time of bereavement. I expect this to be in place throughout the NHS later this year.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para33"></a>"Finally, the law will be changed to enshrine the concept of informed consent. The existing law in this area has become outdated. The 1961 Human Tissue Act does not even contain penalties for breaches of its provisions. The law has ill served bereaved parents in our country. It causes confusion for staff. It must now be changed.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para34"></a>"I will bring forward measures urgently to amend the Act to clarify that informed consent must be given, that organs and tissues must be specified and to make it a criminal offence to ignore informed consent. We will also undertake a wider review of existing laws on all aspects of taking, storing and using tissue and organs from both the living and the dead. When the review is completed we will seek to legislate to bring in the necessary changes.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para35"></a>"These changes in the law will be supported by a new statutory code of practice which will be issued to the NHS. It will cover the issue of organs being used by the pharmaceutical industry. The code of practice will be accompanied by a new standardised consent form which will be introduced throughout the NHS.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para36"></a>"There is one other important point. Informed consent need not be at the expense of medical research. Proper post-mortem procedures and archived tissues and organs hold the key to much medical advance--discovering the effects and causes of disease, finding cures for illnesses that disable or kill. But retaining public confidence in these procedures requires public consent. Members <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_576"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 576</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>of the medical profession share this view. Indeed, it is reflected in recent guidance issued by the Royal College of Pathologists. When I met families from Alder Hey, from Bristol and elsewhere, many told me that had they been asked properly, they would have been only too willing to allow their child's death to help another child live.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para37"></a>"Doctors and pathologists have an incredibly difficult job to do. They have usually acted with the best of intentions: to bring about greater understanding of disease and to improve standards of care--and to do so in a way that avoids causing further anguish to grieving families.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para38"></a>"These are laudable aims. They are honourable intentions. But as the events at Alder Hey have proven, modern patient expectations and traditional clinical practices have grown apart. The NHS can no longer assume that the benefits of science, medicine or research are somehow self-evident regardless of the wishes of patients or their families. The relationship between patients and the service today has to be based on informed consent. That will require changes in practice and changes in policy. It will require changes in medical education. As I have made clear today, it will also require changes to the law.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para39"></a>"The parents I have met from Alder Hey and elsewhere have acted with great dignity and purpose. I pay tribute to them today. I hope that the reforms we will now make will provide some comfort for the pain they have endured. I commend the reforms to the House".
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for repeating the Statement made in the other place. We on these Benches accept that this is a balanced Statement which accurately and broadly covers the issues raised by the inquiry, even though it does make for very harrowing reading. We further agree that the NHS is staffed primarily by good doctors, rather than the type of bad doctor exemplified in this Statement.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para41"></a>The situation at Alder Hey and elsewhere is troublesome. We on these Benches extend our deepest sympathy to the families involved. People will be rightly shocked by the revelations emanating from Alder Hey that the NHS has sold retained body parts without the knowledge and consent of parents or families. It is a disgraceful situation and one that rides roughshod over the dignity and respect that should be accorded to families in extremely distressing personal situations. However, we must keep the matter in perspective and resist the temptation to over-react.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para42"></a>There are two clear issues. The first concerns the activities of one specific professor who consistently lied and broke the law in an otherwise outstanding hospital. Perhaps I may ask the Minister whether Professor van Velzen is being investigated elsewhere, or indeed in another country. The second issue is a more general one--that of how to approach the <P>


<a name="column_577"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 577</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>retention and use of tissue and organs. The retention of certain body tissue is critical to medical research and must continue. Other patients can and do benefit from the use of otherwise discarded tissue. To ensure the continuance of medical research, we need adequate mechanisms for the giving of consent.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para43"></a>The Statement by the Secretary of State mentioned that the law will be changed to enshrine the principle of informed consent. We on these Benches have offered to incorporate that principle into the Health and Social Care Bill, currently being debated in the other place. From a personal point of view--and I can speak from the heart on this, as I have suffered the terrible tragedy of losing a very young baby--I would have been prepared to allow tissue to be used for medical purposes in order to help others, provided that the pros and cons were properly and sympathetically explained. However, that would require us to ensure that parents and families were informed by carefully trained staff, who will hold these discussions in what are certain to be very trying circumstances. The Statement mentioned that all NHS trusts will have in place support mechanisms for families at the time of bereavement. Will the Minister tell the House what those mechanisms will be, what guidelines will be put in place, and when?
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para44"></a>We feel that there is a need for the special commission under Professor Margot Brazier to be particularly sensitive when dealing with the return of organs. Some families undoubtedly will wish to have them returned. For others, that would simply reopen painful memories. We ask the Government to pay particular attention to this matter and to ensure that, if multiple organs are to be returned, they are returned at one and the same time, thus avoiding repeated suffering for the families involved.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para45"></a>In conclusion, we welcome the broad thrust of the Statement. It is vital that the Government act to respond to the real concerns raised by the Alder Hey inquiry.

<A NAME="10130-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, I, too, join the noble Lord, Lord Astor, in thanking the Minister for repeating the Statement made in another place. We on these Benches also very much welcome the Statement. It is a truly appalling story, which seems to illustrate practices of the 18th century taking place in the 20th and 21st centuries.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para46"></a>The Chief Medical Officer's report is, if anything, more shocking than the Redfern report, because it demonstrates that the culture is at fault. The findings in relation to Alder Hey are particularly shocking because of the activities of one man. However, the CMO's survey appears to indicate that the failure to obtain informed consent was part of the culture of organ retention in many hospitals. Alder Hey is not a completely isolated example of the culture. We therefore need a complete culture change in addition to any legislative change. The problem concerns not only the law but also the language.
<P>


<a name="column_578"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 578</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para47"></a>I was interested to note that in his Statement the Secretary of State illustrated that the word "tissue" is a euphemism. "Tissue" also covers organs. While welcoming the Secretary of State's commitment to changing the provisions of the Human Tissue Act 1961, we hope that any change to the law will explicitly make it clear for what informed consent is being obtained. That is absolutely vital.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para48"></a>Like the Secretary of State and the noble Lord, Lord Astor, we agree that research is important. In the wake of this extremely harrowing report and the CMO's findings, it is important that the Department of Health should carefully consider what steps can be taken to restore public confidence in scientific research. As we have heard, much of the Alder Hey research into heart surgery was extremely important for some of the children involved. I commend the Secretary of State's speech made yesterday to the King's Fund. The benefits of scientific or medical research are not self-evident, but we should not stifle the benefits of scientific inquiry. I do not believe that the public will recognise the benefit of scientific research unless it is clearly seen to be useful. It is therefore for the scientific and medical community to persuade the public of the benefit of that research; and they must be quite open about the nature of the research.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para49"></a>I greatly welcome the indication in the Statement that other steps are planned by the department. I welcome the setting up of the special commission to oversee the return of organs and tissue, and I add my voice to that of the noble Lord, Lord Astor, about the process by which that is to be done. It is quite unacceptable that Alder Hey parents had to hold several funerals for organs returned at different times. A review of the coroner system is well overdue. In view of the joint tenure of many doctors clinically active in hospitals and engaged in university research, accountability and management arrangements between NHS trusts and universities is also an extremely important issue. We welcome the proposal for a statutory code of practice governing the retention of organs. In view of the recent case revealed at Alder Hey, and only today at Great Ormond Street, it is important that the passing over of organs in return for an administration fee (or whatever euphemism may be used) should be covered by such a code.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para50"></a>I have a few questions for the future. The Statement makes it clear that Professor van Velzen will be pursued under the criminal law and by the GMC in relation to his professional practice. However, other clinicians are also involved. A Dr Bouton practised in the same hospital prior to Professor van Velzen. I have no doubt that clinicians in other hospitals have breached the Human Tissue Act and have, to say the least, been cavalier in their treatment of consent. I hope the Minister can assure us that hospital trusts will be encouraged to ensure that those doctors are brought before the GMC to have their records examined.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para51"></a>The requirement for legislative change is all very well, but the key issues concern monitoring, how consents are obtained and how storage is effected. It is extraordinary that the hospital authorities did not <P>


<a name="column_579"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 579</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>raise their eyebrows in relation to the practice of storing these organs. Can the Minister say what arrangements will be made to ensure that such practices are properly organised in future? What compensation will now be offered to some of the affected parents?
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para52"></a>Further, will the General Medical Council be drawing up guidelines to ensure that such issues are properly tackled from now on? In particular, what is to become of these collections? As can be observed from the CMO's report, we are talking about major collections. Can we start afresh with some of these issues? For example, even if such organs cannot be identified, do we need to keep such macabre collections of organs in hospitals and universities throughout the country?
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para53"></a>Finally, will the Polkinghorne code of 1989, which related to foetal material, now be revamped and incorporated in the guidance on tissues and organs? After all, one of the most scandalous issues relates precisely to foetuses at Alder Hey, which, in a sense--again, it is a use of language--might be excluded from examination if we were purely talking about individual organs.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para54"></a>I accept the statement made by the British Medical Association that it wants to work in partnership with patients in discussing acceptable ways in which organs are used for scientific and medical research. As a result of the appalling events at Alder Hey, and the unacceptable practices discovered in NHS hospitals and universities, I hope that we can use today to make a fresh start.

<A NAME="10130-06_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may begin by thanking both the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, and the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, for their measured response to the Statement. As the noble Lord, Lord Astor, said, the report comprises over 500 pages and makes harrowing reading. He is right: it was a disgraceful situation. Our sympathies are very much with all the parents involved.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para55"></a>I accept what the noble Lord, Lord Astor, said--indeed, this was mentioned in the Statement--that, overall, we have very dedicated doctors and other staff within the National Health Service. We need to reflect on that fact when considering the action that now needs to be taken. However, there is no doubt that there has been a significant cultural change in our society over the past 20 or 30 years. What may once have been acceptable practice is no longer so. I believe that many people working in the NHS have failed to realise that that change has taken place. If we are to see good coming out of this report, it will be by way of a change in the overall culture of the health service. We must also strive to make sure that it helps us to change our practices. In turn, that will ensure that the public, parents and relatives are fully aware of what is happening to their loved ones, so that when they are asked to give consent they will do so in the full knowledge of what they are being asked to do.

My understanding is that there has been an investigation by the Canadian police, but I have no knowledge of the outcome. As I said when repeating the Statement, the GMC has called a hearing for Friday of this week. In addition, the Redfern report has been referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para57"></a>I very much agree with the noble Lord, Lord Astor, who talked about the benefit of organ retention for research purposes. It is absolutely essential. However, as I said, it can be done only on the basis of informed consent and a proper process whereby parents and relatives can be properly counselled and advised. They must have a full understanding of what it is that they are being asked to do. If we can do that and change the culture of the NHS, I also believe that parents would, if they so wished, give their consent on that basis.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para58"></a>I took note of the offer from the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, of the Opposition's help in regard to legislation. No doubt that will have to be discussed in other places. I thank the noble Lord for his suggestion. I can tell him that we shall seek to introduce legislation as soon as possible. That is certainly so in relation to the Human Tissue Act 1961, the core issue of consent, and the issue of sanctions against doctors who do not carry out the provisions of that legislation. One of the problems with the Act at present is the fact that there are no sanctions. As well as the immediate issue of the Human Tissue Act, we shall need to look at legislation in the long term to ascertain whether the whole area of regulation in relation to organs needs to be tightened and considered afresh.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para59"></a>Both noble Lords referred to the position of families as regards the support to be given to them. In particular, they asked what arrangements will be put in place for counselling generally throughout the National Health Service. I can tell the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, that, in terms of compensation, it is up to individual families to decide whether they wish to take legal action. In that event, they would have to establish legal liability. I cannot comment any further in that respect.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para60"></a>I can tell noble Lords that we expect effective counselling and support to be available, both in relation to parents affected by what has happened at Alder Hey Hospital, and in relation to the many other hospitals throughout the NHS with retained organs which are likely to receive inquiries from parents regarding whether any of their children's organs have been retained.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para61"></a>We accept that bereavement advisers should be available in all trusts to explain and/or arrange full clinical explanation of the circumstances of death, the reasons for post-mortem examination and the need for consent to hospital post-mortem and retention of organs. In the interim guidance issued by the Chief Medical Officer in March 1999, we called for a designated person to fulfil that role. I have no doubt that the new commission on organ and tissue retention will follow that through, as will the department, to <P>


<a name="column_581"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 581</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>ensure that that happens. In addition to overseeing the return of tissues and organs from collections around the country, it is worth pointing out that the role of the organ retention commission will be to ensure that suitable counselling is available for families. More importantly, it will act as an advocate for parents if problems arise. Given the sensitive nature of this issue, parents need someone to turn to for help and advice. Above all, while acting as an advocate for parents and handling inquiries from families and the public, the special health authority will have a crucial role to play in that process.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para62"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, referred to the culture change needed in the NHS. I agree with him and, indeed, have already spoken on that issue. The noble Lord asked how that would be effected. The outcome of the Alder Hey report and the census by the Chief Medical Officer, together with his recommendations, will be very powerful accelerators to that culture change. But the code of practice that will be issued, the change in the law and, I believe, the work of the newly established commission will all have a part to play in that development. I certainly accept the point that the noble Lord made; namely, that we also need effective performance management within the NHS to ensure that that change takes place. In that way we shall restore public confidence.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para63"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, is also right to say that we need to do more in the area of public education in terms of research--and not just as a result of what has happened at Alder Hey. More generally, we must encourage greater public confidence in what we seek to do by way of research. Again, the report of the Chief Medical Officer touches on that point.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para64"></a>The noble Lord also referred to the issue of university/trust relationships. One of the most important points in the Redfern report is that Professor van Velzen was not dealt with effectively, despite the fact that poor practices were known about, because of the difficult relationship between the university and the trust concerned. We therefore asked the DfEE to review the issues that arise in relation, in particular, to doctors who have joint contracts with a university and a trust, and it agreed to take the lead in that process. I hope that that review will also examine some wider issues. At the end of the day, we need good, robust relationships between universities and university trusts with regard to teaching, research and further education.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para65"></a>As to disciplinary action, I confirm to the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, that we have indeed referred several of the doctors who are mentioned in the report to the General Medical Council. We have also referred two medical laboratory scientists to the Council for Professions Supplementary to Medicine. Several other people who are named in the report have been referred to their employer's authorities for the consideration of disciplinary action.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para66"></a>We have identified a problem with NHS mangers who move from one trust to another and for whom there is currently no professional regulation. We shall institute discussions with the NHS Confederation, the <P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para67"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, that we need to consider the future of collections that are put together by universities and hospitals. We look to the commission on organ and tissue retention to advise us on that matter.

<A NAME="10130-06_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Alton of Liverpool: </B>   My Lords, for two years from 1990 my then two-year-old daughter was operated on and treated at Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool. I put on record my admiration for and gratitude to the staff--the nurses and doctors--for the extraordinary love, care and professionalism they showed during that period. I do not believe that I am alone in saying that; I do so on behalf of the many parents whose children have been treated there over the years. We have watched this unfolding scandal become a tragedy for that fine hospital. It is a tragedy that the actions of predominantly one man have brought the hospital into such disrepute. His actions destroyed the reputation of a fine hospital and caused immense grief to parents who had already suffered the pain of bereavement.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para68"></a>I want to put four brief points to the Minister whose Statement to the House this afternoon I welcome. The first concerns the legislative changes that he announced today. Will the Government make it a criminal offence to possess and use any or all human material without consent? Secondly, will he reiterate the importance of the family and its protection, especially at times of sorrow and bereavement?
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para69"></a>Thirdly, I turn to the desirability that the Minister and others rightly expressed about the use of organs in circumstances in which consent has been gained. Does he agree that even when written consent was obtained at Alder Hey Hospital, in most if not all cases the retention of tissues and organs was not fully and properly explained? Parents were not told what material would be retained; in particular, as the Minister said, they were not told that whole organs would be kept by the hospital. The word "tissue" was not explained, so that even those who read the consent form would not know that "tissue" could comprise major organs. Parents were not told how retained material would be used or for how long it would be retained.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-06_para70"></a>Finally, following the revelation of the sale of glands of living children, which has already been referred to, will the Minister review the way in which commercial arrangements are entered into and the possibility that such considerations have been allowed to overshadow the high sense of idealism, ethics and humanity that should characterise the medical profession?

<P>
<A NAME="10130-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Alton, for making those important points. Yes, the problems at Alder Hey Hospital are very much focused on one man. Although the system <P>


<a name="column_583"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 583</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>clearly had several failings, which added to the awful impact of what Professor van Velzen did, there is no doubting the fact that he is, by a very long way, the most culpable person in this sorry affair.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-07_para0"></a>I agree with the noble Lord that Alder Hey Hospital has for many years had a wonderful reputation, not just in this country but throughout the world. Although it is suffering at the moment from enormous criticism and adverse publicity, I still say that its work is first class. It is important for people who work in the hospital to have confidence in it and to believe that it is a fine hospital, as should people from Liverpool and others who come to it from all over the country because it is of such repute and quality. The appointment of a new chair today allows a fresh start to be made. The hospital's reputation must be treasured and supported, and improved in future.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-07_para1"></a>In response to the various questions that the noble Lord asked, the answer is, I think, yes to all of them. We want to ensure that, with regard to legislative changes, a criminal offence will apply to those who break the law. As I explained, the current problem, apart from the obscurity of the Human Tissue Act 1961, is that there are no sanctions against a doctor who breaks the law.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-07_para2"></a>I agree with the noble Lord's comments on the family. The report of the Chief Medical Officer is strong in that regard. If there is to be proper and informed consent, parents and relatives need fully to understand what has happened to their loved ones--they should be told in as sympathetic and supportive a way as possible--why a post-mortem is necessary, and why it may be helpful if certain organs or tissues are retained to help with research and education. If we can do that properly, I am convinced that many parents will give their consent.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-07_para3"></a>The noble Lord was absolutely right to say that that approach was not adopted at Alder Hey Hospital. Even when parents signed a consent form, they did not know what they were signing. The word "tissue" does not convey to many people the concept of an organ of the body. Indeed, until I became involved in this issue, I thought that "tissue" meant a bit of skin and that it could not refer to the heart or another organ of the body. Parents did not understand what they were signing. In addition, it is clear that parents were asked to sign a form without any explanation. That is the key lesson that we need to learn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that one of the great triumphs in the field of public health in this country in the 20th century was the massive drop in infant and child mortality rates? The earlier higher rate was caused by disease and defects. The horrific report and the work carried out at Alder Hey Hospital and Great Ormond Street Hospital have to be seen against that background.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-07_para4"></a>I return to the question that my noble friend asked about culture. The general public are concerned not so much about one doctor as about the desensitising of medicine, especially among senior researchers. What <P>


<a name="column_584"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 584</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>plans does the Minister have to ensure that what the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of St Albans referred to as the proper respect for human dignity is part of the culture of medical and nursing training? That is an important part of putting right the problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-07_para5"></a>The Minister referred to the fact that a number of firmer codes of practice are being put in place. However, the medical profession is notoriously hierarchical. Can the noble Lord assure the House that within the health service protection exists for whistle-blowers? That protection is also a guarantee against mavericks who try to ignore codes of practice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for raising those points. I accept the point that he made about the importance of research. Indeed, in the Statement I referred to the enormous impact which the research at Alder Hey Hospital has had on the saving of many lives. We need to reflect on that.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-07_para6"></a>However, the extraordinary and disturbing point about the Redfern report is that, although the practice during the van Velzen years was to retain organs from every child after a post-mortem, virtually no research of any value was carried out during that period. Therefore, parents and relatives did not even have the comfort of believing that at least the organ retention served some purpose. That is a stark and disturbing fact.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-07_para7"></a>The noble Lord then went on to ask how we change the culture and ensure that the code of practice and other initiatives are ingrained in the National Health Service. I am convinced that the medical profession wishes the culture to change. I believe that the Alder Hey case and, indeed, a number of other disturbing cases which have taken place over the past two or three years have come as a profound shock to the profession. From meetings which I have held locally and with the leaders of the profession, I am convinced that the great mass of doctors recognise that they must change. Equally, I recognise that procedures and processes must be put in place to encourage that to happen, and I believe that change will occur in a number of ways.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-07_para8"></a>First, the code of practice will need to be implemented in full by every NHS trust in the country. We shall use our power of direction to ensure that that is the case. That will be backed up by the clinical governance process which will ensure that, just as in the past the boards of trusts have been concerned with financial issues, they must now ascertain corporately that the proper procedures are in place so that clinical decisions are carried out in a framework which ensures effective governance. That process has not been in place before and it is already beginning to bite. Already doctors are approaching trust boards to say that current practices in certain hospitals must change because they are no longer acceptable in safety terms.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-07_para9"></a>In addition, through the new assessment centres which we are setting up, I believe that we have developed a much more robust way of dealing with poorly performing doctors. In the past, culturally the health service has had great difficulty in tackling <P>


<a name="column_585"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 585</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>poorly performing doctors. The new mechanisms that we have established enable us to deal with such a situation in a less confrontational way than in the past and at an earlier stage so that problems can be nipped in the bud. Taking all that into account, I am confident that we can effect the type of change the noble Lord asks for.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, the Statement and the report sound more like a Frankenstein novel than an actual situation. Our sympathy must go out to the parents who are suffering gravely as a result of the actions at Alder Hey Hospital and elsewhere.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-07_para10"></a>I very much welcome the Government's Statement and the actions that they are to take. Although I understand that they have received criticism, I also welcome some of the statements made by the Secretary of State, particularly in relation to his desire that patients should be treated with respect and consideration. I believe that he is on to a very good point. All too often in the National Health Service patients are treated as supplicants rather than paying patients who, on average, pay £40 per week per family for that service.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-07_para11"></a>We have heard of many scandals in the health service. I have been involved in one or two cases which have occurred, for example, in mixed-sex wards. Such incidents horrify people in all parts of the country. I welcome the new approach of the Secretary of State towards not only this but other matters, too. I hope that my noble friend can assure me that this inquiry will not simply be a flash in the pan but an ongoing examination of how people are treated in the National Health Service and whether they are treated as individuals and not as a mass. I hope that my noble friend will be able to give me that assurance.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for raising those apposite points. I believe that circumstances have arisen in which patients and members of the public have not been shown the proper respect and consideration which are due. My noble friend mentioned mixed-sex wards. I know how much concern that matter has brought to patients--particularly older patients. He will know that we are determined to phase out mixed-sex wards. We have made considerable progress but there is more to do.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-07_para12"></a>I also believe that the National Service Framework for Older People will reflect many of the points that my noble friend has raised. After all, older people are the biggest users of the National Health Service, and it is they who sometimes find that they do not receive the respect and consideration that they deserve. I know that your Lordships have raised the issue of mixed-sex wards and the question of how people should be addressed when they are in hospital. The assumption that people always want to be called by their first name is not necessarily correct. We need to respect how people wish to be treated and addressed.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-07_para13"></a>My noble friend also raised a fundamental question which goes to the heart of the culture and philosophy under which people in the National Health Service work--how the service is led and how people are <P>


<a name="column_586"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 586</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>trained. I believe that we have a massive job to do in turning around that situation. I agree with my noble friend that it cannot be dealt with in a flash-in-the-pan manner. We must ingrain it within everything that we do. I believe that some of the changes announced in the National Plan will be important in that regard--for example, the appointment of modern matrons with more authority at ward level, and changes in the curriculum which affect nurses in particular.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-07_para14"></a>Many mistakes were made in Project 2000. Training was taken away too far from wards and into universities. I am sure that it was right to link training to academic ability and to ensure that universities were involved in the training process, but not at the expense of practical skills and work. I, for one, regret what happened to enrolled nurses. I believe that through phasing them out we lost a huge raft of people who knew how to talk to and treat people with respect.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-07_para15"></a>I turn to the question raised by the noble Lord in relation to whistle-blowing. We issue guidance and advice to all NHS organisations on that matter in line with the requirements of the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998. We also encourage staff to raise concerns about standards of patient care.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-08_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness O'Neill of Bengarve: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for all that he said about the intention to make respect for persons and informed consent by patients and families central in this area. I first became aware of the legal vacuum some six years ago when, as a member of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, I worked on our report on the medical and scientific uses of human tissues; tissues being by us well understood to be diverse in their significance and sometimes to include organs.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-08_para0"></a>We were, curiously, least aware of how difficult things might be in the case of tissues removed under coroner's authority. Can the Minister reassure the House that in reviewing the matter, account will be taken of the two other contexts in which tissues are removed and retained for a range of purposes? I refer first to the process of treatment where tissues may be removed for the benefit of patients but may be retained for pathological examination to the benefit of that patient, other patients, medical education, medical audit and, indeed, research. The other context--here, I believe consents are generally much better--is in the case of human subjects of research where a greater degree of understanding of the particular research project has been required. In all of this one has to see that pathologists deal with a large range of tissues procured in different circumstances and for a large range of purposes. It would be a pity to lose the opportunity by looking too closely at the specific events that have caused these particularly sad and appalling outcomes.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-08_para1"></a>I have one further point. Perhaps I may ask the Minister whether particular care will be taken in the review to consider the question of the financial transactions that may or may not be involved. I am sure that I am not alone in noticing the "scare quotes" around the word "sell" in virtually all the newspaper reports. People are not sure whether things are being <P>


<a name="column_587"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 587</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sold to someone's benefit or whether all that is going on is a handling charge. I believe that steps have already been taken in the case of blood--that, too, is tissue--to clarify these issues. I hope that we shall see them clarified with respect to other tissues. I hope also that we shall take account of the strong differences in practice in different parts of the world; the fact that this is much closer to being a commercial culture in the United States, and that in some parts of the world there is no regulation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, we are considering the legislation in two phases. We want to deal immediately with the issue of consent and sanctions as regards the Human Tissue Act. Equally, I accept the point raised by the noble Baroness. We need to look at a number of wider questions, which may require legislative change. I can assure the noble Baroness--indeed, I should be interested if she wanted to talk to the department--that we shall also consider those wider issues.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-08_para2"></a>As regards the commercial uses of tissue, thymuses were collected at Alder Hey between 1991 and 1993. I understand that an annual handling fee was paid by the company to hospitals collecting thymus fragments. We understand that a number of hospitals had similar practices up until 1995. There is clearly an issue of consent, which appears not to have been sought in those cases. However, I can assure the noble Baroness that the code of practice--which, as I stated, will have the backing of statutory direction to NHS organisations--will also lay down that explicit consent must be obtained before tissue can be provided for use in products, product development or research by commercial companies.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-08_para4"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10130-08_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: The first and most obvious point made by the amendment is that expertise in all the various fields covered by the Bill, as well as much more widely, is acquired by both training and experience. It seems to me that the wider word "skill" would reflect that fact. It would make the authority and everybody else conscious of the fact that they are not thinking just in terms of training but of the skills acquired by the individual.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-08_para6"></a>This clause is separate from those which deal with licensing. It gives the authority the function of setting and approving standards of conduct for adoption by the people involved. The authority can make other requirements under the criteria for issuing a licence. The fact that its only concern here is training does not necessarily mean that the criteria for a licence might not include an element of experience or probationary conduct.
<P>


<a name="column_588"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 588</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-08_para7"></a>A number of British standards in this area will no doubt assist the authority when it comes to carry out its functions under this subsection. Some are set out in the White Paper. As they stand, they are not onerous. I refer, for example, to two days' initial training. Nevertheless, they have been set out and agreed. Since the British standards listed in the White Paper, BS7960 of 1999 takes the matter further.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-08_para8"></a>I realise that the authority will not have legal permission to run training courses. That is not provided for in the Bill; quite rightly. I do not believe that that is its function. I am unclear as to whether approving the standards of training in the way suggested will give the authority permission to run examinations, for example, and whether the Government envisage that happening. A large number of training courses are already organised in the industry, notably by the Security Industry Training Organisation, which is a joint body set up by the industry. That organisation, and others, are capable of running the training, so I do not think the authority needs to do that. Whether it should consider examinations is a different question. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   Amendment No. 4 would mean that the security industry authority was required to set and approve standards of skill instead of standards of training. The Government agree that it is important for the security industry authority to have the ability to incorporate references to skills into the standards which it sets. We believe, however, that subsection (2) as drafted already allows the authority to achieve that. The subsection also requires the authority to set standards of conduct, training and levels of supervision. The provision would therefore allow the authority to incorporate relevant skill levels into the standards it sets for conduct and training. It already achieves the objective of the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-08_para9"></a>In addition, I believe that it is widely acknowledged that the private security industry is acutely aware of the importance of training and attaches considerable importance to the authority being proactive in setting standards in that area. We believe that to delete the word "training" from the statement of the authority's functions would be undesirable. It would shift the area of responsibility, which we do not think would be wise.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-08_para10"></a>As we envisage the SIA, it will not run examinations itself. However, we do recognise that there is a need to consider how examinations might contribute to its standard setting and delivering role. The authority will have an interest in this aspect, but will not run it. The examinations will be set and run by others. The authority may well monitor this and report on it, and obviously it will have a carefully thought-through role in the examination process.

Both are about the power of the authority to borrow money. The Bill provides in paragraph 14 of Schedule 1 that the authority can borrow money with the permission of the Secretary of State. The amendment suggests that it should not be able to borrow at all. It is a probing amendment. I do not intend that it should never be allowed to borrow in any circumstances, but I should like to know how borrowing by the authority will be dealt with in the Home Office's accounts, particularly now that we are on resource accounting. Will it show up as government borrowing? I suspect that it will not, and that is because permission of the Treasury is not required. Generally speaking, in matters of borrowing or expenditure the Treasury is careful to make sure that this is written into every Bill. As far as I can see, permission of the Treasury is not going to be specifically required although it may have have sufficient control over the Secretary of State for Home Affairs to deal with it.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-08_para15"></a>I hope that the authority will not be borrowing large sums of money, although it may not be able to function entirely without borrowing. Any well conducted business should certainly consider doing that and indeed may have to borrow considerable amounts. I do not see why the authority should be different in that respect. However, because it is a public institution dealing with public money, it should obviously be carefully supervised in this respect.

<A NAME="10130-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving me the opportunity to explain lines of accountability. The SIA will be established as a self-financing non-departmental public body. The bulk of its income will be derived from fees charged for individual licence applications and inspections under the approved contractor scheme and will be used to fund these processes. However, we believe there is a case--I think the noble Lord accepts this--for the authority to have limited ability to borrow money. I emphasise the word "limited". This would allow it some flexibility in conducting its business. It is not an open-ended guarantee. Any wish to borrow money will require the consent of the Secretary of State. So there will be parliamentary accountability and he will expect to see a proper business case made out.

<A NAME = "10130-09_para0"></a>The authority will also be subject to external controls. It will be required to keep proper accounts and to prepare a statement of those accounts annually. These will be laid before Parliament and will also be subject to audit by the auditor general. So although we understand the nature of the amendment, we think it would unnecessarily constrain the operation of the authority--a point which I believe the noble Lord accepts. I urge him to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   Will any borrowing show up as government borrowing in the main government accounts?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I am sure that this body, as a non-departmental public body, will operate like all other such bodies. Borrowing by the SIA will be reported within the accounts; it will be necessary for the Secretary of State to approve it, and he will consult with Cabinet colleagues as appropriate. This would allow an opportunity for the Treasury to give its view. Borrowings would therefore be clearly shown in Home Office accounts and properly fed through to Parliament and there would be all the other checks and balances which operate throughout Whitehall.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for putting that on the record. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "10130-09_para2"></a>Clause 1 agreed to.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-09_para3"></a>Clause 2 [Directions etc. by the Secretary of State]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-09_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Astor </B>   moved Amendment No. 6:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 2, line 23, at end insert--
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-09_para4"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
("( ) The Secretary of State shall lay a copy of any such direction before each House of Parliament.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "10130-09_para5"></a>The noble Viscount said: This amendment relates to directions given by the Secretary of State. The Explanatory Notes say clearly that the authority must comply with directions given to it by the Secretary of State and must provide any information requested by him. Also, the Secretary of State must consult the authority before giving any directions.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-09_para6"></a>My first question is a general one. I should like to ask the Minister what kind of directions the Secretary of State might give. What area might be covered that is not in the Bill and cannot be done by either an order under Schedule 2 or in some other way? Can it relate to costs, for example--either the annual running costs of the authority or indeed the costs or charges that the authority might impose on the industry? The Minister will realise that there are many order-making powers within the Bill, giving the Secretary of State the chance to do lots of things in Clause 2 and Clause 3(3) about designated activities. What kind of things have the Government in mind under these rather broad and sweeping powers?
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-09_para7"></a>Also, it is not guidance; it is a direction. The Bill says that the authority will comply with any general or specific directions. What is the difference between a general direction and a specific one? Presumably any <P>


<a name="column_591"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 591</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>direction would have to be specific if the authority was to comply with it. I do not understand the meaning of the phrase "general direction". Surely, the general directions are largely contained in Clauses 1 to 3. Indeed, if it is a specific direction, will it not be included in the general powers in Schedule 2?
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-09_para8"></a>My last question is: how will the Secretary of State give these directions? Will they be laid before Parliament, enabling Parliament to see the nature of the extraordinarily wide power that the Home Secretary is giving himself in relation to the authority? These are important questions and I beg to move.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-09_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   There will probably be a wider variety of possibilities, from requesting special reports about incidents of concern to the addition of reports if need be. I believe that the standard arrangement is for the Secretary of State to be able to give directions to non-departmental public bodies. If necessary, that could include the placing of a cap on fees. Therefore, they are general reserve powers. I understand that they will be subject to the usual statutory instruments procedure.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-09_para9"></a>I hope that that reply is helpful to the noble Viscount. I do not believe that the consideration is as sinister as he suggested. We believe that it is a helpful way of assisting the Secretary of State to conduct business flexibly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-09_spnew6"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   Before my noble friend responds, will the Minister explain the position a little further? He said that directions would comply with the normal statutory instrument procedure but I wonder whether he is sure about that. If so, would they be affirmative or negative instruments?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-09_spnew7"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   In giving the Minister time to consider his answer perhaps I may turn to Clause 22, which defines orders and regulations and their use. I have studied the clause with some care. I may have missed something, but I cannot find anything relating to the directions which may be given out by the Secretary of State under Clause 2. Therefore, I do not believe that the directions are given by any form of statutory instrument, whether negative or affirmative. It is important that we have a clear answer from the Minister on this.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-09_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   On this occasion, the noble Viscount is right and I am wrong. I apologise to the Committee for that. Directions are not statutory instruments; they are merely a mechanism for a more informal way of establishing priorities and registering concerns. I hope that that clarifies the matter and I apologise to the Committee for having misled it earlier.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-09_spnew9"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for that correction. Will the directions be published?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-09_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   If the noble Viscount will bear with me, no doubt I shall be able to give him an <P>


<a name="column_592"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 592</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>answer. I would hope that such directions would be a matter of public record because they would be helpful to all concerned. It is important that we are clear about what we are trying to do with orders and directions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-09_spnew11"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I rise in anticipation of the Minister's reply. We should be extremely unhappy if the directions were not a matter of public record and all those licensed and involved in the industry were not clearly able to see directions made by the Secretary of State.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-09_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   There is no absolute obligation to make them public. However, having heard what the noble Viscount said, I am prepared to reflect on the matter. In some situations, there may be an advantage in clearer communication and there may be benefit in that communication being in the public domain. I shall reflect on the point and happily write to the noble Viscount.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-09_spnew13"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   Will the Minister also agree that there could be circumstances in which the authority would want to see publication of the directions? It could then make clear to those being regulated why it had taken a certain action.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-09_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   As always, the noble Viscount makes a sensible and telling point and I shall reflect on it. He is probably right.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-09_spnew15"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   The Minister's final words in reply to my question went to the heart of my amendment. It is important that the Home Secretary cannot impose secret directions on the authority, leaving those licensed or affected by the authority unaware of them.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-09_para10"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for saying that he will reflect on the matter because if he had not done so I should have been forced to take it further and test the opinion of the Committee. However, I am grateful for the Minister's constructive attitude and I shall return to the matter on Report. By then the Minister will have had an opportunity to reflect on what has been said. It is important, not only in safeguarding the industry but also the authority and the role of the Secretary of State in giving such directions. I am sure that the Minister believes in open government. We must try to make these provisions as open and clear as possible. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="10130-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford </B>   moved Amendment No. 11A:

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "10130-10_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 11A, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 52A. They have only one thing in common; they deal with issues in respect of which the Government have completely reversed their thinking.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-10_para2"></a>As regards Amendment No. 11A, the Government stated in their White Paper that the provisions of the Bill are to include in-house directly employed security personnel. They added that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Government believes that to exclude in-house security personnel from the scope of licensing would create an unacceptable loophole and reduce confidence in the system".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-10_para3"></a>
I took up that matter during the Second Reading debate. In reply, the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, stated that the Government had changed their thinking since publication of the White Paper, further stating:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In-house guards are vetted by employers and we see no need to add a further layer of bureaucracy".--[Official Report, 18/1/01; col. 600.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-10_para4"></a>
Therefore, the reason for changing from an unacceptable loophole reducing confidence in the system to the Government's present position was simply because employers vet their employees.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-10_para5"></a>That misses the point entirely. The whole purpose of the Bill is to ensure that those who engage in security work are properly vetted and trained and have the necessary skills and ability to deal with the public which will enable them to carry out their tasks properly.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-10_para6"></a>If people are simply vetted and then engaged by an employer, who may or may not know anything about the provisions of this Bill or check the skills and training of those individuals, almost certainly a loophole will be created. Through that loophole can creep undesirable people. Firms will believe that they have engaged individuals who can carry out the functions of security guards but they will be deceived. In the end, what is achieved is a two-tier system whereby those who are employed by security firms are properly trained and have the necessary skills, and those who manage to creep into jobs with employers are not. I agree with the Government's original view that that is unacceptable and look forward to hearing the Minister's response.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-10_para7"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 52A which deals with installers and so on. In paragraph 5.12 of the White Paper the Government state:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The lower end of the domestic market does not tend to be covered by these arrangements and although reputable companies do exist it is likely to be those that are most vulnerable who will be most at risk from unscrupulous operators".

<a name="column_594"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 594</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
The White Paper goes on to make the very good point that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Those who install or maintain alarms and CCTV systems have a unique opportunity to gain inside knowledge of the systems which could be used to facilitate or commit crimes".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-10_para9"></a>
I also raised that matter at Second Reading on the 18th December, and at col. 600 the Minister responded:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"[The Government] take the view that that sector is already well regulated. It already has to meet high police and insurance standards and purposes. Also, it consists of many small businesses".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-10_para10"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10130-10_para11"></a>I cannot over-emphasise the current role of CCTV systems in dealing with crime. They have a central role in dealing with major criminal activity in this country. For much of the evidence adduced in court the role of CCTV is crucial in relation not merely to burglaries and break-ins but to violent scenes and so on. If a criminal gang infiltrates a CCTV managing system so that it controls what pictures are taken, retained and so on, big criminals, not small ones, will have an important opportunity to commit serious crime. As the White Paper originally suggested, I believe it is sensible that unscrupulous operators should be kept out of this field entirely. Those who are unlicensed and without the necessary skills, training, vetting and so on provided for by the Bill should not be allowed to offer their services to the general public. I look forward again to hearing the Minister's response. I beg to move.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-10_time0"></A><H5>5.15 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   I absolutely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, that the Government have made an about-turn between the publication of the White Paper and the introduction of the Bill. However, unlike the noble Lord I believe that the Government are right to do so. Within the industry many large firms, trade associations and so on are keen that in this field both in-house operatives and those who fit alarms and deal with CCTV should be covered by the licensing system. The Bill, however, provides that only in-house door supervisors and wheelclampers, if a release fee is required, should be included, not those concerned with either alarms or CCTV.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-10_para12"></a>I refer first to other in-house guards. One of the matters to be considered is what I term the "receptionist problem". Almost every business, professional firm or doctor's surgery has a receptionist of some kind at the front door who deals with visitors. From time to time, the receptionist, commissionaire or whoever it is, may have to deal with someone whose presence in the building is not welcome and fulfil guard-type duties. That may involve sending for others to assist in the process. We have heard a good deal recently about violence in hospitals, but it also occurs in health centres and doctors' premises. One of the difficulties is where one draws the line in relation to a person in that position who provides an element of guarding. That will vary from one doctor's practice to another. Some practices will be in inner-city areas where there are drug problems to which they will be much more susceptible. An individual who does that <P>


<a name="column_595"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 595</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>job will spend much more time engaged in that kind of activity, whereas in another area no such trouble may arise from one year's end to the next.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-10_para13"></a>Where does one draw the line between the two? However, there must be a clear line because a licence is required. A person can be fined or sent to prison if he does not have a licence. The public and individuals are entitled to know whether or not a licence is required. Therefore, there is great difficulty in definition. In any case, I am temperamentally against regulation unless it is absolutely necessary. An enormous amount of legislation already affects firms of all sizes and to extend it further is something of which we should be very leery. I made that point at Second Reading and shall not labour it.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-10_para14"></a>I do not believe that there is much difference between alarm companies and locksmiths. In each case someone comes to one's house or business premises and fits the necessary equipment, whether it be an alarm or lock of some kind, and leaves knowing the security precautions that have been taken. To a degree one needs to trust that those people will not misuse the information that they have gained. One can extend that to others who are not locksmiths but fit items that are to do with the security of premises. They may do the job incorrectly or pass on information. There is also a problem as to where one draws the line.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-10_para15"></a>The position in relation to CCTV is a little clearer. We all know what we mean by it. However, I am not in favour of including something unless it is absolutely necessary. A firm or individual who hires a specialist organisation needs to be able to rely on the fact that it is up to the job and has proper standards. The Bill will provide that safeguard statutorily as opposed to the voluntary standards that apply now. I am not in favour of extending it further than is needed. Therefore, on this particular matter I prefer the Bill as drafted.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lane of Horsell: </B>   I declare an interest as a director of Reliance Security. Conceptually, I am very much in favour of the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, but I believe that this is a matter of definition. If a suitable form of definition can be found to cover in-house security men--I slightly question whether it can--it should be explored very carefully.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, for tabling these amendments. It gives the Government the opportunity to explain why we have taken a different view, although some of these arguments were rehearsed at Second Reading. As the noble Lord said, in our White Paper we propose to regulate the whole of the manned guarding sector, including in-house staff.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-10_para16"></a>However, we are a government who listen. We gave the matter further consideration. We concluded that to require all in-house staff to undergo what would effectively be two vetting processes by the employer and by the authority would add a largely unnecessary layer of bureaucracy on to business. Having heard <P>


<a name="column_596"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 596</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>comments today in your Lordships' House, it is plain that there is a fair measure of support for not going along that route.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-10_para17"></a>In general, we believe that we can rely on companies satisfying themselves about the probity of their own, or potential, employees. However, it is also the case that the Bill seeks to regulate some in-house staff. Door supervisors and wheelclampers are sources of particular public concern. These operatives are in a different category. Door supervisors are in a position of authority, often with young people, and wheelclampers are in a position of considerable power over the owner of the vehicles they have immobilised and which only they can release. We therefore believe it is right to extend regulation to all those working in these sectors, the in-house employees as well as those supplying services under contract.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-10_para18"></a>The noble Lord asked, why exclude the locksmiths and the alarm installers? He rightly said that in the White Paper we suggested they would be subject to regulation. We recognise that these industries wish to be included in our regulatory proposals. But we have decided not to include them for a number of reasons: first, there is no evident high level of criminality in either of these sectors. That is a widely accepted point.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-10_para19"></a>Secondly, and this touches on what the noble Lord, Lord Cope, said, self-regulation has worked particularly well in the alarm installation sector due to the influence of the insurance industry and the police; for example, the police will not guarantee an immediate response to an alarm unless it has been fitted by a company approved by an ACPO recognised inspectorate. That makes a big difference.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-10_para20"></a>Thirdly, there is a significant number of small businesses in this sector. We are conscious of the regulatory burden this might place on them and of the barrier to them expanding and developing their business.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-10_para21"></a>Fourthly, the main focus of the Bill relates to those sectors of the industry where there is the biggest problem, particularly door supervisors and wheelclampers. Could the locksmiths and alarm installers be included later? We have established a flexible framework within which Parliament can include or exclude particular sectors of the industry according to perceived need.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-10_para22"></a>We would prefer to get the SIA, the authority, up and running with the significant body of work the Bill already gives it and then make an assessment as to whether other categories, such as locksmiths and alarm installers, might be a priority for legislation. We are prepared to look at these matters at a later stage. We do not think that at this stage they are a priority. Therefore, we do not believe that they should be brought into the remit of the Bill. It is about getting the balance of regulation right. The Government do not want excessive regulation or to overly burden business. We believe that we have the balance right in this case.

<P>
<A NAME="10130-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   Perhaps I may ask a question which has arisen from what the Minister has just said. An in-house security person on licensed premises need <P>


<a name="column_597"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 597</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not be licensed unless he is the door supervisor. From what the Minister said, he becomes a door supervisor if he steps outside the premises. I am not sure if we have understood the Minister correctly, but can the definition of a door supervisor depend in any circumstances on whether he is inside or outside the premises? If so, is that what determines whether he is subject to the additional controls?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I am not entirely certain that I have the matter right, but I suspect that one is a door supervisor if one undertakes specific functions and activities. Door supervisors work at licensed premises. They are fairly carefully described in the Bill. We need to rely on the Bill's definition. If further clarification is needed, I am happy to try to provide it at a later stage. But it very much relates to what they are licensed to do rather than necessarily where they are undertaking the activity.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-11_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I should like to ask the Minister a question. I declared my interest in the bars business in London at Second Reading. As far as I understand the matter, in-house security personnel who remain in-house looking after the security of the premises are not covered by the licence. But someone supervising the door, out on the street, is covered and has to be a licensed person. But if there is a fracas on the street and someone who is an in-house person steps out into the street and, say, gives them a hand, is he not allowed to do that because he is not licensed for it? I am sure the noble Lord has seen door supervisors in his trawl of the pubs and clubs. Most of them stand on the pavement with a rope, sometimes looking friendly and sometimes looking menacing, saying, "You can come in and he cannot". Do they need to be on the street? What happens to door supervisors who are inside? Are they covered by the Bill? If they are employed by, for example, the club they are in, are they in effect in-house if they are inside? Where is the demarcation line?

<A NAME="10130-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   We could get into some frightfully complex discussions as to whether, when and how one becomes a door supervisor and someone controlling entry. By the nature of the business, their duties are at the licensed premises. I shall go away and seek further clarification as to in what circumstances they become responsible for particular actions. But they have to be licensed. They have to be licensed for a specific purpose. It is that licence that enables them to carry out particular functions and work. That is how I understand the matter. I am happy further to pursue the detailed points that the noble Lord wishes me to. I shall provide him with further detail on that matter perhaps between now and Report stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-11_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   One of the problems that seems to have arisen is whether there should be door supervisors at the door and a second row inside who are under no control, have no training, skill or whatever and who have not been vetted for violence at all, who simply parcel up a person who attends one of the noble Viscount's establishments and hands him to the door supervisor to throw down the stairs. I do not <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>think that we should leave these definitions up in the air. When one looks at the paragraph it says "Door supervisors etc". It does not say what "etc" is at paragraph 8 of Schedule 2. As the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, said, the matter should be clarified considerably.

<P>
<A NAME="10130-11_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I am sorry to interrupt the noble Lord. I should hate for someone to have the impression that any person coming to the bars with which I am involved is ever thrown down the stairs. If someone is asked to leave, that person is escorted to the door with great care and respect. We do not operate in Wales, and I have no idea what happens to people who get into trouble there.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-11_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I have no personal experience of the noble Viscount's door supervisors or of being escorted to the door at his bars or in Wales.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-11_para0"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, for his considered response. He referred to the flexibility of the Bill in bringing in other people. The noble Lord, Lord Cope, referred to the position of a receptionist as opposed to a hospital guard. Reference has also been made to the need for definition. Paragraph (2)(5) of Schedule 2, which deals with manned guarding, states that the licensable conduct,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"does not apply to the activities of a person who, incidentally to the carrying out of any activities in relation to a group of individuals which ... are neither ... the activities of a security operative, nor ... activities comprising the exercise of any such control as is mentioned in sub-paragraph (4), maintains order or discipline amongst those individuals".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-11_para1"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10130-11_para2"></a>The concept of someone doing something incidentally to their main employment does come out in that sub-paragraph as it does in sub-paragraph (6). Although it is fuzzy, it might cover the position of the receptionist to whom the noble Lord, Lord Cope, referred. Hospital guards have a very clear main activity of manned guarding; that is why they are there. It would be very unfortunate if the manned guarding among hospital staff, which is obviously in-house, should be carried out by people not properly qualified, skilled or vetted to perform that function.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-11_para3"></a>I turn to CCTV. The operator at a bank of screens inside a factory or hospital is governing the way in which that building is being operated. They can stop people coming in; they can issue alarms; they can warn the police if something undesirable is happening. My point is that to permit an in-house CCTV operator such access leaves it open for an unscrupulous criminal to get control of an entire factory or hospital. All kinds of problems could then arise. The Government should have a further look at this point. I hope to come back to it at a later stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

("( ) An order under subsection (3) shall not include any activities other than those set out in Schedule 2 to this Act.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "10130-11_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: With this amendment it is suggested that we discuss Amendments Nos. 14, 35, 36 and 37. Amendment No. 13 is very similar to Amendment No. 12 and others that we discussed earlier. It seeks to ensure that the Home Secretary does not designate activities that are not within Schedule 2, bringing them within the licensing regime. The Minister sought to reassure us that this could not happen because of the way the Bill is worded. No doubt he will say that again.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-11_para8"></a>Amendment No. 14 is of a slightly different character. It suggests that when the Secretary of State designates various activities as requiring a licence he should do so by means of an affirmative order. Amendments Nos. 35, 36 and 37 are consequential on Amendment No. 14.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-11_para9"></a>The designation of activities brings into play the whole licensing regime. From that point on it will affect a person's employment and ability to obtain a job or to retain the job that he has at the moment. It will affect the ability of firms to stay in business. A series of other things flow from the licensing regime. That is what one would expect. It is important that Parliament should not leave this matter to the Secretary of State entirely but should be able to control--at least to the degree of an affirmative order--what the Secretary of State is doing.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-11_para10"></a>I assume that one of the purposes of this provision will be to introduce the licensing regime by stages. That would be sensible from the mechanical point of view of the authority widening its responsibilities as it gets going.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-11_para11"></a>There is considerable concern that the authority should not immediately start to do everything it can and bring in the licensing regime too quickly. Many people and firms are engaged in these various activities. There is a very large turnover, particularly in some of the categories of employment involved. The business of vetting people will be a very considerable operation. Parliament ought to keep an eye on the setting up of the authority and on the gradual extension of the licensing regime to different categories in order to make sure that it is being done within the capacity of the authority to do it sensibly. It should not over-extend itself or be pushed into over-extending itself by the Secretary of State.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-11_para12"></a>I am aware of the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments. It looked at all the possibilities for statutory instruments and the various parliamentary procedures to be gone through and did not especially recommend. Nevertheless, I felt that it was worth suggesting it to the Committee. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-11_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   It is important that the legislative framework underpinning the licensing regime is flexible enough to take account of future developments in the industry and concomitant future decisions about the application of the licensing regime. Accordingly, paragraph 1(2) of Schedule 2 <P>


<a name="column_600"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 600</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>enables the Secretary of State to amend the activities which designated the licensing purposes. Any such orders proposed would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. However, orders made under Clause 3(3) are designation orders activating the licensing requirements for those security services which have been or will be designated in Schedule 2. Sectors of the industry that may fall to be regulated in future--such as perhaps alarm installers--will first need to be added by order to Schedule 2. Such an order is to be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. There would then need to be a practical lead-in time to enable advance preparations to be made before licensing was activated by an order under Clause 3(3).
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-11_para13"></a>The scope or orders made under Clause 3(3) is limited to the activities that have already been defined through legislation as the activities of a security operative which are subject to regulation. Those are the activities listed in Part I of Schedule 2. Amendment No. 13 would not therefore have any additional effect. I hope that the noble Lord will consider withdrawing it.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-11_para14"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 14. We believe that this amendment stems from a misinterpretation of what Clause 3(3) does. The number of employees in the private security industry who are brought within the regulatory framework of the Bill is, as the noble Lord recognised, probably around 300,000. That is clearly a considerable undertaking and will need to be achieved by means of a phased programme of implementation.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-11_para15"></a>This programme will be activated by means of a series of designation orders, one the security industry authority and the Secretary of State have agreed an implementation strategy. Orders made under Clause 3(3) are designation orders activating the licensing requirements for those security services designated in Schedule 2. Such orders are not normally subject to the degree of scrutiny proposed by the amendment. Orders adding activities to Schedule 2 are subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. Clause 3(3) orders only "switch on", as it were, the activities listed in Schedule 2. I hope that my explanation will persuade the noble Lord not to press the amendment. The arguments I advanced a moment ago apply also to Amendment No. 35.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-11_para16"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 36. We do not believe that there is any need for the amendment. Clause 22(4) requires the Secretary of State to consult the security industry authority before bringing forward any regulations, orders or draft orders. We intend there to be an open channel of communication between the Secretary of State and the authority and full consultations will, as a matter of good business, be essential if the authority is to do its job properly. As well as the good business sense of this consultation, Clause 22(4) already requires it to take place. I hope that the noble Lord will see that adequate provision is already made to secure the objectives that he seeks. The same factors apply to Amendment No. 37. I hope that the noble Lord will not press the amendments.

<a name="column_601"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 601</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>hint that she gave, presumably to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, that the Government might extend the order-making power in Schedule 2 to cover alarm installers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-12_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   To be fair, and to have placed it on the record, I think I indicated that there is the facility for so doing under the terms of the Bill. The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Cope, allowed us to make that clear.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   As a matter of fact, it was relevant to the previous amendment. But that later intervention of the noble Baroness has poured cold water on the idea that the Government will extend the provision in the near future. She drew back from saying that it does anything more than provide the facility for them to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-12_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   For the benefit of the noble Lord, Lord Cope, and also for the benefit of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, it is important that I place on record that I was neither indicating a willingness or desire to do so immediately nor any rejection of that course of action. Perhaps I should place on record my interest in this subject. On the night before a rugby match I was refused entry to a public house in Wales by a bouncer. Members of the Committee will not be surprised to learn that all I wanted to do was buy a packet of cigarettes. He said that no one who was a stranger would be allowed across the threshold in case they started a fight.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-12_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   The noble Baroness appeals to our sympathy with her account of that unfortunate experience. We know that in matters of cigarettes it is sometimes important that supplies are available to people. However, I shall draw a veil over that. I thank the noble Baroness for making clear--or clearer--the Government's intentions with regard to alarm companies and others. In view of the substance of her remarks on the various amendments, I beg leave to withdraw Amendment No. 13.

<P>

<A NAME = "10130-12_para4"></a>With this amendment I seek to raise the question of absolute offences. As the Bill is drafted, Clause 3(1) states:

<FONT SIZE=3>
I approve of the proposed amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Cope, to remove the words,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it shall be an offence for a person",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-12_para6"></a>
and have a simple prohibition that a person shall not engage in any licensable conduct. But I have not been party to his discussions with the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, and so I do not know what has emerged from them.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-12_para7"></a>The purpose of my amendment is to introduce into the concept of an offence which carries a sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months the idea of knowledge or intention. The word "wilfully" is appropriate in such circumstances. In order to make it absolutely clear that a person is not committing an absolute offence to which he has no defence, Amendment No. 14A introduces the words,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"wilfully contravenes subsection (1) of this section".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-12_para8"></a>
Amendment No. 23B is linked to Amendment No. 14A and refers to Clause 8. In Clause 8 we have something rather worse. One has a reverse burden of proof. It is clear from Clause 8 that an absolute offence is set out in subsection (4). It states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Any person who contravenes the conditions of any licence granted to him shall be guilty of an offence and liable ... to a term of imprisonment".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-12_para9"></a>
There is a statutory defence in subsection (5) that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it shall be a defence for that person to show that he exercised all due diligence to avoid a contravention of the conditions of the licence".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-12_para10"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10130-12_para11"></a>Reverse burdens of proof of this kind are reasonably frequent in the criminal law but they do cause problems. Instead of the prosecution having to prove the case, it is for the defendant to prove his innocence. That is what it amounts to. Human rights considerations do arise. Amendment No. 23B seeks to insert the word "wilfully" into subsection (4) and Amendment No. 23C seeks to omit the statutory defence for the purposes of clarifying that mens rea--intention and knowledge--must be proved before people can be sent to prison for up to six months for a breach of the legislation. Heaven knows, the legislation that goes through the House introduces so many new offences. It should be government policy to ensure that in all those cases absolute offences are not created and that mens rea is a necessary ingredient. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-12_spnew6"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I should like to support in particular Amendment No. 23B, spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, when he moved Amendment No. 14A. He referred in particular to the absolute offence which has been created here.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-12_para12"></a>The Bill will confer substantial powers on the Secretary of State through various order-making procedures and, indeed, by in effect issuing directions to the authority. The security industry is large and complicated. Given that, orders will be introduced over a comparatively long period and the transition period will be lengthy. I believe that it will be extremely difficult for everyone to remain absolutely innocent all of the time. No doubt some corners will be cut and grey areas encountered. The authority needs to be given time to work out those problems.

<P>

<A NAME = "10130-12_para13"></a>It seems to me that, without incorporating a defence of some kind, we shall run the risk of convicting a person because there will be no choice but to convict him, simply because that is what is stated in the law. However, that person may have a perfectly valid and reasonable explanation that should, under normal circumstances, be taken into account in any court of law.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-12_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   The Government consider that, for regulation to be effective and for the authority to have teeth, it is important that the licensing provisions are supported by criminal offences. I would hope that all of your Lordships involved in these discussions and debates would support that principle. However, it is important that the offences created are appropriate for the type of conduct they have been designed to prohibit and that they can be clearly understood.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-12_para14"></a>Clause 3 as drafted creates a strict liability offence of engaging in licensable activity without a licence and no proof of intent is necessary. The penalty for this offence is set out in Clause 5. The purpose of the offence is to put the burden on operatives within the industry to ensure that they are properly licensed for the activities which they perform. To accept this amendment would be to add a requirement that a prosecution of an unlicensed person must also prove that they "wilfully" or intentionally failed to have a licence. In our view that would draw the teeth of the offence. It would be difficult to show that a failure to have a licence was "wilful". A defendant could easily show that, far from being wilful, he had been simply negligent or had made a mistake. As it stands, the clause properly puts the burden on the operative.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-12_para15"></a>Clause 8(4) creates a strict liability offence of contravening the conditions of a licence. The purpose of this offence is to put the burden on operatives within the industry to ensure that they do not breach their licence conditions. To accept the amendment would mean that the prosecution would again have to prove that the person wilfully or intentionally breached their licence conditions. That would effectively shift the burden of proof away from the defendant.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-12_para16"></a>We want to give defendants adequate protection where there is no intention to subvert the licensing system. We also want to put the onus on them to ensure that they hold the appropriate licence for the work that they are performing. That is an important point. For those reasons, I cannot accept the amendments and I hope that the noble Lord will now consider withdrawing them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-12_spnew8"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   The Minister pointed out that a person must take steps to have the appropriate licence for the job that he is performing. Perhaps I may cite the example of a person employed by one of the large security firms. That person will hold a licence. Does that mean that many different types of licensing will be necessary for someone undertaking many different tasks? What will be the appropriate licence in each case? Will one person hold a licence for guarding and another <P>


<a name="column_604"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 604</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>person hold a licence for a different duty? If an employee of a large firm is licensed and his firm says, "Tomorrow you are going to do this", is the onus then put on the employee to check whether his individual licence covers that duty, or will the licence be a corporate entity?
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-12_para17"></a>I might have misunderstood the noble Lord when he referred to "appropriate licences". I was not entirely clear about what he had in mind.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-12_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   The noble Viscount will appreciate that licences will relate to individuals. In other words, the individual must hold an appropriate licence to enable him to carry out the duties included in his job. It is the licence which needs to be "appropriate". I hope that that explanation is of help to the noble Viscount.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I believe that an important matter of principle has arisen in relation to these amendments. The Government are not being consistent here. On reading Clause 18(3), which deals with entry, inspection and information, a person is guilty of an offence under that clause if he "intentionally obstructs any person" or,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"fails, without reasonable excuse, to comply with any requirement".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-13_para0"></a>
Furthermore, Clause 20(1) states that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A person is guilty of an offence if for any purposes connected with the carrying out by the Authority of any of its functions under this Act--
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(b) he recklessly makes any statement to the Authority which is false in a material particular".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-13_para3"></a>
It appears that some of the offences which can be committed under the provisions of the Bill will be absolute--if you are found guilty you are liable to be sent to prison, even if you were acting with a completely innocent mind and had no idea that a licence was required for what you are doing. That is wrong.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-13_para4"></a>There is no consistency in the Bill because mens rea is required for other offences. The problem is therefore highlighted. I would ask the Government to think again on this point because I shall certainly return to it at a later stage. For the moment, however, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<A NAME = "10130-13_para11"></a>Amendment No. 17 comprises a new subsection of three paragraphs, each of which excuses people from committing offences under the Act. Paragraph (a) would excuse those carrying out activities on a non-commercial basis. Paragraph (c) covers those,

<P>

<A NAME = "10130-13_para13"></a>
although he may act as such from time to time. As I have said, we have already discussed the matter of security activities being "incidental" to the main activities. For that reason, I shall not press new paragraph (b) of the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-13_para14"></a>However, as regards paragraphs (a) and (c), I think that it is important that the regulations and licensing system should not cover innocent people who would be criminalised by the Bill if it was strictly interpreted. One can cite all kinds of activities where people take on the role of temporary door supervisors. I have in mind several jumble sales that I have attended in Chipping Sodbury town hall. Sometimes a considerable press of people wishing to get into the jumble sale first to secure the best bargains may be encountered at opening time. The same can happen in commercial premises, but when the jumble sale is run, as such sales habitually are, by a charity or some other deserving cause, this can occur. On a strict reading of the Bill, someone acting as a door supervisor for that purpose might be held to require a licence. If so, the organisers of the event would also require a licence, because they would be taking on people to act in that capacity, even if there was no remuneration.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-13_para15"></a>It is also regrettably the case that occasionally a church service is disrupted for one reason or another. We all know that there was an interruption in Canterbury cathedral in the middle of a sermon by the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury not so long ago. I am thinking particularly also of midnight masses at Christmas and Easter, which sometimes coincide with the pubs turning out. That can lead to unfortunate incidents, one of which I witnessed a few years ago. In such cases, people have to act as door supervisors, sometimes for an extended period. I want to be sure that that kind of activity is not covered and that there is no requirement for a licence. Another example is a school caretaker who provides security services occasionally, but he is probably covered by the "incidental" words we discussed earlier.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-13_para16"></a>Amendment No. 18 provides that one can go to the local magistrates' court to apply for a temporary licence. This is intended to cover a one-off event, where the organisers may wish to take people on to act as door supervisors and so on. There are some large one-off events in our part of the country. One thinks of the Glastonbury festival. I have never been to it, but a large <P>


<a name="column_606"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 606</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>number of people do go, and the organisers have a great deal of trouble controlling the entrance, to such an extent that they are not holding the festival this year. Such events can be policed--if that is the right word--by one of the large security firms, but also by people employed by the organisations running the events.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-13_para17"></a>No doubt under the Bill, although there is no special provision for this, organisers could ask for a temporary licence from the security industry authority. However, it would be more sensible for them to be able to go to the magistrates, although the magistrates should use the same criteria as the authority would. We have made it clear in the amendment that the licence would exist for only one month and would not be renewable, so this is not a way of opening up a separate channel for acquiring a licence.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-13_para18"></a>The magistrates' court is probably a good place to go for a temporary licence, particularly as the magistrates will be likely to be issuing a temporary licence for the sale of alcohol, for example, and perhaps for dancing or public entertainment; they are likely to be in the business of licensing the particular event that is being organised. Rather than having to apply separately to the security industry authority, a person should be able to apply to the magistrates for the necessary security licence as well.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-13_para19"></a>The provision would also cover urgent cases in which something was being set up quickly. The national authority may be very slick in its operations and its issuing of licences to individuals and firms, but not all such authorities have proved very slick in the past, whereas the magistrates' court is up and running and one can go to it any day to apply for licences and get going. Once again, the licence would run for only one month. If it was a permanent activity starting urgently, one would still need to go to the authority to obtain the proper licence to proceed.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-13_para20"></a>I expressed on Second Reading my concern that the Bill, which we support in principle, should not catch unnecessarily activities outside the main stream of the security industry, and these two amendments are designed to try to bring this matter into focus and to make sure that the Bill does not apply to people to whom the Committee--and, I feel sure, the Government--would not wish it to apply. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I support the noble Lord, Lord Cope of Berkeley, on these two amendments. With the jumble of images that he has given us--the bursting open of the door at jumble sales, the vergers at risk on Christmas Eve and so on--he has painted a picture of the kind of situation in which people become involved in performing, on a temporary basis, some of the activities described in Schedule 2, and those people should not be caught by the provisions of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-13_para21"></a>I also agree with the noble Lord that the swift procedure of obtaining an order from the magistrates' court would be of great value. If the application could be heard together with the applications for the temporary liquor licence and the temporary dancing licence, that would be a very easy way of having some <P>


<a name="column_607"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 607</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>control over the kind of things that go on at special events. I am sure that the authority itself would welcome the use of the magistrates' court, rather than having to set aside part of its operations to deal with urgent and temporary applications.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   If I ever have to attend a jumble sale in Chipping Sodbury I shall now feel much more secure in the knowledge that the noble Lord, Lord Cope of Berkeley, is likely to be on the door taking my 10p, or whatever the entry fee is.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-13_para22"></a>It is not our intention to be excessive in the way in which we apply this part of the legislation. No person falling into the categories which are the subject of Amendment No. 17 will be taken into the regulatory regime established by the Bill as currently drafted. The Bill is directed to those who provide services under contract, or, in the case of door supervisors and wheelclampers, those also employed in-house, as I clarified earlier. These are covered by the provisions of Clause 3 and Part II of Schedule 2. The licensing arrangements do not apply to those who undertake the activities of a security operative on a non-contract or reward-free basis, nor to those who carry out security-related activities which are incidental to their main employment, a matter that we have already discussed.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-13_para23"></a>If a school, church or registered charity hires security operatives under contract, we still take the view that it is right that those organisations should expect them to have been vetted to a national standard and licensed. If the security operatives that they use are employed in-house, they will be exempted from the licensing requirement; in those circumstances it will be the responsibility of the organisation to vet its own staff.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-13_para24"></a>The Bill already takes account of the issues which the noble Lord has suggested as the basis of the amendment, and we think that for that reason the amendment is unnecessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-13_para25"></a>Perhaps I might add that it is not our intention to cover innocent people inadvertently, and I hope that the clarification I have given will help in that regard. Regulations may specify in greater detail by description who is excluded. Further than that, the security industry authority itself will be able to make it clear that groups such as those mentioned in paragraph (c) of Amendment No. 17 are not covered. I hope that that helps the noble Lord.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-13_para26"></a>Turning to Amendment No. 18, we do not believe that a temporary exemption from the need for a licence is necessary or desirable. It would potentially introduce an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy into the licensing process. It could also lead to different standards being temporarily applied across the country. That would be a recipe for confusion and would lead to the development of a rather uneven package. That is not something we should encourage. We want a level playing field.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-13_para27"></a>Provisions already exist in Clause 4 for exemptions from the need for a licence. Clause 4 permits exemptions where the authority is satisfied that a valid alternative to its own vetting procedures exists. It also <P>


<a name="column_608"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 608</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>allows firms which have received approved contractor status under Clause 13 temporarily to engage unlicensed persons who have none the less applied for a licence.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-13_para28"></a>The security industry authority will be a one-stop shop arrangement. To establish a separate exemption scheme through the courts would again lead to confusion. It would weaken the licensing regime rather than strengthen it and add to the work of magistrates.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-13_para29"></a>The noble Lord suggested that one-off events could be approved by magistrates' courts in the same way as a temporary licence. We would argue that one-off events needing door supervision on a licensed basis should be staffed by properly licensed people, particularly an event such as a pop concert. It is appropriate that such events continue to be covered. In some respects, urgent cases may be an ideal opportunity for criminals to offer their services. Where the need arises rather rapidly is exactly the kind of situation where people with a dodgy background may seek to become engaged.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-13_para30"></a>For those reasons--to ensure probity and evenness of application--we do not think that the amendment should be supported. Having heard that explanation, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   So far as concerns Amendment No. 17, can I take it from what the Minister said that the Government do not wish to catch people working for charities and so on, even if they are lowly paid or volunteers? The suggestion seemed to be that if they were paid they were covered. Sometimes people who undertake these duties get a small remuneration.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   If it helps the noble Lord, that is exactly the case. I completely concur with the extra elucidation given by the noble Lord and with his interpretation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord. He also said that regulations could vary. I am not sure which regulations he had in mind.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   The point I was trying to make was that in the description of regulations we will be much more forthcoming in setting out how they might work and how the exemptions might work. There will be further clarification then.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-14_time0"></A><H5>6.15 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   We shall look forward to that. So far as concerns Amendment No. 18, I am not really persuaded by what the Minister said. He talked of marginally differing standards. The Bill provides subsequently for local authorities to have powers of licensing. Presumably that will lead to marginally different decisions being made by local authorities. So the Government are already providing for that on a permanent basis. Under the amendment there may be slightly different standards between magistrates' <P>


<a name="column_609"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 609</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>courts--although they are supposed to apply the same rules as the security authority--but, by definition, they will apply only temporarily, for not more than one month. I do not think the Minister has a powerful argument in these circumstances. A licensing system whereby a temporary licence can be granted by a magistrates' court--particularly in combination with an application for a licence to sell alcohol or for dancing and so on, as I described--could be extremely helpful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-14_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I can see the parallel and the comparison, but, of course, singing, dancing and entertainment licences are taken through the local authority process. It is our long-term intention to bring liquor licensing into the local authority orbit as well. The noble Lord's argument--certainly in the medium to longer term-- does not hold quite as much water as he would have us believe.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-14_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   It may be the intention of the noble Lord and his colleagues in government to bring licensing into the local authority's purview instead of the magistrates' court, but it is certainly not Parliament's intention--not yet, at any rate. I am not inclined to think that that is a good idea. But that is not an argument for today.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-14_para0"></a>I do not share the view which seems to be taken by the Government that magistrates' courts are something basically to be got rid of--at least that the lay magistrates' courts are something to be got rid of. The Government seem to want to stick pins in them all the way round. However, that is a much larger argument. We should not involve ourselves too much with it today.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-14_para1"></a>Magistrates' courts will be very good places to go for licences as long as they are responsible for alcohol licensing, dancing, entertainment and so on. If at some future stage the Government lay a Bill before the House to remove that power from magistrates and give it to local authorities in respect of alcohol sales and other matters, no doubt the power to license in this case would be removed at the same time. That would be logical.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-14_para2"></a>But that is a different argument from the one that applies today. We have to proceed on the basis of the law as it is. And the law states that alcohol licensing and so on is carried out by the magistrates' courts. That is why it is a sensible arrangement to have the temporary licence provision arranged in the way I suggest.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-14_para3"></a>From the nature of his reply, it seems to me that the Minister does not want to give this matter further consideration. I am encouraged by the support of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, and the Liberal Democrats to seek the opinion of the Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-14_para4"></a>On Question, amendment negatived.

<P>
<A NAME="10130-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley </B>   moved Amendment No. 19:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 5, insert the following new clause--
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-15_para0"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><center><B>LIABILITY FOR SECURITY OPERATIVES</B></center><BR>
(" .--(1) An individual, partnership or company which employs security operatives to which paragraph 8 of Schedule 2 to this Act applies (door supervisors, etc. for public houses and clubs and comparable venues) shall be liable (in contract and in tort) for the acts and omissions of those individuals.
<BR>
(2) It shall be the duty of any such individual, partnership or company, to maintain, for public inspection, upon reasonable notice and upon the payment of such fee as the Secretary of State <P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_612"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 612</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=2>may from time to time prescribe, a list of the individuals and their addresses, to which paragraph 8 of Schedule 2 to this Act applies and the dates upon which they worked, and their hours of work.
<BR>
(3) For the purposes of this section, an individual, partnership or company employs a security operative if he has security operatives on his premises, notwithstanding the fact that those security operatives may be employed or remunerated by another individual, partnership or company.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "10130-15_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: This proposed new clause provides a liability for the acts, or omissions, of door supervisors when they do the wrong thing. In order to police the liability, the amendment goes on to provide that those who employ door supervisors must keep a record of those whom they employ in that capacity and their times of employment. As subsection (3) makes clear, that applies even if the security operative--in this case the door supervisor--is the employee of another company but is merely working in that club or public house at the time.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-15_para2"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to provide a remedy to a problem which I am told is quite common; namely, the trouble that may arise between a door supervisor and some of the guests or customers of an establishment. If there is an argument that the door supervisor has assaulted a customer, it is often not possible for that customer to pursue a civil action against that individual because the door supervisor will almost certainly lack the means to pay any necessary damages. It appears that employers are unlikely to be found liable in such cases because the victim (the customer) is likely to be met with the defence that the employee was acting on his own behalf, that he was on a frolic of his own and was, therefore, outside the course of his employment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-15_para3"></a>I express myself in those terms in the light of conversations that I have had with a barrister who has experience of these matters. As the law stands, if a night club reasonably contracts out its security functions to another company, an action against the venue could not succeed. This amendment seeks to ensure that if an altercation takes place, during which a customer feels he has been unfairly set upon by a door supervisor, it will be possible for him to bring a successful action for damages against the company that owns the club or public house in question. That may not occur in the best conducted establishments, but it may and apparently does occur in some.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-15_para4"></a>In my view, it is the duty of a club to keep control over its employees. If those employees behave improperly and, for example, throw somebody down a flight of stairs, the company, as well as the individual security operatives, should be liable. I should add that that concept will not necessarily always involve a flight of stairs. The altercation may take place on the pavement outside the premises, which would make it all the more difficult, as the law stands at the moment, to pursue the club itself. The purpose of the amendment is that one should be able to pursue the club as well as the individual door supervisor. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   If this amendment is intended to cover a security operative who acts on a frolic of his own, it is a startling extension of liability <P>


<a name="column_613"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 613</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in contract and in tort. It has wide insurance implications. For example, if a door supervisor produced a knife, which the owner of the club had no reason to suspect he had on his person, and used it, the club would be liable for the injury that was occasioned. As I understand the way in which the noble Lord, Lord Cope, puts the case, it may or may not be desirable from a public point of view, but it does have very wide implications.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-15_para5"></a>With regard to subsection (2) of this new clause, anyone with experience of the Crown Courts of this country will understand precisely the problem to which the noble Lord referred; namely, that security operatives who cause trouble disappear or cannot be identified, either in respect of their criminal liability or their liability in tort. It is a very good idea to have a register of club or public house door supervisors. Whether it should encompass the whole of this clause, with its wide extension of liability, is a different matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-15_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   I support the intent behind my noble friend's amendment. There clearly is an issue to be considered with regard to the relationship between the management of clubs and the actions of door supervisors. I have listened with care to the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, about the various legal difficulties with this approach. There is perhaps another approach that the Minister or another Member of the Committee might volunteer. However, it would be extremely regrettable if the management of a club could say, "We have moved from the previous position of employing any old gaoler on the door. We have now employed a licensed doorkeeper, who has committed an act for which we have no responsibility whatever".
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-15_para6"></a>One of my concerns relates to drug dealing by doormen and the control of drug dealing in night-clubs. Responsible night-club owners will want to ensure that drugs are not used in their night-clubs. However, there are rogue night-club owners as well as rogue doormen. In the circumstances that I have described, how does the Minister suggest the relationship between club management and doorkeepers should work? In the example of a doorkeeper throwing someone down a flight of stairs or on to the pavement, the management may say to a doorkeeper, "We employ tough doormen who will throw people out. We do not want any bother. We want to see these guys out on the pavement and treated harshly". The doorkeeper may do exactly that, and the customer may try to pursue a claim against that doorkeeper. However, the fault could well lie with the management of the club for encouraging their doormen to exercise undue violence, or because of concerns relating to dealing in drugs.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I have some sympathy with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Cope of Berkeley. However, I am not sure that this amendment deals with it in the right way. I prefer the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. The amendment would place additional requirements on employers of door supervisors and those who may use <P>


<a name="column_614"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 614</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>door supervisors. I also argue that it places a vicarious liability on those employers or other users for the actions of their door supervisors.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-15_para7"></a>We believe that the duty that would be placed on employers to keep publicly available records of door supervisors' names, addresses, dates and hours of work would impose an additional burden on employers for very little public benefit. Any member of the public who has a complaint against a door supervisor should already be able to ascertain the relevant details from his employers, and, if necessary, the police may be called upon to assist.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-15_para8"></a>We believe that this additional burden would go too far in the direction of a regulatory burden on companies. We take the view that reputable companies should already be able to do what the amendment seeks to impose. Although I am not at present in favour of such a requirement, if a problem should arise and it became apparent that it was larger than at first thought, there would be nothing to stop the security industry authority from making it a condition of the approved contractors scheme under Clause 14--a scheme that we expect the majority of reputable companies to join.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-15_para9"></a>The issue of vicarious liability raises further questions. Vicarious liability is firmly established at common law as a principle that will make employers liable for the acts and omissions of employees who are acting,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in the course of their employment",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-15_para10"></a>
rather than, as has been said, going off on a frolic of their own. The amendment would extend the vicarious liability principle substantially. A bouncer's employer would be liable in contract and in tort for all actions and omissions of his employee. Theoretically, a situation could arise where a pedestrian, knocked down by a motorist who happens to be an off duty bouncer, would be able to claim against the bouncer's employer. More practically, if a bouncer decided to stab someone while carrying out bouncer duties, it means that the employer would be liable to pay compensation for the actions, even if the bouncer were acting independently out of anger or revenge.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-15_para11"></a>Subsection (3) of the amendment considers that an employer employs a bouncer if he has bouncers on the premises, even if that person is supplied under a contract of services. So a landlord may go to the trouble of employing a reputable company and yet still be liable for misdeeds on the part of the bouncer.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-15_para12"></a>The proposed extension of the vicarious liability principle goes far beyond the needs of common law. We believe that it would impose an unfair and unjust system on those who retain door supervisory staff. Therefore, in good conscience, I am afraid that we cannot support such a measure. In view of my comments, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment. For my part, I shall certainly reflect on the issue raised. However, I cannot recommend the proposed new clause as a solution to the Committee.

<P>
<A NAME="10130-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   I thank my noble friend for his support for my proposed new clause. I believe that <P>


<a name="column_615"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 615</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>there is a problem in this respect. Indeed, the Minister has agreed to reflect further on the matter. As regards subsection (1) of the amendment, I realise that this proposes a very considerable extension of the liability involved. If there is an easier way out of the dilemma that occurs from time to time, we should obviously choose it.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-16_para0"></a>Notwithstanding the support that I received from the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, I am also very susceptible to the argument that subsection (2) would, as the Minister said, place an "additional burden" on companies. In the circumstances, I believe that we should all reflect further on the matter. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-16_para1"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<A NAME = "10130-16_para2"></a>Clause 6 [Licensing criteria]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-16_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Astor </B>   moved Amendment No. 20:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 5, line 42, leave out paragraph (b).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-16_para3"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10130-16_para4"></a>The noble Viscount said: The two amendments in this group are probing amendments that are designed to highlight a range of issues that arise as a result of Clause 6 and subsection (3) in particular. We seek clarification on how the authority will be able to gauge "the skills" and the "criteria" when deciding whether to issue licences. If Members of the Committee look at Clause 6(3)(a), they will see that it refers to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"such criteria as the Authority considers appropriate for securing that the persons who engage in licensable conduct are fit and proper persons to engage in that conduct".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-16_para5"></a>
That seems to be perfectly reasonable. It is normal duty that is often imposed upon such bodies.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-16_para6"></a>However, subsection (3)(b) extends the criteria, in that the authority will have to consider whether such persons,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"have the skills necessary to engage in the conduct for which they are licensed".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-16_para7"></a>
What do the Government mean by "skills"; for example, what skills are these people supposed to have? I can only assume that they mean "training" in some way. If that is the case, the legislation ought to say so. Will training schemes be set up for the purpose? Will the authority demand that people undertake some training before they can be considered for a licence? If so, will that training form part of an educational system like NVQs? What form will such training take? I do not understand the position. Such a requirement seems to me to be unnecessary. "Skills" seems to be a rather meaningless word in this context.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-16_para8"></a>Can the Minister say what kind of skills applicants will be required to have? Either those concerned will be fit and proper persons or they will not be. I do not understand the meaning of the word "skills" in this provision. It seems to me to be both confusing and unnecessary. If the Government really mean to impose a serious regime of training for the industry, they should say so. They should come clean and state their position clearly on the matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-16_para9"></a>I turn now to subsection (3)(c), which seems to me to be an extraordinary belt and braces clause. It appears to say, "If we haven't covered anything <P>


<a name="column_616"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 616</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>further than the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) which relate to someone being a fit and proper person and having the necessary skills, we can consider anything else that we want, no matter what it is"--in other words, the authority will have a totally undefined power that will enable it to say, "Whatever we think, we can say no".
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-16_para10"></a>I should like to know why the Government consider such a provision to be necessary. If the authority is to be responsible for people's livelihoods, it seems to me that a clear duty should be placed upon it to state what it regards as being "fit and proper" and what is not; and what it regards as appropriate training. As it stands, this is an incredibly wide provision, especially when one considers the extraordinarily wide powers that the Secretary of State will have to add further provisions to various parts of the legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-16_para11"></a>The Minister may correct me if I am wrong in this respect, but it seems to me the current licensing functions will be sub-contracted out to local authorities. Therefore, the powers under Clause 6(3)(a)(b) and (c) will also be sub-contracted to local authorities; in other words, local authorities will have a whole series of rather vague rules by which they will have to decide such matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-16_para12"></a>When we discussed a previous amendment, the Minister said that the one thing we do not want is different rules applying to different areas. So how will these provisions work? Before the authority contracts out to the local authority, will it stipulate "the skills" required? Further, will it state what training will be required and then outline all the different conditions that are to be attached to the licence application? When one looks at the Bill, one sees that the authority has the power to add conditions once a licence has been issued. How will that work in practice? Like the Minister, I am concerned that there should not be different rules for different parts of the country.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-16_para13"></a>I should like to hear more from the Minister about how the proposed system will work with local authorities. The Government must define what they mean in subsection (3). Indeed, the Minister must explain why it is necessary to have paragraph (c) in the clause. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="10130-16_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   My noble friend has highlighted an interesting inconsistency. I recall that we argued a similar point a short time ago. At that stage, my noble friend Lord Cope sought to have the word "skill" inserted into the Bill in place of the word "training" in Clause l(2)(e). However, we have a direct reference to "skills" in Clause 6. The Minister put forward a convincing argument against the word "skill" at that time. He said that it was much better to have the word "training" in that clause. Nevertheless, a few pages further on in the Bill, the Minister had changed his mind by the time that we reached Clause 5, where we have the word "skills" instead of the word "training". It seems to me that both words should be used. We could then sleep carefully and safely at night.
<P>


<a name="column_617"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 617</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-16_para14"></a>As Amendment No. 21 has been included in this group, perhaps I make take this opportunity to raise a rather wider point that I trust the Minister can answer at this stage. However, if he cannot, perhaps he will be able to respond in relation to another clause of the Bill. Although the issue is relevant to Clause 6 and Amendment No. 21, the point goes a little further and relates to the issue of revocation. Criticism has been made of the Bill that it will target individuals and that the licensing system is based around the activities and licence ability, if you will, of the individual concerned, not of the firm for which he works. I understand that criticism and to some extent support it. There will be individual licensing of all individual security operatives rather than one overall licence for a firm and the imposition of duties on that firm, which would ensure that the people who worked for it were the right sort of people. There is a difficulty concerning bad firms.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-16_para15"></a>What happens when firms go wrong? One knows that the dodgier elements, to use the Minister's expression, of the security business have in some unfortunate episodes overlapped with some elements of the criminal fraternity and that criminals have been involved with the provision of security services. That is why the Bill is felt to be necessary. I am concerned that licences may be given to firms that are substandard and, perhaps, run by criminal elements.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-16_para16"></a>Amendment No. 21 relates to Clause 6(3)(c), which states that the authority,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"may also include criteria relating to such other matters as the Authority thinks fit".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-16_para17"></a>
It would assist the Committee if the Minister said whether the type of employer will be taken into consideration when a licence is issued. In other words, a firm may be known to be dubious--it may be infiltrated, owned or run by criminal elements--and someone in it, perhaps a new recruit, may apply for a licence. That person may be perfectly acceptable, apart from the fact that he works for a dubious firm. Will that be taken into account in an application or would that discriminate against the individual, who may be a perfectly decent person? There may be a failure to impose sanctions on a substandard firm.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-16_para18"></a>My point boils down to this. How can substandard firms--by "substandard" I mean those about which the police and the licensing authority have strong suspicions that criminal activities are going on--be effectively put out of business? As I interpret the Bill, various individuals can have their licences suspended or revoked, or they may not be issued in the first place, but that does not appear to be the case with a firm as a whole.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-16_para19"></a>I do not think that I should prejudge the Minister too much if I guess that his answer will involve a <P>


<a name="column_618"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 618</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reference to the approval scheme. Some of my remarks definitely relate to it. At Second Reading, he said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"But we do not believe that the threat of withdrawal of approval will necessarily be a deterrent if companies feel that illegal activities are the way to gain their business objectives".--[Official Report, 18/12/00; col. 600.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-16_para20"></a>
That explanation did not involve the approval process.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-16_para21"></a>That argument, which is relevant to Amendment No. 21, involves the type of criteria that the authority can take into account when deciding whether to issue a licence. However, that argument is also part of a much wider question. I should appreciate it if the Minister would respond to that wider question, but if he cannot at this stage perhaps he would discuss the narrower question of the issuing of licences in connection with an employer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   We have had a useful debate on the two amendments. It is important for the authority to have the flexibility to decide on the licensing criteria that should be applied. Each sector of the industry has different requirements, and the authority may decide, following consultation with the industry, police, local authorities and other interested organisations, that to obtain a licence in order to undertake a particular type of recruitment activity, a particular skill or standard would need to be achieved. That is an important tool, which the authority will use to drive up standards across the industry. The Bill is therefore designed to give the authority flexibility in determining the criteria that will best ensure that standards are raised in an appropriately targeted way, where necessary, and that regulation is overall more effective.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-17_para0"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Goschen, raised the prospect of the relevant criteria perhaps being skills and/or training.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-17_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   And training.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   Yes. I am attracted to that proposition and I am grateful to the noble Viscount for making it. It may help us to clarify the word "skills" in line 43 on page 5. I shall take the suggestion away without commitment, although I am interested in it. It may help us in relation to the clause and with our earlier debate--it may be relevant in both instances. I hope that we can be helpful in this regard.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-17_para1"></a>When the authority sets out criteria against which it will judge licence applications, subsection (3) will require it to include criteria to establish whether applicants are "fit and proper persons". That subsection will also allow the authority to include criteria relating to necessary skills. Amendment No. 21 would remove the authority's ability to include a third set of criteria relating to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"such other matters as the Authority thinks fit".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-17_para2"></a>
From our perspective, that amendment would reduce the authority's flexibility. It is important for the authority to have the flexibility to decide on the licensing criteria to be applied. Each sector of the industry will have different requirements, and the authority may decide, following consultation--this is <P>


<a name="column_619"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 619</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>important--with the industry, the police, local authorities and others, that to obtain a licence for a particular kind of security work a particular skill standard should be required. That is an important tool, which the authority will use to drive up standards across the industry. That is why we want it. It would be wrong to remove the authority's room for manoeuvre when it responds to particular demands. It goes without saying, of course, that it will not use that flexibility capriciously or without good purpose. It is important to remember that the criteria will continue to be published, so that applicants for licences will know what is expected of them.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-17_para3"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Astor, asked why paragraph (c) was so open ended. The relevant conditions will be published by the security industry authority as part of its public statement on standards. It would need the flexibility to review old conditions as circumstances demand. The relevant conditions will all be published, so people will know what is required.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-17_para4"></a>The noble Viscount also asked about how skills will work when contracting out to local authorities. Local authorities will need to give effect to the authority's standards and published criteria; they will not be able to introduce their own criteria.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-17_para5"></a>In a helpful contribution, the noble Viscount, Lord Goschen, asked whether the type of employer would be taken into account when a licence was applied for. Personal licences do not necessarily relate to the individual's employer--such licences are, after all, personal. There is a common understanding in that regard. If the security industry authority knew that a substandard firm was seeking involvement, it might add--I argue that it should add--conditions to a personal licence, which would ensure that the threshold would be raised. Clearly, that would create the necessary difficulties.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-17_para6"></a>Perhaps I may refer to our earlier debate about the need to license directors or those with management responsibility. That would provide another safeguard and check. I believe that I made the point that we need to regulate properly the owners or directors of a company precisely to see off the type of difficulty which the noble Viscount mentioned in his contribution to the debate on this amendment. I hope that I have answered most of the points raised.

<A NAME="10130-17_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way and for his helpfulness in covering my wider points. I give notice that I should like to return to this point on Report.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-17_para7"></a>Given the Minister's explanation of where the matter now lies within the context of the Bill, I am not sure that sufficient leverage can be applied to a rogue firm. I understand his point with regard to the licensing of directors. However, as we know, the nominal directors of an unscrupulous company may not reflect who controls and, indeed, owns the benefits from the company. I believe that such information would be more difficult to tie down. If an individual is <P>


<a name="column_620"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 620</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not overly concerned about having people "roughed up" or if he deals in drugs, and so on, he will probably not be too concerned about the provisions of the Companies Act or shadow directorships. Therefore, I believe that the Bill is not yet sufficiently tight in that regard. However, I appreciate the Minister's explanation thus far.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I understand the issue that the noble Viscount raises. He is trying to get to grips with the character of a company and the company which its owners or directors might keep. I shall reflect further on that matter but I do not believe that there is an easy solution. We may well get to the root of it by taking the approach which we suggest in relation to setting standards and criteria. I am prepared to give the problem further consideration. If the noble Viscount is able to put forward any ideas in the interim, I shall happily pursue those, too. In the meantime, perhaps I may suggest to the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, that he withdraws his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-17_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Goschen for putting forward the argument about skills and training. The words in the Bill are almost contradictory in that Clause 1 refers to training and Clause 6 refers to skills. The Minister kindly said that he would address that issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-17_para8"></a>I want to put three questions to the Minister. First, I believe that the criteria will be crucial to the successful running of the authority. I should like to receive a commitment from the Government that they will publish draft criteria for consultation. Secondly, the security industry training organisation has been established. Can the Minister tell me whether that will be used in assessing the criteria for training?
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-17_para9"></a>My third question is a request for confirmation of what the Minister said. I believe he said that if anything were contracted out to a local authority, that authority would have to take note of the criteria. In order to clarify my understanding of the situation, am I right in believing that he is saying that the security authority would not contract out to a local authority unless that local authority, in effect, signed up to the criteria and that, therefore, there would be no question of a local authority using criteria which were different to the criteria decided by the authority?
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-17_para10"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for his reply and, of course, shall withdraw Amendment No. 20. With regard to Amendment No. 21, I note his reply and am somewhat delighted by it because I feel that it will provide me with a far more powerful argument when I come to deal with my Amendment No. 23. In the meantime, I give the Minister the opportunity to respond to those questions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-17_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   The answer to the noble Viscount's points are: yes, no and yes. That is as brief and as complex a reply as I would wish to give at the moment. However, I believe that we do meet the points that he raises. First, yes, the draft criteria will be published for consultation. Secondly, no; possibly <P>


<a name="column_621"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 621</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>they will be used to examine training criteria, but we do not want the SIA's hands tied at this point. Thirdly, yes, the local authority will not be able to introduce its own criteria; we believe that that would be quite wrong.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-17_spnew7"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for being clear. With regard to my second point, the security industry training organisation has been in place since 1991 and has a number of years' experience. Therefore, I ask the Minister to consider how that industry organisation, which is well respected, will be brought into discussions about the authority. Obviously, I shall let the Minister consider that point and, in the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

It will have the opportunity to be as open as possible with those who apply for a licence. That will be a complicated process and there will be various transitional provisions. A huge number of individuals--as we have heard, more than 300,000--within the industry, not including new entrants, will have to apply. It will be easy for people to fall through the gaps and not be given a licence, but they will not know why. The process will be difficult.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-17_para16"></a>The Government are trying to raise standards in the industry. We do not want people to have to wait or to remain unpaid because they cannot obtain a licence. We want people to have confidence that when they apply for a licence they will have a reasonable chance of obtaining one. If they are not to be granted a licence, they should be told the reason why. We have all had experience of records kept by government organisations or large bodies being wrong. In fact, they are more often wrong than right. I believe that an applicant should have the opportunity to make his case and find out what happened.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-17_para17"></a>That leads me to Amendment No. 23. As we heard, the authority will have extraordinarily wide powers to say "yes", "no" or "maybe" to an applicant. I believe that any quango with that type of power over people's lives should be mindful of the consequences. One way to make government organisations mindful of the consequences is to include a process whereby, if an <P>


<a name="column_622"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 622</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>applicant has been treated badly and claims to have suffered damage, under reasonable terms as set out in Amendment No. 23 the authority would have to pay compensation. I do not believe that such a situation would arise often. However, it would be in the minds of those who run the authority that they must operate with care and in a proper manner.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-17_para18"></a>The Minister may reply that recourse may be made to judicial review. That response is often given by governments; we have heard it time and time again. However, we all know that judicial review is enormously cumbersome and incredibly expensive. Anyone who applies for a job for the first time does not have a hope in hell of going down that path. Therefore, that is not a good argument and I hope that it will not even be considered by the Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-17_para19"></a>I accept that perhaps these two amendments are not drafted as well as they might be. However, I hope that the Government will consider the principle behind them and be able to give the Committee some reassurance. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="10130-18_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   Amendment No. 22, moved by the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, would oblige the security industry authority to have regard to any representations made to it and require it to seek such representations before it refuses to grant a licence. The Bill already provides for a transparent system of licensing. The criteria upon which the authority will reach its decisions will be published. The authority will wish to ensure that applicants are given every opportunity in their application forms to provide the strongest case in support of their applications. Unsuccessful applicants will have rights of appeal against the decision to refuse them a licence.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-18_para0"></a>Therefore, the Government do not believe that it is necessary to add a further requirement for applicants to be afforded an opportunity to comment when the authority is minded to refuse a licence. The noble Viscount recognised that we are already proposing a complicated process. To do what he asks in the amendment would add a disproportionate further layer of bureaucracy and cost in contrast to no real gain in natural justice for the applicants. There is already a duty to make a speedy response so as not to cause applicants to have to wait too long. The SIA's published criteria should include a statement of its turnaround times for applications and targets. Some applications may be more difficult than others. However, applicants are justified in expecting to know when a decision should be available.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-18_para1"></a>I hope that that has reassured the noble Viscount, who we know does not want to see the system become more time-consuming or more cumbersome. There will be a system of appeals against SIA decisions, as the noble Viscount said. Ultimately, there will be the availability of judicial review, but that would be additional to the right of appeal which is set up under the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-18_para2"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 23. We believe that the duties of the authority and the rights of individuals already exist within the drafting of the Bill or elsewhere <P>


<a name="column_623"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 623</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in existing statute or common law. Therefore, Amendment No. 23 would not add substantively to either the duties of one or the rights of the other. As the noble Viscount said, the security industry authority will, in common with other public bodies, have a general duty to act reasonably, including with appropriate care and skill.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-18_para3"></a>Similarly, individuals already have the right to take legal action where their rights have been infringed. We believe that individuals who consider themselves adversely affected by the decision not to grant a licence to undertake security activities or to modify or revoke their licences will, in addition to any more general rights of redress, have a specific right of appeal against the authority's decision.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-18_para4"></a>I hope that in the light of those explanations and assurances the noble Viscount will not press his amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-18_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for those explanations. She referred to a general right of appeal. I presume that she referred to Clause 10. As far as I can see, the Secretary of State has to make an order for the bringing in of appeals. I wonder whether she could answer my question on that. Is there a right of appeal elsewhere in the Bill or is it just in Clause 10 and has to be initiated by an order?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-18_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   The process of setting up and enacting the Bill on completion of its passage through Parliament is one that has to be phased through a series of orders by the Secretary of State, as we recognised earlier. The noble Lord, Lord Cope, recognised that there needs to be discussions with industry. That is why there is a process. The process of bringing into effect the matters referred to in Clause 10 is the one which I have outlined. I hope that that satisfies the noble Viscount. If it does not, I shall write to him with further clarification.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-18_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I think that means that the noble Baroness agrees with me that an appeal system will be brought in by order by the Government under Clause 10. We shall see what that order says. I give the Government due warning that if I am to withdraw my amendment now, we want them to take note of what has been said during this debate so that they may get right the order. Otherwise, we shall have to look at it. I am sure the noble Baroness will consider that.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-18_para5"></a>As regards Amendment No. 22, the comments of the noble Baroness satisfied me to a degree. I am not quite so happy with her reply to Amendment No. 23. It is always difficult for someone to obtain compensation. That is always a good test to put on anybody. Perhaps this should be dealt with by an order. It may not be right for it to be dealt with on the face of the Bill. I shall consider that point and read carefully what the noble Baroness said.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-18_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   It may assist the noble Viscount if I remind him that in responding I also said that the right of appeal is set up by the Bill. The procedures, details and timing are obviously part of the negotiations and discussions with the industry. However, the right of appeal is established.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-18_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for repeating her comments. My point is that we shall have to consider the nature and terms of appeal. As regards Amendment No. 23 and compensation, we shall have to consider whether we need to be specific. The noble Baroness said, quite reasonably, that the authority will have to have targets and turnaround times. We all know about government targets and turnaround times. We know how long it takes to reach targets, and about the targets for asylum seekers, which have not yet been met. I think that almost no turnaround time in government has ever been met by anybody. That was the same when we were in power, just as it is now. Perhaps it has become worse; perhaps not. Who knows?
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-18_para6"></a>It will be extraordinarily difficult for the authority to keep to its target. The only way it will do so is by having a long transitional period. Otherwise, it will never get through all the people who are to be covered by the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-18_para7"></a>I am grateful to the noble Baroness for her reply. I am somewhat satisfied by her reply to Amendment No. 22. I shall consider carefully whether I wish to come back on Amendment No. 23. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

("( ) The Authority shall state its reasons in writing, by reference to the criteria, for--

(a) a refusal to grant a licence under subsection (4), and
<BR>
(b) an imposition of additional conditions under subsection (6).").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "10130-18_para13"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 23A is linked to Amendment No. 23D. Under Clause 7, Amendment No. 23A is concerned with the refusal of a licence. Amendment No. 23D is concerned with Clause 9 and the revoking or modifying of a licence. All those are decisions which are likely to give rise to an appeal by the applicant--adverse decisions to him.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-18_para14"></a>I was pleased to hear the noble Baroness refer to the intention to create a transparent system here. The purpose of my Amendments Nos. 23A and 23D is to achieve transparency because it is necessary for the authority to state its reasons for a refusal on the one hand and the revocation or modification of an existing licence on the other. Those reasons should be given in <P>


<a name="column_625"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 625</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>writing and they should refer to the criteria which the Government have indicated are considered to be very important so that an appeal can be effective.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-18_para15"></a>A simple blank refusal of a licence without reasons or the modification or revoking of a licence without reasons would clearly be contrary to natural justice and probably to the rules appertaining to tribunals in any event. So those reasons should be given. I hope the noble Baroness considers this a sensible suggestion, and I await her response.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-18_spnew7"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   Before the noble Baroness replies, I should like briefly to say that we support the intentions of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, in his amendments. In these he might have gone a long way to satisfy the concerns which were behind our earlier amendments. Therefore I look forward to the Government's reply.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-18_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   Before the noble Baroness replies, I have said nothing about the proposed subsection (5). It seems to me that there is missing from the Bill a duty to notify the authority of matters which may lead to the modification or revocation of a licence. Two bodies are concerned: the police and the public. If the police hear of something adverse to the licence holder there should be an arrangement enabling the police to inform the authority of that so that consideration can be given to the continuation of the licence either as it exists or in some modified form.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-18_para16"></a>As for members of the public, no doubt they will have complaints against licence holders from time to time. How are they to be dealt with? It is no use writing to the authority if its response is, "I am sorry: we have no way in which we can give effect to your complaint." There must be some way in which the authority can respond to the proper concerns raised by members of the public in respect of their particular licence problem.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-18_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   I think all sides of the Committee share a concern that this system will work. We do not believe there is a need for the requirements to be on the face of the Bill. The establishment of an appeals mechanism against licence decisions by the authority will require the authority to state in all cases the reasons for a decision it has reached--a point which I hope will please the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford--and these must be set out very clearly against the criteria which it must also have published. The SIA will need to work closely with the police, as the noble Viscount recognised, and come to an operational understanding with them as to how to pass on relevant information. We believe that precise arrangements are best left to the authority, once established, and the police to decide that they are required to do this. We do not want to shackle the arrangements that will be reached in achieving the objectives we all share by prescribing them in detail on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-18_para17"></a>The authority will also wish to establish a complaints procedure against licence holders. In deciding whether to continue, modify or revoke a <P>


<a name="column_626"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 626</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>licence, the views of the public and customers of licence holders will, as your Lordships recognise, be an important factor. Therefore it is important for the authority to establish and publicise a complaints system. Again, we see no need to specify this as a requirement on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-18_para18"></a>I hope I have been able to give an assurance that will enable the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, to withdraw his Amendment No. 23A and not press Amendment No. 23D. I can assure both speakers in this short debate that the Government share their concern that this procedure should be absolutely clear and reassure them that the Bill requires that this process be followed.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-19_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   Before the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, replies may, I say that it seems to me rather a contradiction for the noble Baroness to say, "This is what we are going to do but we don't want to put in the Bill that we are going to do it." If the Government are going to do it, I do not see why it should not be in the Bill. I hope the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, will consider that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-19_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   Before the noble Viscount sits down, can I make it absolutely plain that the detail of how to achieve the objectives we all share, we believe, should not be on the face of the Bill. The requirement to provide that detail and to work closely with the police to make it work is a duty to be achieved by the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I have listened to the very helpful reply of the noble Baroness. I am not seeking for detail on the face of the Bill, as she will observe. So far as subsection (5) of Clause 9 is concerned, I am simply setting out the duty of the authority to do precisely what she says it is going to do. I do not think that that unduly clutters up the Bill. It is not detail, and it is not seeking in any way to impose a straitjacket upon the negotiations with the police or to prescribe precisely how complaints from the public are to be handled.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para0"></a>I should have thought that as a matter of public presentation a duty of this sort should be made absolutely clear because unless it is on the face of the Bill it is impossible for anybody to demand it of the authority, once set up. I shall think very long and hard about what the noble Baroness said. For the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="10130-19_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Brougham and Vaux </B>   rose to ask Her Majesty's Government what plans they have to ensure sufficient financial support for British competitors at the next Olympics.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I make no apology in begging to move the Motion standing in my name some three months after the event. And what an event it was for our men and women, boys and girls, at the Sydney Olympics, the Para Olympics and the World Junior Championships in Santiago.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para6"></a>I know that the whole House will join with me in congratulating all of the team. Our Olympic team surpassed all our expectations and, as we know, they won 22 gold, 10 silver and seven bronze medals, putting the team 10th in the medals table. Whilst we all measure Olympic success by the number of gold medals or the total number of medals won, overall Team GB achieved another 30 performances in the top six, including 12 fourth places. In addition, no fewer than 98 personal bests were set by our athletes.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para7"></a>What is more encouraging is the spread of the 11 medal winning sports compared to previous games. The Sydney Olympics were Team GB's most successful games for 80 years. It is more than obvious that lottery funding played a major part in our success. As Stephanie Cook said--and others too--"There is no way I could have achieved this standard without it."
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para8"></a>There is one other vital factor which helped our team and that is the facilities on the Gold Coast and in Brisbane which the British Olympic Association secured, organised, managed and funded. Athletes who used those facilities in 1999 and last year prior to the games indicated that the facilities, management and expertise available were crucial in enabling them to perform at their best.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para9"></a>However, if you consider the population of the UK and compare our results with those of other countries with a similar population, apart from the USA, Russia and China, there are five countries of a similar size which did better, or a lot better, than we did.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para10"></a>In 1960, after the Rome Olympics, Germany, which won precious few medals, set up training facilities up and down the country, as did France, both spending vast amounts on providing the right kind of environment to encourage their sports men and women to train and reach the high standards that they now have. Likewise, Australia, having won no gold medals in the Montreal games, was determined to create a sports institute. It nurtured 16 gold medallists in Sydney some 24 years later, placing Australia fourth on the medals table at the games.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para11"></a>In 1993-94, our lottery was started and by 1996-97 Sports England set up a programme of funding top athletes costing £60 million a year. It was the first World-Class Performance aimed at those who have a realistic chance of a medal. Then there is World-Class Potential for those who can win medals within 10 <P>


<a name="column_628"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 628</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>years. Lastly, there is World-Class Start, aimed at the young at school where our medal winners of the future will come from. We need school sport and physical education.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para12"></a>In a recent European survey we came bottom of the league. It showed that five years ago only 33 per cent of our young did two hours of physical education a week. The most recent survey showed that only 11 per cent did any. That has an affect on all our sports. It has been said that in a few years' time there will be no British football players because all the young do is sit in front of the television and eat junk food.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para13"></a>The Government's strategy, "A Sporting Future For All", proposes ensuring that the UK Sports Institute is fully operational by the summer of 2002. The Government also refer to the UKSI acting in partnership with the sports councils in order to co-ordinate the delivery of all these services to elite athletes. Also, my party's paper, A Future for Sports, refers to the UKSI and the need for "well co-ordinated centres of excellence".
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para14"></a>The UKSI, if properly funded and strategically organised on a UK basis, if delivering best practice at elite level and if encouraging the strategic development of much needed elite-level facilities, could have a profound and sustained impact on further improving the performance of British athletes for the next games. The Australian model, the Australian Institute for Sport, as I have said, offers an instructive guide.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para15"></a>The UK has 16 50-metre swimming pools but there is no Olympic-size pool in London capable of hosting an international meeting. The UK needs more Olympic-size pools and other elite facilities if British athletes and the country as a whole are to build on our collective success. Any new facilities must be built as part of a UK strategy. That will go some way to ensuring that there is no unnecessary concentration of facilities in any one home county or in any one area.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para16"></a>The policy to develop the UKSI should, however, be driven centrally so as to ensure a co-ordinated and British-driven approach. Devolution must not be allowed to dilute the effectiveness of this excellent initiative if we aspire to future success at the Olympic Games. A British philosophy must drive British sport and investment should reflect this focus.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para17"></a>Facilities should ideally be spread evenly throughout the UK. If athletes from all areas of the country are to be encouraged to participate, lottery funding and government support of elite-level Olympic athletes undoubtedly contributed to the British success in Sydney. However, if we are to build on our achievements at future games, as we must, levels of funding must be increased and not merely maintained.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para18"></a>In September last year, the Government guaranteed that the current level of funding for elite sports of £28 million per annum would be maintained. It remains to be seen whether that guarantee includes an indexation element. I hope that the Minister can give us some news on that in his reply.

<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para19"></a>The British Olympic Association aspires to build on our success in Sydney at future Olympic Games and aims to be placed even higher on the medal table in Athens. To do so will require not only increased levels of funding but also clear strategic leadership and direction for the distribution and use of those funds.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para20"></a>To improve on Britain's success at future Olympic Games, we must seek to raise the aspiration of school children by committing further funding and resources to developing sports facilities in schools and by offering school children, both male and female, incentives and added encouragement to take part in sport. Let us not only follow Australia's example but let us go one better and get into the top three of the medal table.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para21"></a>Finally, I thank all noble Lords who are taking part in this short debate and I and others outside look forward to the Minister's reply. I would also like to thank Sport England and the British Olympic Association for their help in preparing the debate.

<A NAME="10130-19_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   My Lords, we are indebted to the noble Lord, Lord Brougham and Vaux, for initiating the debate, not least because it gives the House the first opportunity, although belated, to congratulate Britain's Olympic athletes who performed so spectacularly well in Sydney.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para22"></a>It is also an opportunity for me to say how much I miss Lord Cowdrey of Tonbridge. He encouraged me to speak in the debate on school sport soon after I joined the House and he was a model of kindness and courtesy on that occasion. I certainly miss him a great deal and miss his presence in a debate such as this.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para23"></a>I intend to speak mainly about the new elite sports funding review group which the Government have set up under the chairmanship of Dr Jack Cunningham. The establishment of that body is most welcome but I want to hear from the Minister more about what it is doing and hopes to do. It seems to me that there a number of issues which it must address. The noble Lord, Lord Brougham, referred to one of the most important--the devolution issue. We must maintain a United Kingdom approach for as long as there is one team representing Britain at the Olympics rather than separate teams from England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para24"></a>The second issue is the quality and availability of world-class facilities for practising and competing. UK Sport needs to take the lead in strategy and planning and ensuring that the facilities are built as part of the same United Kingdom approach. The chief executive of the British Olympic Association, Simon Clegg, spoke to me, and I assume to a number of your Lordships, while I was preparing for the debate. He said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Achieving British success at future Olympic Games will depend largely on implementing a successful strategy to increase the funding available for UK distribution as opposed to home country distribution. This will ensure that smaller home country sports councils do not suffer at the expense of their larger better funded neighbours and that sufficient and appropriate facilities exist across the United Kingdom as a whole. When the country <P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-19_para25"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para26"></a>The third issue is the need to maintain and sustain funding levels for our elite athletes. Traditionally, they have received financial support from a variety of sources. I briefly mention the Foundation for Sport and the Arts with which I am associated as a trustee. My noble friend Lord Attenborough and the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon of Tara, also sit on that body. When the funding of that foundation was at a higher level than it is today it was able to provide substantial sums to Olympic athletes. Among many grants, it contributed sums of £39,000, £40,000 and £30,000 to individual athletes who competed in 1996 and 2000.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para27"></a>Obviously, today the main source of funding of Olympic athletes is the lottery, but there is some uncertainty about it. The level of funding will depend on the fluctuating sales of lottery tickets, unless it can be underwritten in some way by exchequer funds to guarantee stability. What will happen if lottery sales fall? Is there any possibility that a fixed sum of money rather than a percentage of lottery income can be guaranteed?
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para28"></a>The announcement of £750 million of National Lottery money for school community sports facilities was very welcome news. The investment of New Opportunities Fund money will start to provide funding for school sports facilities, which is long overdue, and may allow the Sports Lottery Unit to release additional funds for elite sport. But what will happen when the three-year NOF funding of school sports comes to an end? Is there not a risk that the Sports Lottery Fund will be squeezed and unable to fund elite athletes without having to reduce community sports funding?
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para29"></a>It is also important not to lose sight of the role of the 150,000 voluntary sports clubs, for it is as members of those organisations that many of Britain's Olympic medal winners learn to compete and succeed. It is also in those clubs that sports such as sailing, shooting, rowing and cycling are developed. Those sports produced seven of Great Britain's 11 gold medals in Sydney.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para30"></a>Finally, there is the question of whether we should again seek to host the Olympic Games in the United Kingdom. The benefits of doing so are enormous. The Spanish Government calculate that the Barcelona Olympics in 1992 were worth £7 billion to the country. Further, the staging of the games acts as a catalyst in improving a nation's sporting success. In its briefing the BOA refers to how many more medals a nation wins if one of its cities is chosen as host, South Korea and Australia being two particularly good examples.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para31"></a>Tonight I do not have time to enter the debate about the future of Wembley, other than to say that we shall require a first-class venue if we are serious about hosting any great international sporting event. However, it is important that in our pursuit of the long-term dream of staging the Olympics we do not lose sight of the need to ensure that our athletes are fully prepared and financially supported for the games in 2004.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-19_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, I welcome this debate initiated by my noble friend. Bearing in mind the Olympic motto that the important thing is to take part rather than to win, I cannot resist the temptation to participate. I do so, none the less, with considerable diffidence.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para32"></a>It is almost 50 years since I last took part in an Olympic Games and more than 50 years since I first participated. Matters have changed considerably since then. At that time the maximum prize that an individual could accept was £15. If one exceeded that one was cast into the outer darkness of professionalism. There was nothing by way of sponsorship at that time. The situation today is very different. The other side of the coin is that at that time there was no temptation to take drugs because all one tried to do was prove that one was better than other competitors. Once there is a degree of professionalism the temptation becomes very real. It is important that testing for drug abuse is improved, and I believe that if someone offends the disqualification should be permanent.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para33"></a>I echo my noble friend's congratulations in three categories. First, undoubtedly Sydney hosted quite the best Olympic Games ever. Secondly, congratulations should go to our athletes, who produced the best results for 80 years. Thirdly, we should also congratulate the British Olympic Association, which played such a vital role in ensuring that our athletes had facilities to enable them to compete successfully. Nowadays, one cannot hope to achieve Olympic standards, or to become part of an Olympic team, without the kind of back-up which the BOA provides. Understandably, the association concentrates on the need to ensure that so-called elite athletes manage to achieve the highest level.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para34"></a>However, the BOA also plays an important role as far as concern schools and so on. That raises the difficult question of funding. The Olympic Symbol etc. (Protection) Act 1995, of which I was a co-sponsor, has been of considerable importance in that context. Clearly, we need to ensure that our athletes have the best facilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para35"></a>I should like to make just three brief points, the first of which is one of my hobbyhorses. Despite all the excellent coaching and magnificent individual performances by our athletes in Sydney, both the men's and women's 4 x 110 teams were a failure. I believe that the reason for that was twofold. First, one member of the women's team said afterwards that the athletes had not trained together very much. That is of particular importance now that one can substitute another team member at different stages between heat, semi-final and final. Secondly, they continued to use the wrong method of changeover. The hand of the recipient was held up and the baton was held down, instead of the other way round, which would have avoided fumbling it. If one fumbles it one goes over the line.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para36"></a>I take up two important points made by noble Lords. First, I believe that the Olympic team should be a British team and not as some suggest, particularly <P>


<a name="column_632"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 632</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>those in another place, participants from England, Wales and so on. In the Commonwealth Games the teams are from England, Scotland, Wales and so on but the environment is very different from the Olympic Games. If we are to compete successfully at the Olympics it is crucial that we have a British team rather than teams from parts of the United Kingdom.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para37"></a>Finally, 2012 is probably the earliest that we can hope to host the Olympic Games. The last time the games were hosted in the UK was in 1948. Given the post-war environment, we did magnificently. Nowadays, enormous investment is required. The spin-off in terms of encouraging one's own athletes is enormous. I very much hope that that can be achieved. We need to plan now for the future, and it is important that the British Olympic Association is supported in that regard. I look forward to hearing my noble friend on the Front Bench whose father, together with the Marquess of Exeter, was such a tower of strength to the International Olympic Committee over the years. I also look forward to hearing the Minister.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-19_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for tabling this Question. I declare an interest as both an Olympian and president of a governing body of sport; namely, the British Bobsleigh Association.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para38"></a>The Sydney Olympics were a huge success by British standards, but we should not kid ourselves: we are not yet in the first division of Olympic medal winners. We came below such European countries as France, Germany and Italy. We have a long way to go, although we did extremely well. Congratulations should go to all our wonderful athletes and the BOA led by Simon Clegg.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para39"></a>A successful team needs long-term planning and investment at the right level. For success the elite level in UK sport needs continuous funding. The objective must be to fund a continuous flow of world-class athletes across the board and to plan that flow at three levels: the start, the potential and the elite. This should not be done at the expense of sport in the community and schools. The home country sports councils are responsible for community sport and the first two of those levels.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para40"></a>The Olympic charter requires us to compete as Great Britain and Northern Ireland until, and if, we move from devolution to independence. Success at Olympic level requires sustained focus year in and year out from all concerned. Devolution is the greatest threat to sustained Olympic focus. It will, and indeed has, led to fragmentation and duplication. Other countries are rationalising their structures while we are adding layers of bureaucracy as a result of devolution. It is possible that Ministers of devolved governments will consider success in Commonwealth Games more important for their country than success at the Olympics for the United Kingdom.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para41"></a>The British Academy of Sport, now the UK Sports Institute, set up by the previous government, was intended to be the hub for excellence. Unfortunately, it was recently moved to Sheffield. No one wanted to <P>


<a name="column_633"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 633</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>go there. It has since been downgraded. Therefore, we have a spoke in Sheffield, and I am not sure what we have, other than bureaucrats, in the institute.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para42"></a>To do as well, or better, in Greece than we did in Sydney, the funding for sport as a whole must be increased. In particular, the funding for elite athletes must remain, at a minimum, at the same level that it was for the run-up to Sydney. Under the present funding structure there is a significant gap. This is almost a direct result, I understand, of a reduction in lottery funding for sport from 20 per cent of lottery proceeds to 16.66 per cent. Can the Minister tell the House how the Government propose to fill that gap and create the necessary funding structure, cohesion and focus that is necessary to give our elite athletes a fair chance of winning gold in the next games? The Olympic Games are seriously commercial. They require long-term significant investment to reap the real rewards.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para43"></a>Before I sit down, I should like to follow the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner of Worcester, in paying my respects to my late friend Lord Cowdrey. It seems very strange to be speaking in a sporting debate without Colin beside us.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_time4"></A><H5>7.53 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-19_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Billingham: </B>   My Lords, I am delighted that the noble Lord, Lord Brougham and Vaux, has initiated this important debate. It gives us an opportunity to celebrate two outstanding successes: first, the success of our British athletes, both in the Olympics and the Paralympics in Sydney last year; and, secondly, that of our Government, whose strategy for sport has helped create such outstanding success, making our athletes the envy of the world.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para44"></a>The Government aim high. In contrast with the past, where success has been achieved despite the systems in place, we are pledged to long-term, all-round support. The benefit of this support is twofold: first, our athletes are now guaranteed a future where funding, facilities and technical support are of the highest quality and firmly in place; and, secondly, and equally important, there is support to inspire young people to take up sport, emulating their sporting heroes.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para45"></a>With a gold medal tally of 11 in Sydney it was the best performance by our athletes since the 1920 Olympics in Antwerp. Our other medals were equally impressive. I do not need to remind noble Lords that our Paralympic athletes did even better--131 medals, including 41 golds. We congratulate all the athletes who brought us such pleasure at the Olympic Games in Sydney.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para46"></a>But how did it happen? What was the magic formula, the magic ingredients? As other noble Lords have said, a major part was probably lottery funding. That was acknowledged by all the competitors. In the three years prior to the Sydney Olympics our athletes received £60 million from the Lottery. The Government are committed to continuing to build upon that success. Support is pledged through world-class programmes. The Sports Cabinet last October <P>


<a name="column_634"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 634</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>agreed to provide the Sports Council with £100 million over the next four years. Thus the long-term support is assured.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para47"></a>A few weeks ago I attended the all-party sports group in this House. We had an excellent presentation by Simon Clegg of the British Olympic Association and by Liz Nichol and Steve Cram. They are delighted with the Government's proactive and positive stance. The most difficult task ahead of them is making decisions on which sports will have what level of funding. Does success demand greater financial reward, or should the weakest be given more? Those are fortunately not questions for us, nor for the Government, but for those who run sport on our behalf. I am confident that their decisions will be wise and fair.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para48"></a>I want to flag up other positive initiatives from the Government aimed at helping sport. The UK Institute will provide expertise and training facilities which are so desperately needed. We are targeting schoolchildren with high-quality teaching and a much welcomed expansion of competitive sports. Yes, competitive sport is back in schools. For the first time we are giving money to build multi-purpose sports halls in primary schools. In short, school sport is being transformed from the miserable legacy of the previous government to one of which we can be quite rightly proud.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para49"></a>In conclusion, as a lifetime sports enthusiast, still playing tennis three times a week, and as a county selector for Oxfordshire, I am delighted to speak in this "good news" debate. I have absolute confidence that the nation's sporting future is perfectly safe in the Government's hands and that many more glittering prizes lie ahead.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_time5"></A><H5>7.57 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-19_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Lyell: </B>   My Lords, I am tempted to say "follow that". I am very grateful to my noble friend Lord Brougham and Vaux for giving us the opportunity this evening to debate this subject. I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Billingham, will have noted from the Speakers' List that there are two Olympians on the Benches in your Lordships' House. I can think of only one other Parliament which might have Olympians on its Benches, and that is Switzerland, but the Swiss take part in all kinds of different sports. It might be the same for the United States.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para50"></a>I was delighted that my noble friend Lord Higgins reminded me of his athletic achievements. I had not appreciated that he ran in shorts and singlet in two separate Olympiads. I took very much to heart his motto that taking part is the most important thing. I and many other noble Lords remember that every year when in January Members of the Lords and Commons Ski Club are shot out of a start gate in blinding snow down a slalom course which they cannot see. They are not like the "pussy-cats" in St Anton--or, perhaps as we might see next year in Salt Lake City--they really take part.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para51"></a>There cannot be many other legislatures in the world where one has a gold medallist sitting on its Benches. My noble friend Lord Higgins referred to 50 years ago. <P>


<a name="column_635"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 635</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Nearly 50 years ago I recall my noble friend who then, in Eton-speak, classified himself as "Mr Dixon". He was even then an all-round athlete, but in 1964 I recall with enormous pride and delight watching his efforts with Mr Nash in the bobsleigh in Innsbruck and bringing back gold medals for the United Kingdom. It proves what we see tonight and what we saw then; that it can be done. If an all-round athlete trains and works hard enough, even in the--I hesitate to call it--somewhat esoteric sport of bobsleighing he can reach the elite standard and win a gold medal.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para52"></a>I hope the Minister will take on board the last two words of the Question tonight, the "next Olympics". In case he thinks it is 2004, perhaps I may remind him that next year--2002--it is the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para53"></a>I happened to be watching Eurosport in Switzerland. There was a competition in a place called Soldier Hollow in Utah. It was cross-country skiing. I needed rehabilitation having watched these people charging around a 30-kilometre course at speeds that gave me the collywobbles while viewing the television. I hope that the Minister will have something good to say about the Winter Olympics. I hope to have some good news about what the Winter Olympics Association can do for the athletes in bob, luge, alpine skiing, biathlon and ski-jumping and something fascinating called the Nordic combination. One of my noble friends thought it was some form of winter underwear. I am given to understand that it is a group of brave people who go around a 15-kilometre cross-country skiing course and then take off down a 70-metre ski jump. I do not like looking at Olympic ski-jumping on television, let alone putting on cross-country skis.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-19_para54"></a>I hope that the Minister will have good news as to how the British Olympic Association can be given some assistance in terms of government help and, above all, ideas. We have been reminded of the situation by the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, and, in the past by Lord Cowdrey. I hope that the Minister will tread lightly if he gives any predictions. The Minister may recall that we had a sporting debate in April. On that particular evening my noble friend made a powerful speech. The Minister said that he had news for us. He thought we were all waiting for the result of a mighty football match. He told us Manchester United 3: Real Madrid 2. We went outside to find Black Rod rending his garments, saying that it was the other way round. I hope that the Minister will take immense care when he gives any predictions this evening. I hope that when the figures come out he will be able to give us his ideas on how the British Olympic Association can be given government support both in terms of finance and ideas.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-20_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, we all owe a debt of gratitude to the noble Lord, Lord Brougham, for initiating this debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-20_para0"></a>I have one small caveat. The thought of competition as exemplified by the Olympics might be a better phrase. It is always easy to sit back and say that we did <P>


<a name="column_636"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 636</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>well and we must go forward. One forgets the other games. The Commonwealth Games have been mentioned; there are European Championships and World Championships in which to take part. It is on-going. The fact that it is on-going and will continue after the next Olympics is probably the most important factor in this debate. We should make sure that athletes for the future, with a life style that is focused and dependent on competing at these events, get through and try to achieve their best. They should be able to get through and be educated to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-20_para1"></a>For the first time we have something that allows that to happen. Someone said to me that it was something that others had been doing for over two decades, and we have been fairly slow. Along with the Australians, who felt that winning nothing was humiliating, finally we seem to have got our act together after a couple of disasters. For far too long we have allowed our sporting pride to be nurtured by the odd burst of brilliance here and there. The brilliant will always emerge. We merely try to give them a few extra hurdles to jump over. At last we are giving these people a chance to compete consistently. The answer is consistency. The National Lottery has been seen as the crock of gold that is allowing this to happen. Unfortunately, since the National Lottery has been in existence the good causes that drink from this bountiful cup have grown. The amount of money available is becoming smaller. Initially, it made far more money than people expected. We said that we should do something else. In the original debates it was said that this was designed not to supplement taxation but to be extra money on top. We have already crossed the line, where certain things we expect the Treasury to have financed out of public taxation have come from the lottery. It was inevitable, but I did not think it would happen this quickly. The slices are becoming awfully thin. If the cake disappears we are in trouble.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-20_para2"></a>I attended a conference about sport and health at the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in December 2000. The Secretary of State for Culture and a Minister from the Department of Health attended. They both said that sport is great and that the lottery helps. It reduces the necessity for ideas to limit spending in other departments. It is good in itself. It gives people motivation. Unless we are prepared to guarantee that funding, even if it means funding something out of taxation, some of these good results will disappear: the incentive to do well, the bonus of feeling good about something and of achievement and a healthy life style by playing sport at any level. Let us face it, the designer label lycra culture does not drag many people to sport long term. Aerobics does not do it, but possibly playing tennis and enjoying it, as the noble Baroness, Lady Billingham, said, will keep one fitter and healthy for longer. Certainly, it is a better strategy. Is that something that would be helped by these achievements? It is good in itself and it gives society a bonus by having a lower burden on the National Health Service.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-20_para3"></a>We are here to encourage the Government to make sure that we do not drop this ball in our hands. I use an analogy from my sport; the try line is not that far <P>


<a name="column_637"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 637</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>away. The only thing we can do is to fall over our own feet but let us make sure that we do not undo our laces on the way there. We have to make sure that we give it a bonus.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-20_para4"></a>I make a comment about the national dilution from the sports councils. We have to recognise that the culture of sport is very important. If certain people in certain sports regard the fact that they should have Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland or England represented separately, we have to accept that that will happen. The culture of sport is something one cannot remove. It is ultimately more important that an athlete gets to the Olympics in the best shape to compete rather than whose jersey he is wearing when he takes part. I leave your Lordships with that one thought.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Luke: </B>   My Lords, I echo the words of noble Lords in thanking my noble friend Lord Brougham for initiating this short but important debate. I feel daunted by the Olympians behind me. I miss my noble friend Lord Cowdrey.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-20_para5"></a>I have a personal interest to declare. As my noble friend Lord Higgins mentioned, my father was a representative member of the International Olympic Committee in Britain for many years and a member of the Finance Committee of the IOC for much of that time. He would have been immensely proud of the games in Sydney, not only because of the great success of British athletes but also the universal praise the organisation and presentation of the games achieved.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-20_para6"></a>It is now the right time to tap into the interest of the British people, so very well nurtured by the BBC presentation, and to start thinking about four years hence. We must look at where we could do better. The answer is everywhere. Despite our successes in Sydney, as mentioned by my noble friends Lord Brougham and Lord Glentoran, our average number of medals compared to population is not very good.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-20_para7"></a>The services have become a great deal better recently but are still lacking. Swimming and diving have been two of our best post-war successes in the Olympics but not at Sydney. We need many more pools. There is no Olympic-sized pool in reach of London. Why not? Surely that is a priority. To compete against the rest of the world, let alone to win against the best in the world, requires continual upgrading of facilities and coaching at all levels, upwards from young children. All these requirements cost, and continue to cost, increasing amounts of money. In my view, the advent of lottery funding, effectively from 1996, under a Conservative Government is the significant factor in our performance in Sydney, as my noble friend Lord Brougham said. Can the Minister clarify for me the press speculation on the amounts available in the next two or three years? Can he also comment on whether the Government agree with Sir Rodney Walker, speaking as chairman of UK Sport, when he said that unless the Government provided more money, funding for sport would decrease from next year?.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-20_para8"></a>Facilities need to be widely and properly spread across the UK. It is essential that Sport England uses this criterion above all in its decisions regarding the <P>


<a name="column_638"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 638</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>distribution of lottery funds. So perhaps I may mention to your Lordships the case of the rowing lake in Bedfordshire of which I spoke briefly in my Second Reading speech on the Culture and Recreation Bill. It has had its request for funding turned down for what seemed to me to be very inadequate reasons. It is really well placed to provide facilities for middle England rowing--not on the Thames--and to provide help for Bedford itself, which is shortly to be joined to the Grand Union canal, thereby making competitive rowing on the Great Ouse almost impossible. The situation is delicate, with a decision on appeal expected very soon. Support for it is right across the board. The original application was submitted in April 1997. This initiative fits exactly into the criteria we have been discussing and includes a catchment area of 3.5 million people. I hope that the Government will take due note and employ their influence.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-20_para9"></a>One of the great successes at Sydney was cycling. The main reason for that was the existence of the Manchester velodrome. Are there plans to build any more? Certainly, I suggest, London will not host the 2012 games without one. Indeed, does London have any Olympic-standard facilities at the moment? Getting the games to London in 2012 will do more to focus the attention of aspiring athletes of all ages and to all sports than anything else.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-20_para10"></a>The coming on stream in 2002 of the United Kingdom Sports Institute is very important, as is continuing support for the British Olympic Association. It would also be very helpful if the Government could redress their broken promises to protect playing fields, particularly school playing fields. During the year April 1999 to March 2000 some 646 applications for development on playing field sites were made. Where are the revised planning and policy guidelines on sport and recreation? Money is short, so when will the £20 million paid to help provide athletics facilities at Wembley be returned, or is there another U-turn on this matter?
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-20_para11"></a>There were 98 best personal performances at Sydney by British athletes in many fields. Getting the games to London in 2012 would be wonderful. But when will the Government sort out the Wembley Picketts Lock situation and give urgent priority to the badly needed facilities in London and elsewhere? I look forward, as always, to the noble Lord's reply.

I congratulate him on attracting such a distinguished group of speakers, including, as has been said, distinguished players and competitors. We do indeed miss Colin Cowdrey. I assume that Mr Hague needs the noble Lord, Lord Coe, so much these days that he could not spare him for this debate. I personally regret that.

<a name="column_639"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 639</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should have been--with the medal winners deserving particular praise. We look forward not only to the 2004 Olympics in Athens but also--pace the noble Lord, Lord Lyell--to the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. I shall not forecast whether we will have any success, but we do have six Winter Olympics competitors in the top world 100 compared with only one a couple of years ago. The British Olympic Association is setting up a training camp in Calgary, Alberta, comparable to the Gold Coast camp which existed before the Sydney Olympics. It can be said, without making any forecasts, that we are taking that seriously.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-20_para13"></a>As will become clear during the course of my remarks, we have high aspirations for sport in this country. We take the view that sporting success is important for the country. It lifts morale and brings the country together. It captivates the imagination of our young people and encourages them to participate and emulate sports people.

<A NAME = "10130-20_para14"></a>In congratulating those who took part in the Sydney Olympics and Paralympics, I can only repeat the highlights of what has already been said. The medal haul of 11 golds was the best performance since 1920. We secured 28 medals in total. We were 10th in the final medals table, the best since Los Angeles in 1984. Of course, it is never good enough and it is true that we are still behind some countries with smaller populations. But this is very considerable progress. The Sydney Paralympics were the best ever games so far. Great Britain and Northern Ireland won 131 medals--41 gold, 43 silver and 47 bronze, and we gained second place in the overall medals table. That is worthy of congratulations. I join the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, and others in congratulating the British Olympic and the British Paralympic associations, the coaches, the performance directors, the physios, the doctors and all those who took part. I join the noble Lords, Lord Higgins and Lord Luke, in agreeing that Sydney was outstanding as a venue for the games.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-20_para15"></a>What do the Olympics and the Paralympics teach us? They teach us that investment in sport works. I hope to be able to say something helpful about that. It is not simply enough to carry on as before--even with the significant investment we are now making. We need to learn the lessons of Sydney in order to provide the maximum benefit. Kate Hoey has had meetings with the British Olympic Association and the chief executives and performance directors of the Olympic sports to identify the lessons learnt from Sydney and to discuss how the support to our athletes can be improved. She was also at the training camp in the Gold Coast before the Sydney games to hear at first hand from athletes, coaches, sports scientists and others. I am sure that she would have been glad to hear the expert advice of the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, on the hand-over in the relay, although I do not think that it is quite the job of the Sports Minister to intervene in that way.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-20_para16"></a>My right honourable friend Jack Cunningham is to lead a review of the World Class Programmes structure and funding, to which my noble friend Lord <P>


<a name="column_640"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 640</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Faulkner referred, and the relationship with the developments taking place with the UK Sports Institute. The review will report back by mid-2001. The terms of reference and membership of the group were published in the Official Report. My noble friend Lord Faulkner would like to hear more on this issue. I could go on about it for a long time but I shall say that the review body met only today. It has been in active contact with the home countries. It has already talked to Sam Galbraith, the Minister with responsibility for sport in Scotland. Tomorrow, it is going to Wales to meet the Sports Council. I hope that that whets my noble friend's appetite.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-20_para17"></a>I acknowledge that devolution and the issue of what national teams are fielded are significant matters. But I do not think that it is a defect. I know that some people call for teams to be either more local or less local. But I do not think that the way we are organising support for sport has been adversely affected by devolution. It is right for the noble Lords, Lord Brougham and Lord Glentoran, to say that we should not let devolution damage our chances. However, I think that the distinction which has been made; namely, of UK responsibility for elite athletes--those who will compete in the Olympics and other international competitions--and most other aspects of sport, including the Commonwealth Games, coming within devolution seems to be working fairly well.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-20_para18"></a>In order to ensure that it does work well, we have set up the Sports Cabinet which brings together the Ministers responsible for sport in the four parts of the United Kingdom under the chairmanship of the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. The chairs of the five Sports Councils may be invited to attend the meeting, as may others. They met for the first time in November 1998. The next meeting is to be held on 16th February. That meeting is succeeding in its efforts to co-ordinate the work of all of the devolved administrations as well as of the Westminster Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-20_para19"></a>On the subject of funding, of course the lottery is probably the most significant individual factor. Funding from the lottery has made an enormous difference. In view of the remarks made by the noble Lord, Lord Addington, I do not think we need fear that the amounts are getting smaller. It is still the case that amounts going to good causes are greater than the £9 billion originally anticipated. Sport is receiving money not only from the original sports scheme; it also receives an enormous amount from the New Opportunities Fund.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-20_para20"></a>In the three years leading up to the Sydney games, more than £60 million of lottery awards was given to the programme for British Olympic and Paralympic sports. Home countries also supported home country-based sports, Sport England world class programmes, Wales Elite Cymru and Scotland and Northern Ireland's talented athletes programmes. In response to those who expressed fears that these initiatives might not continue, last October the Sports Cabinet agreed to continue the World Class Performance Programme at least at its current level of funding. That will provide <P>


<a name="column_641"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 641</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>UK sport with £100 million over the next four years for the UK element of the programme. The record of lottery funding is unassailable.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-20_para21"></a>I do not think that the noble Lord, Lord Luke, will expect me to comment on individual applications such as the rowing lake in Bedfordshire. Indeed, that would breach the arm's length principle which the Opposition have been at pains to defend, with some reason.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-20_para22"></a>I turn now to the UK Sports Institute, referred to and welcomed in particular by my noble friend Lady Billingham. In addition to direct financial support, elite athletes and governing bodies benefit from the facilities and services of the UK Sports Institute, which is not based in Sheffield. It is only one of the centres, contrary to what was originally intended. The institute consists of 10 regional networks in England, along with national network centres in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It will be fully operational by the summer of 2002. A central services team is in place, which provides sports with technical, operational and programme support services. We are investing £120 million in 80 facilities for the English Institute of Sport network. Over £80 million of new lottery funding has so far been committed by Sport England, with most of the remaining lottery applications--over £40 million--to be made over the next six months. Comparable figures are available for Scotland and Wales.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-20_para23"></a>I turn now to what is a proper concern of the debate; namely, Exchequer funding. The spending review announced Exchequer funding for sport effectively to be doubled to £102 million by 2003-04. Of course, the advantage of having three-year expenditure figures is well recognised. Under those circumstances, the question put by the noble Lord, Lord Brougham and Vaux, as regards whether this is to be index linked rather takes a back seat. In any case, the expenditure is linked to a review of programme success rather than to any other measure.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-20_para24"></a>Furthermore, I challenge the statement made by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, that there is a gap in the funding. I have said that we are committed to continuing world-class funding. All these issues are included in the Cunningham review. Our investment will produce a major step-change in children's participation in sport through high quality sports teaching and coaching, as well as the expansion of competitive sports in schools. I address that remark in particular to my noble friend Lady Billingham.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-20_para25"></a>As regards the issue of anti-doping raised by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, the Government are funding the UK sports testing programme and will continue to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-20_para26"></a>The situation on playing fields is simply not true. Under the last government, we were losing 40 playing fields a month. We are now losing three playing fields a month. Those fields are almost all related to schools which no longer exist or which no longer require them.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-20_para27"></a>I should like to have spent more time discussing schools sport and grass-roots support for sports. Although the Question concerns the next Olympics, if <P>


<a name="column_642"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 642</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>we are to look further ahead we must consider not only support for those who are already elite athletes, but also those who will come from our schools and move into sporting excellence over the coming years. As I said, we are committed to strengthening schools sport at every level. We are spending £120 million to set up a network of 1,000 school sports co-ordinators by 2004. The first 145 were appointed in September last year. We aim to designate 150 specialist sports colleges by 2003. Already 83 have been designated in England. We are spending £130 million to develop the new Spaces for Sports and Arts facilities on primary school sites; £580 million from the New Opportunities Fund to strengthen the foundation of sport across England by building and refurbishing PE and sports facilities in over 1500 schools; £50 million from the New Opportunities Fund for outdoor adventure activities; £22 million from the New Opportunities Fund Green Spaces initiative--all of these real developments which ought to be recognised.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-20_para28"></a>As regards the national curriculum, to which several noble Lords referred, I must refer to the announcement made on 11th January that there is no longer merely an aspiration but an entitlement to two hours of sport and physical education a week. All that stands apart from what is being done for sport in the New Deal.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-20_para29"></a>If I continue for two minutes, we shall be able to avoid adjourning during pleasure. I hope that that is acceptable to noble Lords. I should like to say a few words about the next Olympic bid, a matter referred to by the noble Lords, Lord Brougham and Vaux, Lord Higgins and Lord Luke. My noble friend Lord Faulkner mentioned his dream of staging the Olympics in Great Britain. Of course, the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, remembers his participation in the 1948 games held in London. I recall those games as a mere schoolboy spectator. It was enormously exciting and it would be wonderful to see the Olympics held here once again.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-20_para30"></a>So far the department has seen only a draft of the British Olympic Association's report which is to be presented to Ministers in February. It indicates the substantial level of public infrastructure investment--billions of pounds worth--which will be needed to stage an Olympic Games. The association has not yet taken a decision on whether to bid for the Olympics in 2012 or later. The decision rests with the association, which has already stated that any UK bid would have to be based on London. We have not yet taken any decision as regards whether to support such a bid. We have a manifesto commitment which states that we shall continue to work with national and international bodies to try to attract more major events to the UK. We also remain committed to supporting a viable bid for the Olympic Games. However, at the moment the ball is firmly in the court of the British Olympic Association.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-20_para31"></a>We share the great pleasure expressed from all quarters of the House over the success of our athletes and players at Sydney, both in the Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games. I hope it is clear that we have practical programmes in place for the next Winter <P>

<P>
<A NAME="10130-21_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley </B>   moved Amendment No. 24:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 9, insert the following new clause--
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-21_para6"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><center><B>APPEALS</B></center><BR>
(" .--(1) A person aggrieved by a decision made by the Authority in his case in relation to the granting, refusal, revocation or modification of a licence may appeal, within three months of the date of the decision to the magistrates' court for the area in which he resides, against such grant, refusal, revocation or modification of the licence.
<BR>
(2) The Lord Chancellor may by order make provision for the procedure to be followed on any appeal under this section, including concerning the disclosure of documents or evidence, and such an appeal shall be held in public except to the extent that the interests of justice require otherwise.
<BR>
(3) Magistrates hearing an appeal under this section shall have it in their discretion to make such order as to costs as they see fit, subject to the presumption that the costs of a successful appeal should be paid by the Authority.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "10130-21_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: It is suggested that with the new clause we should discuss Amendments Nos. 25, 25A, 26, 27, 27A, 29 and 31. This group of amendments is concerned with the appeal system. It is a very important group, not least because people's jobs and businesses are involved and depend on the decisions taken. It is important that there should be an appeal system, not least in connection with human rights and so on, but also it is not a small matter to the individuals involved; it affects their livelihood and their businesses.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-21_para8"></a>The Bill provides in Clause 10 that the Secretary of State "may" provide for an appeal against refusal of a licence. Under Clause 17 he "may" provide for an appeal relating to a Clause 14 application in respect of approvals of businesses. The Bill states both that the Secretary of State "may" provide for an appeal, and that if he decides to do so he "may" do it by setting up a tribunal. I am not sure what other way there is to provide for an appeal, but it is expressed as "may".
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-21_para9"></a>That is the first point, which runs through several of the amendments. Our amendments relating to appeals all use the word "shall" instead of "may". So does the Liberal Democrat amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, Amendment No. 25A, which is <P>


<a name="column_644"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 644</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>confined to that point. The same point--and a very important one--runs through all our amendments of this character.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-21_para10"></a>It is essential that there should be an appeal. What is more, it is very important that the procedure should be established before the process goes active. People will be applying for licences. No doubt some will be granted them and some will be refused them. Before people are required to have a licence to carry out these activities, they must be able to appeal, if they think they have good grounds, and to have their appeal dealt with, so that either they do or do not have a licence on the day when it becomes statutorily essential to have a licence to carry out their job, whatever activity it is.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-21_para11"></a>Therefore, it is important that there should be an appeal, and also that the procedure should be set up in time, before the Bill takes effect in the various sections of the security industry. To say in the Bill that the Secretary of State "may" set up appeals, if he feels like it, is not sufficient.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-21_para12"></a>The next point to come out of the amendments is this: who is to set up the appeal system in the first place, and who is to supervise it? There are three suggestions in the Bill and these amendments. The first suggestion, in the Bill, is that the Secretary of State should do so. The second, in Amendments Nos. 25 and 31, is that the Lord Chancellor should be responsible for setting up the tribunal; laying down the lines on which it is to operate; how the parties are to be allowed to present their cases; what should happen about costs and disclosure of documents; and all the other matters necessary for ensuring that the appeals tribunal is a fair mechanism for arriving at a decision.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-21_para13"></a>The word "tribunal", which is what the Bill suggests the Secretary of State should set up, has a legal ring to it. We think of a tribunal as being something within a legal framework. Given its important responsibilities, it should be properly set up, with proper rules about who may appear before it and whether they will be represented and what documents various parties should have to disclose in the course of an appeal. We have already discussed whether the authority should give its reasons for decisions to refuse a licence, so that the grounds of appeal are known, but it is also important that documents should be made available so that a proper and fair appeal can take place, since people's jobs and businesses are involved, and that the question of costs be dealt with.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-21_para14"></a>Given this legal tone, it is important that the tribunal is properly set up in legal terms. The right person to do that is really the Lord Chancellor, who would give authority to the tribunal by being involved. His involvement would also make sure that the rules that applied in the conduct of an appeal were in line with those of other tribunals for which he is responsible.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-21_para15"></a>In case that proposal does not take the Government's fancy as an improvement on the Secretary of State's doing it, we have put up another alternative in the new clause set out in Amendment No. 24, which is the lead amendment in the group because it comes first in numerical order. The <P>


<a name="column_645"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 645</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendment provides for an appeal not to a separate tribunal, but to an existing tribunal: the magistrates' court. The advantage of the magistrates' court is that its members are knowledgeable about the local scene where the activity is to take place. They are knowledgeable, too, by their nature, about the local characters who will sometimes be involved, particularly characters who have got into trouble. They will have a feel for the situation. They exist, they have rules, they have all the necessary clerks, premises and everything else to hear cases, and they have some very similar responsibilities, as we have already discussed in relation to earlier amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-21_para16"></a>Those are the three basic options before the Committee at the moment: first, that the Secretary of State should set up a tribunal; secondly, that the Lord Chancellor should set up a full legal tribunal; and, thirdly, that a case should go to the existing tribunal, the magistrates' court.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-21_para17"></a>Other amendments in this group also refer to appeals. Amendment No. 26 provides that, whatever kind of appeal tribunal the Committee settles upon--whether it is Secretary of State, Lord Chancellor or magistrates' court--the decisions should be appealable both from the authority itself, which is what the Bill provides, and also from local authority decisions. We know that some decisions to grant licences and so on will be delegated to local authorities. I have no greater faith in local authorities than I have in the new authority. It is important that there should be a right of appeal against decisions made by the local authority in these cases as well as appeals against decisions of the security industry authority. This is a quite separate point from which tribunal is to be given the job. I hope that the amendment is so drafted as to apply to whichever tribunal is in charge of these matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-21_para18"></a>Amendment No. 27 again embodies a separate point--whether there is an appeal only if the licence or permission, whatever it is, has been refused; whether there is no appeal if the licence has been granted. In some cases there might be, quite properly, an appeal when a licence is granted. For example, if the police thought that a particular individual was not suitable for a licence but, nevertheless, he was granted one by the security industry authority or by the local authority, as the case may be, the police may wish to appeal against it if they considered it wholly wrong that a licence should be granted. At the moment the appeal procedure is entirely a one-way street. It can only operate if a licence or permission is refused.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-21_para19"></a>In addition, a person who is granted a licence with various conditions may feel that he wants the conditions altered, in which case he may want to appeal even though a licence has been granted. I am not sure, quite frankly, whether he can appeal under the Bill as drafted.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-21_para20"></a>That brings me on to Amendment No. 27A, which stands in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. The amendment seeks to make clear that the tribunal--whichever tribunal it is--can change the conditions of a licence as well as uphold a refusal or <P>


<a name="column_646"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 646</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>grant a licence. Again, that is important. It should not be, as it were, a yes or no answer; it may be a slightly more grey answer resulting from a more grey appeal in cases where it is not the granting of the licence that is wrong but the conditions attached to it. Amendment No. 27A is also a different point, but it is important.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-21_para21"></a>Amendment No. 29, on the other hand, is simply consequential. All it seeks to do is to ensure that the words "local authority", which would be inserted by Amendment No. 26, are defined. I am aware that this is, in one sense, in the wrong place. If we were to accept Amendment No. 26, the consequential amendment would move the definition of "local authority" into Clause 22, the main definitions clause, rather than simply altering the wording here. I am against having a definition which applies to more than a section hidden away in the middle of the Bill. It is more convenient if the definitions are all in the definition section at the end. It is very much a subsidiary point. Whether we need to extend the definition depends on whether or not we can persuade the Government to agree to Amendment No. 26 or something like it.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-21_para22"></a>I have made a variety of points, all relating to the very important question of appeals. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I listened carefully to what the noble Lord said. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, wishes to speak at this point, but it may well help the Committee if I indicate that I intend to make a confession. I am happy to explain now.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-22_para0"></a>Perhaps I may say for the record that I understand the concerns behind the amendments. The noble Lord wants to make explicit on the face of the Bill the fact that an appeals mechanism will be established to deal with a range of SIA activities. This issue is quite complex and there are a number of related matters. The noble Lord was kind enough to say that he was providing us with three options. I am not going to say at the Dispatch Box which option I prefer, although I will say that we are not drawn towards using the magistrates' courts.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-22_para1"></a>I should like to take away the propositions in the amendments and bring back at Report stage something which will certainly satisfy the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Cope, and, I suspect, of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas. We fully recognise that there must be a right of appeal. I intimated that at Second Reading. I said then that we would bring a mechanism forward under Clauses 10 and 17. I should like to consider how best to do that.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-22_para2"></a>We were at one stage, particularly with regard to appeals from local authority decisions, considering having those heard within the security industry authority itself. Having heard the noble Lord, Lord Cope, I am no longer entirely satisfied that that would be the most appropriate way of dealing with the issue. But I should make the point that I am not convinced that we necessarily would want to set this up within the ambit of the Lord Chancellor; we would prefer to leave it with the Secretary of State.
<P>


<a name="column_647"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 647</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-22_para3"></a>However, I can confirm that we would like to bring forward a proposal for an independent tribunal; I can confirm that we are happy to take on board, in spirit, the points that have been made today; and I can also confirm that, having agreed to go in that direction, we will take into consideration the licensing matters currently in the remit of the local authority decision-making process. That will lead to a consequential amendment, probably with an effect similar to that of Amendment No. 29.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-22_para4"></a>If the Committee is happy to leave it to us to bring forward proposals at Report stage, I shall be happy to consult with noble Lords on the shape of those proposals so that we are very much in spirit with what has been said in the debate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for that indication. We shall wait to see what he wishes to bring forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-22_para5"></a>Perhaps I may make this point for him to consider. When we were debating Amendment No. 22, he will recall that the Government were not anxious to give to the applicant an opportunity to respond to the grounds upon which it was proposed to refuse a licence. The reason given for that was that there was an appeals process. That means that, on the appeals process, for the first time the applicant will have his say on the objections that are being made to his having a licence for whatever activity. This becomes a justiciable question. Points will be put by both sides and a tribunal, however it is constituted, will have to decide precisely between the balancing forces; the objections and the responses to it. It is very much a thing for a tribunal to do.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-22_para6"></a>I noted that the Minister did not consider the Lord Chancellor as appropriate and preferred to rely on the Secretary of State. The machinery for setting up the tribunal is in the hands of the Lord Chancellor anyway. He is the person who keeps the list of people who are suitable for appointment to tribunals of various kinds. It is his department that is concerned with setting up rules that will meet the criteria of the human rights legislation--rules regarding fair hearing and so on. I should have thought that from a practical point of view it would be right for the Lord Chancellor to set up the tribunal and lay down the rules. In that regard I support the amendments proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Cope. I make these points in welcoming the Minister's announcement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-22_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, I, too, welcome the Minister's remarks. I suggest that as an earnest of his good faith and his intention to do this he might accept the Liberal Democrats' Amendment No. 25A--it is the most modest of the amendments in this group; it seeks to substitute "shall" for "may". That does not close off any of the other points.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-22_para7"></a>I hope that the Minister will give serious consideration to the Lord Chancellor being responsible for the tribunals. The noble Lord, Lord <P>


<a name="column_648"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 648</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Thomas of Gresford, set out the reasons in support of my proposals, although with much greater legal knowledge.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-22_para8"></a>I took the Minister to say that the Government were more or less decided that the appeal should apply against local authority decisions. I shall not necessarily hold him to that; however, it is clearly the way that his mind is working, which I very much welcome. Amendment No. 27A ought to commend itself as well--it would allow the tribunal, whichever it is, to make changes in the conditions.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-22_para9"></a>Finally, to make the point clear, it is my belief that the provision regarding the tribunal that is set up ought to apply equally to decisions on licences under Clause 14, as well as to other licensing decisions made under this clause. Clearly, the tribunal will acquire some expertise in the matter and can make decisions on both matters. So two groups of tribunals are covered by this group of amendments and will, I hope, be covered by the noble Lord when he considers these matters.

<P>

In saying that, I shall not commit the Government to points in the amendments as they stand; however, I hope that we can have further discussions and arrive at a point of agreement. We are at one in wanting to design a simple, effective and cost-effective appeals mechanism that works to the benefit of the industry and satisfies local authority interests as well. That is where matters stand and we shall be in touch.

<A NAME = "10130-22_para15"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment deals with a simple point. At Second Reading, I drew attention to the fact that between the publication of the White Paper and Second Reading, the proposed fees for licences had virtually doubled. Instead of the authority charging,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"such fee as it considers reasonable",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-22_para16"></a>
which is how the matter is presently phrased in Clause 11(5), the wording should be "a reasonable fee". That introduces an objective standard in relation to the fee that is being imposed.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-22_para17"></a>One does not want to place too great a burden on the industry by upping the fees until the whole thing is self-financing from the beginning. It may ultimately <P>


<a name="column_649"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 649</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>become self-financing, but I do not think it sensible to start in that way. My Amendment No. 43A to Schedule 1 makes the same point. The amendment seeks to replace the phrase,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"such charges as it considers appropriate",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-22_para18"></a>
with "reasonable charges"--again introducing some kind of objective standard into the cost of the whole scheme. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-22_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   I support what the noble Lord has said. Over the past few weeks I have detected rising concern in the industry regarding the potential costs of this provision. Admittedly, that does not always sit well with the industry asking for the powers to be further extended; nevertheless there is concern about the cost, because it will ultimately be borne by the customer. As has been said, the proposed cost has escalated from £23 for a personal licence, as was set out in the White Paper just over 12 months ago, to more than double that--to £50 to £60 per person.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-22_para19"></a>This is not an industry with high profit margins. On the contrary, sections of it, particularly the "guarding" part of it, have low profit margins. They have no alternative but to pass costs on to the customer. That is the danger facing those areas of the industry. That is why the authority should not be the ultimate decision-making body as to what is in all circumstances a "reasonable" fee that people can be expected to bear.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-22_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   We consider it important that the security industry authority acts responsibly and sets all its fees at a reasonable level. Members of the Committee will have judged from my demeanour and approach during the course of these debates that we seek to introduce a "lean and mean" regulatory machine. We are not keen on extending the weight of regulatory enterprise, nor do we seek to overburden the industry. Therefore, we want the fees to be kept at a necessary minimum--I want that to be clearly understood on the public record. Fees will be kept to a level sufficient to enable the authority to be self-financing as a regulatory body. Therefore, the degree to which we can narrow the need for regulation will enable the SIA to keep its fees to a lower level.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-22_para20"></a>We consider, however, that there are already a number of safeguards against excessive charging built into the Bill. Under the Bill's provision, the SIA is, for example answerable to the Secretary of State; it is required to comply with directions given to it by him. There are also other financial controls. The authority will be required to produce an annual statement of accounts for the Secretary of State and the Auditor General, both of which will have to be laid before Parliament for scrutiny and debate. We believe, therefore, that the Bill already contains adequate mechanisms to prevent any excessive charging.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-22_para21"></a>It is perhaps worth further clarifying how the initial setting up costs of the SIA will be met. It obviously cannot be self-financing from the beginning. The start-up costs will be funded by the Home Office. However, it is our intention to recoup these costs over a longer period of time so that they are spread out. The fee of <P>


<a name="column_650"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 650</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>£35--perhaps as much as £40 on our current estimate--is for a licence usually lasting three years. We therefore feel that the burden is not excessive. Through the reporting and scrutiny process, pressure will be applied to ensure a lean and efficient regulatory body. We undertake at the outset to provide for the start-up costs. Therefore, there will be no pressure initially to increase the licensing fees to a higher level.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-22_para22"></a>I hope that that explanation satisfies the concerns of noble Lords. We are happy with the wording as it stands. In any event, I am not entirely sure that the wordingsuggested by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, creates the measure of objectivity towards which he seemed to be directing us. I can assure the Committee that it is our intention to ensure that these fees are kept to the necessary minimum--but necessary, nevertheless, to provide for more than adequate financing to make the SIA effective.

<P>
<A NAME="10130-22_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   I ask for the Committee's indulgence briefly to mention a point that arises indirectly from Amendment No. 27B. The point was mentioned to me by someone involved in the industry but too late for me to table a particular amendment. The fee referred to in Amendment No. 27B is to inspect the register. There is a fear that if people can inspect a register containing the names and addresses of security operatives, that information may be used to blackmail and bring pressure to bear on security operatives involved in carrying cash. I am told that the modern thief does not try to break into cash vans. The modus operandi that has recently been used is to pass a note to a security guard explaining that his wife and children, whose address can easily be discovered from this register, are being held hostage and that unless he, under their instructions, drives the van to the place in which they choose to deal with it, he will not see his wife and children again, or some similar threat. The names and addresses of the individuals concerned could be sensitive in this respect. I do not wish to press the point. I mention it because I believe it is worthy of consideration. It did not occur to me in time to table an amendment.

<A NAME = "10130-23_para5"></a>Secondly, having struggled to read this Bill, one reached the conclusion that the drafting was unnecessarily obscure. That was the point at which the fuse blew, as it were, and I fell down trying to re-write subsections (1) and (2). As presently drafted, Clause 12(1) states:
<P>
<BR>

<P>

Subsection (2) defines the authority's relevant licensing functions. Why not incorporate them into one subsection? I hope that the effect of the words is precisely the same as the wording of the two subsections as they stand at the moment. I also hope that it is marginally clearer. That will be a matter of opinion. As I say, it was the moment at which the fuse blew when I was reading this difficult prose that is favoured by parliamentary draftsmen. I beg to move.

<A NAME = "10130-23_para7"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10130-23_para8"></a>The noble Lord has raised a good point about the delegation to local authorities. It is intended to cover the consideration of applications for licences as door supervisors only, not other security activities, and the grant, refusal and modification of these licences. They would not need to inform the SIA of decisions for register purposes. That is what this wording attempts to achieve. My note goes on to be generous to parliamentary counsel by suggesting that we rather prefer the wording as drafted by our experienced parliamentary draftsmen; and, of course, that is the case.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-23_para9"></a>I think I am satisfied with the wording. I hope that I have clarified the point raised by the noble Lord. In any event, I shall consider whether or not our wording can be further simplified, but that is what it aims to achieve.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-23_para18"></a>The object of the amendment is very simple: it is designed to enable those inspecting the register to see whether a company continues to remain approved--and, more importantly, to ascertain when that approval might expire. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-23_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   Clause 13(3) lists the information that will have to appear in the public registers of approved contractors. As identified by the noble Viscount, the information as currently drafted is limited to the name and address of the contractor, the security services for which the approval has been given and the conditions of the approval. The clause is not exclusive in its provisions. There is nothing to stop the SIA from publishing additional information, such as that suggested in the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-23_para19"></a>However, like the noble Viscount, we recognise that the public will wish to have unambiguous information available in the register and that the amendment would provide a useful improvement to the list of material that must be published. We are not convinced that it will be essential to publish both the date on which an approval has been given and that on which it is due for renewal. The appearance of a company name on the register will, in itself, be evidence that approval is in force. But it will certainly be desirable to publish the due date of renewal.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-23_para20"></a>However, the improvement made by this amendment is equally applicable to the provisions of Clause 11(3), which relate to information that must be published in the register of individual licence holders. If the noble Viscount is willing to withdraw his amendment this evening, I shall give an undertaking that the Government will bring forward their own amendment on Report to require the publication of renewal dates in both the registers established by Clauses 11 and 13--that is, the register of individual licences and that for company approvals.

<A NAME = "10130-23_para24"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10130-23_para25"></a>The noble Lord said: Read with Amendment No. 30C, this amendment is a slightly clumsy way of trying to raise again the question of seeking voluntary approval--or, perhaps "the voluntary seeking of approval" is a better way to put it. The matter was referred to on Second Reading. It seems to us that leaving it simply as a voluntary scheme will not achieve a very satisfactory outcome. We believe that two different types of contractors are likely to emerge under the scheme: those who are approved and those who are not. The latter will apply different standards and will not have been through the same tests. However, both types of contractors will offer their <P>


<a name="column_653"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 653</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>services to the public. No doubt those who have not sought approval will be doing so at a cheaper rate. Therefore, many of the policy points that lie behind the Bill will be lost. Again, I shall welcome the Minister's response to the issue. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-23_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   Although I have seen representations from the industry on the point, I am not persuaded. It seems to me that the way the Government have proposed the scheme in the Bill will prove to be satisfactory. I realise that there will be two classes of company, but both will be employing licensed personnel to undertake the same job. After all, there are advantages to being an approved company; namely, that, under the Bill, you can take people on provisionally.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-23_para26"></a>I believe that there would be advantages in the proposed approved status. Customers will be able to distinguish between those companies with approved status and those who are not so designated. Indeed, most serious customers will want to employ someone with approved status, providing that it does not prove to be vastly more expensive. I do not see why it should be; it is only one extra requirement. The main expense is licensing the individuals who work for such companies.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-23_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   As drafted, the Bill allows for a voluntary scheme. We consider that this is best at present. It minimises the burden on companies to one that they themselves are willing to bear. Like the noble Lord, Lord Cope of Berkeley, we expect that the majority of reputable companies will want to seek approval under a voluntary scheme.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-23_para27"></a>We also want to build on the self-regulating mechanisms that are already in place. Companies will be able to volunteer to be inspected to the standards that will be set for their particular sector by the authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-23_para28"></a>However, the Bill will allow the Secretary of State to turn a voluntary scheme into a compulsory one if he judges it necessary to do so; that is, if the fears of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, prove to be founded. The Secretary of State will be able to invoke provisions in Clause 16, which will make it an offence to provide security services unless approval is obtained under the provisions in Clause 14 via the negative resolution procedure, which will be laid before Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-23_para29"></a>A decision to turn the voluntary scheme into a compulsory one would be taken only after a recommendation from the authority and after exhaustive and extensive consultation with the industry, police and other interested parties.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-23_para30"></a>I hope that my response has reassured the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. We should also bear in mind the words of wisdom from the noble Lord, Lord Cope. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, feels able to withdraw the amendment.

("(c) requirements to seek approval of the Authority of the design of any uniforms proposed to be used by the providers of security industry services, so as to ensure that they are distinguishable from the uniforms of police officers").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "10130-24_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: On Second Reading, I expressed the concern that there should be no confusion between the police and those in the security industry who provide, for example, guarding services. It so happens that yesterday I was in Altcourse prison, which I discovered was in Fazakerley, Liverpool. That prison has the acclamation of the inspector of prisons, which is not easily acquired, and that of my client, which is even more difficult to acquire, for being one of the top prisons in this country. It is also a Group 4 prison.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-24_para2"></a>A noticeable feature of the service provided by that company and by others is that they go out of their way to ensure that their staff do not look like prison officers of old. They do not wear blue serge; they wear green pastoral colours. That reduces the temperature in prisons and helps to distinguish them from authority figures such as policemen.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-24_para3"></a>I am concerned to ensure that security firms are distinct from those who provide security on the streets--police constables. There is no reason why the authority should not have some control over the design of uniforms that are advanced by a company seeking approval for its employees. That would ensure that no confusion occurs. I recommend the amendment for serious consideration.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-24_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Thomas, wants to set up the authority as a kind of taste police that examines the uniforms, or prospective uniforms, that those providing security services might have to wear. That perhaps goes a little too far.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-24_para4"></a>I seem to recall somewhere in the recesses of my mind--I should be grateful if the Minister would confirm this--that adequate laws already exist in this context. I believe that there is a law that makes it illegal to impersonate a policeman. That includes wearing a uniform that is similar to or that could be mistaken for a policeman's uniform. If that is the case--I believe that it is--the amendment is unnecessary. However, if the amendment is necessary, it would be better to state that people should not wear uniforms that will be confused with those of police officers. We need not set <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-24_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I had written in my notes, "style council". We need not worry too much about this matter. I do not believe that the security industry authority will set itself up with the proposed function, and I do not think that Versace standards will be applied. The noble Viscount, Lord Astor, made the point for me. We do not believe that the amendment is necessary or that it is necessary for conditions relating to uniforms to be included as a licence condition in the approved contractors scheme. As the noble Viscount said, under Section 90 of the Police Act 1996 it is already an offence to impersonate a police officer or to wear anything having the appearance of a police uniform in circumstances in which the person wearing it might be mistaken for a police officer. That ensures that those who attempt to pass themselves off as police officers are committing a criminal offence and will be prosecuted. Therefore, although the amendment is well-spirited and good-intentioned, we do not consider it to be necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-24_para5"></a>We want people to respect uniforms because they have an important, authoritative presence which, in certain circumstances, will be of help. I am certainly aware of neighbourhood warden schemes which attempt to achieve that objective without impersonating in any way, shape or form a police uniform or a police presence. Therefore, we are grateful for the notion, but the powers already exist and we do not believe that further powers are required. I hope that, notwithstanding his flattering comments about one of Her Majesty's prisons, the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-24_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I am interested to note that the legislation was passed in 1996. In 1996 this provision formed part of the Liberal Democrat Party policy document.

They all refer to the circumstances in which representatives of the authority, authorised in writing--I believe that we could call them "inspectors"--may enter premises owned or occupied by a person appearing to be a regulated person. Later in the clause there is reference to offences of obstructing, and so on.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-24_para17"></a>The permission for an inspector to enter premises is completely unfettered provided that the premises are owned or occupied by a person appearing to him to be a regulated person. That is a very strong power. Rightly, Parliament has been careful about granting powers of access and entry to inspectors and policemen. However, a large number of officials have the right to enter premises. In most cases, such officials, including policemen, need a warrant to enter and search people's homes. Two suggestions for limiting the power of entry are on offer in this group of amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-24_para18"></a>So far as concerns Amendments Nos. 32 and 33 in my name, I have suggested that under this provision there should be no access to domestic premises. Only business premises should be entered, and only then with a warrant from a magistrate.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-24_para19"></a>I cannot see why an inspector of the security industry authority should want to go into somebody's home. There is not much to be gained by that. An Englishman's home is supposed to be his castle and I believe that it is right to protect access wherever we can rather than facilitate it. Amendments Nos. 32A and 33A, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, who clearly takes a milder view of such matters than I do, provide that there should be a warrant only in the case of domestic premises. He is happy for people to waltz into business premises without any authorisation other than their ticket.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-24_para20"></a>My understanding of the clause is that the authorisation in writing by the authority will in effect be the appointment of the inspector to that post, whereas when we seek a magistrate's warrant, whether for business or domestic premises, we seek permission for that individual to inspect those particular premises on that occasion. As far as I can see, the authorisation in writing is likely to be a piece of paper or an identity card which lasts for as long as an individual does that job. It is a blanket authorisation to walk into any premises covered by it, or in this case, if the Bill is passed, any home covered by it.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-24_para21"></a>There is, therefore, not only a difference in who it is authorised by; there is also the difference of whether it is authorised on that particular occasion to go into those premises for that purpose, the case having been made out to the magistrate, or whether it is a blanket authorisation to enter at any time. There is more than one layer to the proposals to introduce warrants; whether they are introduced into all premises or just domestic premises.

<P>

<A NAME = "10130-24_para22"></a>We should take the matter seriously. The powers of entry and inspection are powerful. Such powers are liked by police states and dictators but countries such as ours should be cautious about granting them to the authorities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-24_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   This is the most serious attack on civil liberties in the whole of the Bill. It will create a whole class of persons who may enter premises without any leave. Furthermore, any person who obstructs them or fails to provide documents or other information relating to any connected matter set out in subsection (2) is guilty of an offence and could end up in prison.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-24_para23"></a>I ask the Government carefully to consider the provisions. I am sure that there is a point of principle upon which we can all unite on this side of the Committee in considering what should be done. The noble Lord, Lord Cope, mentioned a slight distinction between us. I can see that there might be a reason for business premises to be entered in an ordinary routine inspection by an inspector of the authority in following up his duties of inspecting licence holders, and so forth. However, entering people's homes, demanding papers and information and imposing a sanction of imprisonment if a person fails to co-operate is beyond the spirit in which the law of this country has operated hitherto. One envisages little inspectors in the Russian style in such a situation. I ask the Government to consider the matter again.

<P>
<A NAME="10130-25_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Marlesford: </B>   There has been a tendency in some parts of the press in recent months to ascribe a rather authoritarian attitude to the Minister's right honourable friend the Home Secretary. I do not share those criticisms. In general I support the Home Secretary in much of what he is trying to do. Indeed, I would sometimes go further than my own party in those respects.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-25_para0"></a>I certainly cannot claim to be a libertarian of the standard that would be required if I were to ask to gain entry to the party on the other end of these Benches. However, I regard this every bit as seriously as my noble friend Lord Cope, and as the Liberal Democratic Party. It is quite extraordinary that these provisions should have been put in, and I doubt very much whether Ministers can really have considered what was involved.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-25_para1"></a>After all, it is not very long ago that we were considering the Bill giving access to the countryside--a Bill which I prefer to describe as the "budgie" Bill. The Minister may not remember it because it was not his Bill, but the noble Baroness will remember because it was partly her Bill. It was a Bill which, partly because of a mistaken transfer of one schedule from one Bill to another, has presented the situation where, if someone keeps a budgerigar and allows it to escape into the wild, he can be sent to prison for two years.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-25_para2"></a>It was the most extraordinary thing. Unfortunately I only discovered it on the day I was asked to speak to an earlier amendment, right at the end just before the Bill needed to become law at the end of the last Session. As a result, the Government were too embarrassed to <P>


<a name="column_658"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 658</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>admit that they had made a mistake and so would have had to change it. So I certainly think of it as the "budgie" Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-25_para3"></a>As my noble friend Lord Cope said, this is a most serious point of principle and I am worried that the Government do not take these things as seriously as they should. On the 28th October 1999 I put down a Question for Written Answer, which was dealt with by the noble Lord, Lord Bassam. The Question was: which statutory instruments giving powers of entry to private premises have come into force since May 1997?
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-25_para4"></a>The noble Lord's Answer--I do not blame him: I blame his department--was to the effect that this information could only be collated at disproportionate cost. That I regard as a disgraceful answer. It is not one that I shall be prepared to let go, and at an appropriate moment I shall seek to put down a Starred Question when we shall be able perhaps to discuss this whole subject.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-25_para5"></a>I warn the Government that they must not allow their officials to be so easy-going with the personal liberties about which the people of this country care passionately. I recognise that tonight we will not be able to reach a final solution to this problem--perhaps there are not enough of us here to do that--but I hope that if we do not get a satisfactory result at the next stage of this Bill we shall all unite, as the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, said, on this side with many Cross-Benchers. I shall take pleasure in drawing this matter to their attention, and we shall unite in this Chamber to defeat the Government on what is a most extraordinary proposal.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-25_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I shall have to take very seriously the admonition of the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, but I cannot fall in with his argument. I do not recognise us as a Government who are careless about civil liberties--far from it--particularly in bringing forward human rights legislation and so on. We have an enviable track record and, certainly as someone who may not be an old-style libertarian but who values his civil liberties greatly, I tread very carefully in this particular policy area.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-25_para6"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Cope, described this as a strong power and the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, suggested that it was taking us closer to the sort of approach that might be adopted by a police state. I do not see that in it, but I do see the amendments being fundamental in the attack they would mount against the security industry authority's enforcement powers. They would seriously weaken them. The authority will be an important body discharging significant responsibilities. It is vital that it has sufficient authority and flexibility of operation to allow it adequately to enforce the licensing regime with which it will be charged.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-25_para7"></a>A requirement on the authority's authorised operatives to obtain further approval from a Justice of the Peace would hamper its ability to conduct surprise inspections. It might also compromise the security of an inspection where an element of surprise may be important, thus allowing evidence of offences under <P>


<a name="column_659"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 659</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the legislation to be destroyed. Similar concerns occur when considering the amendment restricting the exercise of the powers on non-domestic properties.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-25_para8"></a>The entry and inspection powers must extend to domestic premises as many people carrying out regulated security activities will have their headquarters or offices in their own homes. That would include freelance door supervisors who operate from their kitchen table with a mobile phone. It would also include a house owner who clamps a vehicle on his private land and charges a release fee. Dentists who operate from domestic premises and clamp vehicles which are parked on their private land, for which they charge a release fee, would also be covered.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-25_para9"></a>While I am as alive as ever to the human rights and privacy concerns which I am sure lie behind the amendments as much as concerns about civil liberties, the limitation on the authority's powers to enforce its licensing regime which the amendments introduce would weaken the authority's enforcement abilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-25_para10"></a>I am not insensitive to some of the points that have been made and I am willing to look at the possibility of excluding from the powers premises used solely for domestic residence purposes. I give that undertaking, but it is as far as I can go in giving assurances. However, as ever, we will read Hansard most carefully and reflect on the points which Members have made in the debate. I hope that with that assurance, and the assurance that excesses and abuses of power would be actionable in the normal way, noble Lords will feel able to withdraw their amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-25_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Marlesford: </B>   The Minister spoke of the need for surprise. Surely there must be many occasions when important raids are made by the police for which they must obtain a warrant. Is he suggesting that in some way the obtaining of a magistrate's warrant makes it impossible to achieve surprise? That is a most astonishing suggestion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-25_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   The noble Lord made the point that I want to make. The police and Customs must obtain warrants for cause whenever they engage in serious operations. Surprise is one of the weapons that they employ. The security of the magistrates who grant warrants is complete.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-25_para11"></a>There is a weakness in the Minister's argument. No doubt the authority has wide-ranging responsibilities and will exercise them responsibly and so forth. It can be imagined that every time an inspector wants to invade the premises of a licenceholder he will go to that authority, which presumably will sit fairly regularly. However, I cannot imagine that he will go to the top and ask for permission every time he wants to do so. In other words, the decision will be made by the front-line troops; by the inspectors on the ground.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-25_para12"></a>These provisions put a huge power into the hands of such people. We do not give that power to the police or to Customs officers. There is no reason whatever why a magistrate should not be involved and oversee the proper exercise of the powers of entry and inspection <P>


<a name="column_660"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>which are contained in the Bill. It is wrong to assume that because the authority is a responsible body these powers will always be exercised responsibly by the troops on the ground.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-25_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   The Minister has given a disappointing reply. However, I am grateful for the indication that he will consider the matter further, in particular his remarks about premises that are solely domestic. I urge the noble Lord to think very hard not only about that matter but the wider aspects. The points made in the past few minutes by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, and my noble friend Lord Marlesford are extremely forceful. The Bill proposes that inspectors of the authority, which I agree has an important job to do but not as important as that performed frequently by the police and Customs, should be given greater powers than those available to police officers and Customs officers to wander into any premises whenever they wish.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-25_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I greatly respect the comments made by the Committee, particularly the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, who, as an eminent lawyer, is very experienced in these matters. It is true that the police and Customs require warrants to enter premises, but it is also right that whenever inspection regimes are set up some powers of entry do not depend on warrants. I have in mind environmental health officers and factory inspectors who operate in this way. That said, obviously I am duty bound to listen carefully to what has been said. I am sure that the Committee does not want to impose restrictions that unnecessarily inhibit the effectiveness of this important inspectorate. There will be occasions on which the inspectorate needs to move swiftly and flexibly, particularly where perhaps a corrupt firm or operator is at work and there is a suspicion that it has been involved in serious crime; for example, drugs offences and so on. One needs to take a balanced view of this matter. As ever, I shall pay careful attention to the comments made in Committee.

<A NAME="10130-26_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for his response. However, the noble Lord makes my point. It may be that environmental health officers or factory inspectors enter premises because they are concerned about certain matters. However, if either barged into a person's home and demanded the production of documents and answers to questions, as this Bill permits, there would be a great outcry in this country. Those powers do not exist.

<A NAME = "10130-26_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 34 relates to criminal record certificates. The new clause seeks to provide that information from an enhanced criminal record certificate shall not be disclosed unnecessarily but retained within the authority. I support efforts for the rehabilitation of offenders. The way in which convictions are allowed to disappear into the undergrowth after a lapse of time is an important provision with regard to the rehabilitation of offenders. The longer the prison sentence, the longer it remains on the open record. These are powers for access to these criminal records notwithstanding the rehabilitation provisions. We should be careful about those. The authority should have a duty to keep them confidential. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-26_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   In order to determine properly that only those who are fit and proper persons should have a licence to work in designated sectors of the private security industry, it is important that the authority should have knowledge of the full criminal record of those applying for a licence. In the case of door supervisors alone, we have decided that that knowledge should be to the level of the enhanced criminal record certificate which will contain information about both spent and unspent convictions, minor convictions and local police intelligence. That is provided for in Clause 19.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-26_para6"></a>It is essential that the security industry authority acts responsibly when such handling of sensitive information about individuals takes place. There are, however, already strict rules governing the disclosure of information obtained from the Criminal Records Bureau. These strict rules are contained in Section 124 of the Police Act 1997. That section outlines the limited circumstances under which a person may disclose the information and to whom. Anyone breaching these conditions would be committing a serious criminal offence. The authority will also need to have due regard to the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-26_para7"></a>Our argument is that adequate restrictions are already in place. These should meet the noble Lord's concerns. That is certainly their intention, and we do not wish the system to work in any other way.

(""security operative" shall be construed in accordance with Part 1 of Schedule 2;").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "10130-26_para15"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 38 seeks to insert into line 42 of Clause 23 a reference to the definition of "security operative". It seemed odd to me that there was not already such a definition in the clause but there is a definition of "activities of a security operative" in line 2 of the clause. Therefore, I thought that perhaps the words "security operative" must always be accompanied by the words "activities of a". I then looked at paragraph 6(3) of Schedule 2 and discovered that "security operative" appears without the words "activities of". It seemed to me that it should be defined and I therefore tabled this amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-26_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   Clause 23 provides interpretation of terms not explained elsewhere in the Bill. The term "security operative" is, by contrast, already defined elsewhere. Therefore, we believe that there is no need to repeat the definition in Clause 23. Schedule 2 defines the activities of security operatives that are subject to regulation by this Bill. Paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 2 makes clear the activities of a security operative. The term "security operative" is thus used in Clause 3(3) in such a way as to link firmly the provisions of Clause 3 to the list of designated activities in Schedule 2. With that explanation on record, I hope the noble Lord, Lord Cope, will be able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-26_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   It is not quite accurate to say that Clause 23 only defines things that are not defined elsewhere. Activities of a security officer are defined by reference to Part I of Schedule 2. That is not abnormal. Some of the other definitions are done by reference to other Acts of Parliament. I treat definitions seriously. Acts of Parliament or Bills are difficult enough to read as it is. Many years ago my noble friend Lord Renton made some excellent recommendations intended to improve the drafting. One recommendation referred to the way in which definitions should be handled. Successive governments, including those in which I was involved, have largely ignored the excellent recommendations of that committee. Nevertheless, I believe that whenever we can put them into practice we should.

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Schedule 1, page 17, line 6, at end insert ("provided that there shall not be a majority of the members who are engaged in activities covered by this Act").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-26_para21"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10130-26_para22"></a>The noble Viscount said: In moving Amendment No. 39, I wish to speak also to Amendments Nos. 40, 41 and 42. These amendments concern the composition of the security industry authority and the appointment of a chief executive. I am sure that the Minister will say that when they come to appoint members of the authority the Secretary of State will use his good judgment and say that it should have a person from here and another from there. This is too important to be left to the Secretary of State. There should be some guidelines by Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-26_para23"></a>The amendments are quite simple. They seek to improve Schedule 1. The first provides that there should not be a majority of members engaged in activities covered by the Act. That means that lay members should have a majority on the authority, and it ought not to be just the industry. It goes on to say in the next amendment that there should be at least one serving police officer. That means that there should be a representative from the police force on the authority. I am sure that this is something that the Secretary of State would normally consider. However, we think it is important to put it in the Bill. We also felt it important that the chairman should be a lay person who could be independent when looking at the various voting issues.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-26_para24"></a>Finally, I mention Amendment No. 42, which seeks to have an open application procedure determined by the Secretary of State for the appointment of the chief executive. This will be an important role. The appointment must be open and seen to be open. It must follow the principles of open government. I am sure that the Minister would agree with the principle even if he does not agree with the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-26_para25"></a>It is important that the membership of the authority represents a wide range of interests. It should not be exclusive to anyone. It must have representatives from the industry and the police. The Minister might have other recommendations. We feel that these amendments at least offer suggestions as to what the membership should be. Amendment No. 40A in the name of noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, provides that there should be adequate representation of the security industry, employees' representatives, the police and customers' interests. It is very similar to our amendment but is put in a different way. I support the principles behind both amendments. They both seek the same end. We believe that Schedule 1 should provide reassurance to the industry, the police and all the parties involved that there will be adequate representation on the security industry authority. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-26_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   Perhaps I may speak to Amendment No. 40A, which stands in my name. I am not tied to the number 10; nor do I suggest that the <P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-27_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   These amendments all seek to insert into Schedule 1 specific requirements. I think that I can probably offer the reassurance which Members of the Committee seek.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-27_para0"></a>The authority will need to work closely with the private security industry it is regulating, not least to ensure that its important regulatory regimes are deliverable. For that reason, it is likely that the Secretary of State will wish to see some industry representation among the membership of the authority. More widely, it will be important for authority members to have a proper balance of skills, experiences and interests. The noble Viscount and the noble Lord made exactly that point. We share that objective. I would be the first to agree that the authority must be independent of the private security industry and, more importantly, be seen to be independent. That is of paramount importance. I drew attention to that point during the Second Reading debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-27_para1"></a>However, I do not agree that it is necessary to place this concept on the face of the Bill. I am happy to give an assurance that representatives of the private security industry will not be in a majority in the membership of the authority and that I think it highly unlikely that a representative of the security industry will be appointed its chair. That would tend to compromise the independence which the authority will necessarily require. There will be a representative of the Association of Chief Police Officers and of other relevant groups. All of those appointments will be made on the basis of fair and open competition.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-27_para2"></a>The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, specifies the security industry, employees' representatives, the police and customer interests. That is precisely the range that we are looking for and there may well be others that we have not discussed during the debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-27_para3"></a>That is our general approach. It is certainly in line with the thinking of the noble Viscount and of the noble Lord. I do not think it is necessary to put on the face of the Bill appointments to a non-departmental public body, but I am happy to reiterate that the main thrust of the concerns behind the amendments will be in the Secretary of State's mind when he considers appointments.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-27_para4"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Astor, referred to the appointment of the chief executive. Nolan principles will apply. It will be a transparent appointment. We need to have that to give a copper bottom to the independence and credibility of the authority.

<A NAME = "10130-27_para5"></a>With those assurances, I hope that the noble Viscount and the noble Lord will not feel it necessary to press their amendments. I am grateful to them for what they have said, which demonstrates that we are pretty much of one mind on this matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-27_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   The Minister made a predictable reply to my first point by saying that the Secretary of State is likely to seek representatives from the industry. He gave an assurance that they would not form a majority on the authority. I take it that they will then form a minority, but that at least one representative will be appointed to the authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-27_para6"></a>I know that the Minister spoke with the best of intentions when he said that the Government were likely to take this course. However, one is always a little dubious when it comes to appointments because one has seen how often the system of appointments has been abused. I am afraid that the noble Lord's Government do not have a totally unblemished record in this regard. We have seen in some cases the allocation of "jobs for the boys". We shall need to consider further whether we want to put a form of words on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-27_para7"></a>The allocation of appointments is not something which takes place while Bills are passing through this House or another place. It takes place once the measure has been enacted. The Chief Whip of the day has a word with the Home Secretary of the day. At that stage, strange names suddenly come to light and are given appointments to quangos.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-27_para8"></a>However, I recognise that the Minister was trying to be as helpful as he could and I much appreciate that. As regards my final amendment, I am entirely happy with his response. I do not know what the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, intends to do with Amendment No. 40, but in the meantime I beg leave to withdraw Amendment No. 39.

<A NAME = "10130-27_para11"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10130-27_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment relates to local authorities and their money. This provision is in itself rather interesting because, without the amendment, it provides for the authority to receive funding from the Home Office, but it is to pay back to the Home Office all moneys it receives in the course of its functions. Every licence fee and so forth is to be paid back in total to the Home Office. The authority will then have doled out to it funds with which to run itself. I do not suppose that that system will encourage the authority to become self-financing. Indeed, we are not clear how the balance of moneys will work out.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-27_para13"></a>In any case, the purity of that system will be somewhat sullied by the fact that some of the activities of the authority are to be delegated to local authorities. I believe that the local authorities will in their turn <P>


<a name="column_666"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 666</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>require a level of funding to carry out their functions. I presume that they will not be allowed to retain any of the moneys they may collect in licence fees because it appears that those funds will need to be sent to the Home Secretary. I am not clear as regards how local authorities are to be reimbursed for carrying out these new activities.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-27_para14"></a>I should point out that I had some difficulty with the drafting of this amendment. Indeed, I am not sure whether it is perfect. It seeks to achieve the effect, if possible, of ensuring that local authorities should at least be allowed to keep the licence fees that they collect in order to reimburse them for their time and trouble.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-27_para15"></a>Incidentally, in issuing these licences, local authorities will be put into the interesting position of issuing licences locally which will then be valid nationally. I cannot think of another example of this. A licence can be acquired in Manchester in order to operate in London, Cardiff or even North Wales. A person will be able to operate in an area on the strength of a licence issued somewhere else entirely. I cannot think of a similar case where such rules apply, but perhaps I have not thought it through carefully enough.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-27_para16"></a>However, the main point of the amendment is to inquire into how local authorities are to be reimbursed if all moneys received for licences must be returned to the Home Office. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-27_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   I am happy to agree with the noble Lord, Lord Cope, that it is important that local authorities are properly funded in any transfer of licensing responsibility delegated from the security industry authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-27_para17"></a>Clause 12 enables the Secretary of State to make provision by order for local authorities to carry out some or all of the security industry authority's licensing functions. This is in recognition of the Government's desire to build on the arrangements in many local authorities where good registration schemes for door supervisors are already being run.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-27_para18"></a>The noble Lord's amendment seems to assume that fees will continue to be paid to the security industry authority in cases in which the local authority has received delegated powers to conduct appropriate licensing functions. This is not the case. The security industry authority will derive a substantial part of its income from fees paid to it when applications for licences are made. However, Clause 12(3)(d) provides that a local authority may retain licence application fees paid to it where such delegated arrangements exist. I believe, therefore, that what the amendment seeks to do is already done by the provisions of Clause 12(3)(d).
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-27_para19"></a>I hope that I have reassured the noble Lord and that he will not feel it necessary to press the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-27_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   I am glad to hear that the amendment is unnecessary, and I shall look in Hansard at what the noble Baroness has said. We would seem to land up in the extraordinary position that the <P>


<a name="column_667"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 667</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>authority will have to pay over to the Secretary of State all the money it receives for the licences that it issues, while the local authorities can keep the proceeds of the licences that they issue. That is an interesting combination.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-27_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   It may help the noble Lord in considering my reply if I add that paragraph 15(2) of Schedule 1 requires the security industry authority to pay all money to the Secretary of State except where the Secretary of State directs otherwise under paragraph 15(3). He will direct the SIA to keep fee money. Local authorities will keep fees paid to them under Clause 12(3)(d), as I have said.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-27_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   That is one way of putting it, but it is not the way the Bill puts it. The Bill says that the authority shall pay all sums received by it other than money given to it by the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State may say "We won't bother receiving this and giving it back to you", but that is what the Bill says.

<A NAME = "10130-28_para1"></a>The noble Viscount said: This is a simple probing amendment. There is some confusion about whether those involved in the carrying of cash or valuables in transit are covered in Schedule 2. Therefore, I have put them in, but I am sure that the Minister will tell me that the matter is covered somewhere else. I should be grateful for a simple explanation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-28_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   Paragraph 2(1) sets out three generic descriptions of the activities undertaken by those providing manned guarding services. The three types of guarding in question are guarding premises, property and people. This approach is a common feature of the drafting of the Bill. For example, we do not attempt to list in detail every type of occupation comprising manned guarding services, since any attempt at such a list would probably be flawed at worst and cumbersome at best. Similarly, we believe that the generic approach taken in paragraph 2(1) is sufficient to cover all relevant manned guarding activities.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-28_para2"></a>However, I am aware of a desire in the private security industry to be reassured that guards under contract who transport cash and other valuables are covered by the provisions of the Bill. I am happy to confirm that this is indeed the case. Cash in transit--the abbreviation used in the industry--is very clearly within the ambit of the Bill, and in particular is covered by the provisions of paragraph 2(1).

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "10130-28_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 47 concerns wheelclamping, a matter to which some attention was given at Second Reading. I think that the Committee is agreed that the activities of rogue wheelclampers should be curtailed--certainly I agree--but I do not think that it should necessarily mean that this enormously elaborate licensing scheme should apply to everyone who might indulge in wheelclamping.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-28_para9"></a>It seems to me that someone who has ground for parking attached to either their house or business premises--particularly in the middle of towns, where parking is very expensive and difficult to find; where it can cost several pounds an hour to park on a parking meter--should be allowed to deter others from parking on it, if necessary by means of wheelclamping.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-28_para10"></a>The amendment proposes that the Secretary of State should issue an order under which--provided people remained within the fabric of the regulations contained in the order--there would be a general permission to carry out wheelclamping without the <P>


<a name="column_669"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 669</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>need for a licence. An authority would only be troubled for the issue of a licence if someone wished to go beyond the regulations.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-28_para11"></a>As the Committee will have noticed in the amendment, I envisage, first, that the regulations should include a maximum permitted charge. It may vary according to the circumstances set out in the regulations--the time and date and so on--but there would be a maximum permitted charge.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-28_para12"></a>Secondly, there should be a requirement that a prominent notice is properly displayed, stating "If you park on this private land you may be clamped". It should state "You may obtain release of your vehicle by taking the following action: Ringing the doorbell on the left or dialling this number", whatever it is. It should state the hours during which the vehicle can be released. I should have added also the cost of release, which would be however much is allowed under the first regulation.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-28_para13"></a>There should be a requirement that the vehicle can be released at any time during business hours if it is parked on business land and at any time when the property is occupied if it is parked on domestic land.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-28_para14"></a>I am not wedded to these particular parts of the regulations and I should like to leave the Secretary of State with some flexibility in the design of the regulations. But the principle behind the amendment is that restrictions of this kind would be sufficient to stop the rogue clampers and at the same time would mean that wheelclamping was an option for someone who wished to keep his private land private.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-28_para15"></a>In the middle of large cities it is often extremely difficult to park. There is a great temptation to park on an area of empty land if you are anxious to do some shopping or to visit someone. However, a person or business has the right to keep private land free for their own or customers' parking, whatever they wish, rather than anyone being allowed to park on it. Of course, some land will have a fence around it and a gate that can be locked, but in the nature of things other land will not. Wheelclamping, properly conducted, is not an activity that we should attempt to stop or tie up with a whole lot of bureaucracy. Therefore, I suggest that a provision of this kind is desirable. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="10130-28_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I appreciate the sentiments behind the amendment. On the other hand, it seems rather odd that a regulating power should be introduced in the second schedule to the Bill, as opposed to having a specific clause dealing with it.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-28_para16"></a>The various matters that the noble Lord suggests should be contained in the regulations--he does not pretend that this is an exhaustive list--seem very proper. As I say, the sentiment is correct; however, I am slightly unhappy about the way in which the amendment is expressed. I hope that the noble Lord will rethink exactly how to phrase such a provision at some future time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-28_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I suppose that in a private moment I might have a great deal of sympathy with <P>


<a name="column_670"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 670</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>this amendment. We have a reasonably sized piece of land in front of our garden. I can envisage circumstances in which I might be hard-up for employment and could do with the extra income, in an unregulated form as well.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-28_para17"></a>We must look closely at the effect of the amendment. As drafted, it would remove wheelclamping on private land from regulation by the SIA and make all disputes in relation to wheelclamping a matter for the courts, as they are now. Were we to accept the amendment, it would mean that the Home Secretary could make regulations governing how wheelclamping should be conducted to avoid the need for regulation by the security industry authority. I shall return to the issue of conditions. First, perhaps I may address the proposed new paragraph 2A to be inserted into Schedule 2.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-28_para18"></a>The objective of the Bill is to regulate various areas of what has become known as the private security industry. We are doing this essentially because, as the law currently stands, it is possible for anyone to seek employment or to act in a self-employed capacity in any area of the industry without any check being carried out on any criminal activity in which he may have been involved in the past.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-28_para19"></a>A key problem arising from the amendment is that it would leave wheelclamping activities, unlike the other security industry activities covered by the Bill, open to being carried out by criminals. I do not think that anyone wants that. We think it essential for the security industry authority to have the proper opportunity to refuse a licence for wheelclamping where the person seeking the licence has, say, convictions for crimes of violence. I am sure that Members of the Committee already appreciate the risks attached to allowing someone with a string of convictions for grievous bodily harm to work as a bouncer at a night-club. There have already been cases where bouncers have been, shall we say, too enthusiastic in the execution of their duties.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-28_para20"></a>Wheelclamping on private land is not dissimilar. It is not uncommon, for example, for drivers who get into arguments with clampers over release fees or what they perceive to be unauthorised clamping to be threatened with violence. If anyone could operate as a wheelclamper under the Bill as the noble Lord, Lord Cope, seeks to amend it, it would be possible for someone newly released from prison one day to be clamping vehicles late the following night and confronting motorists at times when no one else is around. When considered in that light, it is no wonder that motorists are concerned about the problems associated with this practice under the present law. That explains exactly why we have introduced this Bill to tackle the problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-28_para21"></a>As the Members of the Committee will have seen today, we are regulating private wheelclampers for three very good reasons. The first is to ensure that, by applying criminal sanctions to unlicensed operatives, anyone who wishes to operate as a wheelclamper will have to apply for a licence. Secondly, when applying for a licence, would-be clampers would be subjected to <P>


<a name="column_671"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 671</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a check to discover whether they had a criminal record, particularly for offences of violence. If such a record did exist, the authority could refuse a licence, and any attempt to operate as a wheelclamper would then become a criminal offence. Thirdly, the authority would have the power to grant a licence on condition that the licensee adhered to a code of practice that the authority could publish or adopt. To tackle effectively the problems associated with cowboy wheelclampers, it is essential that those three conditions operate alongside each other.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-28_para22"></a>I turn to sub-paragraph (2B), which would be inserted by the amendment. The legislation that we propose would leave to the discretion of the security industry authority the provisions to be contained in a code of conduct. Common sense dictates that such a code would determine a reasonable release fee, and that warning signs should be erected in restricted areas. The draft code of conduct drawn up last year by the British Parking Association is very explicit on those precise points. I do not believe that the security industry authority would need directing in law as to what such a code should contain. I shall not allow their discretion to be fettered in that way. That would be quite wrong.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-28_para23"></a>In conclusion, it is essential that the powers that we introduce to deal with unregulated wheelclamping on private land are as straightforward, clear cut and robust as possible. Under the Bill, it is an offence, with certain common-sense exceptions, to use a wheelclamp without a licence. I would argue that any question about the way in which a licence-holder operates as a wheelclamper is, rightly, a matter for the SIA to take up on behalf of the general public, with the possibility of withdrawal of the licence if necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-28_para24"></a>The proposed amendments make no reference at all to the means of resolving disputes between the driver and the clamper about the latter's compliance with the regulations made by the Secretary of State. In the absence of such provisions, it is our view that the matter could be decided only by the courts on a case by case basis. That is broadly the position we are now in, and it needs to be improved. The proposals of noble Lords opposite would make it considerably more difficult to impose criminal sanctions on clampers who consistently operate outside the regime set by a code of practice. In my view, those proposals would allow cowboy clampers to continue to operate in the very way that our proposals are designed to tackle.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-28_para25"></a>With vested personal interests on one side and all matters taken into consideration, I find myself unable to accept these amendments. I hope that the noble Lords opposite will very carefully reflect on the points that I have made and will feel able to withdraw their amendments.

<a name="column_672"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 672</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>his ministerial views. The Minister said that the restrictions on wheelclamping should be clear-cut and robust. I believe that under the regulations that I have proposed they would be, provided--and it is rather a large proviso--the Secretary of State and those who assist him could devise clear regulations. The regulations might become a little complicated once they had been past the parliamentary draftsmen; that is where their clarity might be lost.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-29_para0"></a>As far as concerns lack of compliance, if one failed to comply with the regulations and had not obtained a licence that would constitute unlicensed clamping and, therefore, would be an offence.

<A NAME = "10130-29_para2"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10130-29_para3"></a>The noble Viscount said: This amendment has been tabled in an effort to try to understand the Government's view on those in the industry who are operating outside the United Kingdom but who happen to come to this country. For example, if someone from one of the famous American detective agencies were to come to this country and carry on work that would be covered by the SIA, would that person be obliged to obtain a licence to do so? If not, how long could that person operate without a licence? In short, I should like to know how the system will work in such a situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-29_para4"></a>That leads me to another point about which I am more concerned; namely, that if someone from abroad does not need a licence to operate, I am concerned that unscrupulous operators might use non-UK operators in this country in order to avoid using those who are licensed. Can the Minister outline the Government's view on those operators who come from overseas--whether it be America or the European Union--who may or may not be licensed in their own countries? If in the course of a divorce case a private investigator is sent over here from, say, Italy or Hungary, to carry out the sort of work that would currently require a licence in this country, would such a person be able to operate in the UK without a licence? Do the Government intend that to be the case? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-29_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   When we were considering what "skills" were necessary at an earlier stage of our deliberations today, it seemed to me that skills for the immobilisation of vehicles required the ability to use a spanner. When it came to private investigators, I had in mind the ability to be able to climb a ladder, or, perhaps, to use a camera.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-29_para5"></a>The noble Viscount has made a serious point. At present, private investigation companies are international. Some very well-known American firms operate in this country, just as we seem to send private <P>


<a name="column_673"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>investigators from this country to places like Cuba, curiously enough. I seem to remember that there was something of a problem about that quite recently. Therefore, it is important to know how these international operations will be run. Will an international company that operates in this country be able to seek approval and advertise itself as an approved contractor? Will people so employed in the United States need to apply immediately to the SIA for a licence to work? All these problems arise as a result of the international aspects of private investigations. I am anxious to hear the Minister's response on the subject.

<A NAME="10130-29_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   I am slightly surprised that the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, seems to think that private investigators in what appear to be--as he implied--domestic marital disputes still rely on ladders. From reading the back of various journals, I understand that there are all kinds of other pieces of high-tech equipment that avoid the need for ladders and cameras. However, the noble Lord may be quite right. Indeed, in certain parts of England and Wales, the use of a ladder may still apply.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-29_para6"></a>I am delighted to be able to reassure noble Lords that all those operating in England and Wales, including detectives from the United States or American companies, will be required to have a licence in order to operate. There is a further dimension to this particular amendment which would apply the regulatory framework of the Bill to private investigations carried out anywhere in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-29_para7"></a>Sectors of the private security industry that will be regulated under the Bill may have provoked Members of the Committee into believing that private investigations are most likely to take their practitioners outside England and Wales in pursuit of their assignments. However, the Bill will extend to England and Wales only with the sole and specifically limited exceptions that are set out in Clause 24(3). Responsibility for those matters has been devolved to the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Executive. Those bodies are currently considering whether--and if so, how--to regulate private security services in Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-29_para8"></a>Limited provisions to regulate the private security industry already exist in Northern Ireland as part of the Terrorism Act 2000. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Cope, is well versed in legislation affecting Northern Ireland.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-29_para9"></a>The amendment would create a strange anomaly in the Bill, whereby all but one of its regulated sectors would be contained within England and Wales. I am sure that no Member of the Committee would wish to risk the wrath of colleagues in the Scotland Office and the Northern Ireland Office by indicating that they supported the amendment, which would be constitutionally unacceptable.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-29_para10"></a>I hope that Members of the Committee are satisfied with that explanation and the reassurance about people operating from companies that are based <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>outside the UK but which operate in England and Wales. I am not in a position to discuss the issues relating to Cuba, which the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, raised--my brief this evening does not cover that issue. I am sure that Members of the Committee would not wish me to go into that subject at this time of night. I hope that the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, will not press the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="10130-29_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   The noble Baroness said that the amendment would create a strange anomaly in the Bill. However, it is the Government who have gone around creating strange anomalies. If someone wanders into the British Embassy in Washington and says, "I am a private investigator, and I am going to work on a divorce case", he might be asked, "In England, Scotland or Wales?". If the answer was England or Wales, he would be told that he had to get a licence, but if the answer was Scotland, he would be fine, but woe betide him if he went a mile south of Gretna Green--if he did so, he would be in trouble. That is the biggest anomaly.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-29_para11"></a>I take note of the fact that the noble Baroness said that the Scottish Executive and the Scottish Parliament were looking into the matter. Those bodies are rather independently minded of the Government at the moment--they reject or accept government policies when they want to. They appear to have a mind of their own.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-29_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   The noble Viscount provokes me. My colleagues who are benefiting from the advantages of devolution in Scotland accept government policies when they remain to be determined here in Westminster. In other areas, they exercise their right to make their own judgments in matters that have been devolved to them by the will of Parliament.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-29_spnew6"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   That is a very good defence of devolution but it does not get away from the fact that the colleagues of the noble Baroness over the Border are making decisions that are clearly not always in line with government policy on this side of the Border. We just have to read the newspapers to appreciate that.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-29_para12"></a>I am reasonably satisfied by the reply of the noble Baroness. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, asked an important question. If someone came to this country and was asked, "Will you go to work in Cuba, or any other country?", will the relevant bodies be covered if they work abroad? Can people who are not registered to work in other countries be sent to work in other countries? I do not know what the case will be if foreign police arrive in this country. Will it be all right if they clock in officially? What will happen if they arrive unofficially to do their own investigation? Will the provisions apply to them? I do not need an answer now, but I hope that between now and Report the noble Baroness or the Minister will write to me about that.

<P>
<A NAME="10130-29_spnew7"></A><B> Viscount Astor </B>   moved Amendment No. 49:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 23, line 9, leave out sub-paragraph (2).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-29_para15"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10130-29_para16"></a>The noble Viscount said: This amendment seeks to remove sub-paragraph (2), which states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"This paragraph does not apply to activities carried out exclusively for the purposes of market research".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-29_para17"></a>
I believe that that point is covered by sub-paragraph (7), which states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"This paragraph does not apply to activities carried out with the knowledge or consent of ... the person about whom",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-29_para18"></a>
and so on.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-29_para19"></a>It seems to me that market research cannot be carried out without asking someone a question, unless the research is surreptitious, in which case one is looking at statistics or other published sources. Therefore, if a person approaches someone, tells him that he is conducting market research and asks a question, that is covered by sub-paragraph (7). The person who is asked the question has immediate knowledge of the fact that he is being interviewed.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-29_para20"></a>I believe that that general power, which does not apply exclusively for the purposes of market research, could pave the way for a loophole. It would become too easy for people to say that they were conducting market research, whereas proper market research is carried out by people looking at either published statistics or statistics in the public domain. Market research is also carried out by questioning people about what they think and whether they buy a certain product, or whatever.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-29_para21"></a>If it is the latter, that is covered by sub-paragraph (7). That is why I believe that the words which the amendment seeks to remove are unnecessary for the purposes of the Bill and possibly could be used as a loophole by those who do not wish to be regulated in their various activities. I beg to move.

<A NAME="10130-30_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   As the noble Viscount knows, the Bill is directed primarily at those who provide services under contract or, in the case of door supervisors and wheelclampers, those who are also employed in-house.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-30_para0"></a>The amendment would remove from exemption from regulation private investigation activities conducted in support of market research. Although a number of people may find it irritating regularly to be stopped in the street by market researchers or to receive their questionnaires, one cannot say that they are conducting activities which are in any way associated with the private security industry. Therefore, we take the view that it would be wrong to give a false impression that their activities might be covered by the provisions of the Bill. The exemption <P>


<a name="column_676"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 676</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>from inadvertent regulation, which is achieved by Schedules 2(4)(2) and 2(4)(9), is an important clarification.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-30_para1"></a>My understanding is that the amendment would take out of exemption and into regulation people who conduct market research activities. Therefore, undoubtedly the amendment would weaken the effective targeting of the regulation introduced by the Bill as it would take in people who should be excluded.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-30_para2"></a>In our view, sub-paragraph (2) is not needed because market researchers would need to ask people questions. Therefore, they would be excluded by sub-paragraph (7). We agree with that point. In any event, market research--that is, asking questions of individuals--may well be excluded by that paragraph. However, other forms of market research exist, such as general surveys and non-personalised research. We believe that the paragraph avoids doubt. I hope that that clarifies the point. Perhaps I may suggest to the noble Viscount that he withdraws the amendment. I believe that we are already well covered.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-30_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I am somewhat confused by the Minister's reply. I think he would agree that paragraph (7) on page 23 includes activities by market researchers who ask questions. Once they ask a question, it is carried out "with the knowledge or consent". They would have to be quite clever to ask a question and for the person not to know that it was being asked. That form of market research is covered. That is the reason I tabled my amendment. I felt that paragraph (2) is not necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-30_para3"></a>The Minister said that it is necessary because we need what I believe he described as "non-generalised research". I do not have a clue what that means. It would seem to me to be taking information from available public sources, whether that be from universities or wherever. It is not implied in any way that that is covered in the Bill. I cannot see that anybody will get the idea from doing market research that they will suddenly be covered by the Bill. Therefore, I maintain that the paragraph is unnecessary. I do not understand why the Minister needs it.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-30_para4"></a>However, I shall read carefully what the Minister has said. Perhaps he will consider the issue and write to me between now and the next stage and state why the Government feel that the paragraph is necessary.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-30_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I thank the noble Viscount for giving way. I suspect that the lateness of the hour has affected my brain. Perhaps I did not explain the issue as carefully as I should. It is "non-personalised" research, in other words not asking people, that needs to be excluded. That is the point on which we may well differ. We cannot agree the amendment. We do not think that it works in the way suggested by the noble Viscount. If in what I said I inadvertently gave the impression that I agreed with him, that was not the <P>


<a name="column_677"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>case. However, if there is further mystery after this exchange, I am sure that it can be clarified between now and Report.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-30_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I was not suggesting that the Minister agreed to delete paragraph (2) but that he agreed that paragraph (7) covers asking questions in the guise of market research. However, what he is saying is that he needs paragraph (2) to cover other types of market research. We shall have to study that closely to see what is covered. I shall consider it before the next stage and perhaps I may ask the Minister to do so. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

("( ) This paragraph does not apply to any activities of a person who is a member of--

(a) the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales,
<BR>
(b) the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland,

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "10130-30_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 49A inserts a new paragraph, which refers to accountants. I should first declare at least a theoretical interest. I say "theoretical" because I am not a practising accountant. However, I am a qualified chartered accountant and, by that means, licensed to carry out audits, and so forth under various provisions. Nowadays the regulations have been tightened up a good deal, so I do not think that I am licensed to do much.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-30_para8"></a>I also admit at once that the drafting of this paragraph could be improved. However, the point behind it is a real one. The immediately preceding provision rightly provides that lawyers and those employed by them shall be able to carry out investigations for the purpose of their legal practice. A large number of accountants these days, particularly forensic accountants, are engaged in investigating fraud and rackets of one kind and another. On a wider level, auditors are engaged in examining books for, among other things, possible fraud. They also examine the operations of companies to ensure that fraud is not taking place. All these are investigatory activities of the kind otherwise covered. I think it is important that unless the Government want to have this security industry authority license every practising accountant in the country, with a large number of their staffs, some provision of the general character represented by this amendment should be inserted into the Bill.

I hope that is what the noble Lord the Minister will say in response to the amendment, which I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-30_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   It is not the intention of the Bill to catch groups such as chartered accountants, auditors, insolvency practitioners and all those employed in similar occupations. I think the noble Lord makes a good point.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-30_para10"></a>Primarily of course it is directed at security operatives providing services under contract: door supervisors, wheelclampers and those employed in-house, as we have rehearsed before. Those are covered by the provisions in Schedule 2. This amendment seeks to exempt chartered accountants, and I understand that. However, it is important to place on record that it has never been our intention to license anyone carrying out security activities only incidental to their main employment. Accordingly, the Bill is drafted to allow for their exclusion. Paragraph 4(8) states that the provision does not apply to the activities of any person who carries out inquiries or investigations merely incidentally to the carrying out of activities that are not those of a security operative.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-30_para11"></a>I understand the business of forensic accountants and the important investigative work carried out, but it would be our contention that they would simply stand to be exempted from the effects of the Bill. Chartered accountants would also fall into that category; so we do not think that the amendment is necessary. I have listened with interest to what the noble Lord has had to say about this, and of course I will go away and double-check the point because it is certainly not our intention to snare people inadvertently in the way he suggests. I am grateful to him for having raised the issue in the way he did.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-30_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord the Minister for saying that he will look at this matter. In doing so, I hope he will bear in mind the position not only of forensic accountants but of all investigating accountants. We should bear in mind that without a paragraph of this character, the Bill says that this licensing applies--looking at paragraph 4(1) of Schedule 2--to any inquiries or investigations for obtaining information about the circumstances in which or the means by which property has been lost or damaged.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-30_para12"></a>We established earlier in the evening that property includes cash and other valuables, but apart from that, of course, the stock of a business is an essential part of its operations, into which accountants inquire in the ordinary course of their business. It is a perfectly ordinary large part of the activities of auditors to make investigations of the kind which seem to me to be covered by paragraph 4(1) and so in these circumstances, unless there is some sort of exclusion of <P>


<a name="column_679"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 679</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the kind I am suggesting, we shall find ourselves having to get licences for ordinary practising accountants as well as for forensic accountants, which firmly seem to be covered. Whether or not that is the Government's intention I am not sure. In view of the fact that this will be looked at again, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-31_para0"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10130-31_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: We now turn to journalists. Amendment No. 50 is grouped with the Government's Amendment No. 51 which modifies the definition of "journalist" in a way which is agreeable to the Newspaper Society. I support that but my amendment suggests that not everyone who says that he is gathering information in order to have it printed in a book or newspaper is likely to achieve that. Many people believe that they have a good idea and go to a great deal of trouble to carry out investigations which they say will appear in a book. There is a danger that the provision will provide a "get-out" for many people, some of whom will use it as such and some who will be cranks.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-31_para2"></a>I do not believe that the revised wording put forward by the Government in Amendment No. 51 improves the situation. No doubt the definition is better but it does not improve the situation at which Amendment No. 50 is directed. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-31_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I shall deal with both amendments and I am grateful for the noble Lord's comments on both. The definition of "journalism" used in the classificatory exemption in paragraph 4(5) is purpose-based; that is, it exempts activities which are undertaken by a person who intends there to be a journalistic-type publication or disclosure of the direct or indirect results of the research undertaken. The key is that some form of publication, not necessarily immediate or directly related to the precise investigation being undertaken, must be intended.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-31_para3"></a>The amendment would remove that purpose-based concept and substitute one which is apparently more objective but which is, in reality, not helpful. Who, for example, would be the judge of whether publication was "likely"?
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-31_para4"></a>The newspaper industry has suggested to us that the drafting of this paragraph could be improved. The Government agree and have tabled an amendment giving substantial effect to the suggestions made to us. We have not been advised by the newspaper industry to move away from a purpose-based definition; indeed, quite the reverse. Our amendment to this paragraph therefore maintains this approach, which we are sure provides greater clarity and is more acceptable to those affected by it.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-31_para5"></a>Our amendment is largely technical and seeks to broaden the scope of the exemption for those who undertake activities related to journalism. It is <P>


<a name="column_680"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 680</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>designed to ensure that those individuals are excluded from the definition of "private investigator". It is not the intention of the Bill to require the licensing of individuals who undertake activities, as defined in paragraph 4(1), where these activities are related to journalism. Paragraph 4(5) therefore provides the exemption for those activities.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-31_para6"></a>It has been suggested to us by the Newspaper Society that the definition in the Bill is narrow and could be improved. We have reflected on that and agree. The amendment to paragraph 4(5) will broaden the scope of the exemption so that it widens the range of activities. The new text explicitly takes into exemption from regulation activities which are related to artistic, literary or reference material.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-31_para7"></a>I understand where the noble Lord is coming from but, on reflection, we believe that we have got it about right. It is right to suggest that the Newspaper Society is happy with our proposals.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-31_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   I suspect that in future anyone accused of "snooping" investigations who is caught in the act will say that when he collected the information or took the photograph he intended to send it to the local paper.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "10130-31_para13"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 53 I should like to speak also to Amendment No. 54. Amendment No. 53 is a technical amendment which seeks to ensure that premises which are licensed outside London under the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 are covered by the provisions of the Bill. The amendment is designed to achieve consistency and to cover events such as raves, where alcohol may not be present, which take place in London but not elsewhere. On behalf of the Home Office, I confess that this was a technical oversight as it is described today.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-31_para14"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 54 which is again technical in nature. The amendment seeks to ensure that door supervisors who operate at casinos or bingo clubs are excluded from the provisions of the Bill. <P>


<a name="column_681"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 681</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Paragraph 8 of Schedule 2 contains provisions relating to door supervisors. Our policy is to require all door supervisors to be licensed by the new authority, regardless of whether they are employed in-house or supply their services under contract. However, for these purposes we restrict the definition of "door supervisors" to those who provide services at pubs and clubs, which we believe are the source of most public concern. Paragraph 8(2) defines what is meant by "licensed premises" in this context, and paragraph 8(3) provides clarificatory exemptions as to what is not meant by that term.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-31_para15"></a>We do not intend the provisions of the Bill to apply to door supervisors who operate at casinos or bingo clubs since personnel who work at those premises are already tightly regulated by the Gaming Act 1968. Unfortunately, the present drafting does not achieve that exclusion and a reference to the exclusion of premises licensed under Part II of the Gaming Act 1968 is required. I hope that the Committee will accept these straightforward, technical amendments. I beg to move Amendment No. 53.

<A NAME="10130-31_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees   (Lord Brougham and Vaux): </B>  Details of the procedure to be followed in Grand Committee are to be found in the opening passages of Hansard on the first day of Committee on the Bill on 23rd January.

<A NAME="10130-31_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Rix </B>   moved Amendment No. 87:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 9, insert the following new clause--
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-31_para22"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
PUBLICATION OF SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL NEEDS AND DISABILITY POLICY
<BR>
(" . In the Nursery Education and Grant-Maintained Schools Act 1996, insert the following section--
<BR>
"Publication of special educational needs and disability policy.
<BR>
3A.--(1) Any provider of nursery education who--
<BR>
(a) is in receipt of grant under the arrangements under section 1; and
<BR>
(b) is not a maintained school,
<BR>
shall prepare and publish a special educational needs and disability policy.
<BR>
(2) Regulations may make provision--
<BR>
(a) as to the content of the special educational needs and disability policy; and
<BR>
(b) for the review and amendment of the policy."").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "10130-31_para23"></a>The noble Lord said: As I am on first at this third matinee in the Moses Room, I apologise for the soliloquy that is about to follow. I assure Members of the Committee that it is short, but it may appear greedy in the cluster of new clauses in front of us.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-31_para24"></a>Aware of the ability of the parliamentary draftsman to make silk purses out of sows' ears, my hope is that the Government will accept the principle of what I am trying to do and achieve the desired result with more elegance and economy than I and my advisers have been able to marshal. If the Minister wishes to offer reassurance rather than legislation, I shall of course listen carefully to what she has to say, though the reassurance that it will not rain is rather less reassuring than actually having an umbrella.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-31_para25"></a>I seek three things. The first is to ensure that those who receive public funds to educate three and four year olds have a published policy on special educational needs and disability. The second is to require local authorities to assist agencies funded to <P>


<a name="column_140"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 140</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>provide nursery education by providing them with appropriate goods and services. The third is to have plans for children with special educational needs or disabilities written into the early years development and childcare plans.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-31_para26"></a>I am well aware that early years plans and policies pay some attention to special needs and that there is for example guidance on having a special educational needs co-ordinator covering the foundation stage. However, there is not a statutory requirement to have the policy which the special educational needs co-ordinator will oversee. Nor is there a statutory requirement to put into mainstream nursery provision the sort of goods and services that will enable children who are a little different from the ordinary run of service users to be included. Finally, I have never been sure that what I shall call, for simplicity's sake, children with disabilities, stand out in the existing guidance from the wider issues of disadvantaged groups and disadvantaged areas. In the plethora of very valuable initiatives for younger children, disabilities can get lost and the educational needs and disability link become a little unclear.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-31_para27"></a>For families with a disabled child at the early years stage, life can be particularly difficult--sans diagnosis, sans prognosis, sans experience and sans the toughness that the passage of years can bring. On the other hand, whatever the eventual diagnosis and prognosis (and for some that can be pretty grim) the early years are precious. My amendments are designed to help ensure that the right support is delivered by the right people in the right way at the right time during those precious early years. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-32_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   Very briefly, (though not very quietly), I support the noble Lord in these amendments and certainly in their thrust. According to some of the briefing I received on this Bill, "He'll grow out of it" must be the greatest mantra for virtually all children with disabilities, particularly those of the hidden kind. If we do not have some process for looking at this, it will be, "Put him to the back of the class". Also, in very young classes, there is always the temptation to push them quietly back and say, "He's not very good at writing yet; let him play and draw for a bit". Those things do happen; they have happened in the past. The noble Lord is pointing out something that has a real historical basis. This would be one attempt to address the problem.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-32_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Morris of Manchester: </B>   I thank my friend the noble Lord, Lord Rix, for having moved this amendment. A question of fundamental importance for the Minister is whether she can confirm that LEAs will be required to provide educational support to children and their parents post-diagnosis and up to three years of age. It is a question of particular importance for children with disabilities such as deafness, whose lives can be revolutionised by the benefits of early intervention and the harnessing of new technology before and after speech and language acquisition. Moreover, those benefits will significantly increase the chances of a child's successful mainstream <P>


<a name="column_141"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 141</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>education. Given all that, is it not crucially important to have it confirmed on the face of the Bill? I know my noble friend will reply as helpfully as she can.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-32_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department for Education and Employment   (Baroness Blackstone): </B>  The amendment would require early years education settings and early years development and childcare partnerships--which I will refer to from now on as partnerships--to set out their policies on plans for children with special needs or disabilities. It would also require local authorities to supply goods and services to support children with SEN in an early years setting delivering Government-funded early education.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-32_para0"></a>We do not believe the proposed changes are necessary. However, having said that, perhaps I could respond immediately to the question put by my noble friend Lord Morris of Manchester. LEAs do not have the same duties towards children under two as they have in respect of those over two. However, they have the power to make and maintain a statement for children under two if they consider it necessary, and they must carry out an assessment of a child with SEN if they need to determine the special educational provision that the child needs and the parents request an assessment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-32_para1"></a>To a large extent, practice has shown that the most effective interventions for very young children are those that involve the input of services other than education. Such children may be "children in need" under the Children Act 1989 and, therefore, their parents can expect support, advice and appropriate provision from both social services and the health authority. The Children Act places a specific duty on local authorities to provide services designed to minimise the effect on disabled children within the area of their disabilities and to give such children the opportunity to lead lives that are as normal as possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-32_para2"></a>For children under three, it is common practice for LEAs to provide educational services through portage home visiting services or peripatetic sensory support services where they are needed. Those services are provided without statutory assessment or a statement. Such educational support is usually allied to support from the other statutory services such as health.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-32_para3"></a>Appropriate provision for young children is very important, so I entirely support what the noble Lord, Lord Rix, and my noble friend Lord Morris of Manchester have just said. We would be very happy to discuss the matter further with interested parties before Report stage if that would be helpful.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-32_para4"></a>I shall say a little more about why we think there are other routes to achieve what lies behind the amendments. I reiterate that the Government accept the importance of early identification of special needs and the provision of appropriate support for young children with SEN and disabilities, so I am grateful that this concern has been raised.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-32_para5"></a>Let me deal first with Amendment No. 87. This seeks to put a requirement on the face of the Bill to ensure that early years settings delivering government <P>


<a name="column_142"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 142</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>funded early education have an SEN and disability policy. I do not think that that is necessary. Perhaps I could take the opportunity to update the Committee on the kinds of actions that have already been taken.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-32_para6"></a>All partnerships are required under the School Standards and Framework Act to admit a plan for approval by the Secretary of State. To meet the criteria for approval, the plans are expected to provide information as requested in the Early Years Development and Childcare Partnership Planning Guidance. For 2000-01, the partnership plans had to include an annex addressing special educational needs and disabilities and this will also be a criterion for future years. Among other things, the guidance asks, in relation to children with SEN or a disability, for an implementation plan and details of how children will have equal access to childcare and early years services.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-32_para7"></a>All early years settings delivering government funded early education for three and four year-olds must be registered with their partnership to receive any grant. It is a condition of registration that providers agree to be bound by the conditions of grant and for periods during which they are claiming grant.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-32_para8"></a>It is also the case that all early years settings in receipt of government funding are required by law to have regard to the SEN code of practice.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-32_para9"></a>The 2001-02 revision of Requirements of Nursery Education Grant will make it a full condition of grant for settings to have an SEN policy. Setting such a requirement is currently an option for LEAs but making it one of the full conditions on which grant is dependent makes a very significant strengthening of the arrangements. All settings providing early education and/or childcare will be subject to disability duties under the DDA, once the Act is in force.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-32_para10"></a>In due course we will issue specific guidance for partnerships and their early education settings to help them to understand and implement the requirements of that legislation. The Disability Rights Commission's code of practice on Part III of the DDA and on the new disability duties to be imposed by the Bill will provide detailed guidance on the disability duties contained in those provisions.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-32_para11"></a>We have set targets for all partnerships to make sure that by 2001-02 they deliver the foundation stage, and by the end of 2001-02 an SEN co-ordinator--sometimes known as a SENCO--responsible for establishing and implementing the settings for SEN and equal opportunities policy.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-32_para12"></a>It is also the case that the latest version of the Ofsted Handbook for Inspecting Nursery Education in the Private, Voluntary and Independent Sectors requires the inspectors to obtain copies of the settings' SEN and other policy documents for consideration as part of the inspection. There is thus a genuine means of monitoring and enforcement which underpins our very great commitment to seeing improvements in this area.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-32_para13"></a>Finally, the Curriculum guidance for the foundation stage, which was published in June last year, sets out the importance of creating an inclusive learning environment. It makes clear that practitioners need to <P>


<a name="column_143"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 143</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>plan for each child's learning requirements, including those with particular needs. We will support partnerships and settings by issuing specific guidance to help them to understand and implement their obligations to children with special educational needs and other disabilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-32_para14"></a>Let me turn briefly to Amendment No. 88. Currently, local authorities are granted powers under the Education Act 1996 to supply goods or services to help with special educational provision for children with SEN in early years settings, delivering the government funded early education. This amendment seeks to change these powers to a duty but that is not necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-32_para15"></a>Many LEAs and local partnerships are already working very effectively to support children in early year settings within the private, independent and voluntary sectors.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-32_para16"></a>In the 2001-02 version of the Early Years Development and Childcare Partnership Planning Guidance, we have asked the partnerships to make sure that they have developed a clear strategy to allow all children to have equal access to childcare and early educational services regardless of their special educational needs or disability.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-32_para17"></a>In 2001-02 we are making available £41.5 million to partnerships, via their LEAs, to fund training and development for early years practitioners, including the SENCOs so that there is much better infrastructure support than there has been.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-32_para18"></a>We are working with partnerships to increase the early identification of SEN and for them to intervene where it is required so that there is better access to appropriate support and services. Those actions demonstrate our long-term commitment to improving the provision.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-32_para19"></a>I turn now to the final amendment in the group, Amendment No. 89. Again, the Government do not believe this amendment to be necessary. We have set partnership targets in their plans to improve SEN support and provide help where it is needed, by establishing SENCOs and developing networks of area SENCOs.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-32_para20"></a>I hope that I have reassured both noble Lords who have spoken in this debate and my noble friend who asked me a specific question, that early years and childcare development partnerships, working together with their early years settings, local authorities and other support services are making significant advancement.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-32_para21"></a>The special needs of young children must and will be identified early; that is absolutely paramount. Partnerships will ensure that the appropriate course of action is taken. On that basis, and with a suggestion that further discussions can take place on how to really make this work, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Rix, will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<A NAME="10130-33_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Morris of Manchester: </B>   Before my noble friend sits down, I want warmly to thank her for her response <P>


<a name="column_144"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 144</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to my intervention. With I am sure many colleagues, I welcome and will be pleased to take up the kind offer she made, as I am sure will the RNID, whose enormous help to all deaf people is so widely admired on both sides of the Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-33_para0"></a>Would the Minister agree with me that current local government practice does not exemplify joined-up services in this area and, if so, how do the Government propose to change this?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-33_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   There is always room for improvement in joined-up services. That is a long-standing problem. Successive governments have often found it particularly difficult to get really good joined-up services, but this Government are committed to trying to improve them, particularly in relation to young children with special educational needs.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-33_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   I thank the Minister for her generous response to these three amendments which, as can probably be imagined, were inspired by the special education consortium. They did raise one point that I should like to leave with the Minister.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-33_para1"></a>The difficulty with the guidance is that something can be a requirement of a grant one year, as with the provider's policies. But it can change its status the next year if it is not a primary requirement. Equally, governments sometimes change and the special education consortium would welcome a commitment to anything more enduring than guidance.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-33_para2"></a>Having said that, I am delighted that the opportunity will be given to the SEC to have further discussions with the Minister's department. At the same time, the response was sufficiently encouraging for me to be able to say: I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-33_para3"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-33_para4"></a>[Amendments Nos. 88 and 89 not moved.]

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-33_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Lucas </B>   moved Amendment No. 90:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 9, insert the following new clause--
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-33_para5"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
EXERCISE OF RIGHTS BY CHILD
<BR>
(" . In section 576 of the 1996 Act (meaning of "parent"), after subsection (4) insert--
<BR>
"(5) For the purposes of Part IV of this Act, a child may exercise the rights conferred on a parent in relation to the Special Educational Needs Tribunal if that Tribunal declares that he is capable of so doing."").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "10130-33_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 90 returns to the public the rights of the child vis-a-vis the parent and looks at the question of appeals to the tribunal. The Minister said some helpful things at an early stage of this Committee on the way in which tribunals would take into account a child's views. Nonetheless, a child does not have a right of action in front of the committee. There will be occasions, notably I suspect for the child in care, where the local authority outside the tribunal table is the child's parents for the purposes of the tribunal. Therefore, if the child has no independent right of action, he or she may have no real way of getting in front of the tribunal. There will be other occasions when the child is in dispute with his or her parents and wishes to make an appeal to the <P>


<a name="column_145"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 145</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>tribunal when his own parents do not. It is not unknown now for children to sue their parents for various reasons, and there will certainly be occasions where a child will wish to take action in front of a tribunal when the parents are unwilling to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-33_para7"></a>If the tribunal feels it appropriate, I do not see why a child should not have a right of action in front of the tribunal. It would seem to be a reasonable extension in these modern times of the rights of a child. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-33_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   Amendment No. 90 would create dual rights of appeal for the parent and the child where the tribunal considers the child capable. This could be confusing and is not necessary. I hope that what I am about to say will be clear to the noble Lord, Lord Lucas.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-33_para8"></a>The new SEN tribunal regulations which will be laid before Parliament soon will entitle the child to attend the hearing of an appeal and to give evidence at the tribunal's discretion. The current regulations do not expressly entitle the child to attend the hearing, so we are moving exactly in the direction that the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, wants. In the light of these reassurances, I hope that he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-33_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   That does not answer the question I have raised. That is the answer the Minister gave a week or more ago, and which I welcome; it is excellent news. The question I am raising, however, is, where are the parents? Suppose the parent is the local authority. Is the local authority supposed to take itself to the tribunal? Are we really supposed to believe that that is practical? If a child in care is being dumbed down by the local education authority, will the local education authority take itself to court to make itself provide more?
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-33_para9"></a>Surely there are occasions--I do not just refer to disputes between a child and his parent which I can understand may cause the Minister some difficulty--where the local authority is the parent for these purposes. I may be misreading the legislation, but it seems to me that there is no other obvious parent or no truly independent parent of a child in care. I will listen to what the Minister says on that, but that is the question I am asking.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-33_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   Where it is a case of children in care, the local authority is the parent and has to act as the parent. In those circumstances the local authority would be required to allow an eligible child to appear before the tribunal.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-33_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   Yes, they would appear before the tribunal, but who is going to take the case to the tribunal? The child has no right on its own initiative to take the matter to the tribunal. It is the parent who can take the matter to the tribunal, but the parent is the local authority. How on earth in those circumstances is a child supposed to get there? A child has a right to speak in front of a tribunal, but it cannot get in front of a tribunal. That is the problem I am addressing in <P>


<a name="column_146"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 146</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the amendment. The Minister is not providing me with an answer. I will not press the matter further, but I will certainly come back to this on Report, and will be grateful for anything she can say to me before that stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-33_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Before my noble friend withdraws his amendment--I suspect that is what he is going to do--there is a genuine lacuna in the Bill that my noble friend found. While he was speaking to the amendment I realised that there is a point to be considered here.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-33_para10"></a>It is fanciful to say that the LEA would never ever let a child down who is in institutional care within the authority. If the LEA is capable of letting down children with bona fide parents at home, and/or foster parents who can act in loco parentis for a child, then it is capable of letting down a child in care.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-33_para11"></a>As mere observers of children in care, some of us would say that many of our children, probably a disproportionate number who are in care, are let down. It takes a stretch of the imagination to believe that the LEA would find itself wanting and would take itself before the tribunal in the interests of the child. Whether the amendment of my noble friend Lord Lucas is acceptable or not, the point he is making is extremely important. It would help me and I suspect other members of the Committee to know how a child in those circumstances can be represented. We are all open to the consideration of novel alternatives to the normal process. This is a real issue. The most vulnerable are those children in institutional care.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-33_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   I accept a great deal of what has been said by both the noble Baroness and the noble Lord. However, it may be a mistake to see the local authority here as a totally seamless, single organisation. I said that it is the local authority which has to be the parent in those circumstances, not the LEA. The LEA is responsible for SEN provision but it is the local authority and indeed the social services department which have responsibility for children in care. Thus, it would be representatives of the social services department who would mount the case in support of the child where there was an argument as to whether the child was receiving adequate provision. I hope that that response helps although it may not entirely satisfy noble Lords opposite.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-33_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   In the most perfect of all possible worlds that would naturally be the case and Ministers would not have to sign up to ministerial codes. Nor would any of us go on registers of interest because we would all behave perfectly and no conflict of interest would ever cause anyone to suspect that we might act awry. However, this is an enormous conflict of interest for any local authority to be faced with: that its own local education authority--a very large part of the authority--is misbehaving in relation to a child and that that child wants the local authority to take its own local education authority to the tribunal.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-33_para12"></a>There is a clear and obvious conflict of interest and it is not satisfactory to rely on the goodwill of local authorities. That may in many cases be there but we <P>

<A NAME = "10130-34_para3"></a>That is the backdrop to what I want to say to this amendment, which would allow the Secretary of State to make regulations requiring LEAs to hold sufficient funding centrally to maintain specialist support and advisory services for children with low incidence disabilities, such as visual impairment--services which cannot effectively be delivered by delegation to individual schools.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-34_para4"></a>There are 22,000 children and young people under 16 in the United Kingdom whose sight is impaired in such a way that they require additional support for their learning. Visual impairment is a low incidence disability and one for which specialist support is vital from the earliest stage that visual impairment is identified. The funding implications for equipment and support can be enormous and there is significant need for flexibility in order for resources and expertise to be employed as cost effectively as possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-34_para5"></a>A sufficient level of funding must be held centrally in order to ensure the co-ordination and provision of support services, to enable statutory assessments to be carried out by qualified specialists in visual impairment. Entitlement for visually impaired pupils to equipment and support must be safeguarded. Access to mobility and orientation services must be guaranteed, an issue which was debated earlier. Access to transport must be provided not only during school hours, but also to make it possible for children and <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>young people to participate in after-school activities such as homework and computer clubs and to promote the full inclusion of pupils who are visually impaired.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-34_para6"></a>We have talked about cross-party support for delegation to schools, but we all admit that there is a tension as to how an education authority can fulfil its central duties to provide for special needs and how the schools can meet those special needs unless there is a system of money flowing flexibly in such a way that the children who require the resources receive them.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-34_para7"></a>Most LEAs provide specialist visual impairment services to support blind and partially sighted pupils in mainstream, resourced and special schools in that way. That has proved vital to the process of inclusion of visually impaired children in mainstream schools and special schools for the past 18 years.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-34_para8"></a>The Royal National Institute for the Blind agrees that schools should be expected to presume responsibility for their own development needs and priorities, but it argues that specialist support services for low-incidence disabilities cannot be effectively or efficiently provided and that if sufficient resources are not retained centrally by LEAs for these services, there will be consequences. For example, the early identification of visual impairment is likely to be severely threatened. The LEA advisory services for visual impairment provide that key function prior to statementing, often well before a child even gets to school. Standards could be compromised, as individual heads and governors lack the knowledge and expertise to devise job descriptions and judge the competencies of qualified teachers of the visually impaired. They may not fully appreciate the teachers' need for specific resources and training.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-34_para9"></a>A further consequence would be the loss of the flexibility afforded by central funding of visual impairment staff, which enables them to be deployed where they are needed. Appointing staff to a resourced school may only guarantee employment for a few years to cover a given group of visually impaired children, leaving heads and governors with difficult hiring and firing decisions when children move on. An LEA-wide service can adapt to the needs of children in both resourced and other mainstream schools where children may need more or less support.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-34_para10"></a>While the recent Green Paper on local government finance contains proposals that could begin to improve the clarity and certainty of SEN funding--for example, by giving separate assessment for schools and LEAs and giving LEAs three-year funding settlements--the Government need to issue guidance to LEAs to ensure the future stability of LEA-wide support services for low-incidence disabilities such as visual impairment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-34_para11"></a>To encapsulate what I have sought to say, delegation will go ahead. My party supports the Government's robust programme on that. We vie with the Liberals as to who was the first to support devolving funds to schools. There is a case for devolving some special needs funding to schools. All schools contain a range of abilities within the 20 per cent of children whom we have come to know as the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Warnock children, from the low end to the severe end of the special needs scale. However, there is a role for the LEA and I am not suggesting absolute answers.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-34_para12"></a>My noble friend argued for flexibility in the system to ensure that the LEA's responsibilities are properly met and that the LEA properly supports the schools to meet their obligations under the law. It seems sensible to give the Secretary of State a reserve power to ensure that flexibility. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-34_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   I support the amendment. The important issue of resources was raised on Second Reading and during the first day in Committee. On this occasion I support entirely what the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, has said in relation to the role of LEAs. It is vital that they retain an overall function for the supply of support services. There are many specialist support services which cannot reasonably be delegated to schools and where it is much more efficient and sensible to retain them at the LEA level.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-34_para13"></a>While it is important that the regulations make clear that the LEAs have the responsibility we are discussing and that they should retain at the LEA level sufficient resources to be able to carry out that responsibility, it is also important that the Secretary of State ensures that, under the standard spending assessments and the revenue support grants, the LEAs receive enough money to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-34_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   While I entirely agree with the gist of what the noble Baronesses have said, I fear that I may disappoint them because the Government do not feel that this amendment is necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-34_para14"></a>The reason that the amendment is not necessary is that it would allow regulations to be made requiring LEAs to reserve sufficient resources to discharge their duties under Part IV of the Education Act 1996, as amended. Part IV covers the main provisions dealing with LEAs' duties towards children with special educational needs.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-34_para15"></a>It is of course important that LEAs continue to spend money in this area, but this amendment is unnecessary because they will retain their statutory duties towards children with special educational needs. Lack of, or failure to reserve, such resources by an LEA would not relieve it of such duties. These duties include those under Section 313 (to have regard to the code of practice), Section 315 (to keep its arrangements for special educational provision under review) and Section 321 (duty to secure that it identifies children in its area with SEN, and for whom it is necessary that the LEA determines the special educational provision for which their learning difficulty calls).
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-34_para16"></a>As these statutory duties remain, there should not be a need for secondary legislation to require sufficient resources to be set aside: by definition LEAs already have to plan properly to meet their statutory requirements and, in consequence, ensure that the necessary funding to carry these out is available. We <P>


<a name="column_150"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 150</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>think that the law is sufficient here and we do not have any intention to change the words in the code on this point.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-34_para17"></a>Even with the move to greater delegation of funding to schools, LEAs will still retain, as they should, a key role in SEN provision. We have recognised this continuing key role in our October 2000 policy paper, The Role of the LEA in School Education. But we also recognise that schools themselves are, in many cases, best placed to determine the most appropriate provision for pupils with SEN, including those with visual impairment. Governing bodies of maintained schools must continue to be under a duty to use their best endeavours to secure that the special educational provision which a pupil's learning difficulties calls for is made in those schools.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-34_para18"></a>There are many examples of funds being delegated to schools while, at the same time, a high quality service to those schools has been maintained by the LEA. I believe that North Lincolnshire is a good example of a place where this happens effectively.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-34_para19"></a>In the light of that explanation, I hope that the noble Baroness, on behalf of her noble friend, feels able to withdraw this amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="10130-35_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   Before my noble friend speaks, I would be fascinated if the noble Baroness could let me have whatever information she has on how good Lincolnshire is. I know this is a problem which troubles a number of local authorities. They are faced with a target of 85 per cent delegation and many rural local authorities will be spending close to 6 per cent now on transport, which they are not allowed to delegate. The SEN budget is 5 per cent and rising and, in good local authorities, it can rise quite quickly because the understanding of needs, and the provisions that need to be made, is rising. and they find themselves in a great deal of difficulty. Blindness affects 22,000 children--an average of one per school. That means that a lot of schools do not have a blind child from one year to the next and then suddenly two will come. How can a local authority delegate funds to deal with such sporadic occurrences? There are times when it is more efficient to keep the resources in the centre and allocate them as particular needs arise in schools.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-35_para0"></a>That is a difficult issue for local authorities. I have heard many of them saying that they do not know which way to turn. Since the noble Baroness does know which way to turn, I would be delighted if she would inform me so that I can pass on the good news.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-35_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   The Government predict that there will be a substantial shift of young people into mainstream schooling. None of us will be in a position to challenge that presumption until we see what happens.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-35_para1"></a>I have looked a number of times at the financial appraisal in the Explanatory Notes. It does not tally with the idea that there is going to be a shift of young people with special educational needs from special into mainstream schools. Paragraph 130 says:

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-35_para2"></a>
The estimate for that is £4 per school. There are 25,000 schools in this country, and the budget is £100,000 per year. I can barely pay for the time to write a letter that would cost £4; it is a very strange sum of money.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-35_para3"></a>Paragraph 129 says:

It goes on to say:

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-35_para5"></a>
The Minister may rightly say that not every school needs adjustments, but many schools will if they are to take partially sighted young people. Noble Lords will remember that I referred to orientation classes as well as bricks and mortar.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-35_para6"></a>The Explanatory Notes also say:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the cost of funding LEA projects to make schools more accessible will be supported by the Schools Access Initiative."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-35_para7"></a>
Some £220 million will be made available over the three years. That works out at £9 per school--again a modest sum. I am deeply suspicious about trying to reconcile the Government's prediction that a substantial number of children will move from special into mainstream education with their expectation of the resources that will be required.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-35_para8"></a>It will be difficult to predict what will be needed with any accuracy. For example, the staffing costs are said to be worth nothing. No amount is allocated for them. Presumably, the Government think that there will be no staffing implication. If those young people are to have support staff in school who transfer with them, there will be a staffing implication. Paragraph 141 says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The SEN provisions will have very few manpower implications".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-35_para9"></a>
The Government do not even see fit to put a figure on it.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-35_para10"></a>I find it difficult to reconcile the Government's robust prediction that many more young people will move into mainstream with the most modest costs that I have ever seen in a Bill. We need some means by which national government can assist LEAs and schools, with funding streaming from one through to the other, so that they meet their obligations without creating serious adverse effects on other parts of the service. We have had sensitive debates about impact on other young people, in particular, children who do not have special educational needs. The impact would be quite substantial if there was not some flexible arrangement for the Government, who are the proposers and sponsors of this legislation, to ensure that the resources are in place. Otherwise we will have a building up of expectations and a dashing of them once the Bill is enacted.

<A NAME="10130-35_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   Perhaps I may try to respond to some of those points. First, I should be delighted to send information on north Lincolnshire to the noble <P>


<a name="column_152"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 152</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord, Lord Lucas, and explain why that council seems to be a role model for other authorities. Perhaps I may say also that the Government have always been quite clear that they are not delegating to schools responsibility for special educational needs provision. That is something that we have felt very strongly should be held back. Indeed, there are members of the noble Lord's party who believe we should have 100 per cent delegation to schools. But how could we if we are going to have local educational authorities providing for adequate term provision which needs to be done by the authority?
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-35_para11"></a>Perhaps I may say to the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, and the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, that I indicated earlier in Committee that substantial additional amounts of money are being allocated for the inclusion parts of the Bill. There is some confusion in that what the noble Baroness read out was not about the inclusion parts of the Bill, but about the disability part of the Bill where the costs are much lower. The Government recognise that, and I said at Second Reading that there are extra costs in moving towards mainstreaming. Indeed, that cost, as the noble Lord, Lord Baker of Dorking, said at one point, is well worth providing for. We are doing just that.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-35_para12"></a>I hope that explanation will clarify the position. The £1.5 million to £3 million is for reasonable adjustments under the disability part of the Bill. It is difficult to predict what they will be, but many of them will not in fact be very expensive on top of all the extra funding that is going in to promote inclusion.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-35_para13"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, is absolutely right when she says that a low incidence disability, such as visual impairment, will not be something for which many schools will have to provide. I imagine that in some cases those children who are blind or visually impaired will be in units attached to part of a school where there will be several such children rather than being distributed across a wide range of schools.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-35_para14"></a>I hope that what I have said on funding helps to explain the position.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-35_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I stand chastened for reading the financial paper, but it is the only financial paper there is in the Explanatory Notes; there is no other. It is headed up, "Effects of the Bill"--I take that to mean the Bill before us--"on Public Sector Finances". I read out a number of references, to schools, post-16, rights of redress, advice and conciliation services and SEN provisions.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-35_para15"></a>My understanding is that a financial paper at the end of any Explanatory Note refers to the whole Bill. It is not just as the Minister said; that is, that it only refers to part of the Bill. If it only refers to part of the Bill, there ought to be a cost appraisal of what the full measures of the Bill include.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-35_para16"></a>The Minister has spoken on good practice and referred to Lincolnshire. I happen to know Lincolnshire very well; it is my neighbouring county. A good friend of mine, Mr James Speechley, is the leader of the Lincolnshire Conservative Group. I know that the council's reputation goes before it in <P>


<a name="column_153"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 153</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>many spheres, including provision for special needs. So good practice is one thing but ultimately there is a tension in all our minds about the rhetoric and the expectations that are being raised by the Bill among many groups concerned about provision for children with special educational needs and the likely reality on the ground; namely, that local authorities are extremely hard pressed at present. They will face real difficulties. The noble Baroness said that we were not placing on schools the responsibility for delivering special educational needs. That is not true. Schools will have responsibility for delivering special educational needs. There seems to be no plan. If we refer to children with special educational needs rather than just those with severe learning difficulties, up to stage 3 it is very much a school-based provision. Schools have that part of their budget delegated. The amendment should ensure that LEAs and schools are able to meet fully the obligation with regard to this new tranche of young people coming into mainstream schools who will have the higher end of learning disabilities to be managed within mainstream schools. The Government are placing that obligation upon schools and LEAs through this legislation. The Government's responsibility is to ensure that they are held to account for that.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-35_para17"></a>My noble friend will want to read carefully what has been said during the course of this debate and I have no doubt that he will refer to the matter at a later stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

FUNDING OF TRAINING FOR SUPPORT STAFF
<BR>
(" . In the 1996 Act insert--
<BR>
"343A. The Secretary of State shall approve and fund formal training and qualifications for support staff operating to meet special educational needs within the maintained sector."").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "10130-35_para21"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving the amendment, I want to address training. It is a probing amendment. One of my concerns with the Government's proposals in the Bill is that they will lead to the early closure of special needs schools. Indeed, there is already evidence that special schools are closing across the country, many of them on financial grounds. The children normally served by those schools could be at a disadvantage if the support in mainstream schools is not adequate. This particular amendment refers to the effectiveness of the people--the actual staff--who will be supporting those children.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-35_para22"></a>I am concerned about the standards of training and qualifications of support staff in mainstream education. At present, special schools are apparently providing much of the informal training "on the job". With special schools admitting a broad range of children with special needs--anything from Down's syndrome or deafness to behavioural or emotional problems--there has been less pressure from formal qualifications in the mainstream sector. It has almost <P>


<a name="column_154"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 154</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>been a question of learning by osmosis. I have met many non-professional staff who are working with children with disabilities in the special schools' sector of special needs who have performed quite brilliantly. Therefore, one would say that if there were any test of their competence, they would pass with flying colours.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-35_para23"></a>Although in many parts of the mainstream sector there are currently higher thresholds for recruitment, in many cases there remains very little additional formal training. The closure or reduction of the specialist establishments, where most of the existing training takes place, will lead to a loss of training environment for support staff. Those will need to be replaced by the introduction of, for example, an NVQ in special educational support or some other recognised qualification. I feel strongly that it must remain the case that schools should retain the right to employ whoever they consider suitable for the post. To this extent, therefore, I am not proposing that such an NVQ should be a compulsory pre-requisite for employment as a special support assistant. I repeat: we can all think of staff employed as special assistants who do an absolutely wonderful and near-professional job. I believe that formal training provision should be made available, especially since the opportunities for informal training in special schools will almost certainly be reduced by the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-36_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My noble friend has a point. We shall have to make sure that people know what they are doing when they come newly into a situation, and some form of training provision would certainly seem sensible. If it is covered somewhere else, I shall be happy. But I believe that this matter must be addressed. Later amendments of mine cover teacher training.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-36_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   Significant record levels of funding are already available to LEAs and schools through the SEN component of the Standards Fund to support the training and professional development of both teachers and support staff working with children with SEN. In the current financial year we are supporting expenditure of £26 million on SEN training--an increase from £21 million last year--and we envisage that £30 million of the total £82 million available for SEN under the Standards Fund in 2001-02 will be spent on training.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-36_para0"></a>That funding is designed to support the implementation of the SEN code of practice and to give direct, practical help to schools and LEAs when implementing the policy of inclusion. But it is designed to be flexible as needs in one area, or indeed from one school to the next, may not necessarily be the same.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-36_para1"></a>A wide variety of providers currently offer courses of training in SEN, including some of the specialist voluntary bodies. We believe that such diversity is healthy, allowing flexibility and the ability to respond to changing needs.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-36_para2"></a>We can play our part. We are making available £350 million for recruitment and training of teaching assistants between April 1999 and March 2002. Within that programme of support we have devised an <P>


<a name="column_155"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 155</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>induction training course for newly-recruited teaching assistants, which includes an SEN component, SEN frameworks and processes within which teachers and assistants work, developed with the help of a member of the National Advisory Group on SEN. That course is being delivered across the country by LEAs from the autumn term 2000. There is also coverage of SEN within the literacy and numeracy modules, and we are keeping the need for further SEN training content under review in the light of experience with those courses.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-36_para3"></a>We have been working closely with the Local Government National Training Organisation and the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority in connection with their work on developing a national, UK-wide set of occupational standards for teaching assistants. Both are expected to be ready this year. They will provide an overall framework within which teaching assistants can demonstrate their abilities and develop their careers.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-36_para4"></a>The amendment refers to formal approval of courses and qualifications. We do not see the case for such a system at a time when we are trying to reduce bureaucracy in education. Indeed, creating a new administrative burden could have the unintended effect of dissuading current or potential providers from offering courses, which would be a pity. That is not to say that the Government should have no involvement in training at all: of course they should. There is a long-standing requirement for teachers of classes of pupils with visual impairment or hearing impairment or a combination of both to have an additional mandatory qualification approved by the Secretary of State and, of course, there are specific requirements laid down in relation to courses of initial teacher training, currently under review by the TTA. However, we see no need for a general requirement for courses for support staff to be subject to formal approval.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-36_para5"></a>Rather, we see our role as lying in somewhat different directions. We have established an inclusion website which is designed to promote good practice and publicise SEN materials and facilities available to teachers and support staff. That would include the courses that are on offer. And we will be working with the National Association for Special Educational Needs and others over the next year to develop some teacher training material of our own designed to meet specific needs. Our intention would be to cover the interests of support staff in this material.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-36_para6"></a>I hope that, having heard what I have had to say, the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="10130-36_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for that reply. She made many helpful points which I should like to read carefully. I should like to make three quick points. One is anecdotal. I was discussing the Bill with somebody who told me about a parent with an autistic child about whom that parent was extremely worried. The parent was not having the <P>


<a name="column_156"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 156</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>happiest experience. The special school assistant who was working with that child had a mere two hours' training from a standing start and the situation was not working out very well.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-36_para7"></a>Secondly, I believe that there is a need to think more positively about training for those who are working with young people with sometimes very complex special needs.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-36_para8"></a>Thirdly, it sounds as though I am pressing the Minister to do something about this matter. I hope that we will not go down the road of adopting the rigid recruitment bar that used to be applied to social work training where one had to have a very specific qualification. It seems to me that in the area of special needs different qualifications will be needed. Some thought needs to be given as to the suitability of someone to work with a young person with special needs. I hope that we will keep in mind the need for training to be made available; the need for people to be better trained and the need for them to receive more suitable training. However, we also need to adopt sufficient flexibility to enable schools to employ people whom they believe to be the right people to work with children with special disabilities.

<A NAME = "10130-36_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: I rise to move Amendment No. 91A and to speak to Amendments Nos. 92A and 92B. These three amendments are probing amendments relating to the word "justified", which is in the proposed new Section 28B(1)(b). Amendments Nos. 91A and 92B relate to independent schools. I shall come later to Amendment No. 92A which relates to maintained schools.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-36_para13"></a>Independent schools are often small and some specialise in particular ability ranges in sport, music, gymnastics or whatever. Can every school be expected to accept any and every form of disability? There are so many different kinds of disability. The National Union of Teachers says that the range of disabilities is vast and that enormous research would have to be undertaken for schools to inform themselves of every possible condition. Perhaps each school in the independent sector should be encouraged to cope with one disability. However, as I read the Bill, it might deny an independent school the opportunity to concentrate on doing one job well. Will the noble Baroness confirm that the word "justified" in the proposed new Section 28B(1)(b) covers a school which elects to concentrate on one disability and provide for it effectively but it could then reject children with other kinds of disability?
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-36_para14"></a>Another problem relates to Asperger's syndrome and other forms of autism and emotional and behavioural difficulties. Having too many children <P>


<a name="column_157"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 157</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with one type of difficulty in a school can be disadvantageous to all those children as well as to the other children in the school. Is an independent school entitled to say, "Sorry, we now have six children with Asperger's, we cannot take your child?"
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-36_para15"></a>Finally, there is the question of costs for independent schools. Can independent schools make charges for extra services? The school with which I am familiar has a good service for dyslexic children. It has about a dozen dyslexic children and, of course, an extra specialist dyslexic teacher is required. The parents of those children pay extra for that teaching. If they did not do so, the burden would fall upon all the other parents. Most independent schools today are non-profit making schools and someone has to bear the cost. Unless the clause is amended, or the word "justified" is very clearly defined, this clause might mean that independent schools had to accept every single pupil disability of any kind.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-36_para16"></a>I move to Amendment No. 92A and the subject of maintained schools. The same problem was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, in the context of Amendment No. 91. I see two sets of circumstances which might cause problems in the interpretation of the word "justified". First, it simply is not realistic to suppose that no additional costs will be involved and no additional staff needed to enable children with many types of disability to participate fully in a mainstream school. Each type of disability will generate its own costs and staff needs.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-36_para17"></a>Surely common sense and indeed a responsibility to use public resources effectively dictate that where a local authority has several schools of a particular kind--secondary, primary or whatever--each school should specialise in a particular kind of disability. Perhaps school A would specialise in mobility and school B in hearing difficulties. How do we know whether the courts would find that a local authority's policy on this matter falls within the category of being justified?
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-36_para18"></a>My second point relates to main schools and the issue of Asperger's and emotional difficulties which I raised in the context of private schools. The question is the same.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-36_para19"></a>Clause 11(1)(b) refers to the treatment in question being justified. Justified by what? Since we shall not see the guidance until after we have passed the Bill, can the Minister give a categorical assurance that the problems I have raised will be covered by the words "the treatment in question is justified"? I beg to move.

<A NAME="10130-37_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I support the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne. It is important that we make clear that there will be specialist schools, whether they are independent selective schools or subject specialist schools, and their right not to select should be preserved in the interests of all children.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-37_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   This grouping includes Amendments Nos. 121A and 131A. I am not sure that <P>


<a name="column_158"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 158</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, spoke to those amendments, although they are in the grouping. Does he wish to do so?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-37_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   I would rather not.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-37_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   Let us deal with Amendments Nos. 91A, 92A and 92B. The Bill will outlaw discrimination on the grounds of disability in the provision of education--every field of education and every provider of education. It will place duties on schools to help to remove the barriers which disabled pupils face in accessing education. Seven per cent of children are educated in the independent sector and we believe it is right that independent schools are fully covered by the new duties on schools. Independent schools are already fully covered by the Sex Discrimination Act and the Race Relations Act. We believe that pupils in independent schools should be protected in the same way as those pupils in maintained schools. I am sure the Committee would agree with that approach, which completely underpins the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-37_para0"></a>Amendment No. 92A would allow a school to refuse to accept an application for admission from a disabled child, on the grounds of his disability, if refusing that application would be in the best interests of the child. I assume that I am right in saying that the intention behind this is to ensure that schools--including independent schools--could refuse to admit a disabled child if they did not, for example, have the facilities to provide for that child and felt that they could not adequately meet the child's needs.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-37_para1"></a>This reopens the very significant debate we have already had in respect of amendments on Clause 1. During that debate, we discussed at some length how the best interests of the child might be represented, in deciding which school the child should attend. It would not be wise to repeat that discussion here, but I stress that with the right support most children could be included in mainstream schools. The test of whether the children should be educated in mainstream schools should be limited to what parents want and to safeguarding the interests of other children. Clause 1 and the SEN framework will provide that.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-37_para2"></a>However, we do not expect all schools to have to admit any child, no matter how profound their needs. Disabled children with more severe needs will have a statement of SEN. Under the SEN framework, LEAs are responsible for arranging suitable school places for children with statements where the child's needs will be adequately provided for. Under the new disability duties a school may be able to justify less favourable treatment or a failure to make reasonable adjustments in certain admission cases. However, once the disability duties have been in operation for a while, more and more schools will be able to cater for children with a range of disabilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-37_para3"></a>The aim of Amendments Nos. 91A and 92B is to ensure that independent schools can continue to select pupils on the basis of ability or aptitude. We expect schools that currently operate genuine selection arrangements to be able to continue to do so. The Bill <P>


<a name="column_159"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 159</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>contains an automatic justification to the less favourable treatment duty for permitted forms of selection. We wish schools to be under the reasonable adjustments duty in relation to their admissions arrangements. However, there is an express factor permitting schools to take into account the need to maintain standards when deciding what the reasonable adjustment duty requires them to do.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-37_para4"></a>While there is no need to maintain a particular standard when selecting pupils, independent schools will be expected to change their selection arrangements. A case in point might be selection on the basis of a written exam. Obviously, a school could not refuse a place to a child using a wheelchair who had passed the written exam on the grounds that the child would not be able to participate in the cricket team. We expect the DRC's code of practice to provide detailed guidance on that.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-37_para5"></a>Schools that are able to select on the basis of ability or aptitude should make such reasonable adjustments to the selection arrangements as may be necessary to ensure that disabled pupils are not substantially disadvantaged. For example, if a school selects on the basis of an entrance examination, it will have to consider taking reasonable steps to ensure that a disabled child with, say, dyslexia, is given more time to complete the exam. After such reasonable adjustment to the process of the entrance exam, the results of the exam will determine which children are offered places at the school.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-37_para6"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, asked specifically whether a school can accept one disability but reject another. Yes, a school could not admit a child if it could not cater for that child's needs. The school would have to provide justification that it could not cater for that need, but if it could provide such justification, it would have the right to refuse a child. Justification will be explained and illustrated in the code of practice. There will also be a consultation process on the code. I trust that that helps the noble Lord and that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-37_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   I am most grateful to the noble Baroness. I shall certainly have to read what she has said because there seems to be a conflict there. On one hand, if a child wants to go to a school, the school has to provide the facilities. On the other hand, the child can be rejected if the school does not have the facilities. I will try to understand that. If the noble Baroness would like to take deal with Amendment No. 121A as well, as she has her notes there, I can speak to it quite simply. Indeed, it speaks for itself.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-37_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   Amendment No. 121A would limit in various ways the duty on independent schools to plan to increase the accessibility of their schools. The limitation of the duty would apply only to the principal parts of the school. We are clear that a duty on schools to plan to increase accessibility should cover all school buildings and premises. A child in a school wants to make use of all the facilities available, not just the main parts. It may be that a school decides <P>


<a name="column_160"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 160</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to start planning for increased accessibility by focusing on the principal parts of the school buildings, but once the principal parts are accessible they will then want to focus on the other parts of the school. Planning for disability access and implementation of plans have to be a progressive continuing process and should not be limited.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-37_para7"></a>Secondly, the amendment seeks to limit the planning duties so that schools do not have to make any alterations which may change or damage features of historical or architectural significance. I can assure the noble Lords that the planning duty will not override regulations covering listed buildings. We would not expect schools, for example, to widen the doorways and install lifts in a Grade I listed building. That would clearly be ridiculous. But there are other things that can be done.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-37_para8"></a>I realise that some independent schools are housed in buildings of historical importance. They, too, will have to comply with a duty to plan for increasing the accessibility of their schools for children with disabilities. These schools will have to consider what they can do within the statutory framework governing historic buildings. This might include installing hearing loops or specialist IT equipment
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-37_para9"></a>Thirdly, the amendment delays the implementation of any physical changes until 20 years after the plan has been prepared. It would be quite unacceptable to allow any school 20 years before they would be expected to start implementing their plans. We want to make progress in removing barriers to learning now and not in 20 years' time. I am sorry to be impatient, but I think that it is right to be impatient about these things.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-37_para10"></a>Let me stress, as soon as the planning duty is implemented, we expect independent schools to start planning for increased disability access and for implementing their plans. In considering implementation, independent schools will, of course, have to consider available resources, but they will also consider whether adaptations could be linked to other planned building works or refurbishments. That is understandable and would make adjustments and adaptations less costly.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-37_para11"></a>Finally, the amendment seeks to require that plans will be based on recommendations by independent schools inspectorate. Certainly my officials will be consulting with the sector about what guidance will be required for independent schools in taking forward the planning duty. The proposal that plans should be based on recommendations from independent schools inspectorate will simply delay.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-37_para12"></a>It is interesting to note that only about half of all independent schools belong to an association affiliated to the Independent Schools Council which inspects member schools. It would not therefore be appropriate to expect all independent schools to base their plans on recommendations by the independent schools inspectorate.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-37_para13"></a>Amendment No. 131A would require the Secretary of State to provide grants to independent schools to meet the cost of the planning duty. Independent <P>


<a name="column_161"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 161</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>schools will be expected to meet the costs of increasing the accessibility of their schools. We recognise the important role of these schools but they are independent, often commercial institutions and in most cases we do not think it appropriate to provide direct grants to them. But if, very exceptionally, a case arose where some assistance was justified and funds were available at the time, then it would be open to the Secretary of State to make a specific regulation to pay a grant in that particular case, under the existing powers in Section 485 of the 1996 Act--just as we have done in the recent past for capital grants to one or two individual independent schools in the music and ballet scheme--so there would be no need for a new power on the face of this Bill for that purpose.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-37_para14"></a>In summary, I reiterate that independent schools must be covered by these new provisions, like other schools. Disabled children should not be discriminated against whatever kind of school they are in.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-37_para15"></a>I hope that my assurances and the explanations of the duties that will apply to independent schools are able to persuade the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="10130-37_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   I did not have much faith in the period of 20 years. However, I wish to raise the first issue proposed in Amendment No. 121A.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-37_para16"></a>I have spent 40 years on the governing body of the independent school that I attended as a child, so I am deeply familiar with it. The school has 11 staircases on four different levels, two teaching rooms up one tower and another teaching room up another tower, and there are differences in levels within each floor. It will be very difficult to provide wheelchair access to all those areas, so presumably the areas that do not have wheelchair access will have to be discarded or used for some other purpose. Are we really at that stage? Is it as bad as that?

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-38_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   No, I do not think it is as bad as that. It is a matter of commonsense application of the Bill when it is enacted. It is a matter of planning timetables sensibly so that difficult-to-access rooms are used for provisions that may not be universal across the curriculum and therefore essential for every pupil.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-38_para0"></a>Anyone who has run an educational institution, whether an independent school, a maintained school, an FE college or a university, will be familiar with what the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, has just described. Most of our school buildings were built at a time when there was much less sensitivity to the needs of disabled students and pupils than there is today. It is a matter of common sense, trying to apply a timetable in a sensible way and to make the changes that are required to the most important parts of a school building, leaving those that are much more difficult until later or using them for a slightly different purpose.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-38_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Can I ask the noble Baroness a quick question? Is there a power to require an <P>


<a name="column_162"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 162</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>independent school--whether it is a special or a non-special school--to accept children with special educational needs? Is there a power to compel physical changes to the buildings? If so, it would be helpful to have those requirements set out, so that schools know what their protected areas are and can defend themselves in the not untypical circumstances referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-38_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   There are no physical features duties on any schools, either independent or maintained. It is a matter of making reasonable adjustments as and when it is possible to do so. There is an overall power requiring schools, whether maintained or independent, not to discriminate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-38_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   If I was doing business with the noble Baroness, I would be perfectly happy, but I am not; I shall be doing business with local authority inspectors, or in an extreme case, with the courts. They will not necessarily interpret things in the same reasonable way as the Minister. That troubles me, but I shall read the Minister's comments with interest and bring my concerns back on Report. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-38_para1"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-38_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch </B>   moved Amendment No. 92:

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Clause 10, page 8, line 34, at end insert ("on the grounds of the disability of that person").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-38_para2"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10130-38_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 93, 95, 159, 160 and 217. I hope that the amendments make it absolutely clear that unlawful discrimination should be discrimination on the grounds of disability. This part of the Bill needs to be worded very carefully if it is not to be abused. It is right that a disabled person should be protected against discrimination on the grounds of their disability, but fair discrimination applies to all pupils, and must include people with disabilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-38_para4"></a>Schools are entitled to discriminate between applicants in their admissions criteria. For example, an academically selective school can reject an applicant on the grounds of insufficient academic ability, whether the applicant is disabled or not. A school specialising in music, dance, or sport is entitled to discriminate on those grounds. Clause 11 attempts to define the discrimination that is to be outlawed in the Bill. However, in addition to Clause 11, it would be better for greater clarity simply to insert into Clause 10 that the discrimination, which is to be unlawful, is discrimination on the grounds of disability. That is quite simply what I have done in this amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-38_para5"></a>The noble Baroness gave an example of a person in a wheelchair taking an academic test for entry into a school which was selective on academic grounds. That is a very good example that, if the person is rejected, it should not be on the grounds of disability but on the grounds that they are not up to the mark, or that there has to be some selection process to take a limited number of people from the list.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-38_para6"></a>Clause 10 reads:
<P>


<a name="column_163"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 163</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is unlawful for the body responsible for a school to discriminate against a disabled person";
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-38_para7"></a>
but that is not specific enough. What it should say is that it is unlawful for the body responsible for a school to discriminate against a disabled person on the grounds of the disability of that person.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-38_para8"></a>It is true that Clause 11 seeks to define the meaning of discrimination as applied in this Bill, and it does so in a rather tortuous manner. However, it would give much greater clarity to the Bill, while leaving in Clause 11, if we started by making discrimination on the grounds of the disability of the person unlawful.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-38_para9"></a>My other two sets of amendments do the same in other parts of Clause 10. My third set of Amendments, Nos. 159, 160 and 217, also refer to the further and higher education part of the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-38_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   Amendments Nos. 92, 93, 95, 159, 160 and 217 seek to confine the duty on schools and post-16 institutions not to discriminate against disabled pupils, students and people enrolled on courses on the grounds of disability only.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-38_para10"></a>Those amendments are not necessary. Part II of the Bill outlaws discrimination on the grounds of disability. Clauses 11 and 26 make it entirely clear that discrimination requires either less favourable treatment of a disabled person for a reason relating to his or her disability, or a failure to make reasonable adjustments to ensure that disabled persons are not placed at a substantial disadvantage in comparison with non-disabled persons, where that failure is to the detriment of a disabled person. The Bill could not be any clearer on that point.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-38_para11"></a>The Bill does not prohibit discrimination against a disabled person on the grounds of, say, race or sex, because we already have effective legislation--the Race Relations Act and the Sex Discrimination Act--which outlaw discrimination on such grounds.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-38_para12"></a>All of the amendments tackle the same fundamental issue and I hope I have persuaded the noble Baroness that they are unnecessary in respect of either pupils, students or indeed adults. I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-38_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   Perhaps I can just raise a point on Amendment No. 95. Subsection (4) seems to present problems if it stands as it is. I cannot see how a school is meant to deal with, say, a boy with a severe case of ADHD. He may be extremely disruptive in class; his condition may be getting out of control and causing a great deal of difficulty to other pupils. If, as part of the management of that child and to bring home to him that he should perhaps in some way be subject to the same disciplines as other pupils and to set him objectives to help him come into line with reasonable standards of behaviour, the school wishes to exclude that child, it will no longer be able to do so. There will be no way in which exclusion of children can be used as a measure against a child where the disruption is a direct result of the disability.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-38_para13"></a>Am I right in understanding that that is to be the position? If so, how would the Government wish a school in that situation to proceed?

Under this part of the Bill, yes, the schools will be able to say that a child who is consistently disruptive, out of control or disturbing the education of others can be excluded on the grounds of justification. They will have to provide that justification. But through that justification that will become possible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-38_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   I am not sure whether this is the right time to raise a point about the new sports academies which are being formed. If they are not used to training wheelchair athletes, would they be allowed to discriminate? I hope not. If they were not used to dealing with that type of athlete I wondered whether they might be brought to account. I ask that as a matter of clarification.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-38_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I should like to come back to the question I raised earlier. Yes, I understand that discrimination can be justified, but I did not understand Clause 28A(4) to relate to discrimination. It states, as entirely separate from discrimination, that it is unlawful for a school to exclude a child on the grounds of discrimination. That seemed to be phrased separately in some way from subsection (1). However, that is clearly my misunderstanding, so I shall shut up.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-38_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   I am not sure that I completely followed the question of the noble Lord, Lord Addington, but I believe that the answer is no, as long as it is a maintained school.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-38_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   There is clearly still some confusion about it. I am more than partly satisfied with the Minister's explanation.

<P>

<A NAME = "10130-38_para18"></a>The purpose of amendment No. 94 is to probe the meaning of the words "education" and "associated service". It also attempts to widen the possible meanings to ensure the inclusion of extra-curricular and leisure activities organised by the school for the benefit of pupils attending that school. The existing subsection (3), which the amendment would delete, gives the Secretary of State powers to decide retrospectively what education and associated services are and allows the Secretary of State to alter the definitions--and hence the extent of the clause--by regulation.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-38_para19"></a>I am confused about who the Secretary of State is, especially in the Scottish context. I should have thought that the definition about education should come most naturally from the Education Secretary, the Scottish Minister in charge of education or the Secretary in the National Assembly for Wales. However, I do not have a problem with the possibility of there being three different definitions as a result.

<A NAME = "10130-38_para20"></a>To focus on the merit of the amendment, I believe it would be useful to have on the face of the Bill from day one a clear commitment that discrimination in education is outlawed in all aspects of the life of the school and not just in any narrow definition of, say, the classroom and the dining-hall. Subsection (3) will not help the reader of this future Act to understand to what it applies. Only by acquiring the regulations when they are published can the reader begin to understand the extent of this ban on discrimination. Surely, that is not a useful purpose for any Bill to have.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-38_para21"></a>I anticipate that the Minister will tell me that all this is explained in the explanatory notes. However, these will disappear and will not be available to readers after enactment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-38_para22"></a>Amendment No. 157 is grouped with Amendment No. 94, which is another amendment needed in the Scottish context. There are several attempts in the Scottish legislation to define who is a disabled person and what their characteristics are. Since this legislation will alter somewhat the admissions process for all educational institutions in Scotland and, no doubt, elsewhere, it is essential that it is clear to whom the legislation applies and to whom it does not apply. I believe that the headings of physical, mental, emotional and psychological disability are helpful in establishing who exactly may not be discriminated against.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-38_para23"></a>Amendment No. 162 is also in this group and is designed to probe and clarify the extent of the description of higher and further education. The amendment proposes to place a description of that extent on the face of the Bill rather than leaving the definition to a hotch-potch of secondary legislation to be published as and whenever the relevant Secretary of State feels like it. The amendment gives a broad definition demonstrating that discrimination issues have to be considered in that full context.

<A NAME = "10130-38_para24"></a>Finally, and briefly, Amendment No. 180 probes the meaning of disabled person and further and higher education by providing a broader definition. The amendment will be helpful but only if it is accurate. I can see little advantage if the Bill does not make it clear at whom it is aimed. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="10130-39_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   We need the regulation-making power in Clause 10 because the boundaries of what constitutes education or associated services are not always black or white. Where it is unclear whether a particular service constitutes education or an associated service, the regulation-making power will help clarification. Amendment No. 94 seeks to set out on the face of the Bill certain services which will be included with those covered by the new duty not to discriminate against disabled children in the education and associated services provided by the school. However, I am clear that we need the flexibility here of a regulation-making power.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-39_para0"></a>The Disability Rights Task Force recommended that all activities covering the life of the school should be subject to the new duty. The task force described what it wanted to secure as a set of new anti-discrimination duties which covered the life of the school. We followed that recommendation. This will, of course, include the provision of education and services relating to teaching and extra-curricular or leisure activities for pupils attending the school but it will also include things like break times, school meal provision, after-school clubs provided by parent associations, school trips and childcare provided by the school. It is impractical to list every aspect of school life in the Bill. We must not forget that new initiatives or activities like breakfast clubs, for example, which were not at all widespread five years ago, are always likely to appear. Where there are grey areas, we want the flexibility to be able to describe in regulations what services are and are not caught by the new duties so that schools and LEAs are always clear. The proposed amendment would not help because it would be inflexible and it would not have the same degree of clarity.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-39_para1"></a>I have some sympathy with the intention behind Amendment No. 162, though not with the amendment itself. I understand the wish to provide clarity and certainty about whether particular services provided wholly or mainly for students are covered by the duties in this clause. Indeed, it is precisely in order to provide such clarity about which services to students are covered by these duties that the Secretary of State has given the powers under subsection (12) of this clause to make regulations to set out whether particular services are covered. Incidentally, it is the Secretary of State for Education and Employment because this is not a devolved matter; it is a reserved matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-39_para2"></a>Such regulations are the most flexible and comprehensive way of defining student services, given the obvious complexity and variety of services provided for students and the changing way in which education and training are delivered.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-39_para3"></a>The noble Earl's amendment seeks to remove that regulatory power and to give examples of student services on the face of the Bill. I have no difficulty with the examples given; they are taken from the examples given in the Explanatory Notes. But Explanatory Notes do not disappear once a Bill is enacted; they remain and are available for people to read as and when.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-39_para4"></a>Far from providing more clarity and certainty than regulations, examples of this kind on the face of the Bill would leave it open to interpretation whether particular services, other than the specific examples mentioned, are or are not covered by the duties. With a power to make regulations, the Secretary of State will be able to clarify the extent to which a wide range of services to students--for example, career or welfare services--are student services covered by the duties in this clause, and will be able to react to any future difficulties which occur in interpreting whether a particular service falls within the definition on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-39_para5"></a>Amendments Nos. 157 and 180 deal with the definition of disability. For the purposes of this Bill, the definitions of disability and of a disabled person are those used in Section 1 of the DDA. We intend to keep this definition of disability. Our clear intention, on which we have consulted, is to extend the DDA to cover education, and we believe that has the considerable benefit of clarity.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-39_para6"></a>The DDA defines a disabled person as someone who:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"has a physical or mental impairment which has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on his ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-39_para7"></a>
Schedule 1 of the DDA regulations and statutory guidance expand on and clarify the definition. People who have had a disability, within the definition, are also protected from discrimination even if they have since recovered. Obviously any child or student meeting the definition will be protected by the Bill. Retaining the DDA definition of disability also provides consistency throughout someone's life.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-39_para8"></a>The definition of disability already in the DDA has worked very well. However, the Disability Rights Task Force reviewed the definition and in its report, From Exclusion to Inclusion, made some recommendations about legislative changes to it. Two would involve covering people with cancer or HIV at an earlier stage in their illness. A further one recommended that people who are certified as being blind or partially sighted should be deemed to meet the definition because the task force found that some people with visual impairment were experiencing difficulties at tribunals in proving that they were disabled.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-39_para9"></a>Finally, the task force made some recommendations for reviewing the definition. It proposed that aspects of the definition should be reviewed to ensure that there was appropriate coverage of people with mental health conditions and that there were no difficulties with the restriction to mental illnesses being clinically well-recognised ones. It recommended that the exclusion of particular conditions should continue for the time <P>


<a name="column_168"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 168</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>being but be reviewed by the Disability Rights Commission. And it proposed that the definition be amended to bring in a range of conditions which can have severe but short-term effects; for instance heart attacks and depression, although they are covered if long-term. The task force suggested that the wider implications of the proposal needed to be explored. The Minister for the disabled announced in the other place on 20th November that we would respond to the task force report around the end of February. That response will cover the recommendations that I have just outlined. The DRC has a statutory duty to keep the working of the DDA under review and has decided to adopt all of the task force's recommendations. Like other equality commissions, the DRC can make proposals and give advice to Ministers on proposed changes to the law.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-39_para10"></a>Having heard my reassurances, I hope that the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, is able to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="10130-39_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   May I probe the Minister further on Section 28A(3)? She said that there would be regulations to cover the detail, but I should be interested to know in which services, not regarded as education or associated services, the Government think that discrimination may occur. The Minister spoke earlier about cricket as an example of an activity in which a disabled person clearly might not be able to participate. Rolf Harris addressed the problem a long time ago in "Jake the Peg". Many disabled people, especially those in wheelchairs, would be a great deal better at cricket than I would be--and I was made to play the game. With a little effort, it is surely possible to integrate disabled people into a lot of sports that some prejudiced sports masters might not think appropriate. I would be most concerned if those words in subsection (3) were to be interpreted widely. I would like to know what the Government think about that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-39_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   There is a strong movement on cricket for the blind. They play very successfully with an audible ball.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-39_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   Sport will be covered as a service. I entirely agree with what both noble Lords have said. Many disabled people can participate in a wide range of sports and are probably better at them than I would be, just as they may be better at cricket than the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. One only has to see the extraordinary success achieved by disabled people in the Paralympics in Sydney. I hope the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, is reassured on that point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-39_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   Yes, but I should still be grateful if the noble Baroness could give me some examples of what services the Government think might not to be regarded, for the purposes of subsection (3), as being education or associated services, although I accept that she cannot give me examples now.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-39_spnew5"></A><B> Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   I thank the Minister for clarifying the issues raised in my probing amendments. <P>


<a name="column_169"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 169</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I note that the regulations are yet to be published, so we have to await that definition. I also take the point that my attempt to define what school and college life revolve around was not sufficiently inclusive. The noble Baroness spoke about a wider group of activities, which was highly satisfactory.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-39_para11"></a>I attempted a definition in Amendments Nos. 157 and 180. They refer to a

<A NAME = "10130-39_para12"></a>
Section 1 of the DDA, which is the ruling definition, refers only to a person with physical or mental, rather than emotional or psychological disability. That leaves us unclear about the position of people with behavioural difficulties or pupils such as those who attend the school run by my noble friend Baroness Linklater of Butterstone for educationally fragile children. I am not yet clear whether they are included in the definition.

<A NAME = "10130-40_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: I apologise to the Committee for having misdrafted the amendment, no doubt in many ways, but particularly the words "this section", given that it refers to a different section of the Bill. What I mean is Chapter 1, Part II.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-40_para4"></a>The objective of the amendment is to make it simpler for schools to know who they are dealing with when it comes to a matter of discrimination. Anyone who falls within the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 is likely to have a statement. Schools will know who has a statement, but the definition under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 is feather-edged. It is difficult to know exactly who they are talking about, and the school may not know whether a person falls within that Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-40_para5"></a>It would be simpler from a school's point of view if the child was statemented. It does not exclude other pupils from coming within the Act, but it makes the prima facie understanding by the school of who is disabled and who is not much easier. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-40_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   To include all children with statements within the definition of disabled persons under the 1995 Act would not be consistent with the intentions of the learning disability provisions in the Bill. Although many children with statements are <P>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 170</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>disabled, some are not, and will make sufficient progress with extra help, after a time, not to require a statement.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-40_para6"></a>A person has a disability if he has a mental or physical impairment which has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on his ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities. A special educational need is not necessarily long-term, and it may be remediable with the right help. SEN legislation and disability legislation serve different purposes. The first is about provision to meet special educational needs, and the second is about preventing discrimination on the grounds of disability.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-40_para7"></a>In the past, a person who has had a disability is entitled to protection under the DDA, even if that person is no longer disabled. If this amendment were accepted, a child who had been statemented, even for a brief period, would be protected by the DDA for the rest of his or her life.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-40_para8"></a>Furthermore, schools are already very familiar with the SEN framework in applying the new disability duties. It is more consistent and practical to work alongside that framework rather than to try to shift the boundaries. We want to avoid a school having to spend time deciding which piece of legislation applies to a child's needs before taking action. Similarly, the purposes of the disability provisions in the Bill and the SEN provisions in the Education Act are different. The former seek to ensure that disabled people are not discriminated against throughout their life, as children and as adults, while the latter seek to provide additional help to enable children with learning difficulties to learn and progress while they are at school.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-40_para9"></a>The Disability Rights Commission is charged with producing codes of practice on the new disability duties. We will invite the DRC, in drawing up the codes, to set the new schools duties in the context of the SEN framework, where that is appropriate.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-40_para10"></a>The present definitions of SEN and disability are different but complementary frameworks. They underpin and allow a consistency of approach both to providing support for children with learning difficulties and preventing discrimination on grounds of ability.

<P>

<A NAME = "10130-40_para16"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendments in this group seek to place a duty on schools, colleges and other places of higher education to take steps to find out whether disabled people are applying to join their courses. They seek to tackle the opt-out within the Bill which effectively says that if they do not have that information, they are not discriminating.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-40_para17"></a>The case of schools is much more complicated because they have to deal with parents. Normally parents are a driving force for dealing with disability. Their efforts are usually backed up by voluntary groups and educational psychologists.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-40_para18"></a>I seek to place some of the emphasis in this regard on the education system. My remarks must not be taken out of context. I am not saying that that should be done with current resources. A later amendment in the Bill seeks to get schools to undertake that duty. For schools to say that they simply are not aware of a child's difficulties is not good enough. Huge delays in offering adequate provision can arise as a result of that. We have already discussed the matter of earlier recognition of problems. If we wait for the parent to discover that something is wrong--that is the worst case scenario because many parents react to information given by teachers--the kind of delays I have mentioned will occur. As we have already stated, if somebody has a minor difficulty such as not terribly acute dyslexia, or an eye problem, and it is discovered early enough, most of the problems will disappear. Indeed, the need for statementing may well disappear.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-40_para19"></a>I shall be very surprised if the Minister does not mention colleges and places of higher education in this context. We envisage some form of enrolment procedure where there is a box to be ticked if you have a disability, and possibly a means of describing what that disability is. Colleges would then be unable to say, "We did not know you could not do such and such". Thus the problem we are discussing would be avoided. At the moment the Bill refers to institutions not knowing the relevant facts. But if they do not ask, they will not know. I suggest that we could remove that difficulty by having an application form with a little box to be ticked and a place for disclosure of information.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-40_para20"></a>I hope that the Minister will be able to respond kindly to these amendments. The noble Lord, Lord Ashley, has tabled amendments with a similar purpose. I am not at all fussy about the words here. If the noble Lord's words are thought to deal with the problem in a better way, I should be more than happy if they were accepted. I beg to move.

<P>

<A NAME = "10130-40_para21"></a>In regard to Amendments Nos. 98 and 99 it will be seen that, according to Clause 26 as currently drafted, there can be no discrimination if the authority did not know, and could not reasonably have been expected to know, that a child is disabled. Since we all know that "reasonably" can have a thousand and one interpretations, this part of the clause provides an escape route for local authorities that wish to do the minimum. They merely have to take no steps to ensure awareness by the authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-40_para22"></a>My noble friend's amendments would help to ensure that all authorities put systems in place that will make them aware of any discrimination. It is essential that every authority or school be made responsible for having clear procedures for encouraging disclosure. It is then up to the parents to decide whether or not to tell the school about their child's disability. The authority needs to be proactive, not reactive.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-40_para23"></a>I know that the special educational needs code of practice says schools should produce policies that describe their SEN policy and have admission procedures that will identify children with SEN. But there are three objections. First, it does not cover all children; secondly, it does not cover all schools, because independent schools are excluded; and thirdly, it is not legally binding. I am glad to commend these amendments to the Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-40_para24"></a>I turn now to Amendment No. 111. We have already dealt with the purpose and principles of this amendment, namely that the child should have a right to participate in issues relevant to his or her future. Amendment No.111 relates specifically to the child's wishes for a disability to be kept confidential and that, too, deserves our support. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="10130-41_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I, too, lend my support. Young people applying for further and higher education are at a particularly sensitive time in their life for talking openly about disabilities--or, rather, not talking about them, which is probably more the order of the day. Providing an extra tick box on a form would not cost the institutions much and I expect that they would willingly accept the obligation to allow applicants to be open. The form ought also to include an invitation to the potential student to discuss any disabilities or provision that they may require when they get to university. Our further and higher education colleges are doing an enormous amount to help young people with disabilities to be accepted into their institutions. That serves everybody's interests and I am happy to put it on record, as I have done before. We are dealing with another aspect of that. They need to be proactive in soliciting information from potential students about any disabilities that they have and whether those <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-41_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I have great sympathy with the intentions behind the amendments. First, I shall address all the amendments except Amendment No. 111, spoken to by my noble friend Lord Morris of Manchester in the stead of the noble Lord, Lord Ashley. The other amendments are all concerned with ensuring that schools and post-16 institutions have taken steps or have policies and structures in place to find out whether a student or a pupil has a disability. I have the greatest sympathy with the intent behind the amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-41_para0"></a>The duty on schools and post-16 institutions to make reasonable adjustments is anticipatory. A school or post-16 institution cannot, in general, wait until a disabled pupil or student arrives before making an adjustment. Most schools, colleges and universities should have--indeed, most already do have--procedures in place to ascertain whether or not a pupil or student, or potential pupil or student, has any disabilities or special requirements. For many institutions that will be part of the information requested in their listings procedure. It is good practice, although I do not know how many institutions use the recommendation of the noble Lord, Lord Addington, of the box being ticked by the intending student.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-41_para1"></a>Schools and post-16 institutions will have to anticipate and plan ahead. They will need to review their policies, practices and procedures, including those relating to admissions, as a matter of course to ensure that they do not discriminate against potential disabled pupils or students by placing them at a substantial disadvantage. We will thereby ensure that good practice becomes standard practice throughout our educational institutions.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-41_para2"></a>Clauses 11 and 26 make provision for responsible bodies not to be liable in respect of the duty to make reasonable adjustments where they do not know or could not reasonably be expected to know of a person's disability. An institution certainly would not be able to rely on a defence that it could not know of a student's disability if it had not done what it could be reasonably expected to do in order to find out whether that person had a disability.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-41_para3"></a>Amendment No. 97 includes the words,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"and identified special needs of pupils and prospective pupils".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-41_para4"></a>
We do not intend to extend the disability duties to cover children with special educational needs who are not disabled within the DDA definition. There is a whole framework surrounding the identification and assessment of children with special educational needs. The revised SEN code of practice will be published later this year. There is also a requirement in the <P>


<a name="column_174"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 174</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>maintained sector on LEAs and governing bodies to ensure that a child's needs are made known to all who are likely to teach him or her.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-41_para5"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 111 in the name of my noble friend Lord Ashley and spoken to by my noble friend Lord Morris. This would place a duty on schools to take account of a disabled child's wishes to have his disability treated as confidential in determining whether to make a reasonable adjustment. I understand that the intention behind the amendment is to seek a formal voice for the child and we have already had substantial discussion in the course of the SEN framework of the Bill on the role of the child.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-41_para6"></a>I know that what my noble friend Lord Ashley intends is that the proposed duty would only bite having sensible regard to the child's age and maturity. The problem is: who makes the decision about the child's age and maturity? The school would have to make that decision. What, then, if there is a difference of opinion between the school and the parents or between the parents and the child? It cannot be sensible to add potential layers of conflict to the situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-41_para7"></a>We believe that it is appropriate that the child's view should be taken into account. But in the inevitable hierarchy of rights of where the final responsibility lies, the parents' voice surely must be paramount. Children may rightfully have views about their disability and about keeping it confidential, and of course they should be taken into account by the school. In some cases it will only be after talking to the disabled child that a school will be aware of what adjustments need to be made.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-41_para8"></a>The most effective provision for a disabled child will be the result of a partnership between the school, the parents and the child. However, it is appropriate to place schools under a legal duty to take account of the parents' view in respect of keeping the child's disability confidential. It is an established feature of our school system that the parents act on behalf of their children. This ranges from the choice of school to appeal against non-admission or an exclusion from the school as well as giving consent to certain activities, school trips and so on. It is right that the position of the parents should be the same in this case. Many children may lack the capacity to make the informed decisions that are required.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-41_para9"></a>I hope, therefore, that Members of the Committee will recognise that the Government agree with the intentions of Amendments Nos. 97, 98, 163, 164, 165 and 166. My point is that they are unnecessary because the Bill already covers the intentions behind them. These reassurances and the comments that I have made in respect of Amendment No. 111 should enable noble Lords to withdraw the amendments.

<FONT SIZE=3>a request for confidentiality fits ill with the fact that the same children of the same age will be asked to request confidentiality to receive the morning-after pill.

<P>
<A NAME="10130-41_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   Clauses 3 and 4 are a "cop out". They are weasel words. Why could it not be kept simple by just striking out those two clauses? The meaning of discrimination is the whole purpose of Clause 11 and subsections (3) and (4) seem to negate that whole purpose.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-41_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Rix, is right. If the Government wish to include these sections, that is reasonable, particularly with regard to colleges. I shall have to read more carefully what the noble Lord said as regards schools. I agree that we have obligations. The Bill states that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it did not know and could not reasonably have been expected to know, that he was disabled".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-41_para10"></a>
We should get rid of that and indicate that that provision has gone. The Minister said that the Government are required to have some provision to deal with this. This is a total nonsense; we are chasing our tails when we can give clarity. The only people who stand to benefit from these subsections are lawyers. If we are to be a job creation scheme for lawyers, I suggest that we have another Bill for that purpose. I cannot see that the provision has any function here. We shall have to return to this issue at a later date. However, at this point I beg leave to withdraw this amendment.

<A NAME="10130-41_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Morris of Manchester: </B>   I thank my noble friend for his response to Amendments Nos. 98, 99 and 111. I assure him that my noble friend Lord Ashley and I will look at it very carefully. I know that the Minister will not be surprised to see us returning to these issues on Report. Meanwhile I reserve my noble friend Lord Ashley's position and will not press the amendments at this stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-41_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   Before my noble friend withdraws the amendment, may I also encourage the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Manchester, and his noble friend to pursue Amendment No. 111? I was not really impressed by the Minister's answer. All that is required is that the authority have regard to the confidentiality request. I cannot see why they do not have due regard to the confidentiality request made by a disabled person under whatever circumstances. They can make their own decisions as to what weight to put on it. It seems to me absolutely right that they should have to take notice of it, and due notice according to the particular circumstances involved. We cannot be more specific than that. Clearly the child should have a right to request confidentiality.

<A NAME = "10130-42_para0"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-42_para1"></a>[Amendments Nos. 98 and 99 not moved.]
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-42_para2"></a>Clause 11 agreed to.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-42_para3"></a>Clause 12 [Disabled pupils not to be substantially disadvantaged]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-42_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch </B>   moved Amendment No. 100:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Clause 12, page 10, line 28, leave out ("substantial").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-42_para4"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10130-42_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: Clause 12 requires the responsible body of a school--by which we take it to mean the head teacher and the governing body--to ensure that discrimination of a disabled person does not take place. However, it goes on to specify the two circumstances where it should not take place; first, in the admissions procedure to the school; and, secondly, within the school once the pupil has been admitted. In both those subsections the clause specifies that the disabled persons,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"are not placed at a substantial disadvantage in comparison with persons who are not disabled".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-42_para6"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10130-42_para7"></a>My concern here is with the word "substantial". I understand that once a disabled person is a pupil at the school there can be a measure of disadvantage compared with other pupils--and that is true--even with the best will in the world to keep such disadvantage to a minimum. The disabled pupil might, for example, be physically slower to get around the school; might find certain facilities that we all take for granted usable but not totally convenient; and so forth. It is fair enough, therefore, for the clause to make unlawful substantial disadvantage for the pupil once in the school. Such a qualification concedes that there may always be some disadvantage, even if such disadvantage is kept to a minimum. Where I find the qualification "substantial" unacceptable is in the first subsection; that relating to the arrangements for admission to the school.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-42_para8"></a>The school will invite applications and will publish its admissions criteria. If it is an academically selective school it will apply some form of selection test; if it seeks other abilities or skills, such as music or drama or sport, it will set its admissions criteria accordingly. If the school is over-subscribed, it will have to apply some kind of pre-published selection process such as siblings of the pupils at the school and then, probably, how far from the school a child lives.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-42_para9"></a>In none of that should the disabled applicant to the school be treated any differently from the rest of the applicants. Thus it is that I say there should be no disadvantage to the disabled person in comparison with other persons when applying for a place at the school. Hence my amendment drops the word "substantial" from subsection (1)(a)--the one concerning admissions to the school. Thus it leaves the wording that there should be no disadvantage.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-42_para10"></a>If the Government argue that the word "substantial" should remain and my removal of it is not acceptable, then another form of words I should like to propose at the next stage of the Bill is "reasonably avoidable". A view needs to be taken which can be tested as to whether the reason for discriminating against a pupil could be avoidable in <P>


<a name="column_177"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 177</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reasonable circumstances. I wait to hear what the Minister says in response to my amendment. I can also say that Amendment No. 167, to which I also speak, applies to Clause 27, but it is the same argument. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-42_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I support my noble friend's amendment most strongly. It is absolutely right that there should in principle be no discrimination in the provision arrangements. There is little excuse for it. Certainly my noble friend's back-up wording would seem to cover any possible faults. It would give me particular pleasure to see the word "substantial" taken out because of the amount of time I spent last year trying to get the Government to put it into the Freedom of Information Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-42_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   Looking at the semantics of this amendment, if the Government insist on leaving in a word such as "substantial", I wrote down two words that might do almost as well: one is "unjustifiable"; the other is "avoidable", which might suit matters better. The requirement would then be that disabled persons should not be placed at an avoidable or unjustifiable disadvantage. I wonder whether those two words might be more suitable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-42_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I do not know whether the noble Lord is addressing that question to me, but I would welcome a debate about the important issue of negotiating an appropriate word. The point I want to make most strongly is that "substantial" is the wrong word here.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-42_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   The Bill places a duty on schools and post-16 institutions to make reasonable adjustments if a disabled pupil or student is placed at a substantial disadvantage.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-42_para11"></a>The amendment would remove "substantial" from the trigger for reasonable adjustments to admission arrangements. It would place schools and post-16 institutions under a duty to make reasonable adjustments to admission arrangements whenever a disabled pupil or student faced a disadvantage, however trivial. We are not legislating to overcome mere slight disadvantage; we are legislating to ensure that schools, colleges and universities help disabled pupils and students where there are real barriers to accessing education. "Substantial" is a well understood term and the Disability Rights Task Force recommended that it should be the trigger for the reasonable adjustment duty on schools and post-16 institutions.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-42_para12"></a>The amendment would create one trigger for reasonable adjustments to admission arrangements and a different trigger for reasonable adjustments to the educational and other activities while a disabled pupil or student was attending school or a post-16 institution. The amendment would not cover adult education at all.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-42_para13"></a>The amendment would create a great deal of confusion for schools, colleges and universities operating under the reasonable adjustment duty. It <P>


<a name="column_178"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 178</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would also set up a hierarchical system within the reasonable adjustment duty. I am sure that noble Lords understand that we want to keep a consistent test across the board.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-42_para14"></a>It may be helpful if I set the substantial disadvantage trigger in context. The starting point for the Bill was the precedent set by the DDA. We have taken the best of the DDA and applied it to the provision of education. We decided to adopt the substantial disadvantage trigger for the reasonable adjustment duty placed on employers under Part II of the DDA because it was a relatively low trigger for adjustments to be made. That leads to a strong reasonable adjustment duty on schools and post-16 institutions. It will also require schools and post-16 institutions to act in an inclusive way, since they will need to compare the experience of disabled children and students with that of their non-disabled peers in deciding what steps they need to take.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-42_para15"></a>In contrast, the duty to make reasonable adjustments in Part III of the DDA is triggered only if disabled people would find it "impossible or unreasonably difficult" to access the service. There is no comparison with others accessing the service. The disability lobby prefers the "substantial disadvantage" test to the "impossible or unreasonably difficult" test in Part III of the DDA for providers of goods and services.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-42_para16"></a>Under Part II of the DDA, a substantial disadvantage is one that is more than minor or trivial. "Substantial" is not defined in the DDA, but in the code of practice issued under it. The term "substantial" is also used in other parts of the DDA, for example in relation to the definition of disability, and in each case it means more than minor or trivial. We expect the DRC to reflect that and to provide further guidance in the codes of practice that they will produce in respect of these new duties. Research monitoring Part II of the DDA has found that disabled people, employers and tribunals have no difficulties with this test. It appears to be working well and is widely understood.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-42_para17"></a>Removing the word "substantial" in the trigger would require schools and further and higher education institutions to make reasonable adjustments however slight the disadvantage. Even if a disabled person was facing only trivial disadvantage, a school or institution would have to do something about it.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-42_para18"></a>People face many sorts of disadvantages every day. Fortunately, most of them are insignificant and they arise from the sort of problems that any of us face as we go through life. They are minor disadvantages that are part and parcel of everyday life for us all and we put up with them. We are not legislating to overcome mere inconveniences. We are legislating to make sure that schools, colleges and universities help disabled pupils and students where there are real barriers to their taking part in education; real difficulties beyond what any of us might be expected to put up with. Otherwise there would be no end to the potential for dispute and challenge. Schools and colleges could find themselves <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>dissipating their resources to deal with a myriad of minor difficulties instead of focusing on the real problems that we believe they ought to be addressing.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-42_para19"></a>We believe we have the balance right and that the Bill will ensure that help is available for disabled pupils and students where and when there really is a need for it. I hope therefore that, having heard what I said, the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-42_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I find it difficult to imagine what kind of discrimination would be trivial or reasonable in the case of admission arrangements. We are talking about a tiny function. Can the Minister give me some examples of what might be a trivial piece of discrimination which should be disregarded but is nonetheless reasonable as part of admission arrangements?
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-42_para20"></a>Schools have some strange admission arrangements. I know of one private school which requires pupils to stand on one leg for admission--it knocks the dyslexics out of the running; they find it hard to do. I would not find that reasonable. I believe that to be discrimination. When it comes to admission, I cannot think of anything, however small, that should be in admission arrangements that would disadvantage disabled people. I cannot see that there is anything in that tiny area which it is difficult for a school to adjust so that disabled people are not discriminated against. I would love some practical examples of the sorts of thing that schools should be allowed to do which, if we took "substantial" out, they would not be allowed to do.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-43_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   I propose that setting an examination on a particular day of the week to admit a child into a selective school could be defined as a trivial discrimination against a child who happens on that particular day of the week to attend some kind of programme that might be in some other way supporting his or her education and therefore helping the child who has some kind of minor disability. I am thinking off the top of my head but that is the sort of thing whereby we could, if we were to take this phrase out, find people who in a vexatious way decide to make trouble.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-43_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I am not sure what to make of that particular example. It seems to me that, if in every other respect the disabled person or the person with disability had all that it took for entry into a school, I suspect it would be reasonable, under the Bill, to find some way of accommodating them in a way that would allow them to take up a proper place at the school, the day of the week being a proper adjustment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-43_para0"></a>I am sorry that the Minister in her response, which I suspect is a seriously prepared one, did not respond to the kind of negotiating stance that we are all in to find words that are appropriate. As my noble friend said, we are talking about a narrow area of function in the Bill and "substantial" seemed to leap off the page as being the wrong word.

<A NAME = "10130-43_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: I rise to move Amendment No. 101 in the name of my noble friend Lord Ashley of Stoke which, it will come as no surprise to the Committee, has my full support.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-43_para4"></a>As currently drafted, the Bill specifically states that schools do not have to remove or alter physical features, nor to provide auxiliary aids or services. This amendment deletes that specific statement. It does not mean there would be enforceable rights to auxiliary aids, services and changes of physical features. What it does mean is that these matters would be included in the "reasonable adjustments" duty on schools.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-43_para5"></a>Appropriate auxiliary aids and services would be essential for some children for without them the education of the disabled child could come to a full stop. There is no point in changing physical features, however, if a child cannot follow what goes on. Nor is there any point in providing excellent communication facilities if a child cannot get to the rooms where they are provided. In all such cases, education is denied.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-43_para6"></a>This amendment will, in particular, enhance protection for disabled pupils without statements because they have no legally enforceable rights of redress against the school's failure to provide such extra help.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-43_para7"></a>It may be argued that the SEN system already makes provision in this important area for disabled children. It does not. Only 2 per cent of children with SEN get statements and, even when they do, evidence from the RNIB shows that large numbers do not receive adequate support. One in three children with significant problems do not get school test and examination papers in their preferred format. In other words, they are put at a disadvantage and the handicapping effects of their disabilities are increased, not diminished.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-43_para8"></a>It is accepted that schools cannot be expected to provide all that is required, as some of the child's needs can be the responsibility of the NHS or the local social services department. However, the code of practice could highlight who should provide what and where responsibilities and duties lie.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-43_para9"></a>The object of this amendment is to try to ensure that disabled children of the future do not suffer, as they do now, from huge inequalities and inconsistencies in provision across the country. I beg to move.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-43_para10"></a>In the previous clauses, the obligation has been placed upon local education authorities, and upon schools, to provide facilities and alterations in order to give access to, and to accommodate generally, pupils who have disabilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-43_para11"></a>The schools and the authorities have to prepare annual plans as to how they are going to do so, and they have to implement those plans. As I have already said in a previous debate, I fail to see how they can possibly do that without knowing that they have the funds to do it.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-43_para12"></a>However, Clause 15 seems to be suggesting that there is no obligation upon the local authority to adapt the school premises, or to provide auxiliary aids or services for the benefit of children with disabilities. Subsection (3) on page 15 says that these provisions do not require the authority to remove or alter a physical feature, or to provide auxiliary aids or services. Indeed, the noble Baroness said that herself this afternoon on an earlier amendment. My amendment adds a third provision, which I know will be a sensitive one; namely, that it does not require such provision by the authority if to do so would incur unreasonable expenditure.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-43_para13"></a>If, as it seems, Clause 15 modifies the absolute demands upon local authorities and schools imposed by the previous clauses to become demands that have to be reasonable and practicable, that may be a sensible approach. I hope that the Minister can explain this apparent contradiction between Clause 15 and the earlier clauses. I am attempting to square the circle here, by emphasising yet again that, unless additional staff and services are added to mainstream schools, and possibly some physical adaptation as well, there is no way that children with disabilities--and for that matter, children with special educational needs--can be properly accommodated in mainstream schools to fulfil all the aims and objectives of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-43_para14"></a>I am afraid this takes us back to many of our earlier debates. I speak in support of the noble Lord, Lord Morris.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-43_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   When considering this legislation, I hope there is an over-arching principle which is that there should be choice between special facilities and integration. If there were to be no compulsion available to procure physical alterations or to provide auxiliary aids and services, then there may be a denial of choice. Exclusion from some schools would ensue, by reason of disability. If schools are to be allowed to fail to provide facilities such as IT, information in alternative formats, specialist teaching, a differentiated curriculum, mobility and independence training, access to specialist support services, then inclusion will often remain a mere pipe dream.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-43_para15"></a>There will be a need for changes to physical features such as loop systems, signage or wheelchair access. Without these changes it is likely that the school will fail to provide for children with disabilities and, to cap <P>


<a name="column_182"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 182</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>it all, there will be little redress against such a failure to provide. This lack of enforceable rights will reinforce inequality of provision and undermine the Bill's intent.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-43_para16"></a>The Bill presumably relies on the availability of another, adapted school. This may work in our five Scottish cities but not in rural and remote Scotland nor in the four island groups. In these areas there is often only one school. The proffered solution will be to live away from home, as usual. The explanatory notes state that the record of needs,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"already provides for the identification and provision of educational aids and adaptations for pupils in school".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-43_para17"></a>
The consortium, Children in Scotland, has pointed out to me that this is insufficient justification to allow for the exclusion of physical adaptations, for two reasons. First, records of need only provide for identification and provision of aids but not adaptations. Secondly, the current assessment and recording system in Scotland does not always work well and is soon to be consulted upon by the Scottish Executive. There is a form of postcode prescribing across Scotland which results in considerable diversity in criteria for recording.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-43_para18"></a>It seems that ENQUIRE, the national advice service for special educational needs in Scotland, in its first year, found that 30 per cent of all enquiries were concerned with records of needs and, of that 30 per cent, a third concerned the level of service provided for a child or young person.

<A NAME="10130-43_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   When I was a member of the Arts Council and Chairman of the Drama Panel--less than 10 years ago--the Arts Council moved from 105 Piccadilly to 22 Great Peter Street. At the time we moved, the architects were aware that I was chairing the Arts Council Monitoring Committee on Arts and Disability. We pressed them most strongly to put into the building the necessary adjustments for members of my committee, all of whom were disabled in one way or another. Unfortunately, the architects failed to take note of our request and we moved in across the road--just off Millbank. Eventually, it cost the Arts Council a further £130,000 to put in the very facilities that should have been provided to begin with. This very probably applies to many schools and other places of education. If all adjustments are not made at the time of such alterations, the costs will be prohibitive.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-43_para20"></a>The argument is constantly being used about theatres: that it is impossible to provide access for disabled people in one form or another because the buildings are either historic or listed. Gradually, however, people are beginning to realise that quite simple adjustments can make life possible for people with disabilities of all kinds. Architects are aware of this. This clause, referring to the removal or alteration of a physical feature is probably a big stumbling block. It could refer to virtually anything--a pillar that did not hold up a roof or some steps that were there--because one was not prepared to alter them. When designed, the Barbican had stairs down to the bar off the concert hall. In the end, they had to put in a ramp, <P>

<A NAME = "10130-43_para21"></a>Just to say that to have to "remove or alter a physical feature" does not require a responsible body to make admission possible seems a very weak excuse, particularly in view of the "reasonable requirements" stipulated by the DDA and the Disability Rights Commission.

<A NAME="10130-44_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Wilkins: </B>   I, too, wish to give strongest support to the amendment in the name of my noble friend Lord Ashley of Stoke, which would rectify what I perceive as one of the main weaknesses of the Bill. If we do not ensure that disabled pupils have enforceable rights to auxiliary aids and services and that the necessary alterations to the physical features of a school are made, discrimination against disabled children in education will continue largely unaffected. Schools and LEAs will continue to use those requirements as an excuse to hide their prejudice against disabled children and the main purpose of the Bill--to strengthen inclusion and put an end to discrimination in education--will be undermined.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-44_para0"></a>How can disabled pupils and disabled prospective students not be placed at a substantial disadvantage compared with non-disabled children if the exemption clause is not removed? At the very least, a time scale should be placed on its removal. Disabled children will continue to suffer rejection, frustration and clear discrimination as they make the transitions through their school lives.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-44_para1"></a>The Explanatory Notes to the Bill make it clear that the exemption for auxiliary aids and services and changes to physical features relies on the fact that the 1996 Act makes provision for those through the statementing procedure. However, the statementing process can be stressful, time-consuming and wasteful of resources. In their 1997 Green Paper, the Government referred to the excessive prominence of statements of need in providing children with appropriate support and to their unwanted side effects. The exemption clause places undue pressure on families to use the statementing process to gain the necessary support for their child. Research by RNIB Scotland, which has already been referred to, shows that almost a third of pupils in Scotland with significant vision impairment are going through the education system with no statement. Some 8 per cent of pupils had to wait two years for their statement and one in 10 parents knew nothing about a statement of need.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-44_para2"></a>Most importantly, the amendment would address the needs of the thousands of disabled pupils who are unable to obtain statements. They currently have no legally enforceable right of redress against a school's failure to provide the help they need. Unless the clause is removed, those now of school age will see scant change as a result of the Bill.

<A NAME = "10130-44_para3"></a>The Disability Rights Commission has argued that by 2004, the education service should be required to comply with the same duties to improve disability access to buildings and premises as will apply to other service providers under the DDA. If schools are under a duty to make adjustments to premises for disabled staff and to consider changing physical features for members of the public attending a function in a school, why should disabled pupils continue to suffer discrimination as a result of this exemption clause?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-44_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Darcy de Knayth: </B>   I also warmly support the amendment. However, I take a slightly different view of statements from my noble friend, as I shall call her, Baroness Wilkins, who has made a powerful speech. I believe that they are necessary at the moment and they need to be good statements. I understand that the Disability Rights Task Force recommended that the exemption was unnecessary because of the protection afforded by the statement. Yesterday we had much talk about bland, meaningless and woolly statements. It is welcome that the provision will be specified and not set out but, as the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, highlighted, we understand that at times it will be quantified as necessary. There is therefore a question mark about the strength of the term, "where necessary" as well. So the protection of the statement is not that huge at the moment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-44_para4"></a>I should like to cite IPSEA again and declare in the same breath that I am a member of that organisation. It stated,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"After nearly 20 years of advising parents and carers of children with special educational needs, IPSEA has concluded that there is a need for an enforcement agency to ensure that LEAs fulfil their legal duties towards children with special educational needs rather than leave it to individual parents and carers to fight for themselves, which means time, energy and money which are all in short supply for the disabled family, or relying on charities like IPSEA to get the appropriate provision which is their legal right".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-44_para5"></a>
The extension of the DDA to cover education is hugely welcome but it will not help in this case. As everyone has said, it excludes the denial of aids and services as a ground for discrimination and deprives parents of the potential support of the Disability Rights Commission, which would be that enforcement agency, in their struggle to secure the provision to which their children are entitled under the law. Therefore, I strongly support this amendment which would strengthen their rights and give them that support.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-44_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I add one trivial point. I am puzzled by the use of the word "that" at the beginning of subsection (2): I have never seen it used in that way before. The words I would expect to be there are, "subsection (1)". "That" seems very inexact and indefinite and, while I believe it means subsection (1), it does not say "subsection (1)". Can the noble Baroness produce any example where "that" has been used like that before?

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 185</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>complaining about statements of need; that was not my intention. My intention was to show that it is often time-consuming and frustrating to obtain a good statement and that those statements should not need to be relied on to obtain the correct resources for a disabled child.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-44_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   Amendment No. 101 seeks to remove from Clause 12 the exception to the reasonable adjustments duty for adjustments to physical features and the provision of auxiliary aids and services. The Government want to remove barriers that disabled people face in accessing education and we believe that the Bill offers an effective means of achieving this without placing an additional duty on schools to provide auxiliary aids and services and make adjustments to physical features. Aids and services are often already provided through the SEN framework and we believe it is more effective to take a strategic approach to improving physical accessibility to premises and the curriculum. That was the position recommended by the Disability Rights Task Force and we have accepted its recommendation.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-44_para6"></a>We expect children, whose special educational needs require them to have aids and services, to receive them under the SEN regime. Children with statements of SEN have an enforceable right to the provision specified in their statement, which may include auxiliary aids.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-44_para7"></a>The issue of auxiliary aids should also be seen within the wider context of the duty on LEAs and schools, under Clauses 13 and 14 of the Bill, to plan systematically to increase physical accessibility to schools by disabled children. In meeting that duty, they will be required to plan and act strategically in order to make both school premises and the curriculum more physically accessible to disabled children. This is not just about lifts and ramps; schools and LEAs will also need to consider providing aids such as specialist furniture, induction loops and improved colour schemes and signs.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-44_para8"></a>Perhaps this is the point at which I should explain what happens in Scotland.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-44_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   When the Division was called I was about to explain that, while in England and Wales, changes to physical features are done strategically through the planning duty, there is of course no such duty in Scotland. Auxiliary aids for specific pupils are done through the SEN framework, or what I think is called the record of needs in Scotland. I thought I should make that clear.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-44_para9"></a>The DRTF felt that requiring every one of the 25,000 schools to make reasonable physical adjustments was not the most effective method for <P>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 186</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>increasing access for disabled pupils. It favoured more strategic arrangements, with LEAs working in partnership with schools to increase accessibility in their area. It considered that a duty on LEAs and schools to plan to increase access would produce the greatest benefit for all disabled children in an area. We have accepted that recommendation.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-44_para10"></a>Noble Lords are aware that we are significantly increasing funding for this purpose through the schools access initiative. As I have already told the Committee, over the next three years we will invest £220 million in making school premises more accessible.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-44_para11"></a>Clause 15 places a residual duty on LEAs. Amendment No. 135A would place a duty on LEAs to make physical adjustments and provide auxiliary aids and services where they would constitute reasonable adjustments, provided the LEA would not incur unreasonable expenditure in doing so. I understand that Clause 15 does not affect the planning duty. The LEA will have to plan to make physical alterations as part of that duty. That would overlap with the SEN framework that provides for auxiliary aids and services for children with special educational needs. As I have explained, we accepted the DRTF recommendations. The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, asked about that in subsection (1). That does mean subsection (1) and we cannot provide any example.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-44_para12"></a>I hope that my noble friend, Lord Morris of Manchester, feels able to withdraw his amendment and that the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, will not press her amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="10130-45_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Before the noble Lord, Lord Morris, comes back, could I ask the noble Baroness a question? There is a great deal of confusion, as I suggested when I spoke to Amendment No. 135A. On the one hand, Clause 12 says that LEAs and responsible bodies are not required to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"remove or alter physical features (for example, one arising from the design or construction of the school premises)",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-45_para0"></a>
or to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"provide auxiliary aids and services".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-45_para1"></a>
On the other hand, they are required to plan for such things. What are schools and colleges to make of the fact that they are not required to do it, but they are required to plan to do it? Can they plan not to make alterations and provide auxiliary aids? That is an extraordinary juxtaposition of two requirements.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-45_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   The key here is strategic planning across an LEA or across an area of an LEA where, as the DRTF recommended, it is considered more cost-effective and sensible to work together and plan provision across a range of schools, than to leave every school to make adjustments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-45_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   The noble Baroness has worried me, because I had it in mind that Clauses 13 and 14 were not appropriate for Scotland. Did the noble Baroness say that Clause 12 would not run in Scotland? I think that it will.

When she has an opportunity to consider again the case we have adduced in support of his amendment, I hope that she will feel able to revise her response. As of now, I feel I can go no further than reserve the position of my noble friend Lord Ashley.

<P>

<A NAME = "10130-45_para6"></a>Subsection (3) of that clause allows the Secretary of State to make regulations as to when it is reasonable for a school to have to take steps as may be prescribed by that regulation; steps which it is always reasonable for the school to take; circumstances when it is not reasonable to have to take certain steps; and steps which it would never be reasonable for the school to take.

<A NAME = "10130-45_para7"></a>This is a very bureaucratic process. Already the Bill is heavily bureaucratic. It seems to assume that those involved in the education of children with special needs, or children with a disability, lack common sense. We do not need yet more regulations.

<A NAME="10130-45_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   If we are to have this clause, I really do not see the function of paragraphs (c) and (d) of subsection (3). There is no way that regulations can anticipate every set of circumstances. The Government can set out good practice, and if they want to do it by regulation rather than by code of practice, they can say this is what they would normally expect people to do and these are the circumstances under which they would normally expect them to react. Someone in Whitehall may think that under paragraph (c) they can specify something which it would probably not be reasonable to do. However, a circumstance turns up in a school a year later and several hundred miles away, where, because of the particular circumstances of the school and child, a certain step would have been the perfect one to take, but the regulations say it does not have to be taken. That seems ridiculous.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-45_para9"></a>Why are paragraphs (c) and (d) needed? I share the antipathy of my noble friend Lady Blatch towards this subsection as a whole, but if we are to have it, what are paragraphs (c) and (d) there for? Surely they cannot have any function in support of the child; they can only turn to the bad. I do not see that they are of much use to the school either.

<A NAME = "10130-45_para14"></a>Amendment No. 102 would remove from the Bill the regulation-making powers in Clause 12. It may be helpful if I start by explaining why we decided it was necessary to have such regulation-making powers. Clause 12 allows us to make regulations to prescribe circumstances in which it is or is not reasonable for a school to have to make prescribed adjustments, and to prescribe adjustments that it is always or never reasonable to have to make.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-45_para15"></a>The school system, after all, is a national, regulated system, providing broadly similar experiences to all. The regulation-making powers will allow us to deal with specific problems where it is apparent that it is not appropriate for those matters to be dealt with purely by the general reasonableness test and by guidance in the code of practice. We might, for example, wish to set down categorically that certain adjustments would not be reasonable.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-45_para16"></a>The regulation-making powers provide sufficient flexibility to be able to respond to changing circumstances or to problems which emerge. It is important that we are able to take account of any changes in arrangements in schools.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-45_para17"></a>Amendment No. 103 would require us to make regulations irrespective of circumstances. However, if it turns out that the experience of the operation of the reasonable adjustment duty is such that one or more of the four separate regulation-making powers contained in this clause need to be used, we would not want to be forced to use them. We would only tend to use them where we feel it is of great benefit to do so. It may prove to be the case that the application of the reasonableness test, together with the consideration of the factors set out in the clause and the guidance contained in the Disability Rights Commission's code prove to be quite sufficient. We are arguing for flexibility between the two positions.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-45_para18"></a>One of these amendments is about removing the regulation-making powers; the other is about ensuring that we take them up straight away. There is clearly a balance to be struck here and that is what we think we have achieved in this clause. I hope that, on reflection, the noble Earl and the noble Baroness will accept that the regulation-making powers are needed in Clause 12, and also that the need is for flexibility in the operation of these powers. I hope that they will therefore consider withdrawing their amendments.

I am arguing for flexibility because the provision will be implemented in many different ways. LEAs or schools differ greatly in what they reasonably can or cannot provide. I have not seen a regulation before any House which does not provide a blanket way of doing something. There is no point in having a regulation which states that schools will do what is reasonable in the circumstances. Regulations will be made when the Government at national level wish a particular rule to apply across a category of schools and/ or LEAs. The proposition here is one of rigidity and not flexibility.

<A NAME = "10130-45_para19"></a>I ask the noble Lord a technical question as to the circumstances when it is reasonable for a responsible body to have to take steps, if the reasonable steps include providing auxiliary aids and/or services by a school and/or a local authority. In Clause 12(2) there is an unequivocal statement that responsible bodies are not required to provide auxiliary services; in other words, it is up to them whether they provide them under the test of reasonableness. Do those two statements conflict? Could regulations be taken by the Secretary of State which, under subsection (a), would say that it is reasonable in the circumstances for LEA X and/or schools Y and Z to make these provisions available? In other words, could they be required to make them available?

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-46_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   The issue that the noble Baroness identifies--the question of requiring auxiliary aids--is on the face of the Bill. The Secretary of State is bound in his actions by what is contained in the legislation. On the question of whether regulations would be required, it is difficult to predict the precise circumstances in which they would but there might be examples. What if a school felt it should alter its policy on class size in an attempt to meet the requirements? Or if it had to reduce the length of the school day? That might be considered not to be an appropriate way of tackling those issues and there would need to be some power within the legislation that gave any Secretary of State the right to make judgments on the course of action that might be proposed in certain circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-46_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I am somewhat confused by that answer and indeed by the first one. A school would surely have the right to shorten the school day anyway? These regulations would only stop a school being compelled to shorten the school day by reason of not discriminating. The noble Lord's comments actually suggest that the department does not have any clue as to the purpose of these regulations. They are not going to use them immediately. They are not going to put them into force but wait to see if they are needed; they are a reserve power, as it were.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-46_para0"></a>Though I would prefer not to have them, I can imagine some practice evolving whereby schools were refusing to provide chest microphones for teachers to help students with hearing difficulties. The Government might then say it is always reasonable to provide microphones under those circumstances and make it a universal practice.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-46_para1"></a>I cannot however imagine any circumstance when it would be reasonable for us to let the Government have the power that they want in paragraphs (c) and (d). The only time they will need those powers is if some practice has grown up, perhaps as a result of court judgments, stating that this Act means that the school has to do this under those circumstances for the child and the Government are going to use these regulations to prevent that. In other words, they will use these regulations against the children because the courts have decreed that this Act requires some provision to be made for them.

<A NAME = "10130-46_para2"></a>That sort of back-tracking should not be allowed in secondary legislation, particularly since the Government do not really know what they want to use it for. They are not likely to table regulations under paragraphs (c) and (d) and the Minister is probably not able to produce any examples of the sort of things he would put in those regulations. If my understanding is correct, it is not appropriate that they should remain in the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-46_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I shall of course withdraw the amendments. As I have said before, I have no other option at this stage in the Bill in the Moses Room. I simply say that this is a control too far. The examples that were given by my noble friend and indeed the responses from the Minister quite terrify me. It does seem that if the Government have in mind to regard the length of a school day and class sizes as reasons for bringing in a regulation which could only do one thing--that is, prevent schools from doing something or giving them a stipulation right across the board, across all categories of school-- and if I take prima facie what the noble Lord said (that the Bill says that a responsible body cannot be required to provide auxiliary aids and services) then this regulation power could not be used to require schools to provide auxiliary services and powers.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-46_para3"></a>The other argument is this. There are mechanisms throughout the Bill to see that schools and LEAs act reasonably. There is a statementing process whereby, if it is decided that a school or an LEA has been unreasonable, they can be required to make that provision.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-46_para4"></a>In relation to the inspection system, it is possible for Ofsted and/or the Government to have a specific look at the way in which LEAs and schools are behaving. I go back to my original point. It will be school by school that they behave reasonably or unreasonably; LEA by LEA that they behave reasonably or unreasonably, and the notion of taking a regulatory power to do something blanket across all local authorities and all schools simply because one or two are acting unreasonably seems to be inappropriate and a control too far.

<A NAME = "10130-46_para10"></a>Educating SEN children in mainstream schools is an evolving process. Already what at one time would have seemed inappropriate and unrealistic is actually happening and working well. However, in the years to come attitudes will change even more and resources will follow. It is for this reason that the list of factors which have to be considered should be in a code of practice and not on the face of the Bill. They should guide, not bind.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-46_para11"></a>My noble friend and I believe that, if the factors have legal status, they will unduly fetter the tribunal in developing a concept of "reasonableness" for the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-46_para12"></a>An example is, if a school wanted to modify a sports programme to include a physically disabled child, the factor laying down the need to maintain sporting standards could tie their hands. Amendment No. 169 refers to further education to the same effect as Amendment No. 104 refers to schools. I am pleased to commend my noble friend's amendments to the Committee. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-46_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   I rise to speak to Amendments Nos. 105 and 169 which are in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Addington, and to support the other amendments in this group.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-46_para13"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Morris of Manchester, has already explained why these amendments were tabled. We have here on the face of the Bill a number of specific qualifications as to what is reasonable and what is not reasonable. Earlier we were talking about Clause 11 and the noble Lord, Lord Rix, suggested that subsection (3) was what he called a "cop-out". It seems to me that, in specifying all these detailed issues on the face of the Bill, we are driving a coach and horses through the whole principle of inclusion that we are trying to write into the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-46_para14"></a>The difference between Amendment No. 105 and Amendment No. 104 is that we have suggested that it is more appropriate for all the specifics to go into the code of practice. Part III of the DDA, on which I believe that the provisions are based, does not contain an exhaustive list of factors that have to be taken into account in determining what is reasonable. There is no place for such a list of factors on the face of the Bill. It is highly prescriptive and will send out the wrong messages to schools and local education authorities. There is no justification for civil rights in education to be treated less robustly than civil rights in other areas, yet it is a common pattern throughout the Bill. Factors such as,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the need to maintain academic, musical, sporting and other standards"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-46_para15"></a>
in paragraph (a) and,

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-46_para16"></a>
in paragraph (g) are wholly out of place here.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-46_para17"></a>Such factors would be more appropriate in a code of practice. We recognise the need for an interpretation of what constitutes "reasonable steps" and that a range of considerations will be taken into account. I also recognise that the cost of a particular step is a <P>


<a name="column_193"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 193</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>consideration when determining what will be provided through Part IV of the 1996 Act. However, when it comes to a consideration of the rights of other pupils, there needs to be a careful balancing--as the Minister has said on other occasions--of the rights and duties of the various adults and children involved. The face of the Bill is not the right place to rehearse such balances, as the Minister has told us on several occasions. This is the territory for guidance under codes of practice.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-46_para18"></a>The Government have recognised that in respect of the guidance on the operation of Section 316. What constitutes "reasonable steps" under Section 316A(6) will be teased out in guidance. The Disability Rights Task Force report, From Exclusion to Inclusion, published in December 1999, also made it clear that a code of practice was needed to address such issues and gave examples.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-46_para19"></a>Amendment No. 105 locates the consideration of what conditions should inform the interpretation of "reasonable" within the code of practice to be drafted by the Disability Rights Commission. Under Section 9(4) of the Disability Rights Commission Act 1999, the DRC code of practice has to be approved by the Secretary of State and it is laid before both Houses.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-46_para20"></a>It is ironic that on many occasions when we have asked for specifics to be written into the Bill, we have been told that it is not appropriate, yet here we are confronted with a list of specifics that, taken at face value, would drive a coach and horses through the provisions of the Bill. We are asked to accept that that is reasonable. I maintain that it is not.

<P>
<A NAME="10130-47_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   I support Amendment No. 105 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, and the noble Lord, Lord Addington. Earlier the Committee talked a good deal about the difficulties caused to children in mainstream schools by having extremely disruptive children in their midst. As I understood the discussion, it was regarded as essential that those most problematic children should go to a special school. I heard only one voice raised in recognition of the argument that children in special schools should not be expected to have their education disrupted and their persons endangered so that children in mainstream schools could work in total peace.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-47_para0"></a>My vision of inclusion is that all children get the appropriate education for them in an appropriate place with appropriate resources, whether that be in mainstream or special schools or in a combination of the two. I enter that caveat, since we are once again discussing the difficulties caused for children in mainstream schools by having to share with children with special needs. Clause 12(4) is an open-ended invitation to stretch the imagination to find some remote possibility of some child at some time being disadvantaged by having to share resources with a child with special needs. Frankly, most children will face far greater difficulties from other sources than they will ever have to face from the removal of disability discrimination in our schools.

<P>
<A NAME="10130-47_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I like Amendment No. 105. Some very good arguments have been made for it. My concern rests with subsection (4)(a) in relation to subsection (1)(b)to which I imagine that it refers. I can imagine no circumstances under which subsection (4)(a) would be needed. How does one prejudice the academic standards of a school by providing for not discriminating against disabled people? One might be able to catch certain factors under paragraph (g) where they were affecting the interests of pupils or other persons who may be admitted to the school as pupils. But if it does not come under paragraph (g), what comes under paragraph (a)? Can the Minister give me some concrete examples of what subsection (a) is supposed to catch?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-47_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   Before the Minister replies, I am afraid that I shall take issue on this. If these provisions are swept away altogether, it may be that the Minister and I are on the same side for once.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-47_para2"></a>The examples given by the noble Lord, Lord Rix, are reasonable. They are eminently challengeable. They can be challenged by the informal process. They could be challenged by the inspectorate. I suspect they could even be more formally challenged through the statementing process. A school must have some defence.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-47_para3"></a>Let us use some more extreme examples. I shall not name any schools because it would be invidious to do so. One tends mostly to talk about severely disruptive behaviour. But I have been given some graphic examples of where the disruption factor is so great that it is unable to cope, physically and in terms of staffing. It is unable to manage. An unsupported family has a young person--he is not culpable in any sense--who will not work in groups. It is impossible to leave him alone and impossible to provide "single only" education for him within the school.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-47_para4"></a>A system for testing whether a school is being reasonable or not reasonable is an important safeguard in the Bill. I hope the Minister will not be tempted to sweep it away.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-47_para5"></a>On the other hand, it is right that there should be a severe test of a school's case when, for whatever reasons, a school says that it is unable to take a particular child. However, there are circumstances when to accept a child with particular disabilities would be inappropriate for the school, and at the end of the day, it might even be inappropriate for the individual child. The appropriate provision may not be in mainstream schools, but in a special unit or specialist school which deals with particularly severe behavioural problems.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-47_para6"></a>We should not put that burden on the schools, particularly at this time. The schools are not funded to cope. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Rix, will say <P>


<a name="column_195"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 195</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that that is not an argument. We have had much debate on money, but at the end of the day, there is a real world. Resources will be finite. If the money and the support for the school are not forthcoming, there needs to be a defence in law for the school to say--it will have to make the reasons public--that it simply would be an inappropriate placement for that child and to allow the system to test the case of the school.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-47_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   Before the Minister replies, I should like to point out that Amendment No. 105 does not sweep them all away. It proposes that the conditions should go into a code of practice. I have been arguing that that is more appropriate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-47_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I apologise to the noble Baroness. I was arguing against the specific amendments which called for the abolition of this part of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-47_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   The amendments relate to the factors in Clauses 12 and 27, which provide guidance for schools and post-16 institutions on what they should have regard to in determining what is or is not reasonable in the context of the duty to make reasonable adjustments. The factors do not affect the less favourable treatment duty.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-47_para7"></a>We decided that it was right to set out on the face of the Bill the factors that schools and post-16 institutions should take account of when considering reasonable adjustments. That provides absolute clarity on the issues that institutions have to bear in mind and reassures providers that important matters are relevant when determining what is reasonable. I agree with what the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, has just said on that. A number of respondents to our consultation said that they were looking for recognition of such factors, not so that providers could evade their responsibilities--of course they should not do that--but to enable them to meet them in a sensible way. Setting out the relevant factors in the Bill also makes it clear to the Disability Rights Commission what needs to be covered in the code of practice.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-47_para8"></a>The list is not exhaustive, but the code of practice is the right place to provide further detail. Our approach is not unprecedented. The reasonable adjustment duty in Part II of the DDA also contains a list of factors to be taken into account when considering whether it is reasonable for an employer to have to take particular steps to comply with his reasonable adjustment duty.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-47_para9"></a>The amendments tackle the factors in different ways. Amendments Nos. 104, 105 and 169 would remove the list of factors. Amendment No. 105 would require schools to have regard to the code of practice when considering the issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-47_para10"></a>The other approach, in Amendment No. 106, is to remove only the factor relating to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the need to maintain academic, musical, sporting and other standards".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-47_para11"></a>
The purpose of that provision is to enable schools to preserve particular standards. The school will have to decide whether there is a need to maintain a particular standard, or whether a standard should be adjusted. In most cases, schools will have to adjust the sports <P>


<a name="column_196"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 196</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>programme to include a physically disabled child, because a certain standard of performance would not be necessary. However, if a school is entering a sporting competition with the aim of winning, the school ought to be free to select a team with the greatest likelihood of winning. The presumption is for inclusion, not exclusion.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-47_para12"></a>Paragraph (a) is not about excluding disabled pupils. Let us not think that having a disability is incompatible with the ability to meet high standards. Our discussion about cricket earlier shows that. The use of objective criteria will make schools think carefully about their activities and about the way in which they choose pupils to take part in those activities.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-47_para13"></a>Amendment No. 171 would add another factor to the list in Clause 27 to ensure that any grants available to the institution to facilitate the education of disabled students should be taken into account. The factors already allow post-16 institutions to have regard to the financial resources available to them and the cost of taking a particular step in deciding what reasonable adjustments to make.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-47_para14"></a>We do not want post-16 institutions or schools to focus on taking particular steps only when specific grants or funding are available. That would be contrary to our overall approach. The duties to make reasonable adjustments are anticipatory. The nature of the anticipatory duty means that institutions should look at all the resources that are available to them and not just the specific grants or funding. We want institutions to take a more holistic approach to improving access.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-47_para15"></a>In conclusion, as on the previous group, I accept that there is a balance to be struck. We think that we have achieved that. I shall take into account the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, and the strong feelings expressed by others in the debate and consider whether we can reflect them on Report. In view of my intention to reconsider this issue, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-47_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   Before the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Manchester, replies, could I ask the noble Baroness for some further clarification on Amendment No. 106? I had not read new Section 28C(4)(a) and (b) as giving any right to disabled pupils to a place in the first football team just because they were disabled. I cannot see how the noble Baroness is reading that in that way, or how, in the absence of subsection (4)(a), disabled persons would have a right to a team place if they were not among the best eleven in the school.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-47_para16"></a>It seems to me a very dangerous thing to put in this sort of overall idea of the maintenance of academic, musical, sporting and other standards because it suggests that a disabled person can threaten those standards. It is reasonable to suppose that there are circumstances where having a disabled person in a school would result in the musical standards being lower. You have a person in a wheelchair, it squeaks and disturbs concerts. What are we talking about here?
<P>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 197</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-47_para17"></a>I cannot see any circumstances where paragraph (a) applies and the matter would not be caught by paragraph (g). Paragraph (g) is a totally reasonable provision, but if you are not affecting the interests of other pupils in any way, what reasonable sort of discrimination are we talking about which should allow a school to say, "You are not affecting the other pupils but we will exclude you because you will affect the musical or sporting standards of the school"?
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-47_para18"></a>I cannot see how the provision is going to operate. This may be a lack of understanding on my part. If the noble Baroness could, in the interim before Report, give me some worked examples of the sort of evils which would occur if paragraph (a) went, I would be extremely grateful.

<P>
<A NAME="10130-48_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   I should like to add to the argument of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, on Amendment No. 105. It is not saying that we want to remove these regulations; we are saying that they should be expressed in the code of practice. The reason is that when these regulations are on the face of the Bill there seems to be a draconian element to them and they seem to provide in tablets of stone the excuses that schools are looking for. Whereas yesterday the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, said, in response to a question of mine:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The straightforward answer is that if we put everything in statute we would not need a code of practice. But we would also lose the flexibility which codes of practice can produce for the way in which legislation is interpreted and implemented".--[Official Report, 29/1/01; col. CWH 87.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-48_para0"></a>
I would have thought that applied to these particular clauses precisely, and I would have thought we would all be delighted if they went into this ever-increasing size of code of practice. On the other hand it would be capable of interpretation perhaps more liberally than on the face of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-48_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   Before the noble Lord, Lord Morris, replies, I endorse the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, and by the noble Lord, Lord Rix. The measure that is particularly objectionable is paragraph (a) of subsection (4) because it leads to selectivity and to exclusion. It would be very unfortunate if that were on the face of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-48_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Morris of Manchester: </B>   While I thank my noble friend Lady Blackstone for her response, as before, I reserve the position of my noble friend Lord Ashley in regard to pressing the amendments further on Report. Meanwhile I know that he will be as appreciative as I am of the support they received in Committee here today. Indeed, I thought my noble friend Lady Blackstone ended her speech on a highly positive note. It may therefore not be necessary for my noble friend and I to work too strenuously to carry the amendment on Report. It seems that we may have the Minister's support at that stage. I trust that is not undue optimism. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-48_para3"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10130-48_para4"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 107, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 108 and 172. We are still on Clause 12 with the theme of what is reasonable for a school to do in order to overcome disadvantage to a disabled pupil and what would be unreasonable or excessive. In making that judgment the governors of the school have a list of considerations given to them in the Bill, which they need to take into account when assessing what steps they can reasonably take to accommodate a disabled pupil.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-48_para5"></a>I am pleased to note that subsection (4)(c) lists the costs of taking any particular step and it is a pity that cost was not similarly emphasised in Part I of this Bill dealing with children with special educational needs. Whether we like it or not, costs matter and, in the real world, finances available to local authorities and their schools are always limited. However, subsection (4)(e) goes on to advise the governors that they can take into account which aids or services would be provided under legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-48_para6"></a>That does require amendment. It is not just aids or services to be provided; it is money. The governors will naturally bear in mind the cost of any improvement proposed to assist a disabled child as well as the finances they have to meet that cost. They would not be good governors if they did not ensure financial probity in these matters. The real concern is the inevitable tension that will result from a Bill that raises everybody's expectations; which puts legal obligations on local authorities and schools who may not have the resources or who may have no choice but to meet such obligations resulting in serious financial problems elsewhere in the system.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-48_para7"></a>Amendments Nos. 108 and 172 are about proportionality. It was, I believe, my noble friend Lord Lucas--or somebody else around the table earlier this afternoon--who addressed this whole issue of proportionality. The amendment to Clause 12 of the Bill relates to provisions requiring disabled children not to be substantially disadvantaged in respect of a school's admissions policy or, where they are in school, in respect of their education there. There are similar provisions relating to disabled students in higher education in Clause 27 of the Bill, to which we are proposing a similar amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-48_para8"></a>In summary, I welcome and support the policy embodied in this part of the Bill, which seeks to protect disabled children from discrimination at school. I also endorse the Government's recognition in this clause that the anti-discrimination requirements need to be tempered by reasonableness, having regard among other things to the interests of the other, non-disabled schoolchildren. The amendment is designed to give specific practical effect to this principle in one important way.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-48_para9"></a>By way of background, Clause 12 is designed to extend the scope of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 by inserting a new provision--the proposed new <P>


<a name="column_199"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 199</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Section 28C of the 1995 Act. The proposed new Section 28C would extend the anti-discrimination rules to the sphere of school education. In particular under the proposed subsection (1), the responsible body for a school--generally the LEA or, for a private school, the governor or proprietor or, as I argued yesterday, the same person--is obliged to take such steps as are reasonable to ensure that disabled children are not placed at a substantial disadvantage compared with non-disabled. However, both in its policy for determining school admissions and, once children are in school, in respect of their education and associated services, the proposed subsection (4) is intended to clarify what is meant by "reasonable" in this context; that is, what is the extent of the duty to take such steps as are reasonable?
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-48_para10"></a>The proposed subsection (4) lists seven factors--(a) to (g)--to which regard shall be given in determining reasonableness. The last one in paragraph (g) of the proposed subsection (4) is that regard must be had to the interests of other pupils and persons who may be admitted to the school as pupils--"other" meaning non-disabled pupils and applicants. We support that principle. It does seem right in determining the rights of disabled children not to be discriminated against, to take account also of the rights of the rest of the children. The right to be educated properly and effectively at school is something that should be enjoyed by all children.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-48_para11"></a>Our aim is to give practical effect to the Government's principle. We propose that the principle in subsection (4)(g) should expressly state the consideration that the interests of non-disabled children,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"will depend in part on the proportion that disabled pupils constitute of the total number of pupils in any one lesson or class or school".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-48_para12"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10130-48_para13"></a>The example has been given of a school that gains a reputation for dealing with children with autism. Over a period, more and more children with that particular problem go there, to the point when the education of all the children--those with autism problems and the rest--is affected. My amendment is about proportionality.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-48_para14"></a>We hope that the Minister will agree with that proposal. We support the compassionate objectives of the Government's provisions. It is right that disabled children should not be discriminated against. However, allowing that to result in a disproportionate concentration of disabled children in any one class or lesson or school would be a form of dogmatic political correctness, which I would not want to support.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-48_para15"></a>I emphasise again that the important point is what is appropriate. If it is appropriate to have a large number of children with similar disabilities and that is accommodated by the school, by the parents and by the LEA, of course that is the right thing to do. However schools that are particularly effective in dealing with children with particular conditions or <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-48_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   The amendments relate to the factors in Clauses 12 and 27, which provide guidance on what schools and post-16 institutions should have regard to in determining what is and is not reasonable in the context of the duty to make reasonable adjustments.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-48_para16"></a>Amendments Nos. 107, 108 and 172 would add factors to the lists. Amendment No. 107 would insert the need to take account of the finance provided for the disabled pupil under the SEN framework. The aids and services needed to cater for a child's SEN needs will be identified and provided through the SEN framework. For those with the most acute needs, they will be set out in the statement of SEN. The resources made available to meet particular SEN are an intrinsic part of the provision of those aids and services. More generally, they will form part of the resources available to a responsible body, so they can be taken into account under subsection (4)(b).
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-48_para17"></a>The intention behind Amendments Nos. 108 and 172 is to make the school or post-16 institution consider the proportion of disabled pupils or students in a class when considering what reasonable adjustments should be made. However, in many cases the proportion of disabled children or students in a class has no relevance to the question of whether any particular reasonable adjustment will affect the interests of other children. For example, if a school has a practice of allowing a disabled child to do an alternative sport to the one that the rest of the class are doing, it will rarely make any difference to the interests of the other children if a few extra children take that alternative sport.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-48_para18"></a>Similarly, if college students who are blind receive material on audio tape, whether one person or five people in the class receive this will not affect the interests of the other students. The interests of other students will not always depend even in part on the proportion of children with disabilities in the class, as the amendment suggests. We do not think that the Bill should suggest that it does. If the interests of the other students are affected in that way, the school or post-16 institution will be able to take that into account when deciding what adjustments to make under the Bill as it is currently drafted.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-48_para19"></a>The amendments are not necessary and they are not very helpful either, so I hope that the noble Baroness will not want to press them.

<A NAME="10130-49_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   The noble Baroness has just argued that the amendment will not be needed if the issue of proportionality has no relevance. In that case, the only requirement is that regard should be had to the issue of proportionality. If it had no relevance, it would be discarded and they would move on to something else. It does not seem to be an argument against my proposal. However, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME = "10130-49_para2"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10130-49_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: I can be brief on this amendment. It seeks to leave out subsection (6) in Clause 12; to explore with the Minister what, frankly--if I may use the colloquialism--this gobbledegook means. Why is it necessary to write into primary legislation that, having received a request for some steps to be taken to improve the provision for a disabled child, the governors must see whether the steps that they propose to take do meet the request being made? I should have thought that was obvious. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-49_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I hope that I can also be brief in response. The amendment would remove the factor that schools must take into account in relation to the reasonable adjustment duty which deals with the wishes of the parents of a disabled child to have the disability treated as confidential.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-49_para4"></a>As I explained earlier, the duty on responsible bodies to make reasonable adjustments is anticipatory--we emphasised that in earlier discussions in Committee this afternoon. Anything that can be done in reasonable anticipation that pupils with particular disabilities may attend the institution therefore has to be done, irrespective of knowledge or confidentiality issues.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-49_para5"></a>However, some disabilities are not obviously apparent and Clause 12 allows schools to take into consideration a request made by a parent of a disabled child that a disability may remain confidential. That might include disabilities that could cause a child to feel embarrassed or vulnerable. The school must take into account whether making a particular adjustment will result in disclosure of the disability contrary to the wishes of the parent. That is the basis of this amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-49_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I have two points to make. First, that is not an answer to the proposition I was making, nor was it an answer to the problem here. Secondly, the noble Lord addressed something quite different; something which this amendment does not seek. In my book, that is otiose.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-49_para6"></a>If the school is either anticipatorily considering or considering when it is about to make a determination whether it is reasonable for the responsible body to have to take a particular step in relation to a child, it would go without saying that the school would have to consider whether it matched up to the request being made. It really is otiose, and I hope that it will disappear from this Bill before it passes from this House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-49_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   Perhaps I could pick up what may be the origin of this problem. Subsection (5), when read with subsection (6), just about makes sense. But subsection (5) does not say that subsection (6) only applies when subsection (5) applies; so subsection (6) <P>


<a name="column_202"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 202</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>applies in every case. That is where the difficulty arises--it is not only applicable to subsection (5); subsection (6) actually applies to the whole clause.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-49_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   Perhaps I may add support to this. In pursuit of plain English, we really should be able to do better than the gobbledegook of subsection (6).

<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "10130-49_para8"></a><P>

<A NAME = "10130-49_para9"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is a subject that was discussed earlier today. It is a simple amendment and I believe it is necessary. In Clause 12, provision is made for a request of confidentiality as to the nature of a person's disability to be observed by the local authority. Such a request for confidentiality is made by the parent of a disabled person and, while it is reasonable for the parent to make such a request on behalf of a young child, it is also proper for the child--certainly if they are of secondary school age--to be able to request that confidentiality themselves.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-49_para10"></a>I beg the Minister not to tell me that young people do not have the capacity to request confidentiality when I sat through the whole of yesterday being convinced that they do indeed have the capacity to request confidentiality if they are taking the morning-after pill. This is simply to guard the young person's coyness, sensitivity or whatever it might be, about their particular disabilities. It seems reasonable that a child--certainly of secondary school age--should be allowed to request confidentiality. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-49_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I note that the noble Baroness introduces an aspect of yesterday's debate which revolved around confidentiality in relation to a medical position, and not directly in relation to the educational one. Surely the noble Baroness would accept the whole basis of our education system as far as responsibilities and rights are concerned; namely, that the parent is at the heart of the system. It is the assumption that parents generally act in the best interests of their children on which the whole of the school system is surely based.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-49_para11"></a>Of course we expect schools to take account of the views of the disabled child. Disabled children may well have views about keeping their disability confidential. Schools should always work in partnership with their pupils and their parents. That is particularly important when a child has special needs or disabilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-49_para12"></a>I hope that we are as one in terms of the broad objectives of the legislation and the relative responsibilities of the parent in relation to the child as far as the Bill is concerned.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-49_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I am probably about as close to being cross in this Bill as I have ever been. The noble <P>


<a name="column_203"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 203</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord said this is about education; it is about the child. It is about the specific disabilities of a child who is highly sensitive. If a parent supports the request for confidentiality, that is fine. We would all agree with that. However, as my noble friend said earlier, it is not every young person who is represented by a parent in these circumstances. Therefore, it should be open, certainly to a child of secondary school age, to request confidentiality.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-49_para13"></a>The noble Lord says, "Ah, but taking the morning after pill is a medical matter". it is about sleeping around and taking a pill after the event. We are talking about young people with disabilities they are sensitive about who do not wish that to be known more widely than it needs to be known within the education sector. I can see no reason at all why the noble Lord should not be sympathetic to both the parent's request and also to the individual teenager's request.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-49_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   Perhaps I can speak up for the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, in this instance. I believe that a great deal of bullying takes place when people have physical impairments of one sort or another. The child should be able to keep that confidential from, not necessarily the authorities perhaps because of the special circumstances of going to school, but certainly from his or her fellow pupils.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-49_para14"></a>It should be their right to ask that this is kept to themselves, and they should be able to say that to their parents as well. I cannot believe that parents would not be confidential in these circumstances, but it could happen. To grant a child a right of confidentiality is fair and just.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-49_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   I offer my support to the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch. It seems to me that it is utterly right on these occasions, if children are old enough to express their own views on this, that they should be taken into account. If I might say so, the logic of the reply the Minister gave us points entirely in that direction.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-49_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Darcy de Knayth: </B>   I too support the amendment. I hope that the Minister will reconsider his reply. We are talking about conditions such as being incontinent and having HIV status, etcetera. Those are sensitive issues. I beg him to think again.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-49_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   In the light of the strength of the representations that have been made in support of this amendment, I will certainly look again at the debate we have had this afternoon.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-49_para20"></a>The noble Lord said: I rise to move the amendment of my noble friend Lord Ashley, which, if accepted, will put due pressure on authorities to recognise that disability ranges far wider than having limbs that do not work. The clause as drafted requires authorities to prepare strategies and plans for improving the physical environment of schools. That is admirable, particularly for children in wheelchairs or with callipers. However, it does nothing for children with any other disabilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-49_para21"></a>To be properly educated, blind children may need braille or in some cases large print. Deaf children may need portable induction loops, videos with subtitles or TVs with teletext. The planning duty should cover provision of these essential aids over time so that children do not need to be statemented before they get them. Speedy decisions matter in education. It has been said that the planning duty will include such an adjustment. But the Bill does not say that and my noble friend Lord Ashley and I do not accept that view. The language needs to be strengthened to ensure that there is no need for argument or disagreement. I wholeheartedly support my noble friend's amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-49_para22"></a>I turn now to Amendment No. 113A, which stands in my name. This amendment to Clause 13 requires stronger LEA planning for the inclusion of children with special educational needs. It was encouraging to see the support expressed at Second Reading for increasing the inclusion of SEN pupils in mainstream schools. It is, however, vitally important that such inclusion should be properly organised and resourced if is to be effective.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-49_para23"></a>The amendment provides a stronger planning requirement on education authorities and schools in order that children with special educational needs are provided with properly supported mainstream education. With many others, I believe that LEAs and schools should have a fixed period of time to prepare to support the full diversity of disabled children and the whole range of impairments.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-49_para24"></a>Sharon Rustemier of the Centre for Studies on Inclusive Education has prepared a number of case studies demonstrating the stress and emotional strain for families in obtaining adequate mainstream support, provision for which we feel should be theirs as a basic human right and which requires stronger legislation to achieve. I shall be making those case studies available to the Minister and I hope that she will look at them with her customary care and understanding.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-49_para25"></a>In Sharon's view, schools need to be ready, in order to cater for diversity, to support any child in their locality and be prepared to set up arrangements as necessary to accommodate individuals, whatever their needs. Cleves School, in London Newham, is a good example of how teams of teachers and learning supporters work together with other professionals and parents to provide every child with access to learning.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-49_para26"></a>Sharon feels, as I do, that such a commitment needs to be enshrined in legislation so that no child is discriminated against. I hope that the Minister will see <P>

<P>
<A NAME="10130-50_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   In speaking to Amendments Nos. 113 and 118, I am supported by the noble Lord, Lord Addington (regrettably he is not in his place). the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp of Guildford, and the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch--a formidable triumvirate indeed. The amendments are a complete mirror image of Amendments Nos. 112 and 117.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-50_para0"></a>It is a matter of continuing sadness to me that the whole access debate so often resolves itself into a debate about whether you can get a wheelchair in. In the early days of the late Millennium Dome--which was quite good on access--it took some time for the Access Advisory Committee to get beyond the planners' initial preoccupation with physical access. Now, in an educational context, despite the Disability Rights Task Force recommendations and the department's consultation document in March last year, we seem yet again to be concentrating on physical access.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-50_para1"></a>I am sure that being able to get a wheelchair into a toilet is very important, but for the disabled child with learning disabilities or difficulties, accessing education depends on the curriculum, the teaching methods and materials, classroom and wider support, the measurement of progress, the way the school and the class are organised and the way that the child is supported.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-50_para2"></a>The inclusion debate in education is coloured by an apparently simplistic assumption that if you change the physical environment you have achieved equal access. That is simply untrue. Every child is capable of learning, but many children in special schools as well as in mainstream schools are not being given the chance to learn, because the educational experience offered to them is irrelevant to their needs. Imagine the effect on our education had we been given a comfortable chair in a comfortable classroom, but the lesson was conducted in a language that we did not understand, accompanied by gestures that meant nothing to us with tasks that we found unintelligible and goals that were incomprehensible.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-50_para3"></a>I cannot believe that the Government have misunderstood the challenge of inclusion as completely as Clause 13 seems to suggest. I hope that the amendments will be accepted, or at least that I will be given substantial reassurance, perhaps in the ever-lengthening code of practice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-50_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   I support what the noble Lord, Lord Rix, has said. Amendments Nos. 112 and 113 duplicate each other, as do Amendments No. 117 and 118. The issue here is access to the curriculum in its widest sense. It is not just a question of physical access. It is vital that we have that on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-50_para4"></a>Amendment No. 113A is of a different category. I have some reservations about it, because it would require us to look to the planning. The accessibility <P>


<a name="column_206"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 206</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>strategy should be that all disabled pupils will be capable of attending a mainstream school. I have made clear my support for the principle of inclusion, but I do not believe that it is realistic to expect to be able to accommodate all disabled pupils in a mainstream school. Some disabled people do not wish to be included. I was asked whether I would put my name to the amendment, but I do not think I can.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-50_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Wilkins: </B>   I give my support to Amendments Nos. 113A and 118. In response to the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, the point is that mainstream schools should be capable of absorbing the full diversity of children and giving them a good education. They do not necessarily all have to go there, but the place should be available for them. Maybe they will come in and out as appropriate.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-50_para5"></a>The aim of the clause is that over a prescribed period, we will achieve full inclusion for all disabled children. In the London Borough of Newham, the principles were set down initially and it has been achieved over time. There are currently also two Channel 4 programmes that speak to this very well called "Count Us In", which I recommend to Members of the Committee. I give my full support to these amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-50_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   I do not want to hold up the proceedings but I should like the noble Lord, Lord Rix, to know formally, on the record, that I support the whole point of having curricular arrangements properly addressed, and that will include Amendments Nos. 113, 117 and 118.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-50_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever: </B>   I support Amendments Nos. 113 and 118. I am concerned that Clause 13 uses too narrow a definition of disability. It needs extending to ensure that curriculum teaching and learning arrangements are included on the face of the Bill. This is a particular problem for children with an autistic spectrum condition; they need access to the curriculum. Currently, a lottery exists as to whether LEAs will plan provision for children with autism.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-50_para6"></a>Due to the breadth and complexity of the autistic spectrum, authorities must plan for a range of educational provision, ranging from autism-specific schools, colleges and units to supported mainstream places. The challenge of autism is exacerbated by the increasing reports of a significant increase in the number of children with autism. Research by Dr Fiona Scott of the Autism Research Centre at Cambridge University has shown that one in eight of the primary school SEN population of Cambridgeshire has a diagnosis of an autistic spectrum condition.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-50_para7"></a>Yet lack of trained staff remains the critical barrier to the effective inclusion of children with autism. Where staff are not adequately trained, a sympathetic placement in the mainstream will remain difficult and parents will continue to seek a specialist autism-specific environment for their child.

<A NAME = "10130-50_para8"></a>Research has shown that 70 per cent of teachers, in the mainstream, taught children with autism but only 5 per cent reported having specific training in their basic teaching qualifications, and only 5 per cent reported attending subsequent autism-specific training days.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-50_para9"></a>The current wording of Clause 13 will undermine the Bill's best intentions if the interpretation of access remains confined to physical limitations alone.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-50_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I entirely support the same two amendments and would only add what wonderful schools they are that concentrate on this aspect of the work, because they are so much better for ordinary kids too. There are so many benefits that come from providing properly and individually for the learning and teaching requirements of disabled children, particularly children who have dyslexic/dispraxic autism spectrum disorders. It breeds an attitude in the school and its teachers; it breeds a range of facilities which are of enormous use to ordinary kids. They are wonderful places to visit and this is something we should be encouraging. Just making doors wider is not really not where it is at.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-50_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   The planning duty is a crucial mechanism for increasing, over time, the physical accessibility of school premises and the curriculum to disabled pupils and disabled prospective pupils. After all, as first steps towards learning, pupils need to be able to get into and around the school and the classroom and be in a classroom which is conducive to their learning. We are aware that, although some good practice exists, LEAs do not plan as strategically as they could.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-50_para10"></a>We have accepted the Disability Rights Task Force's recommendation that the most effective way for increasing accessibility for disabled pupils is by taking a more strategic approach with local education authorities working with schools in their area to increase accessibility.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-50_para11"></a>What is the planning duty intended to achieve? It is not just about increasing the accessibility of premises; it is also about increasing physical access to the curriculum by providing aids to learning outside of the SEN framework, which provides specific aids and services to meet the needs of individual pupils.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-50_para12"></a>We want to ensure that LEAs and schools do more to improve physical accessibility than just providing ramps and lifts. We want them to think about what physical measures will help disabled children access the curriculum. This may include providing laptops, using appropriate paint schemes and carpets, installing soundfield systems or providing specialist furniture.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-50_para13"></a>The provision of such physical aids can be used to improve access to education by a range of disabled pupils: they are not restricted to one type of disability.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-50_para14"></a>We recognise that improving physical accessibility to schools is important. LEAs in England are eligible for funding through the schools access initiative to increase accessibility to mainstream schools for pupils with both physical and sensory disabilities. The sum of £220 million is being made available to LEAs in <P>


<a name="column_208"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 208</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>England over the next three years, which is a significant increase over the £30 million which was allocated this year.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-50_para15"></a>If this were all that LEAs were required to do, the amendments might have some substance. However, other provisions in this Bill and other measures already being taken by this Government provide sufficient levers to ensure that teaching and learning arrangements are sensitive to the needs of disabled pupils.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-50_para16"></a>We do not believe that schools' plans and LEAs' strategies are the right vehicle for securing change to teaching and learning approaches. These amendments would introduce additional administrative burdens when schools and teachers are now required to ensure that they follow inclusive practice in delivering the national curriculum.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-50_para17"></a>Under Clause 12, schools will have to consider what reasonable adjustments to practices, policies and procedures such as general teaching methods should be made if particular arrangements would place disabled children at a substantial disadvantage.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-50_para18"></a>All maintained schools and a fair few independent schools follow the national curriculum. The national curriculum statement on inclusion sets out three principles that teachers are required to have due regard to in planning and teaching the national curriculum: setting suitable learning challenges; responding to pupils' diverse learning needs; and overcoming potential barriers to learning and assessment for individuals and groups of pupils.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-50_para19"></a>It goes on to say that teachers should take specific action to respond to pupils' diverse needs by, among other things, providing equality of opportunity through teaching approaches. For pupils with disabilities, it specifically states that teachers must take action in their planning to ensure that these pupils are enabled to participate as fully and effectively as possible within the national curriculum and the statutory assessment arrangements.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-50_para20"></a>This is a major lever for ensuring that teachers, as part of their professional duties, will consider how to adjust their teaching methods to ensure that disabled pupils are able to access the curriculum--which is the burden of the speeches and the nature of these amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-50_para21"></a>During the Second Reading debate, the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, described the planning duty as appearing "very weak". This is not so. It should not be seen on its own, but rather as part of the wider framework which includes the existing SEN framework that provides auxiliary aids and services to meet children's special educational needs; the duty to make reasonable adjustments; additional school access initiative funding; the national curriculum statement on inclusion; and increased funding for training for SEN. These will increase services to disabled children and make provision that will help them develop to their full potential.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-50_para22"></a>Let me turn to Amendment No. 113A. We recognise the importance of making schools physically accessible to pupils with disabilities, which is, of <P>


<a name="column_209"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 209</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>course, the intention of the planning duty. I sympathise with the intention of Amendment No. 113A, but it would be unreasonable to expect LEAs to ensure that their mainstream provision is accessible and can cater for all disabled pupils within the prescribed time period of the strategy.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-50_para23"></a>The planning duty is to plan strategically over time. The LEA may initially decide to concentrate on improving the accessibility of its schools to pupils, for instance, with a hearing impairment. Alternatively, the LEA may decide to improve the accessibility of one school to a number of pupils with a number of different disabilities. We do not want to be prescriptive. It will be for each LEA according to its particular circumstance to prioritise. Not all LEAs will start from the same starting point. Some LEAs, for instance, may already have accessible provision for visually impaired pupils.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-50_para24"></a>As time moves on, we naturally expect LEAs to have made progress in increasing the physical accessibility of schools to disabled pupils. The duty is progressive. But it is also realistic in recognising that some schools, because of the availability and nature of their building stock, may have further to go than others.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-50_para25"></a>In the light of this description of the way in which all aspects of educational policy come together, I hope that it will be recognised by the noble Lord that this amendment need not be pressed.

<A NAME="10130-51_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   In dealing with the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Rix, the Minister suggested that these plans would cover such things as provision of equipment for the hard of hearing and laptops. I do not see how that fits under the phrase "physical environment". If I were asked to describe the physical environment of this room, I would say it was cold and dark, and I would be right, but the fact that I do not have a laptop in front of me has nothing to do with the physical environment of this room.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-51_para0"></a>If we were to put the words "and equipment" after "environment", then I would understand that what the Minister said corresponded to what was in the Bill, but that is not there at the moment. Would the Minister consider their inclusion?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-51_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   At the very beginning of our Committee proceedings there was a complaint about the physical dimensions of this room and about the acoustics. I thought it was indicated that they could be improved. I hear what the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, has said on this occasion and I will look further at that point.

<P>

<a name="column_210"></a>

<B>30 Jan 2001 : Column 210</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I would like to say that I cannot totally accept what was said by the Minister. The amendment does not place an additional burden on LEAs and teachers and schools any more than is already put upon them in the Bill. It clarifies the situation and it also puts a belt and braces not only on the physical access, but also on the teaching access which is essential for all disabled pupils.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-51_para1"></a>I fear that I must return to this issue possibly when we come to the next stage of the Bill, but I shall consult with the Special Educational Consortium who will, I hope, in turn have words with officials in the department. I hope that some compromise may be reached.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-51_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   Before the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Manchester, winds up, I would like to endorse what the noble Lord, Lord Rix, has said. We have had a great deal of explanation on the essence of the clauses and in particular on the vital role played here by the long-term strategy. It gives completely the wrong message to mention just the physical environment here. It is very important that the concept of access to the curriculum is embedded on the face of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130-51_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Morris of Manchester: </B>   We have had an informed and worthwhile, if discursive, debate on these important amendments. I trust I may be forgiven for expressing special pleasure about the speeches of my noble friend Lady Wilkins and the noble Lord, Lord Rix.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-51_para2"></a>Turning to the reply from the Minister, while I had hoped for more today I am not unhopeful of a more favourable reply when we return to these issues on Report. After all, the Minister said that he favours the intention of Amendment No. 113A. Is it unreasonable to expect that he may take one further step and discuss with those who support the amendment any necessary improvements to its drafting if that would help matters along?
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-51_para3"></a>Meanwhile, I again reserve the position of my noble friend Lord Ashley in regard to Amendment No. 112, and on this occasion also my own position in relation to Amendment No. 113A. On that basis, I shall not press the amendment. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-51_para4"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130-51_para5"></a>[Amendments Nos. 113 to 113A not moved.]

<A NAME="10130-51_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   This may be a convenient moment for the Committee to adjourn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130w01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   The Government have recently issued a licence for the export of industrial gas turbine parts to Iran for civil end use. This particular industrial engine has been developed from a military engine and is commonly used to drive pumps and electric generators. The engine is not subject to export control when it is exported as a complete unit. However, when it is broken down into component form, a very small percentage of its parts are unchanged from their original form and, as military components, come within the scope of the UK's arms embargo and are controlled under Part III of Schedule 1 to the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994.
<P>

<A NAME = "10130w01_para6"></a>The Government are satisfied that Iran does not possess any aircraft powered by the original military engine and that the risk of the components being diverted for use by the Iranian military is minimal.

Returns as to election spending will normally need to be submitted to the commission within three months of the date of an election or within six months where the return is required to be audited (because the expenditure exceeds &#163;250,000).

<A NAME = "10130w03_para0"></a>It must also be remembered that two independent epidemiological studies into the health of British nuclear test veterans, funded by the Ministry of Defence, concluded that participation in the UK's atmospheric nuclear test programme has had no detectable effect on participants' expectation of life or on their risk of developing cancer or other fatal diseases. We are also funding research into the incidence of Multiple Myeloma and other cancers among nuclear test veterans, the results of which should be available later this year. I therefore do not believe that there is a case in making screening facilities available to them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="10130w03_spmin0"></A><B> The Minister for Science, Department of Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville):</B>  Current regulatory controls on unsolicited direct marketing communications are based on the telecoms data protection directive (Directive 97/66/EC). Under the UK implementing regulations for this, the Telecommunications (Data Protection and Privacy) Regulations 1999, unsolicited non-automated telephone calls for direct marketing purposes may not be made to individual subscribers who have indicated that they do not wish to receive them (automated calls are prohibited without prior consent). There are similar rules on direct marketing faxes to corporate subscribers but individuals have the dual right both to register not to receive such faxes and not to receive such faxes unless they have consented.

<A NAME = "10130w03_para1"></a>There is some debate over the application of the current rules to e-mail and text messages and the Government welcome the Commission's proposal to clarify the position.

Independent evaluation conducted by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research published last year considered whether there was evidence that 18 to 24 year-olds were being taken on instead of older workers and concluded that there was little sign of substitution. The same report found that long-term youth unemployment would be twice as high without New Deal and the economy is richer by &#163;500 million a year because of New Deal.

co-operation in combating actual or threatened oil pollution at sea; there is an International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund, established within the framework of the International Convention of Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage 1969 (CLC) and the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage 1971 (IOPC Fund Convention), and the Protocols of 1992 to both of these conventions. This regime provides compensation where oil pollution damage from tankers affects states which are parties to the CLC and the IOPC Fund Convention.
