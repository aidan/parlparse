The revised Healthcare Travel Costs Scheme was launched on 1 April 2008 and we are developing a performance regime that will monitor the uptake of the scheme, while placing a minimal administrative burden on the NHS.</p>

Although I appreciate that the local hospital has the prime responsibility for administration and publicity of the scheme, a recent survey by Macmillan Cancer Support claimed that only 19 per cent of patients were informed about the previous scheme. Considering the very large cost that is involved when NHS appointments are missed and the dramatic impact that travel-to-hospital expenses can have on patients&#146; finances, is the noble Baroness willing to review the Government&#146;s position in, say, six months, so that we would have a real idea of how well the publicity is going?</p>

That is not quite the six months he asked for. He is quite right to say that the take-up of the old scheme was not as good as it should have been, which meant that people who needed and were entitled to help were not receiving it. The noble Lord is also right to say that the effectiveness of the new scheme depends almost completely on commitment and delivery at local level. Our review will be undertaken following the end of the financial year 2008-09 and will, indeed, focus on the impact of the revisions on the take-up of the scheme and the financial impact on NHS organisations.</p>

Part of the review and the launch of the new scheme was a commitment to enhance and promote awareness of the HTCS. It is the responsibility of NHS organisations to promote the scheme. However, to assist them to do that, the Prescription Pricing Authority provides leaflets and posters. A range of application forms and leaflets that deal with help for healthcare costs are available through a variety of different organisations&#151;primary care trusts, hospital trusts, DWP, NACAB, universities, pharmacists, GPs and dental surgeries&#151;to be distributed to patients. In addition, we are sending quarterly mailshots every three months to dispensing doctors, pharmacists and key contacts. We hope that that will enhance the take-up of the scheme over the year.</p>

The noble Baroness adumbrated a number of steps, but who is taking responsibility at national level for improved take-up? What incentives are being built into the system?</p>

Guidance has been issued as a result of the relaunch. We have indeed redoubled our efforts to promote the scheme right across the piece and we are very optimistic that this will make an impact.</p>

Can my noble friend Lady Thornton tell us what reply was received from the commission?</p>

I do not have the detailed answer here. We are aware that cancer patients face particular difficulty in paying the cost of their travel to treatment, but the principle of the scheme is that those on low incomes are eligible. That does not necessarily address the issues that cancer patients face. I undertake to find out what answer was given to my noble friend at the time and to let the noble Lord and the House know.</p>

For those people, one can view the scheme as not so much nice to have but a vital part of their care and treatment. In that context, is there some way in which from the outset commissioning processes could be used to boost and promote the scheme to patients?</p>

The exhibition examines the changes in the membership of both Houses since the 19th century and is one of a number of initiatives taking place in Parliament to mark the 1958 anniversary.

Does he agree that, whatever the merits of the exhibition, its structure does not sit comfortably in the splendour and graciousness of the Royal Gallery? Does he further agree that, although we are of course indebted to the life Peers, who have brought so much to this House&#151;all sorts of things, including wisdom, ability, great competence and even, sometimes, charm&#151;they have only been here for 50 years, whereas hereditary Peers have been here for 800 years? Will he consider having a conversation with the noble Baroness the Lord Speaker to see whether she would think of putting up another exhibition, in favour of the hereditary Peers, to show what they have done to make this House what it was, which life Peers have for so long, understandably, aspired to join? Should that not be done pro rata with the exhibition over there?</p>

It seems to be used for House of Commons exhibitions all the time. Can we not share it? I very much resent that. I agree with the noble Lord, who is a hereditary Peer and, I hope, my friend: it is a desecration of the Royal Gallery to use it for these purposes.

With the leave of the House, I shall now repeat a Statement made in another place on the final report by Kieran Poynter, chairman of PricewaterhouseCoopers, into the loss of child benefit records at HM Revenue and Customs last year. The Statement is as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;I should tell the House that the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which conducted its own investigation into the loss, is publishing its report today. The IPCC found no evidence of misconduct or criminality by any member of staff at HMRC. The Cabinet Secretary has also published today his wider cross-government work to improve data handling. The Poynter and IPCC reports are available in the Vote Office and the Library of the House. I am grateful to Kieran Poynter and his team and the IPCC for their extensive work. Both have provided a very full and detailed account of what happened.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Improving information security is a challenge that every organisation is facing. In recent years, we have seen problems in both the public and private sectors as organisations struggle to keep pace with the development of technology in data storage and transfer. The public are entitled to expect government departments to ensure that their personal details are kept safe, and it is therefore essential that we do everything we can do to minimise the chances of this sort of loss happening again.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;I deliberately gave Mr Poynter wide-ranging terms of reference, not just because of the seriousness of this loss but also because, as I said in my Statement of 20 November, I was concerned about previous losses of data by HMRC. In my Statements to the House on 20 November and 17 December, I set out the circumstances surrounding the events that led to the loss of the child benefit data and the immediate action taken. My priorities then were to locate the missing disks and to ensure that adequate safeguards were in place to monitor bank and building society accounts of those who could have been affected.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1437"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column 1437</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Despite extensive searches by HMRC and the police, the disks have not been found, but I can tell the House that I am advised that there is no evidence of any fraudulent activity as a result of the loss.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;HMRS took a series of immediate steps at that time, including a complete ban on the transfer of bulk data without adequate security protection, measures to prevent the downloading of data without the necessary safeguards, and the immediate disabling of the ability to download data from all desktop and laptop computers within the organisation.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Mr Kieran Poynter&#146;s report is in two parts. The first deals with the circumstances giving rise to the loss. The second part deals with his wider findings and recommendations. He examined in detail the circumstances surrounding the earlier transfer of data in March 2007, to which I referred in my Statements to the House. He found that in March, because the HMRC staff then involved were unaware of the relevant guidance, which in itself lacked clarity, they did not escalate the request to the appropriate level of seniority before releasing data to the NAO. As a result, no senior HMRC official was asked to permit the NAO to take the data off-site to conduct its analysis and no such official knew that this was envisaged.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Mr Poynter has concluded that these events in March last year then created a precedent which allowed a similar transfer to take place in October without the appropriate level of authorisation or adequate consideration of the security risks of releasing such a large amount of personal information. He says that senior managers were unaware that the data had been moved from HMRC premises in March and October until the loss of data was subsequently reported to them.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;He concludes that the data loss incident arose following a sequence of communications failures between junior HMRC officials and between them and the National Audit Office. However, he finds that the loss was entirely avoidable and the fact that it could have happened points to serious institutional deficiencies at HMRC.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;First, information security simply was not the management priority it should have been. Secondly, management structures and governance were unnecessarily complex and did not establish clear lines of accountability. Moreover, he points to a lack of clarity in communications and the failure to involve senior HMRC staff as being contributing factors in both cases.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Mr Poynter makes clear in his report that both these failings have now been addressed. He acknowledges the progress the department has made since last November. HMRC is a complex organisation, operating from some 900 sites and sending out more than 300 million items of mail a year.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Against this background, Mr Poynter sets out the action that has been taken to make information security a priority. This includes the appointment of a chief risk officer, new, clearer security guidance and a wide-ranging programme of training to raise awareness of security issues among staff. He also

He acknowledges the new organisational structure as a positive step forward.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Mr Poynter&#146;s team has worked closely with HMRC and in particular those teams that process large volumes of personal data or provide corporate services such as IT. By providing detailed recommendations to the organisation as its work progressed, rather than leaving them to the final report, the review team has been able to support HMRC and help it make good progress in implementing its recommendations.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;However, Mr Poynter states that,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="08062572000327"></a>&#145;a great deal of work will be required to bring HMRC up to and to sustain the world-class standard for information security to which it now properly aspires&#146;.</p>
</ul><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>In all, he makes 45 recommendations, all of which have been accepted. HMRC has made good progress on 39 of the recommendations, including 13 which have been fully implemented. Work is continuing on the remaining recommendations.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Mr Poynter also makes a number of recommendations in relation to the way in which HMRC operates and the fragmentation and complexity of its IT systems. The organisation is already addressing these issues and will be spending &#163;155 million improving data security over the next three years. The 45 recommendations, when fully implemented, will reduce the risk of a serious breach in the future and make sure that HMRC achieves the highest standards of information security.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Kieran Poynter states that the decision to merge the Inland Revenue and HM Customs and Excise was the right one, but he says that the management structure subsequently adopted was not suitable&#151;exactly the same failing identified in the capability review carried out by an independent panel, overseen by the Cabinet Secretary and published last December.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;In acknowledging the significant changes the organisation has undergone, Mr Poynter judges that,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="08062572000328"></a>&#145;these changes individually and collectively represent good decisions which have created the platform from which to build a high-quality, efficient administration&#146;.</p>
</ul><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>In order to build from this platform, the management needs to continue to address the issues highlighted by Mr Poynter in his wider review and the capability review. In particular, HMRC&#146;s security procedures must be improved to ensure information security is a management priority and, importantly, the management must raise staff morale.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Mr Poynter acknowledges the new organisational structure put in place earlier this year as a crucial step and makes recommendations to develop it further. He concludes that his findings represent an opportunity to modernise work practices and systems, which will make the organisation more efficient as well as rebuilding its reputation for data security.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;I am grateful to Dave Hartnett, the acting chairman, who has overseen these improvements and led the organisation through a difficult time. Yesterday Mike Clasper, who has considerable business experience, was appointed as the new chair of HMRC. He and Dave Hartnett have made it clear that the

<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;The Information Commissioner, who has been kept informed since the outset, has indicated that this review has investigated all the facts and issues with which he needs to be concerned; he fully supports all of Kieran Poynter&#146;s recommendations. The Information Commissioner proposes to serve the appropriate enforcement notice on HMRC under the Data Protection Act.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;It is quite clear that the loss was entirely avoidable and, again, I apologise unreservedly to anyone who has been affected. HMRC employs tens of thousands of people, who work hard and who are dedicated to providing an excellent service to the public. The staff are entitled to expect clarity as to how they discharge their duties. The public are entitled to expect that their privacy is respected and that security of highly personalised information is the highest priority. It is essential that we now implement his recommendations. I commend this Statement to the House&#148;.</p>

We were beginning to think that the Government had forgotten about this. Last December, they assured us that Mr Poynter would issue his full report in the first half of this year. Well, he just about made it, with a couple of sitting days to spare.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="08062572000077"></a>Mr Poynter&#146;s first review, published just before Christmas, was disappointing in its lack of hard facts, so we welcome this report. What is still a mystery is why it has taken so long. The Government want to introduce 42 days for the purposes of establishing evidence as to the facts in criminal cases, but they have allowed Mr Poynter to take eight months to establish the facts in this case. Doubtless that was convenient for a Government who hoped that this would disappear off the public radar screen.</p>

<a name="80625-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="08062572000078"></a>Now that we have a definitive study on what happened in HMRC, we can address the critical issue of whether this failure was systemic, isolated or procedural. The distinction is important because Ministers take responsibility for systemic failures. The headings in Chapter IX of the Poynter review say it all: &#147;Information security not a management priority&#148;; &#147;An unsuitable organisation design with muddled accountabilities&#148;; &#147;Fragmentation and complexity&#148;; &#147;Inadequate information security policies&#148;; &#147;Embracing the digital age&#148;, which actually means not embracing it; and &#147;Morale is low&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="08062572000079"></a>This organisation has not had a long history contributing to a cumulative list of failings. It was created in 2005 by a decision of the current Prime Minister, when he was Chancellor. He chose to merge two adequate organisations and, in doing so, created one monster. He knew exactly what he was doing. He appointed a chairman from outside the public sector who spoke in management riddles and then set up an organisation that is described in the Poynter report as a,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="08062572000080"></a>Let no one believe that the Prime Minister just appointed an outside expert and left him to it. That is not the Prime Minister&#146;s style. He would have known in detail what was being done to the organisation and approved of it. He might not have understood its disastrous consequences, but he must have known about it. Through a strategic job move, the Prime Minister may cleverly have escaped paying the price for the systemic failure that he helped to create and, certainly as Chancellor, oversaw. In another era, he would not have escaped. Ministers have resigned for much less in previous regimes.</p>

<a name="80625-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="08062572000081"></a>The report makes distressing reading. The HMRC officials involved were spun as being junior officials but, in fact, they are the grades that form the backbone of the Civil Service. The report finds that they did not know, understand or follow laid-down procedures and did not prioritise data security. They were not trained and the policies were opaque.</p>

<a name="80625-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="08062572000082"></a>Have any of the staff involved in the data loss been disciplined or dismissed? I note that several immunities were for some reason granted to some unspecified individuals. I am not asking for personal details; I am merely asking for the overall picture. If the report is right that those individuals were muddling through in an environment where doing the right thing happened more by luck than judgment, it might then be right that no action should be taken against the individuals.</p>

<a name="80625-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="08062572000083"></a>The chairman of HMRC resigned last November, but he left on feather-bedded terms, so his departure does not really count. However, if no one else in HMRC has taken the blame and the Prime Minister has not accepted responsibility, absolutely no one is carrying the can. It simply cannot be right that the slate is wiped clean by this report.</p>

<a name="80625-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="08062572000084"></a>We are being invited to accept that a contrite and reformed HRMC will not make the same mistakes again, but is the statutory framework robust enough? The Government fought off our amendments to the 2005 Act that created HMRC. Will they now undertake to review the statutory framework?</p>

<a name="80625-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="08062572000085"></a>The problem is not confined to HMRC. Since the previous government Statement, we have had many more data losses, including secret terrorism papers left on a train. Even a Cabinet Minister cared so little for the rules that she took a laptop containing classified information to her constituency. The Government have forfeited the trust of the public in relation to data security.</p>

<a name="80625-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="08062572000086"></a>Will the Government now call a halt to the identity card project? It should not proceed until there is complete assurance about citizens&#146; data. The national children&#146;s database, which will contain sensitive information about some of the most vulnerable in our society, carries exactly the same dangers. So, too, does the NHS spine. If it eventually works, and if the Government compulsorily upload patient data from GPs, they will at a stroke expose the most intimate details about individuals to major security risks. All these projects should be put on hold until the public can be confident that they can be operated securely.</p>

<a name="80625-0003.htm_para7"></a>

<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1441"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column 1441</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>website at lunchtime but could find no trace of this document. Since I have been unable to find out what the document says, will the Minister say whether that, too, contains further embarrassing confirmations that government departments cannot be trusted with citizens&#146; data?</p>

<a name="80625-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="08062572000088"></a>I have one final question for the Minister. Appendix A of the report, which describes Mr Poynter&#146;s terms of reference, states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="08062572000281"></a>&#147;I have agreed with HMRC and HMT that my review is focused on data loss and therefore excludes misuse of data&#151;including any misuse of data held by HMRC by its staff&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80625-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08062572000089"></a>This extraordinary exclusion was not made plain when the terms of reference for the report were published last year and has not, I believe, been made plain in any other way. Can the Minister say why the Poynter review was constrained in this way? More important, who is looking at whether HMRC has misused data that it holds? Losing the data of 2.5 million people was bad enough, but the misuse of data belonging to a single individual would be even more reprehensible. Can the Minister assure us that this stone will not be left unturned?</p>

<a name="08062572000090"></a><a name="80625-0003.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80625-0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08062572000413"></a>Lord Newby:</b> My Lords, I, too, thank the Minister for repeating the Statement and for bringing the Poynter review to the House. The report is the most extraordinarily damning indictment of the management of HMRC that one could wish to read. I will repeat just the three principal criticisms. The Statement says that,</p>
<ul><a name="08062572000297"></a>&#147;information security was simply not the management priority it should have been ... management structures and governance were unnecessarily complex and did not establish clear lines of accountability&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08062572000091"></a>and there was,</p>
<ul><a name="08062572000282"></a>&#147;a lack of clarity in communications and the failure to involve senior HMRC staff as being contributing factors&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08062572000267"></a>in all the cases that were looked at. The incident that spurred this inquiry was simply an accident waiting to happen. It is not just a question of technical management issues. It goes to the whole ethos of the way in which this huge department works and its attitudes towards individuals&#146; personal data.</p>

<a name="80625-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08062572000092"></a>When we were considering the Bill that merged the two departments, we received an extraordinary letter from the late Lord Callaghan. He described how, as a young boy, he joined the Inland Revenue. On his first day, he appeared before a large man, with a large beard, who made him swear an oath that he would secure, to the best of his abilities, all personal data that came into his possession. He was made to swear that it would not get into the public domain or into anyone&#146;s hands, as indeed it should not. Yet one of the many damning statements in this document is that there is no mandatory induction briefing on data management for people entering HMRC; at least I assume that that is the case, as the report urges that such mandatory briefings should be given.</p>

<a name="80625-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08062572000093"></a>There has been a long period during which data protection and data management have slipped down the agenda in the two departments. This may have been exacerbated by their merger but I do not think  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1442"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column 1442</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that it was caused by it. We cannot simply blame the staff; Ministers must also take some of the blame. I cannot see anything in the report to suggest, for example, that Ministers experienced or expressed any concern, at any point, about attitudes towards data security and the methods of storing data and communicating them within HMRC.</p>

<a name="80625-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08062572000094"></a>If what Mr Poynter calls the &#147;transformation&#148;&#151;it is a wonderful word in respect of these matters&#151;takes place, he claims that the following benefits will ensue: improved efficiency; improved tax yield; better customer service; and a higher level of staff satisfaction. If this is the case, as seems plausible, why did no Minister or senior member of staff at HMRC seem to have any awareness of these pretty substantial and obvious benefits of managing data differently? If they were aware of them, why did they not do anything about them?</p>

<a name="80625-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08062572000095"></a>On the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, has anybody taken personal responsibility for any of this mess whatever? Has anybody resigned or been disciplined? Or was the malaise so widespread that everybody&#151;Ministers and civil servants&#151;was equally to blame?</p>

<a name="80625-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08062572000096"></a>An interesting side issue discussed in the report is the way in which HMRC communicates to taxpayers. The report deals with the problem that HMRC has not really come to grips with the digital age. It points out that the volume of paper issued by HMRC is almost unbelievably large. It says, for example, that each business gets on average 68 mailings per year&#151;as a small businessman, I can assure noble Lords that it certainly feels like that. Nearly all these mailings could easily be dealt with in an e-mail rather than on paper. The fact that HMRC is still thinking in terms of paper for communicating with individual taxpayers and businesses shows a cast of mind that has not moved on to take account of modern circumstances.</p>

<a name="80625-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08062572000097"></a>The report says, in respect of this, that legislation may be needed to allow HMRC to specify how customers exchange data with it. Although the Government have apparently accepted all the recommendations, for some reason this is not a recommendation; it does not appear in the table at the end of the report. Can the Minister say whether the Government agree that there would be benefits if HMRC started communicating with taxpayers in a modern way? Do they think that legislation as Mr Poynter suggested might be needed to enable them to specify that it does that? If so, can they give us an indication of when such legislation might be forthcoming?</p>

<a name="80625-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08062572000098"></a>This report deals entirely with HMRC, as does the Minister&#146;s Statement. When we discussed this previously, in the immediate aftermath of the data loss, there was much discussion of what was happening elsewhere in government. From the report and the Statement, we are completely unclear on how far the lessons that Mr Poynter has drawn have been accepted across government, as opposed to just within HMRC, and what is being done about them. As the noble Baroness said, recent examples suggest that the attitude towards data in HMRC, which has clearly been most careless, extends across government and certainly to Ministers and their private offices. What actions will flow to try  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1443"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column 1443</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to ensure that the slack ethos around data, which is clearly evidenced across government, not just in HMRC, will now be tackled?</p>

<a name="80625-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="08062572000099"></a>Finally, to end where the noble Baroness ended, will the Government now accept that the country has no faith in them to introduce large-scale new systems that involve individual citizens having data kept and transferred electronically by a Government whose track record in this area is so absolutely woeful?</p>

I shall try to deal with each of the questions raised. The noble Baroness asked why it took so long for the report to be finalised. I think that she acknowledged that it was delivered within the timeframe within which it was promised. It seems important, given the issues at stake here, that we had a thorough report rather than a rushed report that did not deal fully with all the issues. We make no apologies for that.</p>

<a name="80625-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="08062572000101"></a>I guess that we had the inevitable political point-scoring about why Ministers have not taken responsibility for all of this, a matter that the noble Lord, Lord Newby, touched on as well. It is because HMRC is operationally independent of Ministers. It is established by statute and run by a chairman and commissioners, who are responsible for its operations but answerable to Parliament through the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Moreover, somebody did resign over it&#151;the previous chairman, Paul Gray, the man at the top of the organisation.</p>

<a name="80625-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08062572000102"></a>The noble Baroness referred to the merged organisation as a &#147;monster&#148;. I remind her that the Poynter report made it clear that the merger was not a contributory factor to this; indeed, with other developments, it was seen as a good platform from which to build an efficient and effective operation. I might also just remind her that in 2000, when the merger took place, the opposition parties&#151;including the noble Baroness herself, I understand&#151;did not oppose the merger.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08062572000105"></a>The noble Baroness asked about the wider capability review around government and the Cabinet Office data-handling review. This has looked across government and the review was published today. I shall ensure that she and the noble Lord, Lord Newby, get a copy. One is available in the Library. The review was commissioned by the Prime Minister and sets out the wide range of actions that have already been put in place to improve data security. It outlines what will be done to strengthen policies further by building on existing momentum. The changes announced fall into four groups: core  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1444"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column 1444</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>measures around mandatory minimum measures being put in place; a culture change; all civil servants dealing with personal data undergoing mandatory annual training; and stronger accountability and increased scrutiny.</p>

<a name="80625-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08062572000106"></a>The noble Baroness predictably referred to ID cards. The national identity register will be protected to the same level as some military databases. Only a very small number of officials managing the register will have full access to it. There is a much longer answer to that point, but this report should not be used as an opportunity to seek to undermine ID cards. She asked about the misuse of data. As I understand it, Kieran Poynter chose to exclude data misuse, which was not the cause of the data loss. HMRC has strong safeguards against wrongful use of its data enshrined in law and treats any misuse as gross misconduct. Nevertheless, the safeguards recommended by Mr Poynter will also strengthen this aspect of the department&#146;s procedures.</p>

<a name="80625-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08062572000107"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, asked about HMRC letters and whether more should not be sent by e-mail. Open internet e-mail is less secure than post sent through the Royal Mail. E-mail is not a secure form of communication and therefore not particularly suitable for sensitive information. He referred to the remarks of Lord Callaghan when he joined the Inland Revenue. Section 3 of the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act requires a formal signed declaration from all people joining HMRC. This has been in place from day one of the creation of HMRC on 18 April 2005.</p>

<a name="80625-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08062572000108"></a>The noble Baroness asked whether major IT projects introduced new security risks. Uploading data to new IT systems can make them more secure. We are discussing the inappropriate downloading or transmission of data.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="08062572000109"></a>The Cabinet Office report was put on to the website at 12.30 today and, as I said, is available in the House Library. Ed Miliband issued a Written Statement earlier, which can be made available to noble Lords.</p>

I emphasise that the Government have accepted all its recommendations and have made good progress in implementing some of them. The noble Baroness asked whether there had been misuse of data and whether individuals are to be prosecuted. The IPCC report made it clear that no criminal activity or misconduct had been identified that would generate disciplinary action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="08062572000112"></a>We are in a different era of data protection management from when our late noble friend Lord Callaghan joined the Inland Revenue. Data protection would have been a problem whether the department had been merged or not. The report said that the merger was right. If it was right, what did we gain from it apart from the appalling management that it has been under? What

Were there major staff savings? Has the Minister got any figures for staff savings, which would have been a substantial benefit? I am not aware of any. My own experience was a long time ago, when I was responsible for the Revenue and for Customs for five years. In those days, data were at a very different level, and paper was still used. Now the department has merged, and we cannot go back and de-merge it, although I would have preferred the two separate departments. The only thing that they seem to have in common is that they both collect revenue. I cannot for the moment see why and how the merger was decided on. It is not my noble friend&#146;s fault and I am not blaming him, but I would like to know if he has any information that might help us: are we eventually going to get a high-quality merged department and, if so, when?</p>

I do not have available all the detailed thinking behind that merger, but some of it must be self-evident, as the noble Lord himself identified. The two departments were dealing with the same customers to a certain extent. There are overlapping issues around enforcement that might be dealt with more efficiently. It seems to me an entirely reasonable proposition. The merger was not identified by Kieran Poynter as the cause of this lack of focus on data security, but he clearly indicated that the merged organisation had serious institutional deficiencies that had to be corrected and are being corrected. In terms of savings, there has been a head-count reduction, but the report indicates that the head-count reduction was not a cause of data loss, although it identifies concerns about cost that may have driven some of the behaviours.</p>

It is not helpful to have a Statement simply entitled &#147;HM Revenue and Customs&#148;, when it covers an enormous range of subjects. If we are to have sensible reactions to Statements, we should have something a little more specific.</p>

<a name="80625-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="08062572000115"></a>I do not think that any of us who have spoken to officials in the merged department could fail to understand the way in which morale has been adversely affected, when compared with the morale that existed in the two great departments of state with their historic traditions. My noble friend raised the question of who had been held accountable, and the noble Lord said that a senior official resigned. Was it clear at the time that the reason why he resigned was this sad series of events? Do we now have a new doctrine where the Minister concerned is accountable to the House but, if something goes wrong, he remains in office and the officials concerned resign? That seems different from the traditional way in which we have dealt with these matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="08062572000116"></a>It would seem from subsequent events that part of the problem is that officials and Ministers take home laptops and documents, and they are left around.

I am not sure who undertakes the description, but it is a fair point.</p>

<a name="80625-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="08062572000118"></a>The noble Lord touched on morale in the services. It is right that merging two big organisations that started off with distinct identities brings particular challenges that have not been met. The Poynter report makes that clear. That is one of the challenges in dealing with the recommendations. That touches on the same point as my noble friend made about the benefits of bringing all those departments together, which include efficiency in sharing back-office functions, effectiveness in joining up the collection of tax revenues and customer focus. We should not forget about the customers in all of this. There must be benefits from treating all customers&#146; tax affairs in one place</p>

<a name="80625-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="08062572000119"></a>The noble Lord asked about taking home laptops. This report was not occasioned by that point, but we need to make sure that people who have secure information on laptops and so on do not use them outside a secure area. That issue was picked up in the wider review undertaken by the Cabinet Office. I cannot do more than repeat what I said about responsibility: HMRC is operationally independent; it has a chair and the commissioners; and that is where responsibility properly lies.</p>

It was common ground between the two Opposition parties that we were extremely anxious that the Revenue culture should prevail, certainly on non-criminal matters. The Revenue culture was that security of personal information should have the highest priority. I look forward to hearing from the Minister what practical steps will be taken to restore that culture and ethos, which we all used to respect and have confidence in.</p>

As the report says, there were serious institutional deficiencies. A key one was that information security was not a management priority. There is the whole range of the report&#146;s recommendations&#151;45 in all&#151;all of which the Government have accepted. That will enable us to address the issues, but that issue is fundamental. The report also makes the point that, even if information security had been a management priority, the management structure then in place would not have been particularly helpful in making sure that that policy was implemented. The whole range of measures that are detailed in the report&#151;some of which are already under way&#151;will enable the information security issue to be re-established, so that trust can be maintained and built in HMRC&#146;s handling of personal and confidential data.</p>

I was there for about 35 years. I apologise to the noble Lord on the Liberal Benches&#151;I cannot recall his name&#151;but I assure him that the old culture of the Revenue has gone and has been effectively destroyed over the past 20 years.</p>

<a name="80625-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08062572000125"></a>At the heart of the problem that these reports deal with are two matters. The first is in the Poynter report at page 63, and the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, referred to it. I do not wish to put words in her mouth&#151;if I do, I apologise&#151;but there is no doubt that the present state of the Revenue is largely down to the significant importation of private sector culture. That has come in two ways: in the appointment of the chairman&#151;I do not wish to be unkind to the new chairman, but his CV hardly bears up as a good example of what the report says should be done&#151;and the appointment of board members of Revenue and Customs. The last time that I looked, only one or two of them actually had Revenue experience.</p>

<a name="80625-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08062572000126"></a>The second matter is mentioned on page 85 at recommendation 43:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="08062572000283"></a>&#147;We recommend that HMRC, rather than being solely savings-driven in its business case, should also evaluate the opportunity to redeploy staff towards yield improving compliance activities&#151;building the business case based on yield improvement rather than staff reduction&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08062572000268"></a>As all the recommendations of the report have been accepted, when and how will that be done? If my noble friend cannot answer that, will he keep the House informed of progress on this critical paragraph?</p>

Each of the 45 recommendations is listed at the rear of the report, and we have ticked those that we have completed or are addressing and others where progress has been made. I am not sure where the recommendation he referred to sits in that configuration, but I will look at the matter in detail and report back to my noble friend and the House generally. Low morale is an important issue, and the Poynter report identified that as one of the contributory factors, as I said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08062572000128"></a>Perhaps I may take this opportunity to say something further about laptops, which a noble Lord asked about.

This comes from what the Poynter report describes as a three-stage process for change, based on 10 principles for information security. There are short-term changes to bring greater control through improving existing processes and investigating phasing out data transfer by physical media. In the medium term, there is consolidation through better processes and technology, including moving to e-mail for communications&#151;a point made by a noble Lord earlier&#151;and scanning post and records. The &#163;155 million in the current spending round over three years is addressed largely to that. Kieran Poynter also recommends in the longer term transformation to a new IT-based operating model through a direction of travel that would involve an integrated data system for managing customer information and would place greater responsibility on the customer for maintaining their data. That part of it&#151;the longer-term proposition&#151;will need to be looked at in conjunction with the next comprehensive spending round. The &#163;155 million is for spending over the next three years on the short- and medium-term recommendations made in the report.</p>

<a name="80625-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="08062572000131"></a>I stress that, in the complexities of dealing with data&#151;this issue arose within the department rather than from sharing data across departments&#151;we should not lose the prize of improved public services and customer focus to be had from being able to share information effectively and securely across government. If we take our vision off that, we will not improve public services as we could. Although it is hugely important that we ensure that data security is at the heart of what we do, we should not let that stop us sharing information effectively across government the better to deliver public services.</p>

I was very unenthusiastic about the merger of those two bodies and am distressed to hear of the collapse of morale that has apparently taken place. When I was responsible for them in 1974-75, I thought that they were two of the finest departments with which I had the privilege to serve and that the officials with whom I worked were of the very highest calibre. It is overlooked that there is a basic conflict of interest between the two departments, particularly when it comes to handling intercompany pricing transactions, especially with respect to imports and exports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="08062572000134"></a>Leaving that on one side, I have two questions for my noble friend. First, do the Government accept that their responsibilities relate not just to the custody of the data that they hold&#151;making sure that it does not leak&#151;but to the integrity of the data while it is in their custody, in other words, that it is not tampered with either maliciously or out of neglect? Secondly, can he assure us that he will come back to this House in no more than six months&#146; time to give us an update on the report?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="08062572000145"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 2, 8, 19 and 20. Before I get to the substance of our amendments, I restate that we share the Government&#146;s aim of raising the participation age for education or training to 18. It is a positive step and a worthy ambition. Our goal, like that of the Government, is to see more young people improve their life chances by participating as fully as they can, but we are not convinced that compulsion is the right way to achieve this. Throughout the course of the Bill we will ask the Government to think again.</p>

<a name="80625-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="08062572000146"></a>Our first amendment seeks to exclude certain persons from the operation of Part 1. Similar amendments have been tabled by the Liberal Democrats. As I have said, it is no secret that we are concerned about compulsion. The Government have looked at the problem and come up with the right solution, but gone about it the wrong way. The best way to achieve these aims is not to make it compulsory for 16 and 17 year-olds to participate in education and training. That debate will raise strong passions on both sides and we will deal with it fully in the group of amendments tabled on Clause 2. These amendments concern Clause 1, which is a paving clause, and substantially increases government control over 16 and 17 year-olds.</p>

<a name="80625-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="08062572000147"></a>If the Government are determined to press ahead with their plans&#151;I dearly hope that they can be persuaded otherwise&#151;we must deal with the issue in a realistic way. First, we must look at to whom this new law will apply. The Bill will place great demands on young people. It will require commitment, time and dedication from them. We must be wary, when we look at the problem of underachieving young adults and teenagers who have decided to drop out of education as soon as they can, of making the rash assumption that they are all alike. It would be a grave mistake to assume that all the young people who will be caught by this Bill are sitting idle, wasting their lives, ignoring opportunities and simply waiting to be given direction by an all-knowing state. We must recognise that, around the country, there are young people who fall into none of those categories because the circumstances of their lives are different from those which the Government seem to have anticipated.</p>

<a name="80625-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="08062572000148"></a>These amendments are an effort to recognise that there are young people with perfectly valid reasons for not wanting&#151;or, indeed, who are unable&#151;to be in education or training after the current statutory leaving age of 16. We have attempted to draw up several exemptions, so that these perfectly legitimate cases do not find themselves hounded by the authorities for failure to observe the compulsory duty in the Bill. Quite often these are unfortunate, even tragic, circumstances, where it would be appropriate to show some understanding and leniency. Those who are, for example, engaged in the full-time care of a relative, may well yearn for the opportunities which are to be created by this Bill, but it simply may not be feasible to expect them to oblige the Government. A desperately sick parent or sibling cannot be put on hold so that their young carer can rush to the designated course or class, however much he or she may want to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="08062572000149"></a>Similarly, there are parents with very young children. Sadly, some of the young people we are talking about could well have a child nearing the age of five. I would

Sadly, too many children are having children. When this happens, and the young girl in question makes the brave decision to keep and bring up her baby, we should do all we can to help and to ensure that, as far as possible, her education does not suffer. There is also a small child to take into consideration; its early years are precious. During our debates on Bills concerning children we have spent many hours discussing secure attachment and we must not ignore it now. If a young mother chooses to stay at home to look after her young child once she reaches the age of 16, we should welcome it. After all, she could be said to have a pretty much full-time job at home. Of course, once the child has reached school age the picture changes and I hope that such young girls will resume educational training for their general well-being and that of their child.</p>

<a name="80625-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="08062572000150"></a>However, one area where the objectives of the Bill might be satisfied for young girls with babies is through parenting classes. At a recent meeting of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Children to discuss the Bill, the noble Baroness, Lady Tunnicliffe, speaking on behalf of the excellent charity What About The Children?, suggested that this would be a great time to get young girls with babies involved in child development. Can the Minister say whether this would count towards the required training?</p>

<a name="80625-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="08062572000151"></a>For a young person who is seriously ill or who has a terminal illness, what purpose does the Minister think will be achieved by forcing such people into the schemes of the Bill? Why compel them to gain training or skills for a lifetime of work which, sadly, they may never be able to enjoy? What is to be gained by trapping these people into a system of compulsory education and then punishing them when, because of their personal circumstances, they are unable to comply? It may well be that they will choose to continue with education or training, but it should be their choice.</p>

<a name="80625-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="08062572000152"></a>Further amendments in the group, which apply to Clause 2, would ensure that the Secretary of State must make appropriate orders to specify the responsibilities and duties of those caring for relatives or their own children.</p>

<a name="80625-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="08062572000153"></a>I have also included those young people who are engaged in full-time voluntary work. Someone who is so engaged is already displaying a commendable approach to their own development and they should not be overlooked because they are not producing a quantifiable economic benefit. Voluntary work is extremely useful and beneficial and should be encouraged. People engaged in such work will undoubtedly pick up skills along the way, not least self-discipline and motivation.</p>

<a name="80625-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="08062572000154"></a>These are the categories of persons to whom Part 1 of the Bill should not apply if compulsion is to remain. We must legislate in a way which includes not only compassion but also common sense. I beg to move.</p>

I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 3, 5 and 6, which are in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Walmsley.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1452"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column 1452</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80625-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="08062572000156"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, mentioned, these amendments take us straight to the issue of compulsion, which is the central feature of the Bill. The preference on these Benches is that, rather than compulsion, there should be an entitlement to two years&#146; further education and training. This will be spelt out at some length when my noble friend Lady Walmsley addresses the next group of amendments.</p>

<a name="80625-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="08062572000157"></a>Nevertheless, at this point we should reflect on the extensive debate in the Commons on these issues. It is clear that, although we differ as to how this should be delivered, all parties agree, as the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, said, that it is in the country&#146;s interests that young people aged 17 and 18 should participate in education and training. The question is: what is the best way of securing this? The lengthy debates in the Commons clearly indicated that the Government believe that by 2013&#151;which is the year in which the first element of compulsion comes into force and young people will have to stay in education and training until they are 17&#151;90 per cent of young people will be staying voluntarily in school or working in a job that provides them with the requisite training as a result of the reforms that are currently going through in the 14 to 19 curriculum and through the new initiatives on apprenticeships.</p>

<a name="80625-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="08062572000158"></a>The key element to which this Bill is addressed is the 10 per cent, the NEET group who are not currently in education, employment or training. They are the hard core; many of these young people have dropped out of school long before the age of 16 and live in a shadow-world of odd jobs, drugs and petty crime. Many of them are illiterate or barely literate. They dropped out because they have not been able to keep up. Very frequently this is because they cannot read and write. Because they cannot read they do not understand properly and they find, particularly when they go into secondary school at the age of 11, that it is extremely difficult to cope with the curriculum.</p>

<a name="80625-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="08062572000159"></a>It is generally agreed that one of the reasons why we have such a low participation rate in this country as compared to all other advanced, industrialised countries, is that our secondary school curriculum does not motivate 50 per cent of the pupils. We are well aware of the reforms that the Government are making to that curriculum. We hope that they will be successful and that we shall see this natural increase in participation. But it is questionable whether compulsion is the right way to encourage this hard core of young people, who very frequently have dropped out of school at the age of 14 or 15.</p>

<a name="80625-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="08062572000160"></a>I turn to the group of amendments before us. There is an anomaly. Young people at 16 are now regarded as being old enough to go into the Army, pay taxes, get married, have sex and be parents. They are no longer tied to their parents&#146; apron strings. My party and, indeed, the Government are very keen that we should give these young people a chance to practise the citizenship lessons that they have been receiving at school and give them the right to vote. Is it right, therefore, that we do not give them a choice over what sort of education they have and when they take that education? Is the sledgehammer approach, as David Laws, our education spokesman in the other place, called it in his deliberations on the Bill, the correct one?</p>

<a name="80625-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08062572000161"></a>This set of amendments is exploring two things: first, the anomalies that arise and secondly, the fourth option. The amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, picks up on some of these anomalies. It addresses those with full-time caring responsibilities, those who are parents of children under five, those who are engaged in full-time voluntary work&#151;I will come back to that in a moment&#151;and those with an illness requiring significant medical attention or a terminal illness, and so forth.</p>

<a name="80625-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="08062572000162"></a>Amendment No. 3 concerns the issue of sport. Those who take their sport seriously are, by the age of 16, frequently spending more or less all their time in what might be called a sporting apprenticeship. If we are trying to train new champions for Wimbledon or to coach a generation who will bring us some gold medals in the Olympics, these super-athletes are going to have to spend a lot of time in sporting activities. Will they be excluded from the requirements of the Bill?</p>

<a name="80625-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08062572000163"></a>In Amendment No. 6, we have gone for a parent of a child under the age of one, rather than under the age of five, as the Conservatives have. We endorse the amendments tabled by the Conservatives in relation to both terminal illness and full-time caring arrangements.</p>

<a name="80625-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="08062572000164"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 5, which is concerned with what might be called the fourth option&#151;voluntary activities. Some extremely interesting sessions were held at the beginning of the Committee stage in the other place when a large number of organisations presented evidence to the Members. Among those organisations were Barnardo&#146;s, the Prince&#146;s Trust and Fairbridge, which deals particularly with the 10 per cent of young people in the NEET group. At Second Reading I quoted some of the recommendations made by these bodies in those Committee sessions.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80625-0005.htm"/>


<a name="80625-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="08062572000165"></a>We have to accept that these voluntary bodies are much more successful than schools or colleges at helping young people get back into employment and education. They stressed what a long-term exercise it is. This is where Amendment No. 5 comes in. It provides that if young people are engaged in voluntary work for more than 20 hours a week, which might well be under the auspices of one of these organisations, they should not be involved in the compulsory element. Amendment No. 5 puts forward a fourth option: there is a way forward that does not have to be within the education sector or training for accredited qualifications, an issue we shall pick up later. These are important issues and broadly speaking we support the amendment introduced by the Opposition.</p>

I wish to relate some personal experiences that underline the reasons for my support. Some years ago I was asked by a local education authority to run a course for young teenage mothers. In its wisdom, the authority provided a crèche for the children while the mothers attended the course. It did not lead to accredited qualifications of any kind, but I hope that it was helpful to them. Indeed, I have kept in touch with some of those delightful young women and they still

<a name="80625-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08062572000167"></a>I recall most vividly one young woman of only 17 who already had two children by different fathers. She lived in very unsatisfactory circumstances. Her mother had thrown her out and would have nothing more to do with her. She was grey-faced and looked about 90 rather than 17 when she said to me, &#147;I&#146;m not getting any sleep and I simply have no time to think. All I want is to look after my babies properly&#148;. She was very tearful as she said that. To tell that young woman that she had to sign up for some form of accredited qualification because she would be criminalised if she did not would go way beyond any kind of sensible thought or reason. Young people who are already caring for small children need help and guidance. If they are lucky enough to have access to something like the provision made by the local education authority I mentioned a moment ago, then of course they should take up some form of supported educational help&#151;but not, for goodness&#146; sake, studying for qualifications, writing examinations and taking practical tests. Those young women are vividly in my mind when I support strongly the concept that women with small children should not be forced into education leading to qualifications.</p>

<a name="80625-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08062572000168"></a>My second thought, when looking at the many good things here, concerns voluntary work. Last week a young man, now in his 20s, told me that at his parents&#146; insistence he stayed on at school for a term after he had finished his very mediocre GCSEs. He said to me, &#147;I was in deep depression. I hated education, my school and my teachers. I knew that I was not academic and I did not want anything to do with it. So I begged my parents to let me drop out&#148;. He did drop out of school. His parents had the good sense to send him along to the Community Service Volunteers. He signed up with them and worked for, I think, six months in a school for young deaf children. He was transformed. He loved the work and being with the young children. He showed me a collection of the cards they sent him when he was leaving, which said &#147;We love you&#148;, &#147;Please come back&#148; and so on. They are a treasured possession.</p>

<a name="80625-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08062572000169"></a>The point of the story is that voluntary work turned the young man around. If you had asked him to go back into formal education, he would have found it impossible and would have run away. The good end to the story is that, at the age of 24, having been very much helped and turned around by two long periods of voluntary work, one of them overseas, he decided to study for a degree.</p>

<a name="80625-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08062572000170"></a>A few categories of people should be allowed to leave education. They grow up at different rates and feel differently at different ages. Some 16 and 17 year-olds are simply not ready for formal education. They have other interests and concerns in life. If they can be helped through this period in ways not strictly leading to formal qualifications, it is my firm belief that the majority will come back later. I do not think we should be forcing such young people into an educational experience that to them is anathema.</p>

A number of these young people just need space. They have been in education from age five to 16. For one reason or another, they have had a hard time of it or it just has not suited them. They just need some room in their lives; they do not need to be beaten over the head for the next two years.</p>

<a name="80625-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="08062572000172"></a>Instead of rigidity, we need flexibility. Later in the amendments, we will come to some ideas on how that might be achieved through local authorities. Personalised learning should be offered, suited to the needs of each young person. That may mean postponing things for a while or going out in the world to get some experience and coming back later. It is not about shrugging off the obligation but perhaps postponing it. That is proposed in one of the amendments in this group and seems a good idea. Above all, there must be something directed at the needs of the person.</p>

<a name="80625-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="08062572000173"></a>To quote a fairly obvious example, the BBC website says that Sir Alan Sugar left school at 16 and started selling aerials from the back of a van. That would see him in jug if he tried that under this Bill, but it is what many people who are destined to be entrepreneurs need to do at that age. They need to get out. They have had enough; they need to use the talent that has been burning inside them, get out there and make something of themselves and of the world.</p>

<a name="80625-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="08062572000174"></a>The situation is common all over the world. I remember talking to the Minister of Education in Singapore, who said that their schools focused on the bottom 20 per cent because it included half of the entrepreneurs who would really make it and who would make great businesses. We have to make sure that those people are looked after. To keep these people in school for another two years doing something that they find pointless will not give them a constructive future. The same applies to all sorts of young people who are just not right for education at a particular moment, as my noble friend Lady Perry said, and who need to do something else constructive.</p>

<a name="80625-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08062572000175"></a>I hope that when we come to the amendments about what responsibilities local authorities can have, the Government will become more flexible in their approach. I hope that they are prepared to trust local authorities to take decisions, particularly about young people, that can never be taken through a centralised, rigid system as set out in the Bill. I hope that we will be allowed to make that improvement to this Bill.</p>

Everything that noble Lords have said about the different stages, not ages, of development, including the very moving story of the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, is extremely relevant, as is the full horror and dislike of formal education felt by some students who have been failed.

<a name="80625-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08062572000179"></a>The one thing I know about education is that one menu does not suit all, and we must have room for flexibility. I could tell the story of a young man of 16 who, on work experience, was the best the company had ever had. It wanted him to take an apprenticeship but, although he was absolutely fitted for it and would enjoy it, he would not take it because it meant compulsory attendance for half the time at an FE college, which he hated. We are therefore destroying an excellent opportunity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="08062572000180"></a>Therefore, while I warmly support what is intended for the vast majority, I think that there must be room for flexibility in the treatment of people for whom it is not at all right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="08062572000182"></a>I agree with my noble friend Lord Dearing that the principle of a firm approach to ensure that young people are in constructive activity as far as possible, to keep them out of trouble and to enable them to achieve their potential is right; but there must be the flexibility that we are discussing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="08062572000183"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Perry, and others spoke on the amendment concerned with teenage mothers having access to parenting programmes. It is so important not to inhibit these young women in their mothering. They may lack confidence when someone says, &#147;We know what&#146;s best for you. We&#146;ll look after your children through one means or another, perhaps through childcare, while you go and study&#148;. As far as possible, we should be encouraging them to engage with their children and to enjoy them. The child will then thrive and both mother and child will benefit from the positive relationship that they have with each other. That was a particularly important amendment to bring forward.</p>

<a name="80625-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="08062572000184"></a>Perhaps I am jumping the gun a little, but can the Minister comment on one scenario I can envisage in, for instance, a children&#146;s home? If a 16 or 17 year-old is saying, &#147;I don&#146;t want to do a course. I don&#146;t want to spend two days a week in training&#148;, it might strengthen the hand of residential childcare workers if they can say, &#147;You&#146;ll be acting against the law if you don&#146;t go to college just for two days a week&#148;. On the other hand, it may be that in the judgment of the residential childcare worker that young person is too depressed to benefit from such training, that they will seek to evade it in any way, or just simply that it is not right for them.

How much input will they have in the process of deciding whether a child is criminalised? I can see some benefit in strengthening a concerned carer&#146;s hand in encouraging a young person to do what is good for them. On the other hand, carers also need to be able to decide whether the provisions should not apply to a particular child. I hope that that is clear, and look forward to the reply.</p>

He cited a case where there was an obvious person to have that discretion, but in the Bill we are dealing with the whole 10 per cent of the relevant group of society, and there will be many different cases. We had the grey-faced teenage mother from my noble friend Lady Perry; we had the volcanic Sir Alan Sugar from my noble friend Lord Lucas; now we have the young person whom the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, described.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="08062572000186"></a>It seems to me that there is no discretion in the Bill except to allow people to break the law&#151;I am very, very glad to see the Minister shaking his head. I shall immediately sit down in anticipation of discovering where I am wrong.</p>

It is kind of him to greet my remarks with such eager anticipation; they are not always so regarded.</p>

<a name="80625-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08062572000188"></a>I welcome the fact that, in all parts of the Committee, there has been general support for the measures in the Bill to promote higher participation among 16 to 18 year-olds. The issue before us now is whether whole groups should be exempted from a requirement to participate. Our argument here is simple. While we believe that there should be elements of flexibility&#151;I will say more about those in a moment&#151;we also believe that the expectation and opportunity to participate in education and training should, in principle, apply to all young people and that, far from being kind and considerate to whole groups of young people by seeking to exclude them, the amendments would be the opposite. They would deny opportunity and expectation to some of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable young people. In fact, irreparable harm would be done to those young people&#146;s life skills and future social and economic success if we were to exclude them in the way proposed.</p>

<a name="80625-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="08062572000189"></a>That is not simply the view of the Government; it is the view of many reputable organisations that have made representations. In its representations on the Bill, Barnardo&#146;s says that it welcomes,</p>
<ul><a name="08062572000298"></a>&#147;the proposal to raise the age of participation in education or training to 18, which represents an important opportunity to improve provision for the many young people who leave school at 16 with few skills and poor long-term prospects. Young people from disadvantaged backgrounds are among the least likely to stay on, perpetuating the cycle of poverty from one generation to the next&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08062572000270"></a>On compulsion, Barnardo&#146;s says that,</p>

<p><a name="08062572000271"></a>the flexibility of provision to meet their needs is a vital requirement&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08062572000300"></a>&#147;then it is fair to expect them to participate&#151;if necessary, through some system of enforcement, including powers for local authorities to prosecute as a last resort&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08062572000190"></a>The Special Education Consortium takes the same view, saying that it,</p>
<ul><a name="08062572000301"></a>&#147;welcomes the proposal to extend to the age of eighteen the requirement to stay in education or training. ... The Consortium recognises that in order to draw disabled young people and young people with SEN into continuing education and training, compulsion may be needed&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08062572000272"></a>The Equality and Human Rights Commission says the same. It says that,</p>
<ul><a name="08062572000302"></a>&#147;the main focus and priority must be to ensure that there is flexible, varied and quality provision of education and training available and that young people, whatever their circumstances or situation, will receive the necessary support to enable them to participate&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08062572000273"></a>We, of course, endorse all that. However, it also states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="08062572000287"></a>&#147;The Commission recognises that a requirement to engage with additional education and training can only unlock potential if it adequately identifies and addresses the reasons for disengagement and underachievement. But we remain concerned that, without the principle of compulsion, the most disaffected young people will not engage and the success of the Bill will be limited&#148;.</p>
</ul><a name="time_12"></a>
<a name="80625-0005.htm_time1"></a><h5><a name="08062572000341"></a>5 pm</h5>

<a name="80625-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08062572000191"></a>That is also the position of the Government. The proposals in the Bill need to be seen in the context of what we are providing for, which is a flexible, one-day-a-week or 280-hours-over-a-year training requirement for those who are in work, and a 16-hour work-based learning requirement or education course for those who are not. This is on the basis of a considerable increase in provision for 16 to 18 year-olds in areas that, as the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, rightly said, have been underprovided for in the past, notably vocationally oriented courses delivered by schools and colleges&#151;hence, the new diplomas, which are starting this September, and the significant increase in apprenticeships, which will enhance the work-based training routes.</p>

<a name="80625-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="08062572000192"></a>I turn to the additional area of flexibility called for by the noble Lord, Lord Elton, and mentioned by other noble Lords in the debate. Decisions on enforcement in individual cases depend on the officer responsible for enforcement in a local authority having regard to Clause 39, under which they must be satisfied that there is not a reasonable excuse for the young person in question not to be participating in education or training. That is a crucial aspect of the Bill, too. It will deal with some of the cases within the whole cohort of 16 to 18 year-olds that are extreme and exceptional and to which noble Lords have referred.</p>

<a name="80625-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="08062572000193"></a>My honourable friend Jim Knight, the Minister for Schools and Learners, followed up extensive debates on this issue in the other place with a letter to David Laws, the Liberal Democrat spokesman on education and skills. The letter is dated 13 February 2008. Noble Lords may have seen it, but I shall circulate it to all Members of the Committee. It specifically sets out our view of how the Clause 39 requirements, which local authorities must implement where there is not a reasonable excuse, might work. The letter states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="08062572000288"></a>&#147;I do of course accept that there will be young people who temporarily or for a longer time, cannot in practice participate due to their individual circumstances&#148;.</p>
</ul>



<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1459"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column 1459</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="08062572000274"></a>He then gives examples of what this might mean in practice. He says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="08062572000289"></a>&#147;If a young person is homeless this could prevent them from participating in learning until they have a permanent residence and a more stable home life&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08062572000275"></a>I think that that addresses one of the main concerns of the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, about care leavers who may not have proper accommodation that enables them to lead a stable life. My honourable friend also referred to young people with,</p>
<ul><a name="08062572000303"></a>&#147;health problems, whether temporary illness, long term disability or ongoing mental health issues&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08062572000276"></a>That deals both with the point raised by the noble Earl and part of the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Perry. He goes on to highlight other cases:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="08062572000290"></a>&#147;Where a young person has addiction problems they may be unable to participate until they have successfully completed treatment for those problems ... When a young person has secured a place on a course but it does not start until the next month or the next term, they would have a reason for not participating in the meantime ... After giving birth&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08062572000277"></a>this responds directly to the points raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Perry&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08062572000304"></a>&#147;a young mother will need time to recover (for mothers of compulsory school age guidance sets out that the normal period of time is a maximum of 18 weeks) and would not be expected to participate until appropriate learning provision and access to suitable childcare had been arranged ... Where a young person has caring responsibilities, they may not be able to participate, or participate for as many hours as we would otherwise expect, until alternative care or learning provision that fits with those caring responsibilities is in place&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80625-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="08062572000194"></a>In the extreme and exceptional cases that we have discussed, Clause 39 gives the flexibility to local authorities&#151;and we would expect local authority officers to be assiduous in undertaking their responsibilities&#151;that has been sought in the Committee this afternoon.</p>

<a name="80625-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08062572000195"></a>I will say a few more words about the specific groups mentioned by the noble Baronesses, Lady Morris and Lady Sharp. The first group is young carers, who, as I completely accept, have onerous additional responsibilities. However, we see no general case for excluding young carer 16 to 18 year-olds from training or education, although there may be particular reasons in specific cases why it would be appropriate to do so. This position is supported by the Princess Royal Trust for Carers, which, when the Bill was undergoing its Commons Second Reading, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="08062572000291"></a>&#147;We do not believe that young carers should routinely be exempted from the requirement to attend education and training. We fail young carers when we give up on their education&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80625-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="08062572000196"></a>That is a highly reputable body that deals with young people in this position and we agree with it.</p>

<a name="80625-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08062572000197"></a>Of course, it is important that young people with caring responsibilities should receive the support that they need to participate. There will be flexible learning options available to them to help them to participate in a way that could be fitted around their responsibilities. We also provide a range of financial support to young people, including EMA and carer&#146;s allowance, both of which go to the young carers directly.</p>

<a name="80625-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="08062572000198"></a>Furthermore, the Government are committed to continuing to improve the provision and support available to young carers. Earlier this month, on 10 June, the Government published the national strategy for carers,  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1460"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column 1460</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>following a review of support for young carers. This sets out a range of additional provisions that we intend to make available to young carers, including support worth &#163;6.5 million up to 2011. That includes more than &#163;5 million to promote better prevention and a piloting of new, more effective models of support around the family and the person cared for; &#163;850,000 to ensure that schools and other universal services have the additional support that they need to identify problems early and to encourage young carers to come forward; and &#163;300,000 to embed best practice, ensuring that this feeds into and informs major new developments, such as targeted youth support and extended schools.</p>

<a name="80625-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="08062572000199"></a>In that context, we believe that the general requirements on young carers to undergo appropriate education or training are correct. However, they need to be seen&#151;I stress again&#151;in the context of the Clause 39 requirements that local authorities must have regard to when deciding whether there is a reasonable excuse for a young person not to participate.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80625-0006.htm"/>


<a name="80625-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08062572000200"></a>The second group is young parents. This issue, too, is covered by Amendment 6. We see no case for a blanket exclusion from educational training here. Teenage parents are 22 per cent more likely to be living in poverty at the age of 30 and much less likely to be employed than their peers. As a consequence, children born to teenage mothers have a 63 per cent greater risk of living in poverty compared to babies born to mothers in their 20s. Participation in education or training is a key factor in combating this risk for their children. Research also shows that young mothers who have previously been disengaged from learning are often motivated to take part in learning when they become pregnant, to help to ensure better outcomes for their babies. Thus, it is often important that they can start courses relatively soon after the baby is born. This is why we do not wish to exempt them from the duty to participate, provided that flexible provisions are in place. For example, in FE colleges, the courses should start at flexible dates during the year, to suit their requirements.</p>

<a name="80625-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08062572000201"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, asked whether parenting courses would count as appropriate training under the Bill. Yes, they would count under Clause 4 if they endured for sufficient hours and were accredited. Subject to those requirements, parenting courses would be eligible under the Bill.</p>

<a name="80625-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08062572000202"></a>The duty on young parents should also been seen in the context of our commitment to have a Sure Start children&#146;s centre in every community doing the kind of excellent work that the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, referred to in her own local authority experience. These Sure Start children&#146;s centres are intended to ensure that teenage parents can access a broad range of support in one place, including childcare, education and training, parenting support, and health-related information, advice and treatment. Information, advice and guidance will also be available to help young mothers, as other vulnerable groups, through Connexions and targeted youth-support services. In addition, a broad range of financial support is available to young parents to help with the cost of accessing education and training&#151;and, vitally, childcare&#151;to enable them to take advantage of these opportunities.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1461"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column 1461</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80625-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08062572000203"></a>The third group highlighted by the amendments is those doing voluntary work. We recognise and are at one with the noble Baronesses, Lady Morris and Lady Sharp, in recognising that volunteering can help young people to gain important skills and experience, contributing to their personal development in a way that is valued also by employers and higher education. We are encouraging more young people to get involved in voluntary work. Volunteering will be recognised as a valid part of fulfilling the duty to participate under the Bill in the same way as paid employment. Regulations under Clause 5 will provide for those who volunteer to be treated in the same way as those working under an employment contract. I can give the Committee that assurance.</p>

<a name="80625-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08062572000204"></a>We are therefore addressing a much narrower issue: whether those who engage in volunteering should continue their formal learning as well, on the same basis as those in paid employment. Under the Bill that will be the requirement. They must engage in a sufficient element of part-time training as part of their volunteering, in precisely the same way as a young person in work would do. This might be as part of their volunteering programme or it might mean undertaking a part-time course alongside that activity. Continuing in formal accredited learning will ensure that the skills that young volunteers have developed are formally recognised and that they gain further qualifications. That is important to help them to demonstrate to future employers what they have learnt and it will be crucial in helping them to find, keep and progress in work.</p>

<a name="80625-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08062572000205"></a>Fourthly, the amendments cover those suffering from illness. This will continue to be a legitimate reason for absence from learning, as it already is in relation to school attendance pre-16. I can give the Committee that assurance. We have also made it clear that the local authority will not be able to act if the young person has a reasonable excuse. As I set out, illness could well qualify as a reasonable excuse under Clause 39.</p>

<a name="80625-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="08062572000206"></a>I do not think that the noble Baroness spoke to Amendment No. 2, which refers to residence in England. Would she like me to reply to it now?</p>

<p><a name="st_91"></a>
<a name="08062572000207"></a><a name="80625-0006.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80625-0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08062572000443"></a>Baroness Morris of Bolton:</b> Yes, please.</p>

<a name="08062572000208"></a><a name="80625-0006.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80625-0006.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08062572000444"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> The amendment seeks to probe what we mean by residence for the purposes of obligation under the Bill. We will make regulations under Clause 53(2) to clarify this further. For the purposes of this debate, our intention is that the duty to participate will apply to all young people resident in England. This does not include people who are here for a day or on holiday or, for example, people who live in Scotland but work in England, but it does include people who have moved here indefinitely from another country. So, it is a reasonable interpretation of the word &#147;residence&#148;.</p>

<a name="80625-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="08062572000209"></a>Amendment No. 3, spoken to by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, would exempt individuals in full-time sports. We recognise the need for young athletes and sportspeople to be able to dedicate their time to their training. Therefore, where a young athlete or young sports man or woman is training full-time for a career in their sport, they will be treated like those who are  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1462"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column 1462</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>employed full-time and they will have to participate only in part-time, not full-time, accredited education or training. However, we believe that they should be required to participate in this part-time education and training not least because for most young people engaged in sports training, including those aspiring to the highest levels of success, as the noble Baroness mentioned, sport alone is unlikely to give them the skills that they need for future employment&#151;certainly, alas, not in the long term. We would like it to be the case that more are able to make a career out of it, but the number able to do so is very small.</p>

<a name="80625-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="08062572000210"></a>However, the requirement has purposely been framed flexibly so that part-time education or training could easily be arranged around an athlete&#146;s training programme and commitments. For example, it could be organised in blocks throughout the year to meet the hours requirement without it necessarily having to take the form of one precise day per week. In some cases, it may also be possible to accredit some elements of the training that a young person is undertaking towards a sports-related qualification. In the academic year 2006-07, 629 new students started on an advanced apprenticeship in sporting excellence. These advanced apprenticeships included places in athletics, cricket, golf, football, rugby, swimming and tennis. They are designed to enable young people to succeed both during and after their sporting careers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="08062572000211"></a>Amendment No. 8, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, provides for gap years. She did not specifically speak to this but I will reply anyway so that my remarks are on the record. We are in favour of gap years at 18&#151;many noble Lords probably have children who are engaged in them&#151;but we do not believe that we should be encouraging young people to leave education or training completely at the age of 16. Being NEET at 16 is universally associated with poor outcomes. Staying in learning post-16, in the flexible range of ways set out in the Bill, is hugely beneficial to young people. They are much more likely to gain further skills and qualifications to help them to progress in learning in the future, to find and keep employment and to earn more over their lifetime if they remain engaged at the age of 16.</p>

<a name="80625-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="08062572000212"></a>There would also be operational difficulties. It would be difficult to define a gap year for the purposes of the amendment. Does it simply relate to those taking a year off or to those judged to be doing something worth while? Who is to decide? Indeed, many parents are not convinced that what their own children do is sufficiently worth while in their gap year. If a public official had to make this judgment as well, goodness knows where we might be. I do not want to get involved in that level of detail. The noble Baroness was probing our intentions, which are that, while gap years may be perfectly appropriate at 18, a gap year that involves no engagement sufficient to satisfy the Bill in educational training would not be appropriate at the age of 16.</p>

<a name="80625-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08062572000213"></a>I believe that I have covered most of the issues raised earlier, as well as many that were not raised but were intended to be raised by the terms of the amendments.</p>

The noble Lord will know that my constant concern is about implementation rather than aspiration. Like the Government, I believe that children in the most difficult circumstances should have the best opportunities for education. In many cases, the provision that should be there now to give these young people support is simply not available. I hear the figures that the Minister gives in relation to funding. I have heard funding figures before, but on the ground local authorities are not always able to provide the services.</p>

<a name="80625-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08062572000215"></a>Therefore, I ask two questions. First, in order to ensure that the local authority takes reasonable steps to make the supportive provision outlined in the Bill, what kind of inspection and follow-up will there be? Secondly, how will that information be monitored at a central level and how will comparisons be made so that young people can see what they should be getting? Will there be any way in which they can appeal if they feel that they are being forced into compulsory education in difficult circumstances where the support services do not appear to be provided? I apologise for waiting until the end. I was not supporting the amendments but I am keen to see how this will be implemented.</p>

There is an elaborate appeal process set out in the Bill, which we will discuss later. All children&#146;s services departments are inspected by Ofsted and its reports are published. They will be inspected against their duties once the Bill is enacted. They are monitored centrally by my department. An aspect that we shall monitor particularly closely is their preparedness for making provision in a whole range of areas, not just direct provision in the commissioning of courses but the provision of information, advice and guidance, which is a crucial area for which they will take responsibility under the Bill once it is enacted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08062572000217"></a>Clause 39 requires that enforcement action is taken against young people only if they are failing without reasonable excuse to fulfil their duty to participate. Jim Knight&#146;s letter to David Laws highlights a particular instance that he believes constitutes a reasonable excuse. The letter states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="08062572000292"></a>&#147;If a particular learning difficulty has been identified and the right support to address it not yet secured or in place, it would be reasonable to expect that the young person could not begin their learning programme until that support was in place&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08062572000278"></a>I hope that that reinforces the point that I have sought to make throughout this debate, which is that, in extremis or where the local authority is itself negligent in its duties and is not making the necessary provision to ensure that a young person&#146;s needs can be met, that would constitute a reasonable excuse not to participate under Clause 39.</p>

Given the discretion that will be put into the hands of officials, it would be helpful if guidance were issued.</p>

<a name="80625-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08062572000219"></a>Secondly, on a number of occasions, the noble Lord has been asked whether such activities as volunteering or parenting courses would fulfil the requirement. He has said that those activities could be counted as part of the education element of the requirement as long as the young people involved participated in some form of education within them, but that the courses would need to be accredited. In the case of these somewhat out-of-the-ordinary courses which are not part of the accredited education system&#151;for example, parenting classes&#151;who will carry out the accreditation?</p>

<p><a name="st_96"></a>
<a name="08062572000220"></a><a name="80625-0006.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80625-0006.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08062572000448"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> The letter, which the noble Baroness has not yet had the opportunity to read, deals with the first issue. I shall quote its comments on guidance. There is almost nothing which my department expects local authorities to do on which it does not issue elaborate guidance, and we do not intend this matter to be an exception. The letter states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="08062572000293"></a>&#147;We will issue detailed guidance to local authorities on how to interpret the concept, and on how to exercise appropriately their duties in relation to appropriate support and powers in relation to enforcement action. The guidance will reflect the interpretation of reasonable excuse set out in this letter. We are keen to work with local authorities, voluntary sector organisations, Targeted Support services and other interested parties in developing that guidance. An element of local discretion will remain extremely important however, since ultimately the interpretation of what a reasonable excuse is depends on what would be reasonable in the circumstances&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08062572000279"></a>I hope that that deals with the noble Baroness&#146;s first question.</p>

<a name="80625-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08062572000221"></a>The issue of accreditation and what constitutes appropriate courses will be subject to the normal accreditation procedures. Rather than seek to set those out exhaustively now, I shall write to the noble Baroness because the same process does not apply in each area. For example, I have no doubt that somewhat different arrangements may apply to sport from those in other areas. However, there is great flexibility here. Just in this debate we have referred to courses with a sporting content which could count and to family learning and parenting courses. There is a great desire to ensure that appropriate learning relevant to the individual in question is encompassed within the duty under the Bill. However, there needs to be a minimum time and a minimum accreditation requirement; otherwise, anything could count and, in many cases, nothing will happen.</p>

Accreditation is not a simple affair, as I am sure he knows, and is further complicated because whereas the Open College Network may accredit particular programmes, the Learning and Skills Council will then refuse to recognise that accreditation. It is key, particularly when one is looking at the funding streams that will be available to institutions offering that education, to know what accredited means and that it also carries the implied promise that such courses will be funded.</p>

I apologise for not speaking to Amendment No. 2 or on gap years. As the Minister rightly said, they were probing amendments. Something is always missed out when we are juggling with groupings in Bills in Committee. This has been a good debate. I am sorry that I omitted to support the Liberal Democrats&#146; amendment on sport. As a sporting fanatic who believes passionately in the importance of sport in the acquisition of lifelong skills, I wholeheartedly support their amendment and I look forward to receiving the letter from the Minister.</p>

<a name="80625-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08062572000225"></a>It goes to the heart of volunteering as well. It is not enough to say, &#147;We value this, but it is not enough&#148;. I look forward to receiving that letter. My noble friend Lady Perry&#146;s moving account of a young mother of 17 with two children having to comply with the duty in the Bill is, as she says, beyond any kind of reason or sense. The neat category is not a static one: young people move in and out of it. As my noble friends Lady Perry, Lord Lucas and the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, said, many of those people need a space: they need to get away from something that has formality and often they will return to it, sometimes within a few months; sometimes within a few years.</p>

<a name="80625-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08062572000226"></a>My noble friend Lord Lucas&#146;s story of Singapore reminds me of a question that was once asked of a former abbot of Ampleforth. He was asked what happened to his boys who failed. He answered, &#147;They employ my scholars&#148;. There is a great deal for people who eventually find their niche in life, but sometimes it takes them some time. I assure the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, that I was so engrossed in my notes that I had not noticed that he was not in his place at the beginning. When I looked up for reassurance on secure attachment, he was there as he always is. I was very interested in what he had to say and look forward to the Minister&#146;s response on those areas of concern.</p>

<a name="80625-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08062572000227"></a>If this element of the Bill has to stay, I can draw some comfort from the Minister&#146;s response on the flexibility of needs and his explanation of Clause 39. Given that the Government have chosen to go down the path of compulsion, it is not surprising that they say that that should in principle apply to all young people and there will not be opt outs for certain groups of people.</p>

<a name="80625-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08062572000228"></a>The Minister prays in aid some august bodies. We have spoken to many of them in the past few weeks. The Government are kidding themselves if they believe that those organisations do not have serious concerns. As the Minister himself said, there are some big ifs in what will be there on offer. Given the long list of possible exemptions that was read out, I shall read carefully in <I>Hansard </I>what was said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08062572000229"></a>However, one question sprang to mind when the Minister talked about young mothers. Why are working mothers given a year off work by statute, while young girls are to be given only 18 weeks? That does not seem right; working mothers are given a year off because it is deemed to be important for them to be with their babies for that first year of life. I seriously hope that the Government will take this away and look at it again. For now, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="08062572000294"></a> Clause 1, page 1, line 10, at end insert &#147;, and</p>
</ul>( ) has not written to the relevant local authority to request that their education and training entitlement under section 2 should be delayed until a specified future date.&#148;
<a name="80625-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08062572000233"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendment No. 10 in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Sharp of Guildford. Both amendments would give a young person a right to postpone their entitlement to free education and training up to level 3 until some time in the future&#151;certainly beyond the age of 25, if that suits them. For that reason, I would expect the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, and the noble Baroness, Lady Howe of Idlicote, to support me, since that is exactly what they are asking for in Amendment No. 210.</p>

<a name="80625-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="08062572000234"></a>There may be many reasons why a young person might want to postpone this entitlement, including the previous reason referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris. I agree with her about the iniquity of a working mother having a year to bond with her child, while a young girl may have only 18 weeks. In the previous debate, we heard many reasons why a young person might want to postpone their entitlement. The noble Baroness, Lady Perry of Southwark, gave a perfect example in which not only did postponement not do any harm, it did a whole lot of good. I hope that the House will take that into consideration when considering these amendments.</p>

<a name="80625-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08062572000235"></a>Young people may want to take a gap year at 16 rather than at the usual age of 18; they may have caring responsibilities, or they may be reaching a crucial stage in a sporting career or other career, such as acting. I do not think that it is quite as easy as the Minister suggested to fit in education and training alongside a career in sport or, particularly, acting. For example, it would not have been terribly easy for the young people who took part in the filming of the &#147;Harry Potter&#148; series to fit in their education alongside a heavy filming schedule. Yet they would have been held back tremendously if they had not been able to postpone their education.</p>

<a name="80625-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08062572000236"></a>The fact that young people may want to postpone it does not mean that they do not want to do it at all; it just means that it suits their life circumstances to do it later. Surely, if a young person chooses when to take his entitlement, he is more likely to apply himself to it. I hope that these amendments make it clear that we on these Benches far from object to giving people the right to progress their education; we simply want them to succeed. Some control of the decisions, not just

Surly, resentful young people do not learn very well. Young people who are worried about those they care for will not learn very well. Young people who would rather pursue a precocious sporting or acting career will not learn very well. It is better to let them do it later than allow them to fail.</p>

<a name="80625-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08062572000237"></a>I have to say to the Minister that I am not convinced that every local government official in the country will make the right decisions as to whether an excuse put forward for non-participation for the time being is an adequate excuse within the meaning of the Bill. We are very keen on the entitlement to level 3 education and training, but we would prefer it to be a lifetime entitlement, like the entitlement to level 2 and basic skills. Forcing people to take education and training at 16 smacks of fiddling the numbers. We heartily applaud the entitlements to a diploma course or an apprenticeship, if qualified, by 2013. However, as your Lordships will hear from my noble friend Lady Sharp, these things and others need to be in place before compulsion is even considered.</p>

<a name="80625-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="08062572000238"></a>All the measures in the Government&#146;s document, <I>Raising Expectations</I>, supporting all young people to participate until 18, will be to no avail if the time is not right. When I was in business, I learnt that it was not enough to make the right decisions; they had to be timely. The right decision at the wrong time is the wrong decision. So it is in education. The two amendments are about one element of compulsion: timing. Perhaps I should say a little more about the principles that underpin our objection to compulsion. It is not because we do not want young people to stay in training until they are 18, but because we should persuade them that it is in their interest to do so, rather than force them. I say that for two reasons. First, it is wrong to put the duty on the child, with civil and criminal penalties if the child does not comply. Secondly, it will not be effective.</p>

<a name="80625-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08062572000239"></a>Let us take the first point in more detail. Section 7 of the Education Act 1996 sets out the duties of parents to ensure that their children go to school until they are 16. The Bill shifts the duty on to the child when they reach 16. I recognise the Government&#146;s good intentions; gaining qualifications is good for the child's life chances and good for the economy and society as a whole. I welcome all measures that encourage providers to provide sufficient training places of a suitable quality, but I fundamentally oppose the creation of a duty on a child.</p>

<a name="80625-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08062572000240"></a>Education is enshrined as a right in human rights legislation, including Article 29 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and Article 13 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. We in the UK are party to those international agreements, which require states to take positive measures to &#147;enable and assist&#148; individuals and communities to enjoy that right. The only reference to compulsion relates to access, not compulsory participation.</p>

<a name="80625-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08062572000241"></a>Article 3 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child requires the child's best interests to be paramount. The Minister may suggest to me in his reply that it is in the child&#146;s best interests to stay in education until 18, and of course I would agree, but Article 12 gives the child the right to express his views  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1468"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column 1468</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in matters that affect him and states that his views must be given due weight. Anyone who has ever met a 16-year-old knows that they are perfectly capable of expressing their views about things that affect them. Thus their decision, if it is so, not to participate should be respected. It should not be superseded by some local government enforcement officer who chooses to decide whether the child&#146;s reasons for not participating are reasonable.</p>

<a name="80625-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08062572000242"></a>According to the Bill, it is a serious matter not to participate. The young person will receive an attendance notice, failure to comply with which will be a criminal offence. It is no good the Government fobbing us off with claims that the offence will not be revealed in a CRB check and would be on the record for only two and a half years. The position regarding record keeping relating to non-recordable offences such as this is far from clear. They are kept on local police records and there is no guidance about how long they should be kept. Will the Government issue such guidance? In any case, they would be revealed by an enhanced CRB check, and they would have to be revealed in applications for employment or insurance and an application for a visa to enter the United States or other countries. To a visa application officer in a foreign country, an offence is an offence. They cannot be expected to understand the nature of this offence.</p>

<a name="80625-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="08062572000243"></a>The compulsion element is like taking a child to a party and saying to him, &#147;Now you sit down there and you will enjoy yourself&#148;. Nothing could be better designed to ensure that he had a terrible time. This is yet another trap into which the most alienated children can fall and become entangled with the law. We all know that that is rarely a positive experience. It will disproportionately affect the most vulnerable and needy and will certainly not guarantee educational success.</p>

<a name="80625-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="08062572000244"></a>Before I end, I take the Minister up on something that he said in the previous debate. He seems to believe that exemption is the same thing as exclusion. It is not. Just because a young person may be exempted, if they so wish, does not prevent or exclude them from taking part in education between the ages of 16 and 18, if they so wish and have suitable support. The crucial words are &#147;if they so wish&#148;. It should be for the authorities to provide courses and support, and to remove barriers, but it should be for the young citizen to decide if it is right for him at that particular moment. I beg to move.</p>

We thought that compulsion would be dealt with in the next group. With the leave of the Committee, I will speak to my amendments that start with Amendment No. 7. These all deal with the issue of compulsion. Amendment No. 7 would make it a condition that the young person must agree to Part 1 applying before it applies to him. We and the Liberal Democrats have also tabled amendments to remove the duty to participate from the person and, instead, to create an entitlement, which they may choose to take up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08062572000246"></a>With these amendments, we come to the crux of this Bill. It should come as no surprise that a number of overlapping amendments are tabled to deal with this issue. What they have in common&#151;and what we have in common with the Liberal Democrats and concerned groups outside this House&#151;is the feeling that the Government need to think carefully about the full ramifications of compulsion. It is incumbent on the Government to proceed with caution. We feel strongly that the Government have taken the wrong approach. We should not criminalise those young people who have dropped out of the education system. Instead, we should ask why they have dropped out. It is not simply to spite the authorities, or because there is not yet a law in place which forbids them from leaving. We have to look at young people&#146;s reasons for dropping out of education. It is because they are disaffected with the system and do not see that it has anything further to offer them. It is a sad indictment of those precious years, which should be exciting and fulfilling. Until we can change that, the Bill is simply going to run into trouble.</p>

<a name="80625-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="08062572000247"></a>What is to be gained by forcing teenagers to stay in a system that has already failed them by the time they are 16? In many other respects they are treated as autonomous adults; for example, in the Armed Forces and behind the wheel of a car. Some are married. Unless we sort out the underlying problems, these 16 and 17 year-olds will be sent back into education or training against their will. The Government&#146;s own consultation of young people, <I>Raising </I><I>Expectations</I>, the DCSF&#146;s 2007 consultation report,<I></I>says on page 4 that a plurality of young people&#151;47 per cent&#151;were against the duty. Thirty-six per cent were in agreement and 17 per cent were unsure. In many cases, that means that they will ignore the duty that has been imposed. Therefore, they will be liable to sanctions and could end up with a criminal record. Before long, this Bill, which we are responsible for scrutinising and revising, will be regarded less as an education and skills Bill and more as a criminal justice Bill.</p>

<a name="80625-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08062572000248"></a>The Government have told us that this is the option of last resort and that it will be seldom-used, but we feel that it will be used and will have a devastating effect on those for whom we ought to do most. A criminal record can be a career-wrecking step and that is not where any of us wants to head. We ought not to criminalise those who have been let down by the education system in their early years. Alison Wolf said in a recent paper that one of the best-established findings in educational research is that children who are doing poorly when they leave primary education almost never catch up.</p>

<a name="80625-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08062572000249"></a>The compulsion element focuses on the wrong place and that is our fundamental problem with it. The Bill, as it stands, would place the onus on the young person to participate. If he or she fails to do so, punishment will follow. The focus of our attention should be what the state and the education system are getting wrong in the years before young people reach the current school-leaving age. If 11 year-olds are leaving primary education with less than basic literacy and numeracy, and if they are failing to catch up by the ages of 14 or 16, why are we surprised that they no longer want to

Why persist with something they cannot do properly, do not enjoy and does not seem to lead them anywhere? At Second Reading I raised the point that if schools are having trouble keeping under-16s in regular attendance, then what are we to expect the results to be for older teenagers. It is all very well threatening to strong arm young people into participating, but is there really much point if mere participation does not achieve very much?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08062572000250"></a>Through the amendments, we wish to find out from the Minister whether compulsion will truly achieve the objectives of increasing the number of 16 and 17 year-olds in education or training, an objective which, as I have said, we share. We fear that the compulsion element will simply create a whole new series of problems without solving any of the underlying ones and will therefore do nothing to improve learning and skills.</p>

<a name="80625-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08062572000251"></a>These amendments would, at a stroke, remove one of the biggest obstacles to wide-ranging support for the Bill, which, as I have said, contains much that is worth supporting. We could turn the Bill into an opportunity ready to be grabbed&#151;a declaration of entitlement for young people to engage in education and training&#151;and we could turn our attention to working out the best possible methods to enable them to do so. That is the reasoning behind removing the duty and inserting a right or entitlement. We fear that compulsion will engender resentment and will be flouted. By turning it into an entitlement we are instead opening up an opportunity. Instead of telling young people what they must do&#151;which is not always the most successful route to follow with young people&#151;we would be showing them what they can do.</p>

<a name="80625-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08062572000252"></a>The Government may say that the current system already is one of entitlement where, under the September guarantee, the LSC has a duty to liaise with schools and course providers to ensure that, come September, any young person who wants it can have a place on a course. We are told that this has an effect on participation rates. It is encouraging, but the system has not been used to its full potential. The framework of support established by the Bill ought to be used to get the maximum effect from the entitlement system. It seems a good idea that we should try to maximise the efficiency of a system based on choice and freedom to participate before we turn to a system of compulsion.</p>

<a name="80625-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08062572000253"></a>So we will be using the Bill as a tool to enable all those opportunities to happen and as a chance to set out the structural changes, the allocation of funds and the commitment of local authorities, education authorities and others to enable young people to reach their potential without having to resort to criminal sanctions.</p>

It is immensely important not to introduce the element of education as something which is almost a punishment; something which you have got to do whether you want to or not. Education for young people, as opposed to children, should be something that they do voluntarily with joy, pride and pleasure.</p>

<a name="80625-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="08062572000255"></a>I have spent a great part of my life working with mature students, people who come into higher education at the age of anything from 23 or 24 to 50 or even more. Almost without exception, these people talk about the reasons why they ceased to engage in education at the end of compulsory schooling. They talk about being slow to grow up; about the allure and excitement of adventure; about wanting to go travelling; about falling in love and deciding that they would rather get married or live together, or whatever they decided to do. They talk about a host of reasons. They talk about wanting to earn some money, being independent and showing that they were grown up.</p>

<a name="80625-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="08062572000256"></a>This underlines the point, which has been made several times already in our discussions on the Bill, that young people grow up at different ages. Some people are ready to go on the tramlines&#151;they stay on in school until the age of 18 or 19, go straight to university and go on to take a PhD&#151;and many thousands successfully do that. But many other thousands do not want to do that and, for them, carrots work better than sticks. I have commended the Government many times on the carrots that they have offered so far. Offering some finance to young people to stay on in education is a brilliant idea which has worked very well. Introducing alternative curricula through the diplomas is also a brilliant idea&#151;I hope that it will work well and keep more young people in. However, I beg the Government to think twice about the element of compulsion when, for so many young people, not just a tiny minority, it is simply the wrong time, the wrong age and the wrong kind of opportunity.</p>

<p><a name="st_103"></a>
<a name="08062572000257"></a><a name="80625-0007.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80625-0007.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08062572000455"></a>Lord Elton:</b> I remind the Minister that we already have compulsion up to the age of 16 and that the Bill moves the compulsion from the parent to the child. Our compulsory system has produced a very large number of truants who have escaped the system. It has not worked&#151;it has resulted in their coming out of education. These young people will compose a large proportion of the group to which this Bill is addressed. I am therefore not encouraged to think that compulsion will have more effect on those in the 16 to 18 age bracket than it has on the five to 16 age bracket.</p>

<a name="80625-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08062572000258"></a>In my experience of teaching in a variety of secondary schools, I have discovered that the offer of friendship and support works for children much more than the threat of punishment. A Bill that puts the authority delivering education into the position of someone with the power to punish immediately puts that person in the wrong relationship with the pupil. The Bill separates the employer and educator from the local authority, so it may be remediable, but I so sympathise with what my noble friend Lady Perry said about the age at which people mature. We have had examples already quoted of people who flee the system and then come back with enthusiasm when they have matured beyond the age of 18. The Bill does not seem to leave any scope for that rate of maturity. These may be very valuable members of society and great contributors to our economy. A system which does not allow postponement of either an entitlement or a duty&#151;on whichever we come down&#151;seems to be flawed in a very important respect.</p>

This is an excellent Bill in terms of its aspirations and the sort of society we could become. However, the noble Baroness was right in saying that the crux of the matter is whether there should be compulsion or entitlement. My noble friend the Minister is aware that I have some concerns that I should like to explore here and I look forward to hearing his response.</p>

<a name="80625-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08062572000260"></a>Placing in the Bill exemptions to compulsion is the wrong way to go. If we introduce a narrative which says that in certain circumstances you do not have to be educated, we are almost saying to teachers and educators that in certain circumstances you do not have to educate certain groups of children. Whether it is because they are in custody, are pregnant, or are carers, I do not like that list which exempts certain groups within a Bill making education compulsory. If education is going to be compulsory, we must have an education system which turns its mind to meeting the needs of every child and every young person, no matter what their circumstances.</p>

<a name="80625-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="08062572000261"></a>My concerns are a little different. I have three points to put to my noble friend the Minister. Those of us who have been teachers for any length of time will know that the nature of educating 16 to 18 year-olds is different because it is optional. Talk to any teacher and he or she will say that the attraction of taking a sixth form class is, to put it bluntly, because the kids have chosen to be there. One of the great changes in further education came about when the old YOP kids were brought in and it became compulsory. I should like the Minister to reflect on the nature of 16 to 18 education when it becomes compulsory. It is quite a significant point.</p>

<a name="80625-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08062572000262"></a>I want to relate one story about a sixth form teacher who said to me that the nature of teaching AS level today is different from what it used to be because more children feel that they have to be there. Schools, colleges and workplaces where attendance from 16 to 18 is compulsory takes away from what almost might be described as a young person&#146;s university. If young people are there by choice, it invites a different teaching style from compulsory education. That has huge implications for the organisation of 16 to 18 education.</p>

<a name="80625-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="08062572000263"></a>My second point is that the years from 16 to 18 form a bridge between childhood and adulthood. At 16 there are hardly any legal entitlements to adulthood, but by 18 you have them all. Between 16 and 18, those entitlements come along in dribs and drabs. The Bill causes me a bit of a problem in two respects: first, it makes the decision that the responsibility for education between 16 and 18 lies with the young person. The responsibility to be educated moves from adults to young people aged 16. The Bill gives a clear message that at the age of 16 you take charge of your own education. You make the decisions, and if you make the wrong ones and go against the law, you carry the consequences. In terms of choosing whether to be educated, the Bill makes it clear that the move from childhood to adulthood takes place at 16, not at 17 or 18. The problem is that that rests uneasily with compulsory education. We do not have compulsory work, for heaven&#146;s sake. There are implications if you do not go to work, and rightly so, but we do not impose compulsory  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1473"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column 1473</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>activity in any sense. Can my noble friend explore further the fact that the decision about education moves to a child at the age of 16 but the state makes it compulsory to take on an activity?</p>

<a name="80625-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08062572000264"></a>Thirdly, my main objection and concern is this: I see the benefit of the Bill in making education from 16 to 18 compulsory only if it creates a commitment to a lifetime of learning and relearning, skilling and upskilling. I am not interested in compulsion from 16 to 18 if no one goes on learning afterwards. It has to keep people in the system. Does my noble friend not think there is a risk that compulsion at 16 to 18 could turn people off? I taught back in the 1970s when life was a lot different, but I see some elements of that system of education coming back, albeit in another form. My first headmaster was a wise person who would say, &#147;What we should do is make them all leave school at 13 and get them back at 14. Those children would come back wholly committed to learning and we would do better with them&#148;. He did not mean it as a serious suggestion, but there is a lot of truth in what he said. At some point in a young person&#146;s life, a gap in education can commit them to a lifetime of learning. I worry that the compulsory element might mean a lifetime of never wanting to learn again.</p>

<a name="80625-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08062572000265"></a>As I said in my speech at Second Reading, I am waiting to be persuaded because in every other circumstance the work of the Government and that led by my noble friend is absolutely excellent and can get us to a wondrous place. I hope that in his response my noble friend can spend a few minutes exploring these issues.</p>

I feel that large categories of young people are generalised although they are the individuals who need real opportunities. That was the point of my question after the Minister&#146;s response. Many young people, when given the right support, like the young mother mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, might well benefit from education, but the support has to be carefully constructed and put in place at the right time.</p>

<a name="80625-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08062587000002"></a>From a long career of working with severely disaffected families, I know that a young person does not necessarily desire to be in the position they are in and that the whole family has led them to that point. I find it extremely difficult, therefore, that a 16 year-old who has been given very little opportunity fails to go further in education because of difficulties in their family. As I said at one of our consultations with officials, I feel that this is somehow a white middle-class issue. I say that because it is often young people from a steady background, from whatever culture, who have the opportunity to go into further education. That is why I am very keen to see support services developed before we introduce any compulsion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08062587000003"></a>I have a problem to do with exclusions. I ask the Minister what will happen to those young people whom the noble Lord, Lord Elton, was probably referring to: those excluded from school because of

Many of the young men and, increasingly, young women I know will find techniques to ensure that they get excluded if they are compelled to attend school. That will create some difficult problems to do with the criminalisation of young people. How will we tackle a situation where we decide that young people should not be in school because of their behaviour but where they are to be criminalised if they are not in school? There are real dilemmas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="08062587000004"></a>I come from a pretty tough background. I am immensely grateful that I had to go to school, even though I travelled for an hour a day to get to a decent one. I would like to make sure that every young person has that opportunity. Again, therefore, I would like to be sure that structures are in place to give every young mother not only support and day care but emotional support&#151;the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, often talks about this&#151;to separate out in her mind what she really wants from the day-to-day pressure that she faces. We could then look at whether compulsion is an option. At the moment I feel that there are too many difficulties to move in that direction.</p>

I am glad to be. I would like to distinguish my remarks on Amendments Nos. 4 and 7 from those on Amendment No. 10. On Amendments Nos. 4 and 7, which I had not expected to speak on, I am already parti pris in supporting the Bill, although I very much want us to avoid criminal sanctions. I wrote a long article, by my standards, back in November or December about the problems of motivating young people who, at 14, had had quite enough to carry on learning until 16. I took the perspective of the teacher and the head teacher. They have enough problems already, I thought. However, I was influenced by the fact that we are moving towards a radically different option at 14, which is fundamental to this issue: giving certain young people, as a matter of choice, an opportunity to engage in a different form of learning, such as the young apprenticeship, which has been extensively piloted from the age of 14 and had an excellent Ofsted report recently, and the vocational diplomas.</p>

<a name="80625-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="08062587000006"></a>A lot of work needs to be done on the vocational diplomas. I suspect that those who composed the curriculum had in mind what today&#146;s comprehensive schools and teachers could offer in practice rather than what was desirable. That led me to start proposing, as I have continued to do since, the option of going at 14 to a technical college that is especially equipped to offer a hands-on approach to learning by doing, rather than by sitting, reading and listening. I believe that this is fundamental.</p>

<a name="80625-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="08062587000007"></a>When I was the chairman of the body concerned with the national curriculum, the greatest personal battle that I fought was to introduce the GNVQ as an option at 14. That was about learning in a group by finding out, rather than sitting and listening. Its motivational effect was profound. I regretted the fact that, to increase its standard, it was changed to become the applied GCSE. The academic community grabbed it and changed its character and the salt was lost. My willingness to support the Government's basic principle on compulsion, subject to Clause 39 being liberally

<a name="80625-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="08062587000008"></a>I come to the challenge from the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. I cannot do other than support Amendment No. 10. In doing so, I am not forgoing my right to speak on Amendment No. 210&#151;just before we rise for the summer, no doubt. I think I see the logic behind what the noble Baroness was saying. It is irrational to say that you may have a level 3 learning experience up to 18 as a matter of right, but you may not have it the following week. Surely, if there is a right to have education up to level 3, you should have the right to take it when you judge that it is right for you. I cannot see the logic in denying it.</p>

<a name="80625-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08062587000009"></a>The alternative argument is the one I offered at Second Reading: it is not a right of the individual but a national imperative. We have all backed the realisation, so strongly expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Leitch, that we need radically to increase the number of pupils achieving level 4. He said, and the Government agreed, that we should aim for at least 40 per cent at that level by 2020. I have said since that the Germans and the Americans are there already, and it is not enough: we should aim for 45 per cent. Furthermore, the noble Lord, Lord Leitch, identified that even to achieve 40 per cent we need to engage in education again those who have already left. In Germany, where 70 per cent achieve level 3 by their early 30s, there is plenty of power to lift the figure of 40 per cent at level 4 to the kind of figure that I am talking about. I was arguing that if we are serious about the Leitch agenda, as the Government are, we need to recognise that it will be achieved only by investing in people who have left education. You cannot get high numbers at level 4 unless you have a base at level 3. Therefore, we must do all that we can to encourage people who have left education to complete level 3 and then move to level 4.</p>

<a name="80625-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="08062587000010"></a>A further argument was adduced yesterday at a meeting at which Chris Humphrey spoke. Some of us may have been there. He pointed out that the demographics of the next decade, with declining numbers of young people, make it all the more important to invest in people who have left school. Only by investing in people&#146;s education and skills capital can we increase productivity to the levels of our competitors, because we are lacking in that regard. For two reasons, then, I support the amendments from the noble Baroness, but I reserve my right to have another go on another day as the department, in our discussion this morning, undertook to give me guidance on the realities of what the noble Baroness and I would like to see.</p>

I am happy to support the amendment from the noble Baroness and have been absolutely fascinated by all the issues raised during this discussion. We all know that it is in the Government&#146;s interest, in today&#146;s world, to see that we upskill at any stage in our lives.

I wished to earn some money&#151;in fact, I needed to do so at that stage&#151;and it was not until a lot later that I began to think of giving myself some advice, as the Equal Opportunities Commission was endlessly encouraging women who had not achieved to go back to school. It was keen on the Open University and the opportunities it created to take up those challenges. Yet I was equally fascinated by the point from the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Yardley. There is a lot to be said for what her headmaster said to her. If you have decided what you want and need to do, if you have suddenly seen the light of how it benefits you&#151;you are probably thinking more about yourself than the well being of the country&#151;the motivation is very important.</p>

For me the whole attraction, which started some time before this Bill, is lifelong learning, which we should be encouraging all the way. I will pre-empt the last day of this debate: if it suited me and I had entitlement and no money, I would like to take a level 3 course in my full retirement. Frankly, that should be my right. I very much support the amendment.</p>

After all, we have more children in criminal custody than several of our European neighbours put together, and that is a great indictment of our provision and support for vulnerable families and children. I also see the other side: the Devil makes work for idle hands. Sixteen and 17 year-olds who are not in school or training are susceptible to joining gangs or getting involved in other activity. I remember that when Louise Casey was charged to reduce the number of rough sleepers on the streets, one strong component of her policy was to find them what she called &#147;constructive activity&#148;. She felt it imperative to get them to do something useful and constructive. It is, then, a difficult question.</p>

A special person is needed. I hope that the Minister can give some detail. It should probably not be necessary to go right up the hierarchy of a local authority before a decision can be made.

I know that the Minister is working hard on many initiatives in that area, but while we have had so much legislation and so many new policies&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, might testify as much&#151;it really comes to nothing without the people on the ground to deliver it or the framework to support that delivery.</p>

<a name="80625-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08062587000017"></a>I would imagine that, in this case, there needs to be excellent communication between those working with vulnerable young people&#151;youth workers, social workers, foster carers and residential childcare staff&#151;and the local authority. While we all talk about multidisciplinary and partnership working, so often in the past it has been difficult for communication to take place where there is no parity of status and where that low-status work sometimes attracts people who feel they can really do nothing else&#151;although there are also amazing people doing it in difficult circumstances. I look forward, then, to the Minister&#146;s reassurances on these matters.</p>

First, on the point made by my noble friend Lady Perry of Southwark and the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Yardley, there are many people for whom a year out&#151;a year&#146;s peace while not in education&#151;is an immense motivation and opportunity to set themselves right. We should not deny young people that.</p>

<a name="80625-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08062586000019"></a>Secondly, the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, drew attention to the consequences of giving a child a criminal record. We should not take these things lightly. I tried, once, to persuade the then DCSF to take on as an employee a young man who had a criminal conviction. It said yes, but when it was realised higher up in the hierarchy that the man had a criminal conviction, the department took a policy decision not to employ ex-offenders. The department really should understand that many employers react in that way, particularly those interested in educated people, and that to give someone a criminal record as part of their education is to deny the benefits of that education then and in the future. It is not the way to go.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08062586000020"></a>Two dialogues are in fact going on, because the Bill does not come into effect until 2013. One, on these Benches but involving the Cross Benches, is: what will we do with the Bill after the next election, when, all being well, we find ourselves having more influence over things, one way or another? It has been very constructive and enjoyable to listen to these Benches in front of and beside me on how we would take it&#151;and I hope that our decisions would please the Cross Benches. However, I urge the Minister to pay attention to the consequences of the amendments of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. As it stands, the Bill will not affect the middle classes. If you are a kid with a bit of access to money and the world, you&#146;ll play the system for six months until they get tired of you, at which point you will go abroad to work in the Alps or the Mediterranean for a year, and come back with six months to go. At that point, they will not be bothered with you anymore and you will have escaped the whole thing. This will bite only on those who do not have access to resources and who do not have the social experience that allows them that confidence. However, if one proceeds along the lines proposed by  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1478"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column 1478</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, and make it an obligation not which comes to an end at 16 but which one has to work off at some stage in one&#146;s career, that will no longer be the case: you cannot escape it by playing the system. If you play the fool for six months, you merely get six months more at the end of it. That is why I worked so hard at my chartered accountancy exams. Every time you failed a chartered accountancy exam, you had to spend six more months as a chartered accountant. I was determined to get through the first time and I did, and it was the first time in my life that I really worked hard. To make it a moving obligation greatly strengthens, rather than weakens, the Bill. You lose the motivation to escape something or to play the fool.</p>

<a name="80625-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08062586000021"></a>If it is a moving obligation, and is enforced, let us say, by making a note on someone&#146;s national insurance records that it still exists, so that any employer knows about it and that if they take you on they are supposed to comply with the provisions of the Bill for time off for education, it becomes a real irritation to the young person concerned. Every time they apply for a job, will they want to be able to offer the employer only four days a week, with the fifth taken off? They will want quite quickly&#151;certainly after a year or two&#151;to get rid of that incubus and settle down and get the education that is required of them, freeing them up for an unencumbered life. Something which causes you continual irritation and difficulty, and makes postponing and avoidance something that you just do not want to do because it is getting in the way of your life, is ultimately a much more effective punishment than any form of criminal record. I support the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, in the direction that she is taking, and I hope that the Government might see it as a way forward for their proposals in the Bill, in terms of the direction that they have chosen rather than that which we might take in a couple of years.</p>

There were some people who believed in lifelong learning in the 1890s; the rest of us have been catching up during the past century, which is absolutely right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08062586000025"></a>By instilling a greater culture of learning among teenagers, the Bill will transform our learning culture further up the age range. There is a great deal in it about entitlements to education and training beyond the age of 18, which will further instil a culture of lifelong learning in the nation.</p>

<a name="80625-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="08062586000026"></a>I could not have agreed more with the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, when she said that carrots work better than sticks. The problem is that when Parliament legislates for sticks it needs to do so in great detail. Therefore, large parts of the Bill are preoccupied with how the sticks work. That has to be the case, because if Parliament is putting in place penalties, it has to be very precise and set out in appropriate detail how enforcement regimes will work. However, the emphasis in all our policies is overwhelmingly on the carrots and at vast public expense we are providing them.</p>

<a name="80625-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="08062586000027"></a>Perhaps I may run through some of those carrots that we are providing now and those that we will provide up to 2015 when the duty fully bites. We have introduced the education maintenance allowances: &#163;500 million of public money per year will spent on giving direct public support to 16 to 18 year-olds from less affluent backgrounds so that they have the financial resources to be able to participate in education or training. Five hundred and twenty-eight thousand young people benefited from EMA payments in 2006-07. Around 45 per cent of learners in full-time education receive education maintenance allowances. Our evaluation of EMAs indicated that they have already led to increases in participation nationally of 3.8 per cent for 16 year-olds and 4.1 per cent for 17 year-olds. I could go through the associated statistics if noble Lords wished. I think that there is general agreement in all parts of the Committee that this is a big and worthwhile reform, whose effects will feed through more substantially in the coming years.</p>

<a name="80625-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="08062586000028"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, referred to diplomas. Diplomas represent a revolution in the availability of appropriate qualifications, and are targeted particularly at those groups who have not been well served by the school system. My noble friend Lady Morris asked me to elucidate rather more our thinking on her first question, which was how we will affect the culture of learning in schools. If we were dragooning 16 to 18 year-olds to sit in the same classes, doing the same subjects as in the past, and if they had to sit unwillingly in AS-level and A-level classes in which they had neither the aptitude nor inclination to participate, I would agree that, culturally, it would be immensely ill-advised. However, that is not what we mean when we talk about the expansion of learning and training opportunities; we mean a much wider range of learning and training opportunities, including a big expansion in vocation-oriented courses&#151;many of which simply do not exist&#151;and in apprenticeship opportunities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="08062586000029"></a>We are introducing diplomas this year.

From September 2010, they will be available in public services, retail business, sport and active leisure, and travel and tourism. And from September 2011, they will be available in humanities, languages and sciences. The diplomas will available at three levels&#151;not merely at higher and advanced levels but, crucially, also at foundation level, which is equivalent to five GCSEs at grades D to G. They will be targeted particularly at those young people with whom&#151;to echo the noble Baroness, Lady Morris&#151;the education system has not succeeded by the age of 16.</p>

<a name="80625-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08062586000030"></a>She will know that I agree with her entirely about the importance of literacy and numeracy in primary schools. We are straining every sinew to improve the quality of education, literacy and numeracy available at primary school. I join her in regarding it as a failure of the education system that there remains a large group of children which, despite the improvements in recent years, has not reached the standards that it needs to reach by age 11. However, we cannot give up on them. We need to continue to provide opportunities for them, including beyond the age of 16.</p>

<a name="80625-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08062596000002"></a>Apprenticeships have a vital role in providing fit-for-purpose opportunities for young people beyond the age of 16, particularly those who are not well suited to continuing full time in the classroom. By 2013, which is when the first of the continuing obligations to remain in education and training up to the age of 17 will apply, we will ensure that an apprenticeship place is available for all suitably qualified young people, with significant growth in apprenticeships for older learners as well. This will involve funding for apprenticeships increasing by almost a quarter between now and 2010-11 to over &#163;1 billion a year. By 2020, we aim to deliver over 250,000 apprenticeship starts and 190,000 successful completions. That is based on significant increases in recent years in completion rates, thanks to the work of all those engaged in apprenticeships, including employers. In 2006-07, these rates reached an all-time high of 63 per cent, compared to 24 per cent in 2001-02. It is not simply that the volume of apprenticeships will increase dramatically, targeted particularly at the groups that we are talking about this afternoon; we are paying greater attention to the quality of apprenticeships being provided and to all the factors that are crucial to seeing that young people complete them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="08062596000003"></a>Everything that we are doing is geared towards improving the carrots, in the words of the noble Baroness, Lady Perry. Not only is there the financial support, but the information, advice and guidance on offer to young people has been significantly expanded. This year, the Connexions service budget will be &#163;469 million. There is provision for &#163;467 million over the following two years. This is almost double the pre-Connexions career service budget of &#163;240 million. The Connexions service is particularly aimed at those in danger of falling out of education and training and provides targeted support for them. This is a further and important carrot in the system. So there are the EMAs; the information, advice and guidance; and the range and quality of courses available in education and training

We believe that those carrots, if I may use the noble Baroness&#146;s term, will continue to significantly increase the proportion in education and training.</p>

<a name="80625-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="08062596000004"></a>The statistics that we have at the moment are encouraging. The latest figures, published last week, show that the proportion of 16 to 18 year-olds in education and training in 2007 was 78.7 per cent, an increase of 1.6 per cent in one year alone and the highest rate of participation in education and training among 16 to 18 year-olds ever. The proportion of young people NEET fell by a full percentage point, from 10.4 per cent to 9.4 per cent. The proportion of young people NEET fell substantially at all three ages: from 6.7 per cent to 5.4 per cent at 16; 9.8 per cent to 9.1 per cent at 17; and from 14.7 per cent to 13.7 per cent at 18. All of the indicators are in the right direction, but we have further to go. That is why we are investing so much in all the additional opportunities that I set out.</p>

<a name="80625-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08062596000005"></a>Ultimately, with all those changes&#151;many are in train at the moment and demonstrating success and there are also those that I have described in terms of future policy&#151;is it right to say that there is this obligation, subject to the flexibility in Clause 39 that I described earlier, on young people to participate? We believe that it is. I will make two points concerning this. The first is that this is now increasingly in line with international practice. The noble Lord, Lord Dearing, referred to Germany and its record in education and training. Over the past 100 years, we should have done more to emulate this record; we would have had fewer productivity and education problems. Germany has a compulsory education and training age of 18. It is ranked eighth in the OECD for participation at 17. Belgium has a compulsory education and training age of 18. It is first in education and training participation in the OECD. The Netherlands has an education and training age of 18. It is fifteenth in education and training participation at 17. The United States has an education and training participation age of 17. It is seventeenth. We are twenty-fourth, behind all those which have higher ages at the moment.</p>

<a name="80625-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08062596000006"></a>We often look to Australia and Canada, as they are English-speaking countries with educational and training traditions similar to ours, and their models of reform. In both countries, the more advanced states&#151;they both have federal systems&#151;are going down the road that we are setting out in the Bill this afternoon. Western Australia legislated in 2005 to raise the education and training participation age and saw a significant increase in participation as a result. In the first year that the age was raised, participation rose from 80 per cent to 98 per cent for those in the year beyond compulsory education. That legislation has an enforcement regime, including fines for non-compliance. Those penalties, I am told, have not yet been used, but they are in the legislation for precisely the reason that we had them in our legislation, which is to provide an ultimate sanction and, therefore, an incentive for young people to participate.</p>

<a name="80625-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08062596000007"></a>This is also the trend in Canada, a system that has much culturally in common with our own. In Ontario, the largest Canadian province, legislation raised the  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1482"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column 1482</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>school leaving age to 18 in December 2006. It also provides a framework for an expanded range of opportunities tailored to student needs and interests, and it includes a sanctions regime. The sanctions regime can only commence when there is a broader range of provision in place for 16 and 17 year-olds. So, again, the ultimate stick is only to go hand-in-hand with the big expansion in the carrots available. The trend of policy in Canada is in our direction, too.</p>

<a name="80625-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="08062596000008"></a>Finally&#151;I have spoken for far too long&#151;I come to the discretion left to local authorities. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said that it was wrong to allow unfettered discretion to a local authority in the ultimate enforcement of engagement in education or training beyond the age of 16, from 2013. The whole of Chapter 5 of Part 1 of the Bill sets out a regime that gives appeal rights and requires local authorities to behave within a framework of due process. In our earlier debate, I referred to Clause 39, which provides that local authorities can only act in respect of individuals who do not have a reasonable excuse for not participating. This is subject to a requirement that the local authority must take,</p>
<ul><a name="08062596000091"></a>&#147;all reasonable steps to secure that relevant support is offered to the person, and</ul><ul><a name="08062596000092"></a>(b) may not give the notice&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="08062596000089"></a>an enforcement notice&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08062596000093"></a>&#147;unless satisfied that the person has been afforded an opportunity to take advantage of the support offered&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08062596000009"></a>Clause 43 sets appeal arrangements in respect of attendance notices, including the requirement for appeals panels to be set up. Clause 47 sets out the regime for penalty notices that may, ultimately, follow attendance notices. In Clause 48, there are, again, appeal arrangements set out concerning these penalty notices. So, far from giving unfettered discretion to local authority offices, there is an elaborate process set out in the Bill. This safeguards the proper rights of young people in respect of any enforcement action taken. It also gives them ample opportunities to contest any decisions taken.</p>

<a name="80625-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="08062596000010"></a>I must stress again that this system will have failed if widespread enforcement action is required. It will only succeed if the carrots are the predominant means by which young people participate between 16 and 18. It is the joy of learning and willing participation that we seek. The evidence that we have so far is that, if we provide young people with the correct incentives and the appropriate range of opportunities, they wish to engage and regard it as a joy. If we continue to expand those opportunities in the way I have described, we will only be faced with a tiny number of issues to do with enforcement by 2013.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="08062596000014"></a>One of the most important points in the debate was that raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Yardley, about the difference when teaching those who want to be in a classroom. I trained as a teacher and did my teacher&#146;s training in Salford, and one of the years I took was the final year for those about to leave at 16. They did not even take their coats off. They were ready to be out the door as soon as they could. A most articulate young lady from the youth council spoke at the All-Party Group on Children and asked about the disruption that some of those young people would cause just because they did not know what they wanted to do. I still do not know what I want to do, and I hope that I am not disruptive. Jim Knight, however, answered her in exactly the same way as the Minister has answered the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, saying that this is not all about being in classrooms or education, this is about training. Is it not true that an awful lot of the training will be classroom-based? That is a real turn-off to some young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="08062596000015"></a>Perhaps I may also press the Minister on the effects of the problem of having something on your record, a point that was touched on by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. All of us who took part in the Special Educational Needs (Information) Bill heard the moving story of the noble Lord, Lord James of Blackheath, and how having something on his record&#151;not, I hasten to add, anything criminal but something to do with his learning abilities&#151;had blighted his earlier career opportunities. It is an important point, and I would like the Minister to address it.</p>

The rehabilitation period for a fine imposed by a criminal court on anyone under the age of 18 is two and a half years, at the end of which that record is spent and does not have to be disclosed. Those who are more than two and a half years on will not have to disclose it and will therefore not have the record, which I think is what concerns the noble Baroness.</p>

I would be interested in an answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, on Amendment No. 4, which is where we started.

The position in this area is not entirely straightforward. The offence created in Clause 45 of failing to comply with an attendance notice is not punishable by imprisonment. It is therefore not a recordable offence, will not be automatically placed on the police national computer and will not be routinely disclosed in a CRB check. An enhanced disclosure, the highest level of check provided by the CRB, may include any information from local police records if considered relevant, which is the point that I was making earlier. The offence may therefore appear on an enhanced disclosure, but it depends whether the police consider it relevant. That is the answer to the point.</p>

I would like to clarify. We have already indicated our intention to oppose the Question that Clause 2 stand part. Our amendment to Clause 1 is therefore not intended to compel somebody to take what we call in our amendment an &#147;entitlement&#148;. It is an entitlement. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, has misunderstood us. Our intention was not that they should be compelled at some time during their life to take up that entitlement. It should perhaps be seen alongside our intention regarding Clause 2, which is the compulsion bit. I hope that makes our intention clear.</p>

<a name="80625-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="08062596000029"></a>I thank everyone who has taken part in this important debate. Before I come to the Minister's response, I will say a few words about one or two of the contributions. Like the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Yardley, I am concerned that no young people are excluded. She mentioned that she did not like the idea of exemptions. If you have exemptions and at the same time an entitlement, as we do, there is no danger that it will be used as an excuse not to bother to provide for their education. I would have the same concerns as she has if there were not at the same time an entitlement, but, as I believe that there is an entitlement, it is not really a problem. I very much agree with her about the difference between sixth form and the rest of the school. That was also my experience when I was in teaching. Probably one of the most effective things in my attitude to the compulsion element is that experience&#151;when choice is there, success comes.</p>

<a name="80625-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="08062596000030"></a>We all want young people to have success in their education. It makes the most enormous difference when young people have chosen what they will do and when they will do it. The element of choice made all the difference, and they succeeded better for it. I want to take away the compulsion element so that there is no need for exemptions. The noble Baroness commented on the danger that compulsion on 16 to18 year-olds could turn people off learning for life, and I agree with her and with the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, that lifelong learning is important.</p>

I do not believe that providing the right to postpone will exclude people, as long as the access, opportunities and support are in place. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, about the need to re-engage adults in higher qualifications, not least because the world is changing and people need to be reskilled and upskilled. The noble Lord, Lord Elton, made the telling point that compulsion has not worked for some young people up to the age of 16&#151;the ones on which this Bill is focused&#151;so why should it work after 16? The things that work are choice, support, assistance and encouragement. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, for his support on the seriousness of the

<a name="80625-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="08062596000033"></a>I thank the Minister for his detailed response. He talked about carrots and sticks and gave us a long list of all the initiatives that the Government have brought forward to improve young people&#146;s educational opportunities and qualifications. Why, then, does he not have confidence in all these carrots? As he said, the EMA has already had a beneficial effect. After a fairly short period, there has been an increase of 3.8 per cent for 16 year-olds and 4.1 per cent for 17 year-olds. Then there are the diplomas, which, despite our reservations, we all wish a fair wind. The Government are also vastly expanding opportunities for vocational training and, we hope, for apprenticeships. With the taking away of barriers to access and the learning support contracts, which we know the Government are interested in and which we will come to in later debates, all these initiatives should, if properly implemented&#151;I take the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth of Breckland&#151;make it very rare for young people not to voluntarily take up the opportunity to extend their educational qualifications.</p>

<a name="80625-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="08062596000034"></a>The Minister talked about other countries, mentioning Germany in particular. There is a totally different cultural attitude to education in Germany. From the beginning of education, children there have very high-quality nursery provision and they do not start formal learning until they are six. I know that because my own niece has done it. So the situation is very different. The noble Lord talked about how successful all the countries that have compulsion are in getting young people to participate. That is a no-brainer. Of course if there is compulsion they are going to participate, but does it do them any good?</p>

<a name="80625-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="08062596000035"></a>The Minister said that I was suggesting that local government officials had unfettered discretion. I do not believe that I used the word &#147;unfettered&#148; but perhaps I will read <I>Hansard </I>in the morning and check. I am perfectly aware of all the conditions that exist. The point is that it is the local government officer who is making the decision, based on the Government&#146;s guidelines perhaps, and not the young person.</p>

<a name="80625-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="08062596000036"></a>I ask the noble Lord a fundamental question: what good is enforcement? As the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, pointed out, by the time the authorities discover that a 16 year-old is not participating, it is probably six months down the track. They chase them up and go through all the appeals&#151;I accept that there must be an appeals process when you have some sort of criminal sanction&#151;but all these things are going to take time and, by the end of it, the young person is nearly 18 and it is hardly worth bothering. The alternative is to look at the young person, see what the problems are and sort them out. We should not be waiting until they are 16 to do that. All these things need to be done many years before that because, as the noble Lord, Lord Elton, said, it is those who truanted when they were 13 or 14 who are going to be reluctant to participate in some way after 16.</p>

<a name="80625-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="08062596000037"></a>I do not think that any of us in the Committee have the wrong impression about what the participation duty means. We are all aware that it does not mean

But it is authority and the idea of education that has already turned some of them off. We need the totally different approach of encouragement, carrots, personal mentoring and an understanding of what the problem was in the first place. Did the young person have a special educational need that was not addressed at the right time and which caused them to go out into a PRU because they were excluded from school, or simply to truant and not be provided for at all? What was the problem?</p>

<a name="80625-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="08062596000038"></a>Much of the Government&#146;s approach is right. This framework of support, if it really gets delivered, is absolutely right. But why not wait and see whether the young people find it attractive rather than saying that we have to have compulsion? The impact assessment underestimates the potential cost of setting up that negative framework. We would rather have something positive&#151;carrots, not sticks. I am sure that we will come back to these issues.</p>

<a name="80625-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="08062596000039"></a>I think that I am being encouraged to go on for two more minutes, in which case I most certainly will.</p>

<a name="80625-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="08062596000040"></a>The Minister listed a lot of foreign countries; I mentioned Germany. There are many more differences than just the compulsion element, as has been said. Can we please look at the other differences between what those countries do and what we do now? What sort of early years provision is there? Is there early diagnosis of difficulties? When there has been diagnosis, is provision made? At what age do they start formal learning? Is their reading programme prescriptive? What sort of transition stages are there between the primary level of school and the secondary level? Do they have the same problem that we have where young people very often fall behind for a year or so when they first go to the secondary school? What range of curriculum are they offered in the secondary sector? Have those countries already followed the route down which we hope the Government are moving to give young people a much wider range of courses, rather than expecting them all to be academic? It is rather simplistic just to list all those countries&#146; percentages of participation and expect that to constitute a suitable argument. However, I think that I have made my argument. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I thank Sir Michael and his team for the professional way in which they have gone about their work of identifying the lessons to be learnt. I also welcome the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee report to which the Government are responding today.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;This month marks the first anniversary of the start of the floods. The lives of many people and businesses were turned upside down and the costs, human and financial, were considerable. Our thoughts will, above all, be with the families of those who lost loved ones, as well as with communities still trying to recover. I am sure that the House will wish to thank all those who have worked so hard to help those affected over the past 12 months and I pay tribute to the contribution of my honourable friend the Floods Recovery Minister.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;As Sir Michael says, &#145;Last summer&#146;s flooding was exceptional&#146;. While we recognise both the huge emergency effort at the time and the investment over many years in flood defences, without which the effects would have been much worse, I said to the House last year that we would learn the lessons.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Sir Michael&#146;s report sets out more than 90 recommendations, including: establishing the right legislative framework to tackle flooding; clarifying who is responsible for what; ensuring that the public have all the information and guidance that they need; working with essential services to assess risk and protect critical infrastructure; and having a clear recovery plan right from the start of any major emergency.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;I welcome Sir Michael&#146;s report and the direction that it sets. We will prepare a detailed response, with a prioritised action plan, in the autumn. We have already taken a number of steps that respond to Sir Michael&#146;s findings and I wish to report these to the House.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;The Government have made available up to &#163;88 million, with a further &#163;31 million to come, to help local authorities to assist those in greatest need, as well as to repair infrastructure and to help schools and businesses to get going again. A lot has been achieved&#151;most of those affected are now back in their homes&#151;and we will continue to work with local authorities and the insurance industry to help the rest to return as soon as possible.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;Flood warnings save lives. Since last June, over 73,000 more people have registered with the Environment Agency flood warning system, and the agency will now automatically register properties to receive flood warnings where telephone numbers are publicly available. The agency has also improved its advice to the public and run flood awareness campaigns and it is working with the Met Office to improve the quality of flood warnings. The agency has spent &#163;5 million on repairing defences damaged last summer. Current improvement schemes include a &#163;5.9 million project refurbishing the Hull barrier and remedial works to culverts in Gloucester.</p>

We will now sort out the detailed arrangements for this, drawing on responses to the <I>Future Water</I> consultation and the results of the 15 pilot projects on urban drainage, the results of which we are publishing today.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;On critical infrastructure, electricity and water providers are responsible for ensuring continuity of supply. The electricity industry has identified just over 1,000 grid and primary sites that are in flood zones and is working with the Environment Agency to see which of these might need additional protection. Every water company is reviewing how its critical assets may be at risk from flooding in order to prioritise investment plans. This information will be used as the basis of a planned nationwide programme to improve the resilience of critical infrastructure, which the Government will produce later this year. Most local resilience forums have now been briefed on critical infrastructure in their area, and the remainder will be done by the end of August.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;On reservoir safety, we will now go ahead to prepare flood maps for reservoirs coming under the Reservoirs Act and ensure that, where they are not already available, they are provided to local emergency planners before the end of 2009. They will decide the best way to ensure that communities are informed. We will also modernise reservoir safety legislation.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;The Government will produce an outline for the national flood emergency framework by the end of July, with a draft for consultation by the end of the year. This will be part of a major programme to improve preparedness for severe flooding. We will bring forward a draft floods and water Bill in the next Session. This will enable us to respond to many of Sir Michael&#146;s recommendations.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;The Government are increasing investment in flood risk management from &#163;650 million this year to &#163;800 million in 2010-11. The Environment Agency&#146;s defences protected 100,000 properties from flooding last year and this new investment will protect a further 145,000 homes across the country. We are developing with the Environment Agency a long-term investment strategy for flood defence.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;We have set aside &#163;34.5 million for priorities identified in Sir Michael&#146;s report. We will, of course, need to consider the detailed recommendations and their funding with local authorities and other partners before making a final allocation but, in order to make progress, I am announcing today that at least &#163;5 million will be made available to develop surface water management plans in the highest priority areas and at least &#163;1 million to improve reservoir safety, specifically for inundation mapping. I have also set aside an initial &#163;250,000 to plan a major

<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a name=""></a>&#147;We must recognise that we can never eliminate the risk of flooding, particularly as climate change takes hold, but all of us&#151;government, water and electricity providers, local communities and individuals&#151;must take flood risk seriously and be as prepared as we can be to deal with it. Sir Michael&#146;s report will help us all to do this. I know that he will be taking a close interest in its implementation and I will invite him to attend Cabinet committee discussions on progress. I will report further to the House in the autumn with a detailed action plan&#148;.</p>

It rightly welcomes the report of Sir Michael Pitt and his team. The Opposition also praise the quality of the report they have produced.</p>

<a name="80625-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08062596000048"></a>Since December, we have had the benefit of Sir Michael&#146;s interim report, on which this final report is based. We have in addition to this full report a useful executive summary, which, if not enabling noble Lords to be fully comprehensive of the final detail of the report, enables us to be informed of its principal recommendations.</p>

<a name="80625-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="08062596000049"></a>The Minister will also remember the debates we had recently on the initiative of my noble friend Lord Rotherwick, who is not in his place this evening. Since that time, I experienced, only a month ago, the flooding of my home in France. Eight inches of rain fell in four hours. There is nothing like direct experience in politics and it was frightening to see water cascading down the hill, through the garden, utility room and garage and out into the street. Fortunately, we were present and able to ensure that the damage was limited. Yet though the house is tiled throughout, even now it is still sweating out water. It is habitable, but neighbours were not so lucky.</p>

<a name="80625-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="08062596000050"></a>I am therefore more aware than ever of the power of water and the way in which a scene of peace and calm can be turned into a scene of destruction, with landslips, mud, debris, fallen trees and collapsed walls. We were fortunate. However, the experience has made me more aware that many in this country suffering similar exceptional rainfall were not so lucky. It is right, when we consider the report, to remember the many families who still live with the consequences. Others will carry vivid and frightening memories. We can think of the families of those who lost their lives, those whose homes and businesses were wrecked and, as the Statement says, whose world was turned upside down. That will not be forgotten by them, nor should it be forgotten by us.</p>

<a name="80625-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="08062596000051"></a>Some 12 months later, far too many people&#151;11,000, in some 5,000 households&#151;are still not back in their home. Some 2,500 are still living in caravans. I hope that the Minister agrees that insurance companies, local authorities and housing associations should prioritise getting people back into their home. It was the Prime Minister himself who promised to get people back on their feet as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="08062596000052"></a>Many local authorities are still faced with the bill for the clear-up. Although the Government made funds available for this, not all affected authorities were fully compensated for the enormous sums involved. Do the Government have proposals for finding the &#163;50 million by which local authorities find themselves out of pocket, or will the council tax payer pick up the bill?</p>

<a name="80625-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="08062596000053"></a>Sir Michael Pitt made an interim report to enable the Government to act immediately on the 15 recommendations he made. How many of these have the Government implemented? Can the Minister tell us what they are? While we acknowledge that, thanks to the report, it is now clear what needs to be done, the Government need to appreciate the urgency of the situation. They need to demonstrate the determination to act decisively. They were all action when the spotlight was on the Prime Minister at the time, but since the fuss has died down, there has been the usual drag between intention and achievement. When he produced his report in April, Sir Michael was critical that insufficient action had been taken on raising public awareness. The Statement tells us that 73,000 more people have been registered with the Environment Agency&#146;s flood warning scheme. How many does that make in total? How many people do the Government estimate are living in high-risk areas?</p>

<a name="80625-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="08062596000054"></a>The Statement also refers to the &#163;5 million spent by the Environment Agency in the last year in repairing damaged defences. Do the Government believe that that is an adequate response? Did not the Association of British Insurers estimate that the cost of the floods was &#163;3 billion?</p>

<a name="80625-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="08062596000055"></a>Early on, Sir Michael pointed out the confused nature of storm water management. The report makes clear the need for better maintenance of surface water drainage, particularly in urban areas. In some rural areas, highly competent internal drainage boards have maintained a high professionalism. I remind noble Lords of my interests and my dependency on my local IDB for keeping our family home, farm and business dry&#151;no mean task when it all lies at 3 metres, more or less, above mean sea level. However, in many cases, where the need for taking these things seriously is not so self-evident, there has been a long-standing failure to maintain rainwater drainage in a proper fashion. All too often, building and development has been bolted on to an old, already inadequate and poorly maintained system, without sufficient consideration of the consequences.</p>

<a name="80625-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="08062596000056"></a>We look forward to the draft floods and water Bill, but note that it is only a draft Bill. We in the Opposition approve of the opportunity for scrutiny which this provides, but do the Government feel that they can afford the time to wait for this Bill which, in the words of the Statement, will enable us to,</p>
<ul><a name="08062596000094"></a>&#147;respond to many of Sir Michael&#146;s recommendations&#148;?</ul>
<p><a name="08062596000090"></a>Have they the time to wait for the Bill? Which of the report&#146;s recommendations do the Government believe need urgent action? Are there some that the Government have identified as needing immediate implementation? What, then, is the timetable for action on those recommendations that will be acted upon now, without delay, 12 months on?</p>

Although we tried very hard, we were totally unprepared for what happened, and we are informed by the Government and government-backed scientists that this is liable to happen again. It is good to hear the Government say that they are learning from what happened, although there is then the caveat of &#147;exceptional circumstances&#148;. I think the general consensus is that such exceptional circumstances are likely to occur again within the next decade, if the scientists have got it right.</p>

<a name="80625-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="08062596000058"></a>Can the Government give us some more assurances? I go slightly further than the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, in asking whether a timeframe will be printed for the things that require immediate action? What should be happening locally over the years? Such actions will have to be locally adjusted, but can we have an idea of when these arrangements should be in place?</p>

<a name="80625-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="08062596000059"></a>What is the idea and the structure behind planning regulations for new homes? Flood plains tend to be terribly attractive places for developers, who choose to ignore the fact that water can arrive there periodically. What will we do about ensuring that any new homes reach high standards in terms of both construction and support services? One of the most important things about the Statement was the idea that drainage and power supplies should be able to survive a certain level of inundation.</p>

<a name="80625-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="08062596000060"></a>Do the Government have any idea when they will be able to rehouse all the 5,000 people still living away from their home? That would be a reassuring statistic because it would give us an idea of how seriously the Government take this planning. Can they assure us that it is not a question of just one department&#146;s funding stream being involved and that there will be an effort across government? If any one department is responsible for this level of investment, it could be tempting to take lumps out of it for other projects.</p>

I am grateful for their broad welcome for the report and the Government&#146;s response to it. As the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, indicated, these are very serious issues. The whole House will be sorry to hear of his recent direct experience of how serious this can be. I take only the smallest amount of solace from the fact that it occurred in another country and not the United Kingdom. As he rightly says, it gives one graphic experience of the costs of flooding and the cost in terms of time&#151;people are affected for such a long time before they can go home again.</p>

<a name="80625-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="08062596000063"></a>We have made significant efforts to ensure that as many householders as possible are back in their home. I pay tribute to all those who have contributed&#151;the insurance companies, local authorities and other agencies which have responded intelligently and urgently. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, rightly identified, some people are not back in their home yet, and that represents an anxiety for us all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="08062596000064"></a>The noble Lord will appreciate the figures in the Statement on immediate action taken by the Government in response to this obvious need and the promise of more to come. The additional expenditure that is scheduled for three years&#146; time is a very significant increase over the present figure. An increase from &#163;650 million to &#163;800 million is not to be disregarded&#151;it is an indication of the extent to which the Government are concerned about flood risk.</p>

<a name="80625-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="08062596000065"></a>The issue that was so painfully obvious from last year&#146;s floods is surface water, which, as the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, identified, raises significant issues about necessary controls over the drainage system, which is meant to cope but at the time did not. As the noble Lord, Lord Addington, reminded the House, we are to expect that the somewhat extreme conditions last year that caused such dreadful problems on Humberside and in Gloucestershire and the west country may recur. What used to be regarded as exceptional in the face of what we can all recognise as aspects of climate change may necessitate a greater action on behalf of us all.</p>

<a name="80625-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08062596000066"></a>I want to emphasise in response to the noble Lord that the Government presented early funding on the issue. They gained the promise of substantial extra resources to be available to the local authorities and the Environment Agency. It is an important point that we have made it clear that the Environment Agency has to take the lead role on the issue and ensure that local authorities respond to the very real points made by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, on the importance of the local authorities&#146; responsibility with regard to surface water. We must ensure that the Environment Agency looks with greater care to our reservoirs and their safety. That work is a major priority over the summer.</p>

<a name="80625-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="08062596000067"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Addington, asked whether only one department was going to carry the strain. The Department for the Environment will be in the lead. It is through that department that resources will be channelled. I want to give him the reassurance that he will already have recognised&#151;this was made clear last year by the Prime Minister&#146;s response&#151;that this is a matter for the whole Government. I understand his point that it needs co-operation beyond one department, because there are a number of agencies that are obviously concerned. Other departments also have to increase the priority that they attach to the issues.</p>

<a name="80625-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="08062596000068"></a>I am grateful to both noble Lords. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, referred to a constructive debate that we had recently on the issue, introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick. I do not have the slightest doubt that the House will make sure that the issue remains at the forefront over the next few months and years.</p>

The one thing that worries me&#151;I asked Questions for Written Answer on the matter some months ago&#151;is  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1494"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column 1494</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that despite the Government&#146;s good intentions and the constructiveness of that report we will find that there is a bureaucratic logjam when it comes to the sort of spending that the Minister has talked about and we will find that there is a conflict of interest.</p>

<a name="80625-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="08062596000070"></a>I should like the Minister&#146;s reassurance. I recall that one of the Written Answers I received indicated that local authorities had a statutory requirement to consult the Environment Agency. Will the Minister tell us what that means? Does consultation mean that they have to accept the guidance? We know the conflict and the pressures that occur at the moment in terms of the downturn in the economy. There is also pressure on developers to keep going. There is pressure on local authorities to accommodate developers. The one thing that struck me was that when I asked about whether redress was available to persons who purchased new homes following planning approval by local authorities and if there was flooding, who was responsible, I received a clear indication that the person who buys and lives in the house is the person responsible.</p>

<a name="80625-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="08062596000071"></a>I ask the Minister to clarify that point. Where there is pressure from developers and where the local authority consorts with the Environment Agency, will reasonable attention be paid to a constructive and commonsense approach so that at the end of the day the householder, who is the person about whom we are speaking, has an assurance that the measures being proposed will be effective?</p>

<p><a name="st_138"></a>

I can give him some reassurance. Of course decisions taken at local level will go through the usual channels and of course he may complain that that may lead to bureaucratic delay, but it is in the interests of local authorities to ensure that their neighbourhoods are safe. Let me say that they will be under a fairly clear obligation with regard to the Environment Agency. The Environment Agency is now a statutory consultee on planning developments, so the question of the permission that local authorities give to planning applications is a matter in which the Environment Agency will take an interest if the issue of flooding might be a real factor. That means that Ministers can call in major planning applications for consideration if they are advised by the Environment Agency that the risks being entailed may be too great.</p>

I have just managed to obtain a copy from my noble friend on the Front Bench. As the Minister said, the Environment Agency will have a lead role. It has a flood warning system, it is working with the Met Office, and it is repairing defences. It is involved with the electricity industry. It also has to protect the flood defences for another 145,000 homes. Will the Minister enlarge on the role of the Environment Agency in the overall planning of housing? He has just stated that there is a statutory requirement for the Environment Agency to look at plans for housing, but is it true that that is not a statutory requirement for the eco-towns that are going to be built? That is one of the big problems that is causing concern, certainly in parts of the country. For example, in Sussex an eco-town is planned. I declare an interest in that I live not too far  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1495"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column 1495</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>away from it. It will not affect me but everyone else is concerned about it. Only last month, when there were flash floods and unusual weather conditions, there was 18 inches of water on the road that will be in the middle of that eco-town. It is close to the coast and there is a real problem.</p>

<a name="80625-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="08062596000074"></a>I have three further questions. First, will the Environment Agency have any say in those sorts of developments, because it would be a case of closing one door and opening another to the floods? Secondly, will the Environment Agency, in playing this leading role, get greater resources in terms of management and taking on the role of other organisations? My recollection is that 12,000 people work for the agency at the moment. Will the situation get out of hand because it is too big to manage? Thirdly, where does the Environment Agency sit with regard to joined-up government in this country?</p>

The Environment Agency will be a statutory consultee and will follow planning guidance for all new build. I do not know far plans for the eco-town she mentioned have reached, but I certainly give an assurance that the Environment Agency will play the role I mentioned. That is critical. On the more general points she made, the agency will inevitably need additional resources. That is why the Government are committed to providing them, because the agency is charged with a significant role.</p>

<a name="80625-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="08062596000076"></a>As I indicated in the Statement, the Government have already pledged a programme of increased resources during the next three years, some of which will be for the Environment Agency. I agree with the noble Baroness that one cannot place obligations on any institution without giving it the means of fulfilling them. The Environment Agency has an excellent record and the Government will ensure that that record continues.</p>

The noble Lord may recall that a few weeks ago he answered my Written Questions on this point. I asked in particular about the money promised from the European Union Solidarity Fund that would be used to defray costs from central government. That amounts to &#163;110 million, compared to the &#163;88 million that the Government have made available so far. Can the Minister provide some explanation of how the money from the Solidarity Fund, which is to be used to defray costs, is related to the budget and the &#163;88 million that is to be expended, as well as to the &#163;31 million to come? At the moment those sums seem to be entirely reliant on the EU Solidarity Fund. I am sure that that cannot be the case. No doubt the Minister will explain that.</p>

We intend to ensure that we get our full share of that necessary resource.</p>

I am the chairman of an insurance broking organisation and I have been a director of the British Insurance Brokers&#146; Association. I took part in the debate on flooding and I reinforce the points made by my noble friend Lord Taylor. The insurance industry has acted very quickly; indeed, we have settled claims as quickly as we can. Our difficulty sometimes is that a lot of properties are not insured, and this is where there is perhaps difficulty in obtaining reinstatement. Indeed, the experiences of our clients demonstrate that people suffer from a great deal of anguish. Does the Minister agree that there must be better co-ordination between the Environment Agency and local authorities, because one criticism is that there is not a great deal of that? Can he assure us that there will be a timetable for implementing what has been suggested?</p>

The insurance industry responded well to the situation last year. That does not alter the fact that some households are uninsured and there are those who are bound to feel that the loss that they sustained has still not been fully made up. We are all too well aware of the difficulties that people face when their homes undergo flooding. I reiterate the points I made in response to a noble Lord earlier; the Environment Agency has a clear role to play in relation to local authorities. Everyone is crucially aware of the significance of having necessary flood defences and the action that needs to be taken by local authorities. The Environment Agency is in the best possible position to identify those issues and it will be its job to ensure that local authorities comply.</p>

<a name="80625-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="08062596000082"></a>On the insurance issue, we will produce an action plan in the autumn with a timetable on how these matters can be dealt with. I assure the House that although the final report has just been published, the Government had preliminary sight of the position that Mr Pitt was taking, and therefore we have made preparations for full development in the autumn.</p>

I hope that the Government will take them up. The report has 462 pages plus a 43-page executive summary&#151;a total of more than 500 pages. Any unsold copies might come in useful as flood defences in some areas. We are used to getting lots of paper in this place, walking away to our offices with piles of thick documents and having good intentions of spending a lot of time looking at them. I will take this document away to read when I am on holiday this summer, because it is full of extremely interesting and useful stuff. I have dipped into it and it seems to be more readable and interesting than quite a lot of the turgid stuff that we are invited to take away from the Printed Paper Office.</p>

<a name="80625-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="08062596000084"></a>I have just a couple of points to make. First, I welcome what appears to be a theme throughout of partnership between the Environment Agency taking a strategic role at the national and regional level and the vital importance of local authorities, which have the local knowledge and accountability in their areas. From what I have read so far, it does not read as if the Environment Agency is there to ensure that local authorities do this, that or the other; it means that they will work together. Does the Minister agree that that is essential, because local authorities have the local knowledge? To make a detailed point that I made in the debate sponsored by the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, there is evidence that the Environment Agency is taking responsibility for small streams for too small watercourses. There is evidence of watercourses being blocked and other such problems. Those problems need to be sorted out locally but local authorities cannot do that because they have been declared to be major rivers. Clearly, they are not; they are just becks.</p>

<a name="80625-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="08062596000085"></a>My second point concerns insurance and the importance of the Government and the insurance industry getting as many people as possible insured. We will be looking at that very carefully, especially in relation to social housing. Social housing landlords have to take much greater responsibility for trying to get people insured. The Minister in the Commons said that he would report further to the House in the autumn. Will the Minister confirm that we will get that report here too?</p>

<p><a name="st_146"></a>
<a name="08062596000086"></a><a name="80625-0011.htm_spnew12"></a><b><a name="80625-0011.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="08062596000149"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, on the last point, a report is somewhat different from a Statement. If it is made as a Statement, I have no doubt that it will be repeated here. If it is a report to the House, it will be for this House to judge how it wants to handle the issue. I have every confidence in the House airing the issues, given the widespread concern about and interest in them. I have no doubt that the Pitt report and subsequent developments will feature in our debates in future.</p>

<a name="80625-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="08062596000087"></a>On the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, about insurance, the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, has already emphasised the crucial role of the insurance industry. That is why we intend to make progress on that in the autumn. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, is absolutely right to say that insurance is crucial. Far too many people have underestimated the necessity for it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="08062596000088"></a>I was questioned by two noble Lords earlier; I want to emphasise the significance of the Environment Agency on planning decisions by local authorities. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Greaves&#151;in every other respect, the Environment Agency&#146;s relationship with local authorities is one of a partnership. It will need to work with the grain of local authorities. As he said, in so many areas, local people know best about local problems and have crucial intelligence for the Environment Agency. Often, the local authority is the agent of necessary change. I assure him that the Environment Agency has an enhanced role, but that is not at the cost of local authorities. Most of its relationship with local authorities will be one of partnership.</p>

<a name="80625-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="080625100000003"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I shall move the first order in my name on the Order Paper and speak to the second. The regulations set out the procedures for registering voters in Northern Ireland and cover some technical administrative aspects of the conduct of parliamentary elections in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="80625-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="080625100000004"></a>The regulations consolidate and replace the existing Representation of the People (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2001, which have already been amended several times. Although this is a consolidation exercise, which means that the regulations before us are rather lengthy, bringing the regulations together in a single text will simplify the legislation and make it easier to use for all those involved in the application and interpretation of electoral law in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="80625-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="080625100000005"></a>Most of the regulations simply replicate the substance of the 2001 regulations. However, there are some changes. The regulations contain new provisions necessary to implement the changes to electoral administration contained in the Electoral Administration Act 2006 and the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006. The regulations also introduce new provisions requested by the Chief Electoral Officer for Northern Ireland, which are intended to help him to fulfil his registration objectives and further to improve the management of elections in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="80625-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="080625100000006"></a>I will now highlight the key changes that the regulations will make. Noble Lords may be aware that Northern Ireland&#146;s registration procedures differ from those operating in the rest of the UK, as a result of the anti-fraud measures operating there. As in the rest of the UK, under the late registration scheme, eligible individuals will be able to register to vote up to 11 days before polling day. However, the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act provides that those applying to register late in Northern Ireland will be required to provide additional supporting material alongside their application. That is because, at that stage in the electoral cycle, the chief electoral officer would simply not have the time to make the necessary checks on applications made under the normal application process.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1499"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column 1499</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80625-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="080625100000007"></a>Regulation 25 lists the type of supporting material that may be required when applying for late registration. That material will enable the chief electoral officer to verify the applicant&#146;s date of birth, nationality, address, and the fact that he or she has been resident in Northern Ireland for three months prior to the application date.</p>

<a name="80625-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="080625100000008"></a>A further change relates to photographic identification. Unlike in Great Britain, voters in Northern Ireland are required to produce photographic ID when voting in person. At present, only a photographic driving licence, passport, Translink senior citizens travel pass or an electoral identity card, which is issued by the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland, may be accepted as proof of identity. Regulation 15 would extend the type of acceptable ID to include a blind person&#146;s travel pass and a war disabled travel pass issued by Translink. Both of those documents meet the same fraud prevention requirements as the senior citizens&#146; travel pass.</p>

<a name="80625-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="080625100000009"></a>Regulation 15 also removes the requirement for the ID to be &#147;current&#148; to be accepted at a polling station. Post-election reports indicate that a small number of otherwise eligible electors have been unable to vote because they have presented out-of-date photographic ID. A person should not be disfranchised simply because his or her ID is not current. In order to maximise voter participation, the regulations will allow electors to vote regardless of whether their ID is current, as long as the presiding officer is satisfied that the ID confirms the elector&#146;s identity.</p>

<a name="80625-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="080625100000010"></a>The regulations also contain provisions aimed at encouraging more young people to register to vote. Young people are at present especially underrepresented on the electoral register. For that reason, Regulation 42 contains changes that will allow the chief electoral officer to request information from secondary schools in Northern Ireland. That information would then be used to invite older pupils to register. That proposal builds on the chief electoral officer&#146;s current powers to obtain information and offers an innovative solution to increasing the number of young people registered in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="80625-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="080625100000011"></a>The Service Voters&#146; Registration Period (Northern Ireland) Order 2008 would simply extend the period for which members of the forces, or their partners who have made service declarations, may remain registered as electors before being required to make a further declaration. This period is currently set at one year in Northern Ireland. The order will extend that period to three years, bringing Northern Ireland into line with Great Britain. The consolidation exercise means that the draft regulations before us are particularly lengthy. However, the changes made in them, and the process of consolidating the existing legislation, will benefit voters and help us to make the complex rules governing elections easier to follow for all concerned. I hope noble Lords will join me in supporting these regulations, which are necessary to ensure the effective administration of elections in Northern Ireland. I beg to move.</p>

He joins a great team of players who have attempted to support Northern Ireland in one way or another and who have debated the issues long into the night on many occasions. Let us hope that we do not do that any more. The noble Lord is very welcome.</p>

<a name="80625-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="080625100000014"></a>I also thank the Minister for the clear way in which he laid out the statutory instrument linked to the services. It certainly seems straightforward, now that he has told us about it. I definitely support all these changes. We have, in Northern Ireland, the best form of electoral management in these islands, and probably in many other places. We have argued and fought hard to get to where we are&#151;that includes the Government, the joint opposition and those on the Cross Benches from Northern Ireland. We have a very satisfactory situation. This legislation would appear to improve it and sharpen it up.</p>

<a name="80625-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="080625100000015"></a>There are one or two areas we need to be careful about, one of which is photographic identification being out of date. If I may say so with the government Chief Whip in her place, I worry that, particularly with women, disguise can very quickly take over. When they are young and beautiful, they have such pictures on their identification. As they age and become more mature, they could pass themselves off as all sorts of people by changing the colour of their hair, the weight that they carry and so on. I am a little nervous about that, and attention needs to be focused on how far we go. I would have liked to see a limit to the number of years that pass before a photograph is deemed out of date.</p>

I was referring to everybody, but I wanted to be particularly apologetic to the ladies who are with us. Men also suffer in that regard, and I do not think that we need to be felt sorry for. We are, I suspect, less adept at disguise. On a serious note, this point should be noted. I would like to see a time limit, whether it is 10 years, or whatever. People should not be able to present identification that has a name and number on it but whose photograph was clearly taken 25 years ago. It puts too much of a burden on those responsible at polling stations.</p>

<a name="80625-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="080625100000018"></a>The provisions regarding young people are an excellent idea. I understand that some schools are reticent to conform with the idea of electoral officers going into schools to collect data from students who are about to join the electorate. That is understandable because over the years the Government have not made a great success of computerisation. We have seen a lot of nasty headlines about the loss of personal and private data. Some reassurance is needed because it is not that big a deal. The data banks on students and other people cannot be that big. We have had no unpleasant impact of this nature, other than through terrorist

I support the Government&#146;s attempt to bring more young people on to the electoral roll.</p>

<a name="80625-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="080625100000019"></a>I read the notes on the changes for the services and had the opportunity to speak to officials. I mentioned that I was anxious that the words &#147;service personnel&#148; should be clarified. It is probably clarified in the notes. In my day &#147;service personnel&#148; meant the police, firemen and sometimes nurses and ambulance staff. This, I assume, is aimed at the Armed Forces. There is a difference. The Armed Forces have always had separate electoral rolls, as I know, having served for 13 years. What this order&#151;which is almost a Bill&#151;proposes is absolutely right and proper. I ask only that, for late registration, the Government insist and ensure that the 11-day extra requirements are adhered to. The order says that people can register 11 days before polling day provided that they produce extra identification at the time. I would hate to think that that was not going to be strictly adhered to. If I have taken too long, I apologise. I support the order.</p>

I support these two orders. I was going to raise the question about up-to-date photographs, but I hesitate to do so after the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran. If he spent 13 years in the Armed Forces, I am pretty certain he blacked up for night manoeuvres and impersonated a tree. He would have made a very good tree.

<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="080625100000021"></a>We are pleased to see these changes in the Representation of the People (Northern Ireland) Regulations to make it as convenient as possible for people in Northern Ireland to exercise their right to vote without undermining the security of the electoral processes there. We very much welcome the introduction of two additional forms of photographic ID to be used as identifiers for voting: the blind person&#146;s smart pass and the war-disabled smart pass. We hope that this will go some way to ensure that as many people are not turned away from polling stations for not having the right form of identification as we saw in the Assembly elections in March 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="080625100000022"></a>We also support the provision that will allow the chief electoral officer to gather information from secondary schools in Northern Ireland, to help in encouraging young people to vote. As previous Ministers will be aware, it is the Liberal Democrats&#146; policy to extend the right to vote to 16 year-olds. We hope this initiative will be useful in encouraging younger voters to participate in elections and the political process. It is also extremely useful to have previous regulations consolidated in this way, along with the new changes. We hope that this will be helpful to the chief electoral officer and to others involved in elections in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="80625-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="080625100000025"></a>I have three observation-cum-questions for the Minister. First, has the decision to allow registration up to 11 days before an election emerged in part because of criticism from the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights in 2003 after the previous Assembly elections? It argued that the period was too long in Northern Ireland and that in a democratic society we should move closer to the figure that the noble Lord has thankfully given.</p>

<a name="80625-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="080625100000026"></a>My second point relates to the issue of how many people who have not been able to vote will now be able to do so because of the changes. Like the noble Lord, Lord Smith, I welcome the changes to the blind person&#146;s smart pass and the war disabled smart pass, although I suspect that the numbers involved there were fairly small. On the other hand, the Minister should be aware that the proposal that documents, passports and IDs no longer need to be absolutely up-to-date to be usable will have major implications. The chief electoral officer&#146;s figures from the March 2007 Assembly elections show that about 3,500 people were turned away because of inadequate or no documents. Over half of those were people who had a passport or driving licence. In fact, on a certain definition of the figures, two-thirds of those people would now be able to vote. I welcome this, but we should be aware that we may be doing something quite radical by putting back on the register possibly 60 to 70 per cent of those who, at the previous Assembly elections, were refused the right to vote. I saw such cases in polling stations in Northern Ireland. It is probably the right thing to do but it is quite a radical step. Does the noble Lord agree that those numbers are roughly right? They are certainly more significant than the number who will be affected by the changes regarding the blind person&#146;s smart pass and the war disabled smart pass?</p>

<a name="80625-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="080625100000027"></a>My final observation is that in this consolidation of the regulations there are significant sections on registration, absent voting, postal voting and access to electoral registers and marked registers. Can the Minister confirm that some of the recommendations arise from lessons learnt from electoral fraud in the Birmingham area and are being wisely applied to the people of Northern Ireland?</p>

<a name="80625-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="080625100000028"></a>I welcome the regulations, particularly the proposals to help to encourage young people to vote. The steps that are being taken to improve young people&#146;s access to voting&#151;it is a great problem in Northern Ireland&#151;are very wise provisions and probably the most benign in the proposed regulations.</p>

It is not difficult to find examples of this problem. The <I>Parliamentary Companion</I> contains photographs of noble Lords, but someone looking at them would be forgiven for thinking that some photographs were of either their sons or grandsons; they do not have a tremendous relationship to the person whom you meet on a daily basis on these Benches. I accept that there will be out-of-date passes, but there must be a sensible cut-off date of 10 years or whatever. We cannot go on ad infinitum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="080625101000003"></a>I accept the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Smith, that we now have one of the best regulated electoral systems in Europe. That is important. We in Northern Ireland are glad to get away from the days when you had the old jibe, &#147;Vote early and vote often&#148;. As people used to say to me, election day in Northern Ireland was like the day of resurrection, because everyone got out of the graveyards and went to vote. I am glad that those days have gone and that we have a sensible voting system. We feel strongly that it should be applied right across the board. That is what is happening and I commend the electoral officers in Northern Ireland. We support the instruments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="080625101000005"></a>I wish to raise three issues, one in relation to each of the instruments, and then to make a final wind-up comment about the first one. On the Representation of the People (Northern Ireland) Regulations, which the Minister correctly identified as consolidation, I and one or two other noble Lords present in the Chamber will remember consolidations carried through on terrorist legislation relating to Northern Ireland where it was discovered, 18 months after the consolidation had been taken through, that carelessness in the consolidation had led to certain potential crimes being eliminated as crimes for a period of about 18 months. Then someone suddenly spotted that the manner in which the consolidation had occurred had, in a sense, instead of consolidating the legislation, removed it from the balance. I hope that someone, somewhere, has gone through this consolidation to make sure that it is copper-bottomed. It will be extremely embarrassing for the Government if it ever turns out not to be. It will also be inconvenient for both Houses of Parliament, because we will suddenly be asked to carry through legislation in 24 hours in order to cover the gap. Is the Minister confident that the legislation is copper-bottomed?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="080625107000004"></a>However, I should like to come back to the general point I wanted to make. In an order that we took fairly recently, which was taken by the noble Lord, Lord Rooker&#151;I think that the noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, was in the Chamber at the time&#151;I referred to the remarkable achievement of the late, great Lord Williams of Mostyn. At the time of the Second Reading debate on the legislation at the beginning of this millennium, which had come to us without having been amended in any way in the Commons, Mr Desmond Browne, now Secretary of State for Defence, was the Parliamentary Secretary handling it in the Commons. It is fair to say that he did not have the weight at that point to be able to tell the Northern Ireland Office what to do about the points that were being raised. I can remember specifically during the Second Reading debate referring to recent cases in Fermanagh and Tyrone, the counties singled out by Winston Churchill in a famous statement just after the First World War&#151;not much changes in the history of the Province. However, Lord Williams of Mostyn went back to the Northern Ireland Office and turned the Bill upside down between Second Reading and Third Reading in this House. My noble

<a name="80625-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="080625107000005"></a>When we had the Statement on the elections and funding the other day, I allowed myself the observation that the Government&#146;s attitude on postal voting seemed in recent years to have been Panglossian. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, from the Government Front Bench said I was being a little hard on the Government. However, the fact remains that when the postal arrangements have been criticised, the Government have either wrung their hands and said that there was no time to legislate before the next election or, if in the middle of an election, they would assure us when ugly reports surfaced about these matters that everything would be all right on the night&#151;a confidence later disproved by events.</p>

<a name="80625-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="080625107000006"></a>I agree that postal fraud in the United Kingdom is apparently limited to certain parts of the country, but anywhere is too much. The barrister who investigated the Birmingham cases some years back said, as I recall, that the rules and practices were worthy of a banana republic. That embarrasses us all; democracy is too precious to be left open to fraud and raising the turnout is not, in itself, a sufficient justification. However, Northern Ireland owes a very great deal to the late, great Lord Williams of Mostyn for the legislation that he put on the statute book.</p>

The concept in the regulations is that the presiding officer should decide on the fitness for purpose of what is presented. The cards that have been selected as photo ID have sufficient security in them for the presiding officer to know that their original issue was to a standard acceptable for purpose, the out-of-datedness, or not, and whether, be they male or female, the individuals do not look like their photograph. If they do not bear a likeness to their photograph, it will not be fit for purpose and the presiding officer will, quite properly, turn them away.</p>

As I understand it, this out-of-date photo ID is to cover people who, like myself, heading for France one day, arrive at Stansted to find that their passport is four weeks out of date and are not allowed to go. I totally agree with the Government&#146;s thoughts on this; one should not be stopped from voting for that reason. However, I believe it could save a lot of problems and administrative difficulties if the noble Lord would undertake to go

One situation I know of concerns my mother-in-law, for instance, who does not choose to keep a valid passport. However, because a passport is such a useful identification document, she uses that as a source of identification. I do not think that it is an unreasonable burden on a presiding officer to be presented with a validly issued document and take the judgment, &#147;Does this person look like their photo?&#148; It is very clear that, should the presiding officer take the view that they do not look like the photo, he is to deny them a vote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="080625107000012"></a>I move on now to the issue of young people. There are some concerns about the process. As I understand it, the chief electoral officer will be able to ask schools about children coming within the bound. He will then dispatch people to schools with the key data already on appropriate forms in order to allow the young people, in a very straightforward way, to provide the information to allow them to get on to the register.</p>

The chief electoral officer is required to abide by data protection legislation and comprehensive data handling protocols.

I do not believe that there is a Birmingham input to this, but if there is I shall write to the noble Lord. Essentially, it has been explained to me that there was a morass of good legislation already sitting there, and the only significant differences from simply drawing it together have been outlined in my speech.</p>

He pointed out the mistakes made in the past during previous consolidations and sought an absolute assurance that we have made no mistakes this time. My Chief Whip whispered an aside that I should give the noble Lord that assurance. The trouble is that, being a realistic sort of person, I know that it is extremely difficult to prove a negative. I have every reason to believe that officials have taken great pains to ensure that there are no careless errors. He asked me why it has taken so long to get from 2006 to 2008. All I can say is that the history of this material suggests that it grinds wondrous fine. To be fair, we are seeing the fruits tonight, but these things do seem to take a long time in Northern Ireland. The noble Lord also commented on the quality of information. Again, I do not believe that there is a Birmingham dimension to it, but I shall not comment on Great Britain voting crimes. It is right that the parties have worked together to produce a high quality system. I commend the regulations.</p>

That order sets out the legislative framework for the regulation and verification of loans to political parties in Northern Ireland by the Electoral Commission and, among other things, provides for Irish citizens and bodies to make loans to Northern Ireland political parties. The order before us sets out the detail of those arrangements, including the conditions that Irish citizens and bodies must meet in order to make loans to Northern Ireland political parties and the steps to be taken by the Electoral Commission to verify such loans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="080625107000024"></a>As my noble friend Lord Rooker explained during the debate in May, we consulted the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments when drafting these orders and concluded that two separate orders would be required to legislate for the regulation of loans in Northern Ireland, and that these orders must be made in sequence. That is why we are discussing the regulation of loans again today. It is our intention that the controls on loans will mirror the scheme regulating political donations in Northern Ireland that began operating in November 2007 and which has been working effectively since then. Neither the Electoral Commission nor the Northern Ireland political parties have advised us of the existence of any significant difficulties with the donations regime. The order before us therefore mirrors the provisions regulating donations to Northern Ireland political parties contained in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (Northern Ireland Political Parties) Order 2007.</p>

<a name="80625-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="080625107000025"></a>Part 2 of the order sets out the conditions that an Irish citizen must meet in order to enter into a loan agreement with a Northern Ireland political party; namely, eligibility to obtain specified documents evidencing their nationality. It also specifies those Irish bodies which may enter into a loan agreement with a Northern Ireland political party. Schedule 1 specifies the information that must be provided to the Electoral Commission in transaction reports relating to Irish lenders. Part 3 sets out the steps that the Electoral Commission must take to verify the information contained in the reports on loans that it receives. The order requires the commission to verify 50 per cent of the reported loans made by individuals and 100 per cent of the reported loans made by bodies. Information provided may be verified by, for example, contacting the bodies listed in Article 11 of the order. During the confidential reporting period, the commission is placed under a duty not to disclose information contained in transaction reports received from Northern Ireland participants during the confidential reporting period. However, under Article 7 the commission is required to publish certain information if it believes on reasonable grounds that a lender was an unauthorised participant. Again, this simply mirrors the provision for donations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="080625107000026"></a>During the debate in May, concerns were expressed in relation to the position of British citizens living in Ireland who may wish to enter into regulated transactions with Northern Ireland political parties. I believe that my noble friend Lord Rooker promised to write to noble Lords, but it appears that the letter has not got through, so I will try to touch on the questions that were raised. In particular, the noble Lord, Lord Laird, asked about those who live in the border areas and consider themselves to be British and not Irish. I would not wish to presume to know the status or nationality of the individuals to whom he refers. Nevertheless, the legislation is clear: they can donate and take part in regulated transactions, which include loans, to a Northern Ireland political party if they are on a UK electoral register or if they are Irish citizens and can satisfy the conditions relating to verification. I reiterate that British citizens, whether they live in Ireland or elsewhere in the world, must be registered on a UK electoral register in order to enter into a regulated transaction with a political party in the

Broadly speaking, it is possible for those living abroad to register as an overseas elector for up to 15 years while living outside the UK. If registered as such, they can donate, enter into loans and vote as an overseas elector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="080625107000027"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Laird, raised a similar point in relation to organisations based in Ireland. Again, I would not wish to presume on the status of these organisations, but would draw his attention to paragraph 4 of the order which, among other things, refers to an &#147;authorised participant&#148; as being a body,</p>
<ul><a name="080625107000034"></a>&#147;which keeps an office in Ireland or Northern Ireland, being an office from which the carrying on of one or more of its principal activities is directed&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="080625107000032"></a>and is,</p>
<ul><a name="080625107000035"></a>&#147;any unincorporated association of two or more persons which does not fall within any of the preceding paragraphs, but which carries on business or other activities wholly or mainly in Ireland&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080625107000033"></a>That seems to be a fairly broad definition that it will be possible for the organisations to which he referred to fall under.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="080625107000028"></a>The broad principles regulating loans to Northern Ireland political parties were approved by the House last month. This order simply sets out the practical details required to give full effect to those principles, and as I mentioned earlier, the provisions contained in the order simply mirror those already in place for regulating donations to Northern Ireland political parties. This order will ensure the successful extension of the political donations scheme to cover loans, and in so doing, represents an important step forward in increasing accountability in the funding of political parties in Northern Ireland.

I am sure that he would have done so tonight had he been here.

It is one thing in England, Wales and Scotland to make this work, but when you have two countries with a border between them, something the other three countries of the United Kingdom do not have, it becomes more difficult. I am sure that, in principle, this will work. It will be positive in funding parties and getting them adequate access to each other across the border, which I believe is right.

We have worked very hard at getting the right balance here. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Smith, for his support. &#147;Another member State&#148; is a member of the EEA, which is the European Union plus Switzerland and one other Scandinavian state. The crucial drafting, which is to stop brass-plate type institutions evading all these regulations, is the second part of paragraph 4, which refers to bodies,</p>
<ul><a name="080625120000030"></a>&#147;which keep an office in Ireland or Northern Ireland being an office from which the carrying on of one or more of its principal activities is directed&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="080625120000007"></a>The order envisages a company that is properly registered in Northern Ireland. However, whatever the other subtleties of incorporation can mean within the EU situation, both conditions must be met, not one or the other. I withdraw my previous statement: &#147;another member State&#148; refers to members of the European Union, not the EEA. I hope that that covers the point.</p>

In general, I look for enlightenment. I beg to move.</p>

We also have amendments in this group: Amendment No. 29 is a probing amendment on the issue of full-time occupation. The clause defines full-time occupation as &#147;at least 20 hours&#148; a week. On what basis was that figure derived? The Government&#146;s consultation paper states that no specific questions were designed to consult on whether 20 hours per week should constitute full-time employment, nor was there even a general question seeking views on where the threshold should lie. The consultation sheet simply asked whether those who are not in employment for a significant part of the week should participate in full-time education. It would be helpful to know why there was no consultation on the number of hours constituting full-time work for the purposes of the legislation. Why could it not, for example, be 16 or 35 hours?</p>

<a name="80625-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="080625120000019"></a>There was specific consultation on whether full-time education should be set at 16 hours per week. Why, then, should 16 hours constitute full-time education when 19 hours per week would not be regarded as full-time employment? Why consult specifically on defining full-time education but not full-time employment? It seems that while those in full-time education are able to undertake appropriate learning opportunities that do not necessarily lead to a qualification, those in a full-time occupation must undergo relevant training or education&#151;in other words, leading to a relevant qualification or course of study that is of use to the employer but not necessarily of interest to the young person.</p>

I am sure that all of the Committee can agree that that sentiment sits well with the aims of the Bill. The use of &#147;relevant&#148; means that the study must lead to accredited qualifications. The Government seem to have a prejudice against non-accredited learning,

<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="080625120000021"></a>My parents had a small cake shop in Farnworth, in the north-west. The young people they employed received first-class training, but it was not accredited. When my parents could, they allowed the young people to go off on day release; when they came back they spent a great deal of time trying to put right the college learning which had no practical application when they were working. Our amendments, therefore, are designed to assist the Government by improving the Bill to take account of in-house training.</p>

We share the desire of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, for more clarification on what constitutes full-time and part-time&#151;for example, why the figure is 20 hours&#151;and that sort of thing. The CBI and the Institute of Directors made it quite clear, in the briefing that we received from them, that in-house training does not necessarily have to lead to accredited qualifications but often involves much learning of skills. They are somewhat wary of all learning having to be accredited. We are getting into a culture of accreditation. As the Minister may know, there is quite a lot of criticism of Train to Gain, where, in many cases, the problem is that employers are doing no more then they did before but are bringing in the assessors so that they can accredit their people with an NVQ level 1 or 2 and claim money from Train to Gain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="080625120000023"></a>In Alison Wolf&#146;s essay on this issue she emphasises the fact that these days many 16 and 17 year-olds&#151;the top 10 per cent of the 25 per cent who are not participating in education post-16&#151;may not receive formal training but are learning many useful skills. Her great fear is that the duties imposed on employers under the Bill will cause them to shy away from employing young people of 16 and 17, so that these young people will no longer acquire the &#147;learning by doing&#148; skills that they had gained from such jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="080625120000024"></a>Having talked with the noble Lord, Lord Layard, who is not in his place at the moment, I think that the really important route to try to develop is apprenticeship&#151;we are probably all agreed on that. Yet if apprenticeships are not available, the danger is that those young people who do not go into jobs will be on what are termed programme apprenticeships in colleges. Those are fine: you train off the job and, if you are lucky, you get a little work experience. However, the employers do not find programme apprenticeships at all satisfactory, and we know that very well from all the information received from them. Alison Wolf is really worried that the young people who had been getting quite useful &#147;learning by doing&#148; training will now get a really unsatisfactory second best.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="080625121000002"></a>I chair the quality and standards committee for the City and Guilds of London Institute. We were recently shown statistics for failure rates in different qualifications. The figure for the plumbing qualifications was particularly interesting. There is quite a high failure rate. We asked for more detail on why there was such a high failure rate and were shown a spread of the different items of the course and what was failed. While the plumbers were doing wonderfully on their practical plumbing and could fix your boiler, put in a central system or fix your leaking tap, they could not write essays. Because the course is accredited and leads to a qualification, the excellent academic standards that come into play as soon as one starts accrediting require that they have to be able to write. I think that most noble Lords in this Committee would agree that, when you call for a plumber when your heating is not working, you do not mind whether he can write an essay about your plumbing; you would quite like him just to fix your boiler.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="080625121000005"></a>All part-time education and training needs to be accredited to qualify under the Bill, because it is important that young people gain qualifications to help them progress in their career. It is important, too, as a guarantor of quality, because employers could otherwise offer any education and training regardless of the quality, and it would count without there being any external check on the process. However, full-time education and training under Clause 4 does not have to lead towards an accredited qualification, because we wish to allow for other categories of education that might be provided, including home education, independent school education&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, keeps reminding me, they do not have to offer just accredited qualifications&#151;and non-formal education. In practice, the Learning and Skills Council funds mainly accredited learning, but other forms of learning may be publicly funded through other local authority funding streams. That may include, for example, the parenting classes about which we spoke earlier. It is possible for parenting classes funded by local authorities not to be accredited but still to attract local authority funding. Developments such as the foundation learning

I hope that that clarifies more fully the position on accreditation.</p>

<a name="80625-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="080625121000006"></a>Why have we set the bar at 20 hours? More than 90 per cent of young people who say that they work full time as their main activity work for more than 20 hours. Some 93 per cent of those who say that they work part time while studying full time work for 20 hours or fewer. Taking those two factors into account, 20 hours seemed to us the right threshold. By contrast, if we had drawn the line for full-time work at 16 hours, as suggested by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, it would catch around 15 per cent of those who study full time and work part time. So it was on the basis of what we regarded as a reasonable assessment of the impact of existing patterns of working and studying that we introduced the threshold that we did. I should mention that, with one day a week in training, work plus training would occupy most of a young person&#146;s week&#151;around four days&#151;at the 20-hour threshold. If the threshold was much lower than this, the young person would not be occupied for most of their time and it would reduce the potential benefits. We have taken all those factors into account when deciding that the 20 hours was an appropriate threshold.</p>

These learning and support contracts are very important. They contain a tailored package of support, as well as specifying the education element. This should enable a young person to take advantage of the right that we all in this Committee want them to have: the opportunity to develop their learning and skills. These contracts also involve their parents or carers. This is important, since the parents or carers can keep a young person motivated.

The local authority undertakes to provide certain services. The young person undertakes to take part in the educational training and accept the support to enable them to do it.

That is why the amendments are supported by the Commission for Equality and Human Rights, as well as Barnardo&#146;s, Rainer and the Special Education Consortium.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="080625121000015"></a>The idea of learning and support contracts is a proven one. It is used by many organisations in the voluntary sector. There are even activity and learning agreements being piloted by Connexions partnerships. These have had encouraging results, as the Government announced fairly recently. Many of Barnardo&#146;s services for young people have an alternative education component because the child has been excluded from school. That organisation has found that agreements that address the underlying difficulties give them the opportunity to re-engage and often lead young people back into the mainstream eventually. Rainer does similar work with homeless young people&#151;those leaving care or young offenders. It has the same experience. Both organisations believe that enforcement should never be used on a child with unmet needs. One of the purposes of the amendments is to get a clear undertaking from the Minister that that will never happen. Spelling out the agreements in guidance would of course be welcome, but, if they are to become routine, they must be put in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="080625121000016"></a>I have tried to get some costings, and there appear to be major cost benefits. In 2001, the DfES estimated that the average cost of a NEET&#151;not in education, employment or training&#151;was about &#163;5,300 in public spending and &#163;5,500 lost from taxes not paid and economic impact not made. Those are the most recent figures that I could get but the costs are probably greater and the loss from taxes and economic impact probably also greater. This means that effectively engaging a young person in education, perhaps in work and training or in apprenticeship, could save more than &#163;10,000 per year. I believe that that is a saving worth making. But the main argument is not an economic one. It is a matter of ensuring that no young person loses out for lack of the appropriate package of support and that no enforcement will take place until they have been offered the right package.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="080625121000017"></a>We have considerable sympathy with the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, on the obligation to fund courses for which presumably there is a demand. We would like to listen to his arguments before definitely making up our minds about his amendment, which is grouped with mine. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="080625121000018"></a><a name="80625-0014.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80625-0014.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="080625121000048"></a>Lord Lucas:</b> Perhaps I had better explain. I cannot do better than to refer to the last speech of the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, when he described how accreditation would work. He said that the LSC would fund the courses that it approved of but, if it was appropriate for someone to have a parenting course, that money would have to come out of other funds that the local authority had available to it. That is exactly the problem with accreditation as it runs now.</p>

<a name="80625-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="080625121000019"></a>There is presumably, when the Minister puts the LSC's budget together, the thought that it will be providing education for all these 16 to 18 year-olds and that is how that budget is calculated. So there is, at least notionally, a pot of money available there for every 16 to 18 year-old. But, if that 16 to 18 year-old ought not to be following one of the courses that the LSC chooses to fund, it has to persuade somebody else, out of some other hard-pressed budget, to spare the money necessary to fund that course, while the money that is in the LSC budget gets used for other purposes. That seems entirely inappropriate. If you have a system that is carefully determining what is right for a particular young person and you have a pot of money that is available to fund whatever is right for that particular young person, the two should coincide. It is therefore important that the local authority, as the person making the decision at the end of the day on what it is prepared to sign up to as being right for the young person, should be able to use the money which has in effect been allocated to that young person by central government for the purposes that are right for the young person and not be bound by whatever prejudices and fashions sway the Learning and Skills Council at that particular moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="080625121000021"></a>The learning and support contracts will be used where the young person concerned is failing to fulfil the duty imposed by Clause 2. We believe that a learning and support contract should always be considered before an attendance notice is issued. By providing a mechanism earlier, before and ideally instead of the enforcement process, our desire is to minimise the chance of enforcement proceedings taking place, because of the damaging effect that they can have on a young person&#146;s prospects.</p>

We are far more likely to achieve increased participation by inspiring and encouraging than by coercion and compulsion. These new contracts would provide a framework for a local authority to agree with a young person and their parent or carer how that young person was to fulfil their duty to participate and how that arrangement was to be supported. By intervening early, we hope to stave off the worst possible outcomes. For that reason I give my wholehearted support to this new clause.</p>

This seems to me to be a constructive and positive approach to intervening with a young person who is showing all the signs of not complying with the provisions of Clause 2. It gives him or her some standing to have a contract. He or she has never had one before. Parents will take an interest in something like that and if, as I would hope, young people who are clearly heading into difficulty have a mentor to help them, this is the kind of document that would give a basis of reference for discussions and encouragement and going to the local authority and saying, &#147;You are not doing your part adequately&#148;. If there is to be an element of compulsion, I welcome this as an important step to try and avoid the need for it.</p>

We are very grateful to the noble Baroness, along with Barnardo&#146;s and Rainer, for highlighting this approach and its benefits. We will be happy to look further at how we can take this forward in concrete terms and I will reflect further on the arguments that she set out. We know that an agreement that a young person has signed up to, where they understand their obligations and the consequences of not fulfilling them, can be very effective. That is how the education maintenance allowance works and it has been a great success in boosting both participation and attainment. We have also extended the conditions for EMAs so that from this coming academic year providers will take into account a young person&#146;s behaviour and progress rather than just their attendance in deciding whether they have fulfilled their obligations for receipt of the EMA.</p>

<a name="80625-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="080625121000025"></a>Contracts or agreements are already widely used with success by voluntary sector organisations, including Barnardo&#146;s and Rainer, in their programmes to re-engage young people and support their transition back to formal learning. The idea has been popular with young people. This something-for-something approach is also the model for our activity agreement and allowance pilots. In these, aimed at 16 and 17 year-olds who are not in education, employment or training, the agreement is tailored to the individual, following an assessment of their needs, and is designed and agreed with them.  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1518"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column 1518</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>We would encourage local authorities to pursue this approach, or similarly successful measures that have been developed locally, before considering taking any more formal enforcement action against a young person under the Bill, and we could specify this in guidance that we will give to local authorities.</p>

<a name="80625-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="080625121000026"></a>I will consider whether there is a case for any reference in primary legislation, but our current thinking is that guidance is the appropriate place for emphasising this approach. The noble Baroness will have heard my concern many times in the past, but it applies here too. If we were to set out requirements in primary legislation, they might risk making learning and support contracts too inflexible to respond to the specific needs of individuals, too formal to be effectively supportive and too prescriptive to allow for other innovative solutions that have been developed locally. However, as I say, I will consider this issue further.</p>

<a name="80625-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="080625121000027"></a>The noble Baroness&#146;s Amendment No. 15 goes further in proposing that participating in a learning and support contract should count as a way in its own right of fulfilling the central duty to participate. While we very much encourage local authorities to pursue a learning and support contract approach or similar measures where appropriate, we do not believe that this should be an alternative route, a way of fulfilling the duty to participate on a par with existing routes. A learning contract is not a form of learning in itself. The contract needs to describe a programme of learning, along with the support needed. It is a tool and approach that can be used to help re-engage young people who have struggled to engage in one of the other routes.</p>

<a name="80625-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="080625121000028"></a>In addition, informal, tailored learning programmes of the kind often provided by voluntary sector organisations, including those we have mentioned, will count under the terms of Clause 4, and the entry to learning approach announced in the Children&#146;s Plan in December will help to ensure that good-quality provision which supports progression into mainstream learning is encouraged and recognised.</p>

<a name="80625-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="080625121000029"></a>While we are glad to see this important practice highlighted, and we are prepared to offer clear assurances that we will continue to seek to promote this contract approach to re-engagement in learning&#151;I will look at whether there is a case for strengthening this in the legislation&#151;we do not think that it should constitute a learning route in itself.</p>

<a name="80625-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="080625121000030"></a>As regards Amendment No. 56 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, at present, the Learning and Skills Council is responsible for ensuring that there is appropriate provision for all 16 to 19 year-olds, and for funding that provision. The overall 16 to 19 budget is planned and allocated by the LSC to respond to learner demand so that all 16 to 19 year-olds who choose to do so have access to suitable provision.</p>

<a name="80625-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="080625121000031"></a>However, we have announced that in future responsibility for commissioning and funding 16 to 19 provision will be transferred from the LSC to local authorities. We published our proposals for consultation in March and, subject to that consultation, will bring forward the necessary legislation in the next session. We expect that the calculation of funding for 16 to 19 courses will operate in the same way when local authorities take over responsibility from 2010-11.</p>

Therefore, we are moving to precisely the regime that he described where budgets are pooled much more effectively at local level, but we require legislation before we can transfer the funding from the Learning and Skills Council to local authorities. That will be forthcoming in the next parliamentary session.</p>

I do not want to be too prescriptive about the way that local authorities work with young people to put the appropriate package of learning and support together.

A number of noble Lords share our feelings that a great many reforms are under way and that to some extent the Government are putting the cart before the horse. We talked earlier about the NEET group at which the Bill is targeted and about the demotivation that many of them experience in the current secondary school curriculum. The reforms are aimed at trying to motivate them better and encourage them to stay in education or enter training after the age of 16.</p>

They will quite possibly learn by doing rather than by cognitive learning and didactic teaching. We feel it is necessary to wait to see whether the reforms work because there is the feeling that we have seen them before. Over the past 25 to 28 years, we have had YOPs, TOPs, GNVQs, TVEIs and vocational A-levels. All have come and gone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="080625128000005"></a>The Tomlinson committee was set up in 2000 to address this issue. For three years, it deliberated with experts on the secondary school curriculum&#151;teachers, academics and laymen. The proposal for the diploma embraced current GCSEs and A-levels but allowed for a degree of flexibility. As well as the introduction of practical modules of learning, those who thrived on the more academic courses could do a bit more practical work. In the event, as we all know, the Government rejected the Tomlinson proposal for overarching diplomas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="080625128000006"></a>The current diploma proposal is a hybrid between the Tomlinson proposal and what the Government wanted. We discussed diplomas during the passage of the Higher Education Act 2004; initially they were called vocational diplomas, only we had to call them specialist diplomas. There were three clear streams&#151;apprenticeship, diploma and GCSE/A-level&#151;with remarkably little flexibility between them. I am glad to say that the Government have shifted their ground somewhat. Partly because of the introduction of the academic diplomas in science, humanities and languages, we are seeing some bridging of the two in the diploma stream. But it is not at all clear how much bridging will be carried out; nor is it clear how far there is going to be flexibility within GCSEs and the level 2 diplomas, because they have not worked themselves out.</p>

We can raise the learning leaving age because everyone will be involved, motivated and wanting to, but if they do not work and we have the same failures that we have seen in the past, it is premature to try to introduce compulsion.</p>

Amendments Nos. 236 and 237, which propose a delay in effect of two years in the introduction of compulsion, pick up the fact that not only are we seeing the introduction at this time of the new diplomas but we are seeing a new curriculum for key stage 3, a changing science curriculum and a changing languages curriculum. We are seeing the A* at A-level and changes in the A-level syllabuses, including an extended essay. All of that means that there are so many changes on the educational scene that it may not be sensible to have a great crescendo of reforms coming at the same time. I beg to move.</p>

She is also right to say that much of the success of this Bill will be predicated on the success of diplomas. We do not yet know what is going to happen there. These amendments would have the effect of delaying the coming into force of the duty until certain conditions have been met. This is necessary to avoid swathes of young people being caught out by a system that was not ready to take them, while they would be left to deal with the consequences. If the Government are going to press ahead with compulsion, we must make sure that it is not the system which is at fault for any avoidable failings.</p>

It would therefore be unforgivable to sweep them up under compulsion into a system that might let them down again. It would be unfair to compel a young person to participate, if in fact he or she was unable to do so. These delaying amendments switch the onus to the state so as to ensure that the necessary funding, framework and organisation is in place before the duty comes into force so that 16 and 17 year olds are not left scrambling for places to avoid falling foul of the law.</p>

If that is so, there should be no need to impose a duty before that 90 per cent target has been achieved. If the Government are serious that the criminal sanctions in the Bill are to be reserved for only the most hard-to-reach 10 per cent, then why allow any of the others to risk being penalised? I would argue that the Government will never realistically reach more than 90 per cent participation and they are likely to get that far with inducements and encouragement alone.

I have been around in education for a long time. While five years seems like a long time, it is not in education terms. I entirely support what the Liberal Democrat spokesman and my noble friend said. It would be common sense to allow the current 11 year-olds to run through with all the innovations that the Government have introduced, many of which we wholeheartedly support, and see what happens at the end of that process, before attempting to implement

Seven years is still quite a short time in educational terms. The nine year-olds who are currently in primary school will surprisingly quickly reach the age of 16; they will go through all the innovations and it may be that the harsher, punitive, provisions of the Bill will simply be unnecessary.</p>

That is precisely why we are not raising the participation age until 2013 for 17 year-olds and 2015 for 18 year-olds when the national entitlement to the new diplomas and the apprenticeship guarantee will be in place and the foundation learning tier for provision at entry and level 1 will be established. Furthermore, the September guarantee, which was implemented for the first time in every local area last year, guarantees an offer of a suitable learning place to all young people leaving year 11. This year it will be extended to 17 year olds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="080625128000014"></a>In respect of planning, the Learning and Skills Council currently has a duty to ensure appropriate provision for all 16 to 19 year-olds. This role includes preparing assessments of the sufficiency of education and training in an area, assessing demand from young people, and planning provision to meet that demand. In March, we published a White Paper which set out our intentions for transferring the funding and responsibility for commissioning provision for 16 to 19 year-olds from the LSC to local authorities. So in future, assessing the sufficiency of provision will become the role of the local authority, which we believe is best placed to make these judgments, which would, under the amendment, fall to central government. We believe it is appropriate that these judgments should be made by local authorities, which, of course, are the strategic commissioners of provision in their areas.</p>

<a name="80625-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="080625128000015"></a>We agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, in respect of her Amendment No. 17, that it will be crucial to successful implementation that participation is as high as possible immediately prior to the new compulsory requirements coming into effect. All our policies that I have described, including the learning agreements and activity agreements that we discussed in the previous group of amendments, are geared to that end. I am in danger of repeating myself, but the latest statistics show that post-16 participation rates are at their highest level ever and are very encouraging: 90.8 per cent of young people currently participate at 16, the first year after compulsory schooling, up from 87 per cent last year; 78.4 per cent of 17 year-olds were participating in education and work-based learning in 2007&#151;up by 1.5 percentage points over the year. The proportion of young people not in education, employment or training has fallen substantially at all three ages and the proportion of 16 and 17 year-olds has declined from 8 per cent to 7.2 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="080625128000016"></a>While we are making good and steady progress towards the 90 per cent participation rate, it would not make sense to link the commencement of the duty on young people to the publication of reports and data,

We believe that we must balance the improvements in train and the judgments we make about the follow-through effects during the next five to seven years, with the need for certainty about what will happen and when, which all of those engaged in planning will require&#151;not least the young people themselves and their parents. Making that judgment about getting the balance right between the need for certainty in the system and ensuring that we have the improvements in train necessary to achieve our objective has led us to setting 2013 and 2015 respectively as the dates for increasing the education ages to 17 and 18.</p>

<a name="80625-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="080625128000017"></a>To repeat myself, when it comes to enforcement, that is subject to the requirement in Clause 39 that local authorities should have regard to reasonable excuses. As I said in the letter, which I once again promise to circulate to Members of the Committee, on 9 June, on what could constitute reasonable excuses, it could be that,</p>
<ul><a name="080625128000027"></a>&#147;if a particular learning difficulty has been identified and the right support to address it is not yet secured or in place, it would be reasonable to expect that the young person could not begin their learning programme until that support was in place&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080625128000024"></a>If we take into account the measures in train to meet the fuller range of learning needs, the evidence of increased participation at the moment and the enhanced role for local authorities to plan locally with the provisions in the Bill, which give a proper balance between compulsion and reasonable excuses for not participating, we believe that the dates of 2013 and 2015 are appropriate.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said the most important thing of all tonight just before we broke for dinner-hour business.

Yes, lots of reforms are in hand and yes, we wish them very well, but given the history of failure on the introduction of practical, more vocational courses, we want to see that the new diplomas are working well before we introduce compulsion and the potential criminalisation of those who are not motivated and do not participate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="080625128000020"></a>The same applies to the apprenticeship group. There will be a duty, initially on the Learning and Skills Council, but it will be transferred to local authorities, to ensure that apprenticeships are available for those who want to take them up. We know that there is a lack of apprenticeships at the moment. It is difficult to persuade employers to enter into apprenticeship schemes. We are well aware that a lot of reforms are at hand, but it is sensible to wait to see whether they are satisfactory before trying to push people to stay on in compulsory education. As the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, said, five years is quite a short time in education.

I recognise that one reason why we have a five-year lead-in is that it is this year&#146;s 11 year-olds who will be affected and who, in 2013, will be expected to stay on until they are 17 and then, in 2015, two years later, those who are nine at the moment will be expected to stay in education or training until they are 18.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="080625128000021"></a>If we look back to the raising of the school leaving age, there was not a very long lead-in then. If you have successful reforms in hand, you do not necessarily need a five-year or seven-year lead-in; a three-year lead in would be perfectly adequate.

<a name="80625-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="080625131000002"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 21, 54 and 55. These amendments make a similar point to the last group. We must not dictate that young people must take up apprenticeships if those apprenticeships are lacking in number and quality. If we are going to make vocational training the viable and respected alternative to academic qualifications that we know it to be, it should go without saying that the apprenticeships themselves should be viable and respected. This should mean practical, hands-on learning. Taking an apprenticeship in plumbing solely using a computer simulation surely cannot be a substitute for dismantling a real water pipe and learning how to use tools in the real world. This is only one example; I could cite many. I was amused by the anecdote of my noble friend Lady Perry. I do not want my plumber to be able to write a thesis; I only want him to be able to do his job in the most effective and practical way.</p>

<a name="80625-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="080625131000003"></a>Delaying the onset of the duty would allow the Learning and Skills Council to gauge what works and in what capacity. This is surely preferable simply to saying &#147;go&#148; and expecting everything to fall into place. Amendment No. 21 would impose a condition that the Secretary of State must certify that a sufficient number of contracts of apprenticeship are available before the duty applies. This is an important safeguard. I think the Minister would agree that if the terms of the amendment are not met, the Bill simply will not work. At the moment there is a shortage of apprenticeship places, owing to a lack of employer engagement. As a result, the Government have consistently missed their target for the number of apprenticeships.</p>

<a name="80625-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="080625131000004"></a>In 2003, the Prime Minister, who was then Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced that apprenticeship numbers would rise to 320,000 by 2006. In fact, there were only 239,000 apprentices in training in 2006-07, and numbers are falling, as was confirmed by the figures published just before Christmas. Numbers are not only falling at

The Government have a long way to go if there are to be enough apprenticeship places to make the duties implicit in the Bill a reality. If they do not provide additional apprenticeship places, how could they possibly oblige young people to sign up to them? The aim of these amendments is to make sure that the Bill works when it comes into force.</p>

<a name="80625-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="080625131000005"></a>Amendment No. 54 relates to the sufficiency of provision. Clause 10 imposes a duty on local authorities to promote participation in education and training. That ought to mean that local authorities have a duty to make sure that there is sufficient educational provision to help young people to fulfil their duty to participate, but there is no specific duty linking the provision of educational facilities to the duty of all young people to participate. There is a danger of complacency by local authorities. Amendment No. 55 would require Ofsted to conduct an annual audit of the sufficiency and diversity of educational provision in local authorities, in order to assess their adequacy for fulfilling their duties. It seems only right that if we are placing 16 and 17 year-olds under a duty, or if we are asking them to face sanctions, we should look at local authorities on an annual basis to make sure that they are upholding their side of the duties. I beg to move.</p>

As I mentioned on the previous set of amendments, in many senses apprenticeships are the most satisfactory route for young people who have a more practical bent and wish to learn by doing. At present there are far too few apprenticeships and considerable excess demand. The Government are coming forward with new proposals, which will be contained in the Bill that we will see next year. They are setting up a national apprenticeship service.</p>

<a name="80625-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="080625131000007"></a>I am not sure how far the Government are moving in this direction but if we are to see an expansion of apprenticeship places there has to be, first, some subsidising of apprenticeships, particularly for small and medium-sized companies. At the moment there is a degree of confusion because, through the train to gain programme, companies can receive funding for putting their employees through NVQ level 2 qualifications and yet, by contrast, they have to pay apprentices an apprentice wage and have to make a contribution towards their training costs.</p>

<a name="80625-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="080625131000008"></a>On the evidence we have received from the CBI and the Institute of Directors, both large and small companies find that there is excessive red tape surrounding apprenticeships. The CBI noted that 81 per cent of large companies, which have the capability to handle these matters, find that there is excessive red tape and a lack of suitable candidates for their apprenticeships. I am aware that the introduction of functional maths, functional English and functional ICT may help in providing more suitable candidates.</p>

<a name="80625-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="080625131000009"></a>There is not a clear route at the moment between diplomas and apprenticeships. It is not clear whether young people from the age of 14, if they opt for one of the diploma routes, will have preferential consideration for going into apprenticeships. This needs to be clarified,

We do not necessarily want a dedicated route in this development. However, because many small and medium-sized companies find not only that there is an excessive amount of red tape but that apprentices are rather expensive to cope with, the notion of some sort of subsidy is appropriate.</p>

<a name="80625-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="080625131000010"></a>Perhaps the Government will consider introducing in the Bill that they are going to bring forward the notion that all companies that have public sector contracts should be required to take on apprentices and to declare how many apprentices they are training. I know that that proposal is not appropriate for this Bill, but I hope the Government will consider putting it in the next Bill.</p>

<a name="80625-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="080625131000011"></a>We have a great deal of sympathy for Amendments Nos. 18 and 21 but, as we said on a previous occasion, we will have to wait and see how the diplomas work. The apprenticeship route is important but at the moment we have no idea whether we will be able to ensure the supply of apprenticeships that we are promised. I assume that the requirement will transfer from the LSC to the local authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="080625131000012"></a>On Amendments Nos. 54 and 55, again the sufficiency and diversity of local authority provision is an important issue.

I acknowledge what the noble Baroness said, that the overall number of apprentices in learning declined slightly in the past year. However, this needs to be seen in the context of very significant improvements in completion; it is completed apprenticeships that carry most value. The number of apprenticeship completions has risen from barely 40,000 in 2001-02 to nearly 100,000 in the current year. This represents a rising completion rate from 24 per cent.</p>

However, I will look at the specific point raised by the noble Baroness and see if I have any further information. The information I have is that the level 3 proportion is holding up.</p>

<a name="80625-0015.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="080625131000020"></a>Given the increase in the number of apprenticeships over the past 10 years, plus the improvement in the completion rate, we believe that our ambitions in respect of apprenticeships are realistic. The apprenticeship review was jointly published by my right honourable friends the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families and the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills on 28 January. It not only restated our intention to put in place an apprenticeship entitlement for every suitably qualified young person who wants one by the time this legislation comes into effect, but also introduced other reforms to improve the regime for apprenticeships including, crucially, the creation of a new national apprenticeship service, which will provide a single point of advice and guidance for any employer interested in apprenticeships, alongside the Apprenticeship Ambassadors Network, which we hope will continue its good work in promoting apprenticeships to employers. But I accept the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, that the public sector has an important part to play in this too and its contribution will be fully galvanised by the national apprenticeship service.</p>

<a name="80625-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="080625131000021"></a>We are also looking for a more flexible and responsive model for apprenticeships to be developed by the national apprenticeship service. Employers will be allowed to submit their own frameworks for funding by drawing from a sector skills council bank of qualifications. All apprentice experience will be recognised as an apprenticeship, meaning that apprenticeship training that does not rely on public funds will still be recorded and recognised and, as the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, said, more apprenticeships will be delivered through Train to Gain, which is the Government&#146;s primary skills service for employers in England.</p>

<a name="80625-0015.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="080625131000022"></a>Taking all these factors into account and in the light of the remarkable growth that we have seen in apprenticeships in the past 10 years&#151;both in overall numbers and in completions&#151;we believe that the goals we have set are realistic. The commitments that come in for apprenticeships alongside the raising of the education and training participation age make this increase credible.</p>

But from what the Minister was saying, perhaps there has been a change in the rules and they can use this money to fund apprenticeships.</p>

I think that the noble Lord said that completed apprenticeships had risen to 100,000, but that leaves a great number of young people who are not finishing them. It is still possible to complete an apprenticeship without going anywhere near a workplace, which turns many young people off. A lot of it is still too classroom based. We are also concerned that a number of employers are just not engaging in providing more apprenticeships, especially in small and medium-sized enterprises.

<p><a name="st_204"></a>
<a name="080625133000008"></a><a name="80625-0015.htm_spnew24"></a><b><a name="80625-0015.htm_spnew25"></a><a name="080625133000037"></a>Baroness Walmsley:</b> Noble Lords will be pleased to hear that, although I cannot promise to be quite as succinct as the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, with his two-word response a few moments ago, I have no intention of wearying the Committee by going through all the arguments again. They have already been debated very effectively. I shall summarise the three main points. Clause 2 is at the heart of the compulsion element of the Bill, with which many of us have difficulty. I shall do something I do not often do: give the Minister an opportunity to shut me up and possibly even shut up some of the Official Opposition Front Bench as well. I say that because this issue is one of the two main points on which both main opposition Benches are united, so the Minister could get through the Government&#146;s business a lot quicker and save us trouble if he accepts that this clause should not stand part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80625-0015.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="080625133000009"></a>The first of the three main arguments is that we believe that compulsion is wrong in principle because it moves the duty from the parent to the child. It is contrary to both the spirit and the letter of a number of international conventions to which this country is a party. The other two points are that compulsion is not necessary and that it could do harm. It is unnecessary because a number of changes are in the pipeline which we have debated in the last couple of groups that may well continue to reduce the number of NEETs, at which this Bill is targeted. The Government should certainly wait and see how well their initiatives work out before introducing compulsion. I say that particularly in the light of the fact that compulsion will not necessarily lead to quality participation and actual achievement of qualifications. It could simply secure bodies on seats behind desks. The point about it possibly being harmful is that compulsion could turn young people

That is the last thing we want.</p>

<a name="80625-0016.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="080625133000010"></a>If we really want children to benefit from their entitlement to levels 2 and 3 tuition, we should let them choose how, when and where to do it. Any of us who have taught will know only too well that young people who choose to do so learn effectively, while those attending under sufferance do not.</p>

I agree with much of what the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said.</p>

<p><a name="st_206"></a>
<a name="080625133000012"></a><a name="80625-0016.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80625-0016.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="080625133000039"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> I sense that we are going through the motions slightly, having had an extremely long debate that went through all the arguments, so I shall simply recap what I said earlier. As the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, so rightly put it, we need many more carrots than sticks, and the whole emphasis of government policy is to provide more carrots for young people to participate. We believe that by doing so we will significantly improve participation rates; indeed the evidence already shows that those rates are improving.</p>

<a name="80625-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="080625133000013"></a>However, it is our view that no young person should be outside the education and training system before 18 unless there is some compelling reason which would constitute a reasonable excuse under Clause 39. As we have teased out the arguments more fully this evening, I am left wondering quite where the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, stands on this, as she and the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, appeared to support the Government&#146;s view that increased participation is a good thing. It is difficult for a politician to start making judgments on the quality of participation, and it is hard enough tracking the figures. If we assume that increased participation is a good thing, the question then arises&#151;and the noble Baroness is sitting resolutely on the fence&#151;whether increased participation is a good thing. The evidence is that having carrots and sticks together will increase participation, including the sticks.</p>

<a name="80625-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="080625133000014"></a>In an earlier debate I understood the noble Baroness to be saying that she accepted that sticks, as applied in legislation in other countries that I set out as operating on a similar basis to here, might improve participation. Is that then a price worth paying to improve participation? If the noble Baroness is saying that her party would settle for significantly lower rates of participation in return for not having the ultimate sanction of compulsion, then I would be glad if she said so on Report, because then we can have a straightforward argument about whether this country requires higher rates of participation if the next generation are going to be economically and socially successful.</p>

<a name="80625-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="080625133000015"></a>I shall make the argument, with all the power I can bring to this Despatch Box, that it is absolutely vital for the future of this country that as near to 100 per cent of young people as possible should be engaged in education and training. That investment will repay dividends many times over for them if they are engaged in education and training. As a Parliament we should not start permitting young people to drop out simply  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1530"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column 1530</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>as a matter of free will when the evidence is that providing the courses and providing an ultimate sanction would encourage them to invest in their own education and training, which will repay dividends for them economically and socially.</p>

<p><a name="st_207"></a>
<a name="080625133000016"></a><a name="80625-0016.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80625-0016.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="080625133000040"></a>Baroness Morris of Bolton:</b> I agree with everything that the Minister said, but is he telling us that he is happy to criminalise young people? If you take the sanctions to their ultimate conclusion, that is what you are saying.</p>

<p><a name="st_208"></a>
<a name="080625133000017"></a><a name="80625-0016.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80625-0016.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="080625133000041"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> The noble Baroness uses emotive words. Am I saying that there should ultimately be a sanction for those who are not participating, in the context of significantly improved provision and of Clause 39, which ensures that reasonable excuses will be entertained and that there is a proper process? Yes, I do believe that it is appropriate that there should be such a sanction in the context of the overpowering need for higher rates of participation in education and training for the good of the individuals concerned and of the country.</p>

<a name="80625-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="080625133000018"></a>Finally, at this late hour, I return the question to the noble Baroness. I would be very interested to know whether she thinks it would be good for the country and for the individuals themselves that they do not participate in education and training simply as a quid pro quo for our not having to take on board the duties set out in the Bill. If that is her view, we have a fundamental disagreement, which I look forward to rehearsing further on Report. The arguments that she would then set out about the freedom for people not to engage and about this being a matter for the individual and not for the state were precisely those used against raising the school leaving age in the 1960s and the move towards compulsory primary education by the late Victorians. I have no doubt that when future generations look at these debates, they will realise that the cause of progress lay on the side of those who were prepared to invest significantly in increased education and training provision for 16, 17 and 18 year-olds and were ultimately prepared to make it a responsibility of those young people to invest in their own future.</p>

The facts that the Minister gave us are absolutely clear. Some countries with sanctions are ranked seventh or even 15th in the OECD league tables; others that have none are right up in second, third or fourth place. The noble Baroness might wish to take on board that, by saying that we do not wish to see compulsion, we are not condemning this country to having a residue of young people who do not participate.</p>

It is not that other countries have been unable to achieve higher rates of participation than us without compulsion post-16; I fully accept that some have. The issue which we have to address&#151;and will do further on Report&#151;is whether, taking a full judgment  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1531"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column 1531</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the case, this country is likely to get significantly improved rates of participation in education and training by setting out the requirements in the Bill. Most of those requirements, of course, apply to public authorities to make provision to meet the real needs of young people, and so on, but that package of reforms ultimately includes a sanction. The issue for us is whether, taking account of international practice and a judgment that we make about the likely effect of reforms here, it will significantly improve participation.</p>

<a name="80625-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="080625133000021"></a>My contention, on the basis of the evidence that we have, including evidence from those parts of Australia and Canada that have reformed recently, is that we would be likely to see a significant increase in participation if we implemented the whole package of measures in the Bill, which includes the ultimate element of compulsion. I think that the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, wishes to be regarded as a progressive on these matters. That being the case, does she think it better to have lower rates of participation, with fewer 17 and 18 year-olds engaging in education and training and attaining the qualification levels that they can by so engaging, in order not to have to address the issue of compulsion? That is a respectable position, but it is precisely the one that has been used in the past, not by progressives but by reactionaries who have not wished to extend rights to education and training meaningfully over the past 100 years.</p>

Let me be clear: I believe that, for most young people and for society as a whole, increasing their educational qualifications is a good thing. In a free society we can offer good things to many citizens, yet we should not force them to accept them at any particular moment. Despite the fact that I agree with the noble Lord&#146;s objective, I feel that, while it is vital to upskill and increase the qualifications of as many members of society as we can, there is more than one way of skinning a cat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="080625133000023"></a>The Minister puts before me only two options: compulsion, or people deciding that they are not going to upskill or increase their qualifications. He suggests that I might for some reason think that a good thing. I do not, but there is a third option that we should do everything we can to encourage: to enable and to remove barriers for all our young citizens to increase their qualifications and get into the workforce as productive members of society, not least because, if they do not, they run the risk of being idle and then getting into the criminal justice system, which none of us wants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="080625133000024"></a>If a young person decides that they do not want to continue in some form of education and training between 16 and 18, it is not necessarily the case that they will never come back to education and training. They very well may. We are obliged to do everything in our power to convince them and make the case.</p>

<a name="80625-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="080625133000025"></a>One of the joys of debate in your Lordships&#146; House is that, on the whole, the Government do not get their business through unless they have won the argument. That is what I should like to see with young people. We should do everything that we can to provide the options and the support, and to ensure that the quality is right. We should also convince them that it is in their own interests to participate in some form of further education and training beyond the age of 16, because it is for their own good&#151;most people ultimately have self-interest at heart. That is what we should want to see.</p>

<a name="80625-0016.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="080625133000026"></a>I say in answer to the Minister&#146;s question that I do not accept either of his options; I think that there is a third way, which is the direction in which the Government are moving. They are doing everything they can to provide the options and the support, and to ensure that people&#146;s special needs are taken into consideration. However, we all need to see those firmly in place as an entitlement before any suggestion of compulsion. The noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, said forcefully that it is the implementation, not the rhetoric or even the legislation, that matters most.</p>

</ul>
<a name="80625-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000008"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a simple amendment, which would require any new power station that uses coal as fuel to produce a minimum of 10 per cent of its output through the co-firing of biomass. We have already had quite a detailed discussion on the pros and cons of using biomass in the generation of electricity from coal-fired power stations, and a number of power stations in the pipeline at the moment have met a great deal of opposition because of the carbon content and dirty nature of coal and its CO2 emissions.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000009"></a>This would be a way of ameliorating the effect of any new-build coal-fired power stations, if such power stations have to be built in the future, and would be a sensible way forward. A target of 10 per cent is not too high, because it is achievable. It would lead to great savings in CO2. It is estimated that the co-firing at Drax will save about 3 million tonnes of CO2. If we are talking about new power stations, we really must think about how we can do everything in our power to reduce the carbon content of the fuel mix. The amendment would be a sensible solution.

One&#146;s mind goes back to the most significant biomass demonstration plant in this country&#151;the so-called ARBRE project&#151;which failed, largely because the distance that one has to carry the biomass source in order to reach the place where it is to be burnt outweighs any possible advantage, certainly of cost, of having a biomass plant. That is often neglected in this argument. We have had a lot of argument about whether it competes with food products and so on. That argument has reached the point where there is good biomass and bad biomass, and anything that competes with food in the present world is properly regarded as bad biomass. If you take the other costs into account, one must realise what the results can be.</p>

<p><a name="08062593000011"></a>I saw a figure a few years ago, which I do not think has ever been doubted. I quoted it in public. It was suggested that instead of having nuclear power stations we should have far more biomass sources, but I was told that if you were going to replace just one nuclear power station&#151;the example was Dungeness B in Kent&#151;you would have to plant with willow coppicing, or whatever you were going to use, the entire undeveloped area of Kent that was not already towns and cities. That is wholly ludicrous. One would never dream of doing anything like that. It would be absolutely nonsensical.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000012"></a>I therefore have doubts about the practicality of the noble Lord&#146;s amendment, although I understand his objective. Clearly biomass should be used where it can be used economically and properly, because it is a rotating source; as you burn and emit carbon, the carbon can be soaked up again through the successive planting of the biomass. I understand that, and I think it has a part to play, but I would be very cautious about trying to impose the sort of obligation suggested in the proposed new clause.</p>

That raises severe practical questions, of not only the economic cost but the CO2 cost of transporting biomass over a large area. My question about the amendment is not with the spirit in which it was moved&#151;I am all in favour of biomass, and my house in Scotland has been heated by a wood-burning stove cheaply, effectively and successfully for many years&#151;but there are practicalities which putting a precise figure on does not take account of.</p>

<p><a name="08062593000016"></a><a name="80625-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80625-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08062593000095"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am grateful to the Members of the Committee who have contributed to this short debate. As has been indicated, we are all in agreement with the amendment&#146;s broad objective of seeking to increase the use of biomass. However, the amendment is not necessary, and it may even be detrimental to our objective of increasing the amount of biomass burned by coal-fired power stations.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000017"></a>The amendment proposes that any new-build, coal-fired power-generation plant should have the capability for a minimum of 10 per cent of its output to come from the co-firing of biomass. The use of biomass as a renewable energy source can be beneficial to the environment, of course, and can make a real contribution to the UK Government&#146;s renewable energy and carbon emission targets and obligations. Therefore, we share the noble Lord&#146;s ambitions to see a greater use of biomass, which is why we already have a number of support mechanisms in place to incentivise its use, including the support offered by the renewables obligation, which we discussed on earlier amendments to the Bill.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC617"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column GC617</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80625-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000018"></a>The amendment would not enhance the existing incentivisation framework, partially for the reasons identified by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin. Let me make the obvious point. All existing coal-fired plants in the UK are already capable of carrying out co-firing, and most are in fact doing so on either a trial or a commercial basis. There is no technical barrier to generating 10 per cent of power from co-firing of biomass in existing or any conceivable future coal plants, so the amendment is not necessary. The capability to carry out co-firing does not necessarily mean that it will be undertaken.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000019"></a>If we put a target in legislation, albeit a minimum one, it could send a signal to the marketplace that the Government&#146;s preferred level of co-firing is 10 per cent. However, higher levels of co-firing may be achieved both economically and sustainably. Having what looked like a target in the legislation could hinder higher levels of co-firing that could be achieved by the economic incentives already available. The renewables obligation, the climate change levy exemption certificates and the EU ETS already provide, and will continue to provide, an effective incentivisation regime for co-firing with biomass. Those incentives are already having effect.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000020"></a>Therefore, I hope that the Committee will appreciate that there are no technical obstacles to the co-firing of biomass in existing or any future coal-fired plants, that the economic incentives are already available to promote the use of this technology, that the Government are four-square with the noble Lord in wishing to see the use of biomass and that the amendment would not add anything to what we already have. It might be mistaken by its 10 per cent figure for some kind of limiting target, when that is not the long-term view that the Government are taking about developing the use of biomass. I hope that he will take delight in the assurance that I seek to give from this Dispatch Box about our commitment to his objectives. This is a disagreement about means.</p>

It is certainly not euphoria. I am slightly disappointed with the Minister&#146;s reply because we are talking about only a capability. I take on board the point that the market might see it as a 10 per cent target. However, we are missing an opportunity if we do not discuss this with the planners to ensure that the capability is in place for a small target of biomass, considering a number of options that would have to be considered if biomass were introduced at a later date. If the ability for dealing with biomass was included in the planning process and thought out beforehand, stations would not have to be redesigned. That would be more acceptable than if the Government&#151;as they probably will&#151;introduce biomass targets in the future.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000022"></a>I take on board the Minister&#146;s point that all coal-fired power stations have the ability to fire biomass. The issue that I have is that, as with carbon storage and capture, we have to have the ability and the space to handle this type of fuel source. I am slightly disappointed, but, on that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000025"></a>The noble Baroness said: The noble Lord, Lord Whitty, was going to speak to Amendments Nos. 64 to 66, but he kindly sent me a note to say that he was not able to be here. I hope that he is here in spirit if not in body.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000026"></a>The Bill primarily concerns the production of energy and generation of electricity, but it is scanty about what happens when the energy gets to homes and businesses. That is a dangerous oversight, for not focusing on efficiency in homes and businesses can have a serious impact on our energy security as well as our emissions. Reductions can and need to be made. The new clause that we are proposing would require the Secretary of State to make a report on energy use in homes and businesses. That report would be done with an eye to locating instances where efficiencies could be made. In 2005, UK CO2 emissions totalled 550 million tonnes of carbon, 27 per cent of which comes from the energy that we use to heat, light and power our homes, yet only 10 million or 40 per cent of our homes are sufficiently insulated. That fact seems shameful when one considers that around a third of the heat loss from an insulated house is lost through the walls. Proper installation would fix that and take around &#163;90 a year off energy bills.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000027"></a>Not only would that benefit the average consumer, it would help the industry in the UK as a whole. It would save &#163;720 million-worth of energy and 9 million tonnes of carbon&#151;the equivalent of the power required to supply 1.8 million homes. Strides are being made by businesses that encourage insulation and other energy-saving measures. However, there needs to be a shift towards a more serious consumer awareness of the importance of energy efficiency. As my friend Charles Hendry said in another place, we in this country are not very good at switching things off. According to the Energy Saving Trust, leaving mobile-phone chargers and lights on contributes an additional 43 million tonnes of CO2 annually to the atmosphere. The estimated energy loss for the period 2006-10 is &#163;11 billion. The UK could reduce its electricity requirements by 3 per cent simply by switching things off when they are not in use. I do not need to expound further on the benefits that that would bring to our energy security and our efforts at mitigating climate change. An annual report would be a welcome first step in analysing where further efficiencies can be found. If we are going to effect change in the way we think about energy, we must remember all the different places where savings can be made. I beg to move.</p>

Therefore, I very much doubt that the Minister will accept this amendment, but it is worth raising the issue.</p>

<p><a name="08062593000029"></a><a name="80625-gc0001.htm_spnew12"></a><b><a name="80625-gc0001.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="08062593000099"></a>Lord Palmer:</b> I, too, support this amendment. Part of this is a matter of education. This morning, all the blinds in your Lordships&#146; Library were drawn down and every light was burning brightly. If we learn from our own doorstep, we could do an enormous amount to educate other people.</p>

<p><a name="08062593000030"></a><a name="80625-gc0001.htm_spnew14"></a><b><a name="80625-gc0001.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="08062593000100"></a>Baroness Carnegy of Lour:</b> I support this amendment. It is the other side of what we have been discussing. We have got to change our habits. I am not sure that I mind too much that there is not legislation about what we do about switching off the lights, but we have to change habits and fashion. The high cost of fuel will change our habits a bit. People are beginning to think about it.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000031"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Palmer, spoke about the Library, which reminded me of a point I want to make. In advocating fuel efficiency, I hope the Government will not go too far on the type of electric light bulbs we use. Those of us who are a bit older, whose sight is suffering from years of use, need a bright light to read. Our Library now has low-efficiency light bulbs. I cannot read in the evening. I have nothing wrong with my sight, except Anno Domini, but I cannot read in the Library unless I am near the window and, of course, as the evening goes on, it gets dark. As we have a great many older people in our population, it is important not to force them to read with too low a level of light. I hope the Government are not going to go in that direction. One European country has made it compulsory&#151;I think it is Germany&#151;and I was sorry to see that. It is a mistake.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000032"></a>However, we must alter our habits. We must improve on only 40 per cent of houses being insulated. The further north in the country, the more important that is. There is no question that if one lives further north, or over the border, as I do, there is a difference in temperature and the amount of fuel one uses throughout the winter compared with down here. Insulation in northern parts is even more crucial, and people should be made aware of it.</p>

<p><a name="08062593000033"></a><a name="80625-gc0001.htm_spnew16"></a><b><a name="80625-gc0001.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="08062593000101"></a>Lord O'Neill of Clackmannan:</b> It is important that any legislation on energy should be tested for energy efficiency, but the Long Title does not suggest that there is much scope for that. The amendments tabled by my noble friend Lord Whitty require some explanation in so far as Clause 80 makes a number of references to reports, and it would be useful if we could get a lay person&#146;s guide to that clause in the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000034"></a>I think it is fair to say that pretty well from the word go in this Committee noble Lords have been asking for reports and have been redirected to other reports. If they had done a wee bit of work they would probably have found that out, or the Library would have guided them. Without wishing to be unduly if not characteristically churlish, I shall move on from that point.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000035"></a>The purpose of the legislation is clear: to pave the way for nuclear, provide better facilities in relation to gas storage, and tie up one or two loose ends. We will  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC620"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column GC620</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be experiencing for months and probably years ever increasing energy bills, so it is incumbent on the Government that greater attention is paid to energy efficiency. The cuts in Defra&#146;s budget, which I know are not the responsibility of my noble friend, mean that the finance for other shortcomings&#151;the warm zones budget, for example&#151;will be cut in real terms next year. That is one of the most effective ways of securing energy efficiency in poorer areas where houses are not so well insulated and people are less able to pay or take better care of their electricity consumption.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000036"></a>It is important to touch on this issue. I know that it is not wholly relevant. My experience in the other place was that the Clerks and Chairs used to be rather more savage in their reluctance to accept such amendments, or to allow debate. I do not want to stray too far from what I consider to be in order as the purpose of the Bill is not to deal with energy efficiency in the way in which the amendments suggest, but I would like to think that the message could go to those who make these decisions in government. With all due respect to my noble friend, I realise that it is not always within his say-so, but it would be useful to have comprehensive legislation to deal with energy efficiency and fuel-poverty matters before too long. Technical, structural amendments to existing legislation would facilitate better consideration of these matters than they are currently receiving in the legislative programme of this Government.</p>

<p><a name="08062593000037"></a><a name="80625-gc0001.htm_spnew18"></a><b><a name="80625-gc0001.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="08062593000102"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> I take up the point of the noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill. It is all very well for the Government to say, as they did frequently in the other place when amendments were tabled, &#147;This is not in the Bill&#148;. If we look at the list of new clauses that appear either after Clause 79 or before Clause 80, we can see that there is a whole range of issues that Parliament would like to be dealt with in an energy Bill. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill, that the Bill has important points. It is about facilitating nuclear energy, dealing with gas and CO2 storage, and all the other measures that we have been debating, but it is naive of the Government to imagine that they can introduce a Bill and not recognise that the concerns of Parliament and increasing numbers of the public go rather wider. This Energy Bill is before us and we should be entitled to debate such things. I hope that if one makes a sufficient case, eventually the House may be persuaded, as it has been on previous energy Bills, to insert amendments dealing with matters that were not originally in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000038"></a>All those who have spoken have referred to the extraordinary difficulty of persuading millions of ordinary citizens to change how they do things; we are creatures of habit. It is difficult when one is faced with a new overriding need&#151;fighting climate change, a new development in this context&#151;to recognise that people must change their way of living to contribute to dealing with these threats.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000039"></a>By far the single most important stimulus to change in this area is price. Some people have argued, for instance, that transport prices are almost inelastic. Well, one only has to study the recent figures in this country, Europe and the United States to see the swift response to the soaring price of petrol at the pumps.  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC621"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column GC621</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>People are driving less and more slowly. They are buying more energy-efficient cars and trucks. That is happening much more quickly than one might anticipate if one merely looks at the economists&#146; arguments.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000040"></a>The same is true of household expenditure. People now feel that they have a duty to switch off lights. I wholly agree with those who say that the public sector is not very good at that. One drives around Whitehall, and the lights seem to be on all night. Why? The public notice these things. I have heard, as have others, the argument, &#147;Why should we take this seriously if the authorities obviously don&#146;t?&#148;. It is a question of setting an example, which is a perfectly good way of bringing this before the public. However, trying to get ordinary members of the public, who do not read lengthy reports on company websites, to recognise that there must be a change is important.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000041"></a>I do not want to anticipate my later arguments on the new clause on targeting groups, which I indicated that I would raise on the Bill; we will deal with that when we come to it. However, there must be increasing awareness of what households and businesses can and should do to curb their energy consumption and contribute to reducing carbon emissions, and that should be a continuing programme. It is as much for the energy industries themselves to do this; they send their bills with leaflets and everything into everybody&#146;s houses. These must be carefully pitched so that ordinary citizens who do not normally read the guff that comes with their bill can be persuaded to do so, and see what they can do.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000042"></a>It must now become much easier to get a wide variety of efficient, energy-saving light bulbs. The supermarket that my wife and I shop at has a selection, but it does not cover everything we need. I entirely sympathise with my noble friend Lady Carnegy that many of these lights are rather dim. My mind goes back to the wise words of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel when this was all introduced at the Copenhagen conference. She said that it was all very well, but if you dropped something on a patterned carpet you could not see it. We have all had experience of that, and it becomes more difficult as one gets older. One must have more readily available and efficient low-energy light bulbs. Some of them that I have been able to buy were very expensive. The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, has constantly assured the House of Lords that prices are coming down as this becomes increasingly apparent. However, anything that contributes to availability would have my support, and the amendment could be a useful contribution.</p>

It is obvious that there is not a lot of information available to help one fully understand the profile of consumption in individual households in the United Kingdom. This morning, as a part of that work and not particularly on this amendment, I talked to British Gas, which has had a dual supply system, to work out what information  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC622"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column GC622</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it held on the profile when it does the annual consumption calculator assessment of the number of units of gas or electricity each household might need. I tried to find out what estimates it makes, but its information is very general. We discussed one, two, three and four-bedroomed houses, because, ultimately, this discussion is about house sizes and footages, and the amount of energy calculated to be required in each household. I support this amendment because it might give the Government the opportunity to acquire from the utilities information to help those involved in energy conservation to draw up new rules and new measures which would help in that general programme.</p>

<p><a name="08062593000044"></a><a name="80625-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80625-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08062593000104"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I thank Members of the Committee who have taken part in this debate. The noble Baroness, not for the first time, raises an important issue; namely, energy consumption. A similar amendment was tabled in the other place. Let me reiterate some of the points that were made. Saving energy, or energy efficiency, is a key part of our strategy to tackle climate change and to help ensure secure supplies of energy. Reducing energy consumption can help towards our goal of reducing carbon emissions as well as helping with security of energy supply by reducing the need for energy imports and reducing the new investment needed in large-scale electricity generation.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000045"></a>Fully implemented, the measures set out in the 2007 White Paper are projected to deliver an additional 7 million to 12 million tonnes of carbon savings. As the Committee will know, our policies include helping consumers make more informed decisions about the energy they use through improved awareness, information and services, raising standards for the products we buy, and increasing the energy performance of new homes and buildings. We have also increased the obligation on energy suppliers to deliver carbon savings and energy-efficiency measures in existing domestic homes, including through loft and cavity wall insulation.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000046"></a>For the largest industrial users of energy, the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, which we talked about yesterday, together with the climate change levy and climate change agreements, incentivise companies to improve their energy efficiency and to save energy. We have also recently announced the carbon reduction commitment, which I believe Members of the Committee have already considered. That commitment will drive energy and carbon savings in the large non-energy intensive sector which includes companies such as banks and supermarkets.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000047"></a>Obviously, communicating information and advice on energy-efficiency measures and benefits to householders is a key plank of our strategy for reducing energy efficiency. We have provided &#163;100 million funding for the Green Homes service with the Energy Saving Trust to provide a single point of contact for advice. In addition, as part of the wider Act on CO2 campaign, we have launched the carbon calculator, which allows householders to calculate their carbon emissions and provides suggestions on how to reduce them through improved energy efficiency.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000048"></a>In other words, I want to stress that this is an issue the Government take very seriously. The point has been made that it does not play a part in this legislation, but we do not believe that new primary legislation is  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC623"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column GC623</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>necessary to help us drive our energy-efficiency strategy. However, I listened with care, as I always do, to what my noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill said on that and would be grateful if later, outside the Committee, he would give some examples of where he thinks that it will be useful for future legislation to deal with energy efficiency. We should beware Bills that put in everything covered by a topic. We have all seen Bills that are top-heavy and have too much about too much in them. This Bill has a specific purpose and primary legislation on the subject is not necessary. I hope that I have an ally in the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, on this at least. Of course, the issue is a crucial part of our strategy for tackling climate change and will remain so.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000049"></a>The question therefore is about whether we should produce the type of document or information that the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, asked for in the amendment. We already produce reports which compile such information and as a result I hope to persuade the Committee, particularly the noble Baroness, that the amendment is unnecessary. Information on energy consumption in the UK is contained in the department&#146;s <I>Digest of UK Energy Statistics</I><I>,</I> updated and published annually. That includes, among other things, information on total energy consumption in the domestic sector and by business. Noble Lords who took part in debates on the Climate Change Bill will not need me to remind them that&#151;if it becomes an Act; I am fairly confident that it will&#151;the Secretary of State will have a duty to prepare and lay before Parliament an annual statement of emissions, which will set out qualitative information on net UK emissions, including energy consumption.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000050"></a>There is information, so the question is about whether it is necessary to have more than at present and, if so, whether the amendment is the right way to go about it. We do not think it is necessary, so we cannot accept it.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000051"></a>I want to make a point about the light bulbs that the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, spoke about. She raises an important issue of just the kind that we try to consider when working with industry in our efforts to increase standards of major energy-using products, such as motors, electronics and air conditioning, as well as lighting. We welcome the European Commission&#146;s intention, at least, which is to work towards regulating against inefficient bulbs. We will ensure that, in the consideration of proposals, such issues are given due consideration before any final decisions are made. Nothing could be more absurd than to have energy-conscious light bulbs, if I can call them that, which people cannot read by. I take her point.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000052"></a>I have been asked by my noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill to say something about my noble friend Lord Whitty&#146;s amendments. Let me do my best to do that as briefly as I can. There is what is described as a Keeling schedule on Clause 80, which we are more than happy to share with Members of the Committee and my noble friend in particular; what the amendments would do to Clause 80 is slightly confusing. The amendments relate to our proposals to rationalise reporting requirements in Clause 80.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000053"></a>Clause 80 is in the Bill for a number of reasons. First, it was to introduce flexibility around the timing of our annual energy report, and secondly, it was to remove statutory requirements that were either replicated  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC624"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column GC624</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>elsewhere or overly prescriptive. We believe it right that we streamline our reporting requirements to ensure that our report is both topical and meaningful. As part of that, we need reporting to be sufficiently flexible to allow us to exclude less relevant technologies and include more relevant ones as developments dictate. Our proposed changes to Clause 80 facilitate that and, as such, we should retain the proposals as part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000054"></a>In view of the current range of statutory and non-statutory reports and national statistics that are already published, if my noble friend noble Lord Whitty had been here to move his amendments, I would have asked him to withdraw them. That does not apply to Amendment No. 64. There was considerable debate on this issue in the other place. A number of concerns were raised that our proposal to introduce flexibility around the reporting and publication periods could raise the spectre of the Government being tempted to use that flexibility to somehow delay the publication of our report to obscure bad news.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000055"></a>I am sure that the Committee does not need persuading that that was never our intention. The Government take the issue of reporting progress very seriously. We agreed on Report in the other place to reflect on these concerns, and we have been considering whether there is a way to allow the Government to produce a more relevant and up-to-date report, while meeting the concerns about flexibility.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000056"></a>As such, officials have been working on a proposal that allows the Government to establish a reporting period that aligns with the calendar year; 1 January to 31 December. That would not only ensure that are we reporting over a continuous period but would avoid a situation whereby one report could cover an excessively long period and the next an excessively short one. Our intention is for each reporting period to cover a full year cycle. Rather than the current 12-month reporting period ending with 23 February, which was arbitrarily based on the publication date of the White Paper in 2003, we want to replace this&#151;perhaps using common sense&#151;with a reporting period of January to December.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000057"></a>We are persuaded that it would be helpful to retain a specific period during which the report would need to be published. The current publication period runs from 24 February to 31 December. However, there are real benefits in establishing a new requirement for the report for a particular calendar year to be published no later than October the following year. There are two reasons. First, it would commit the Government to report by a certain time in the year but would still allow the appropriate analysis to be completed shortly after all the latest data become available, which is usually between April and July. Secondly, it would align our reporting with the carbon budget reporting cycle that will be established through the Climate Change Bill.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000058"></a>We recognise that this may appear to provide the department with the scope to choose a publication date that suits its own objectives. However, I remind the Committee that such scope already exists under Section 1 of the Sustainable Energy Act 2003. I am sorry to have gone on at some length about that, but we want to consider that amendment and perhaps come back with something akin to it on Report.</p>

I have two points. First, when we talk about reports, we are still living in the pre-computer age. While it is not in the amendment, given the plethora of information available it would be helpful if the website of the department, where it related to energy matters, was a proper one with links, so that things could be added at an appropriate time.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000060"></a>For example, I will take one small case. I am not making a debating point; I am trying to be helpful. It is now abundantly clear that instead of just having in September and October the auction for gas, which determines in large measure the next quarter&#146;s electricity and gas prices to the consumer&#151;industrial or domestic&#151;we now know that those auctions often take place in April and May as well, so a number of the statistics on their own seem largely meaningless if they are not linked with other sets. Our preoccupation with paper sometimes requires us to think in terms of publication dates and reports, whereas the updating of a website and appropriate links would provide a running commentary, not to trip the Government up but to make the debate better informed. At the moment, we are often dependent on highly coloured and often misleading press reporting of some of these transactions and market situations. Therefore, I would like to think that when we get to Report and Third Reading, we could think more flexibly. I happen to be almost computer illiterate so I am not in any position to lecture, but I know the fundamentals of how to get round Google-world. A lot of other people also do and would benefit if the Government were prepared to release information rather more regularly than the requirements of a 12-month calendar cycle.</p>

I will reply to him seriously in a moment, but he should not assume that departments in Whitehall have not heard of computers or websites because they have. BERR has a specific area on its website focused on energy statistics. Whether that could be improved is the issue that he is raising.

That is a very good way of assisting people in what will be a growing interest&#151;seeing the amount of energy that they use. This is a simple point. Sometimes when we are talking about the big things in this area we forget the simple rather important points.</p>

<p><a name="08062593000064"></a>My noble friend Lord Jenkin made an important point when he noted how quickly people are picking up the need to save money on motoring. It is quite extraordinary what has happened. It has happened to me and I think it has happened to most people where I live; I notice it very much. This would help people to see how we are getting on in this area and I am sorry that the Minister thinks it is unnecessary. I actually think that it is a jolly good idea, but my noble friend will doubtless say everything that has to be said about that.</p>

Among other things, it includes information on total energy consumption in exactly the fashion that the noble Baroness has just asked for&#151;in the domestic sector and consumption by business. Those facts are already there. I have just been advised that those facts are also on the website. That information is in the public arena. Frankly, there is a danger that overduplication and confusion can arise from too much publication in this field. Let us get the publication right and let us get it through.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000066"></a>I that hope the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, will be with me on this. We think that publishing figures is not enough to change people's attitudes and minds. I fear that that is slightly too optimistic.</p>

He and the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, were concerned about help for householders, and wanted to know what help and information was available. The Energy Saving Trust remains the cornerstone of how we communicate the benefits of energy efficiency and provide information and advice to householders. I repeat that the provision of the Green Homes service with &#163;100 million funding will provide a single point of contact for a home energy audit, plus advice on how to save water, reduce waste, make travelling more green, and how to connect to grants and offers from energy companies.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08062593000070"></a>As part of the Green Homes service, from 1 April Energy Saving Trust advice centres in England, Wales and Northern Ireland advise not only on energy but provide tips to householders on waste and water efficiency in the home, and can signpost individuals to specialist organisations to ensure that they receive the highest standard of advice on household waste and water efficiency. It is important for the Committee to realise what that money will be spent on.</p>

I remember praising the speech on Second Reading by the noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill. I would point out that that speech followed a stinging attack on the Front Benches of the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats for not coming up with ideas. I note that our Benches have managed to slip in amendments around energy efficiency and fuel poverty, but I do not notice any from the noble Lord.</p>

I do not think that I have been selfish in holding it to myself; there is a list a mile long from all sides. The noble Lord, Lord Bach, makes a good case for what the Government have done so far; nobody is criticising that. The whole idea of having a Bill is to try to change our habits, improve life and make cause for the common good.</p>

<p><a name="08062593000074"></a>The noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill, rapped my knuckles by saying that the Bill with its Long Title means that we are paving the way and tying up loose ends. I have two points to make about that. First, the amendments were laid before the Clerks of the House and were passed by them, so there is no reason why I should not talk to them. Secondly, the noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill, then went on to make a better case for all of this than I did.

It is not the information that people want or can use; it is not given to them in a way in which they can use it. That is why the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill, was certainly new.

</ul>
<a name="80625-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08062598000002"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment is about information on the contribution to environmental taxes on invoices. It specifies that the invoices received from energy companies must outline for the consumer the amount spent on environmental taxes and emission-reduction schemes. The Minister in another place indicated that it might be difficult to pinpoint the precise contributions for individuals, as consumers&#146; tariffs might vary considerably. That does not seem to be the industry view, however. When Ofgem gave evidence to the Committee in another place, Alistair Buchanan said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08062598000072"></a>&#147;Some &#163;80 of roughly &#163;1,000 dual fuel average household bill is now a combination of ROC, which is about &#163;10, your energy efficiency, which is about &#163;35 ... and your European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Scheme ... which is around &#163;30&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Energy Bill Committee, 5/2/08; col. 47.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08062598000065"></a>The regulator seems to know the amount of contributions and believes it to be available in a way that is straightforward to determine, so does the Minister not think that consumers should have access to that information? If consumers are to be empowered to make decisions on their energy use, surely they should be given all the information concerning how much of their money is going to pay environmental taxes and how much will go on the fuel that they use.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08062598000003"></a>If we expect people to monitor their energy consumption, it makes sense that they should also be allowed to monitor their contributions to schemes designed to reduce consumption. Our efforts to increase energy efficiency should be married to the idea of the empowered consumer. The best way to give people that sort of power is to keep them as informed as possible. The Minister in another place said that he would investigate whether legislative structures were already in place to deal with the matter. Can the noble Lord tell the Committee the conclusions of that investigation? Was it a concession on the principle of the matter, or does he feel it right to keep consumers in the dark over their energy bills? I beg to move.</p>

From these Benches, we entirely agree with transparency and with taxpayers paying their taxes indirectly, for whatever reason, being a good principle. Almost going back to an amendment tabled previously by the noble Baroness, I say that, if this amendment is accepted, we should clearly have until at least 2012 a declaration on the bill of how much consumers are charged extra for the windfall profits made from the free allocation of their EU ETS carbon units. I would be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s present estimate of the windfall profit rate for energy companies under the EU ETS. Once we move towards a full auctioning process for them, the need would clearly disappear, but there needs to be transparency both ways in the area. We look forward to the list also including the feed-in tariff that we fully hope will be a part of the Bill when it becomes an Act.</p>

<p><a name="08062598000005"></a>The only thing that slightly worries me here is that, when there is a differentiation between actual cost and the taxes above and when one is looking at comparative tables, one could always be in the Ryanair position of companies declaring their costs and taxes separately and switching to the other figure in their marketing. Maybe that is just a malaise of the cheap airline industry. In general, we welcome this, but windfall profits by energy companies need to be part of this equation.</p>

The central point made by my noble friend is that this is an example of transparency. If extra charges are being laid at the doors of consumers for broadly public sector objectives&#151;climate change and so on&#151;it is right that the consumer should know how much he or she is paying for that. The argument put to me on the previous occasions was about how that can be apportioned to individual consumers. I see the Minister nodding and looking up the page from which he will repeat the argument. I do not accept that argument. We now have elaborate computer programs, and all major energy suppliers produce their accounts through sophisticated consumer programmes.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08062598000007"></a>At Second Reading, I quoted the figure that I got from Ofgem for the typical contribution of an average householder: it was &#163;79 a year. That is not an insignificant figure against an average householder&#146;s fuel budget of approaching &#163;1,000. It is a little less than 10 per cent, but it is still a substantial figure. My guess is that very few householders have any idea that they are paying this with their gas and electricity bills. The Government have always talked about subsidising renewable energy, but how many householders realise that that is not coming out of taxation or being paid by the Government but is being paid by the consumer? The cost of ROCs goes on to the industries that have to buy them; it is included in their costs and they put them on their bills. The same is true with the Emissions Trading Scheme: the costs of that are borne not by the Government but by consumers.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08062598000008"></a>The average figure given by Ofgem for 2008 is &#163;79. That is for the average consumer and assumes a certain consumption of gas and electricity. No doubt Ofgem could supply the details. It does not seem to be beyond the wit of man or woman to say that if you consume less, you are contributing less to these other climate change objectives. If you are consuming more, you are contributing more. I do not accept for one moment that it is impossible to link that to the individual consumer&#146;s invoice and show the on the bill, &#147;This is what you are paying towards the measures to fight climate change&#148;. That would have a considerable impact on the public&#146;s appreciation and understanding of what is happening.</p>

<p><a name="08062598000009"></a>At the back of my mind, I fear that the Government&#146;s real objection to this is that they do not want consumers to know, so that they think that they are getting all these climate change things without having to pay for

If you were to ask the average consumer, I suspect that is what he would say. If we are going for transparency, it is important that the Government come clean on this and make it clear so that companies can include in their invoices the amounts that that individual consumers are paying towards these charges. For the life of me, I cannot see a valid objection to that. I can see that the Government&#146;s objection is that they do not want consumers to know. I can see the possible objection that it would be too difficult to apportion amounts to the many millions of consumers, although I do not accept it. So what is the real reason? Transparency is called for. I argued for it eight years ago, I argued for it four years ago, and I argue for it again. Perhaps this time it will be third time lucky.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, is arguing that there should be transparency and that individuals should know what they are paying in these green taxes. However, the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, was slightly different. He referred to uSwitch. I understood him to say that it would be a consideration in the mind of the consumer when they were purchasing gas or electricity or deciding on the supplier. I cannot see how that kind of taxation, identified on, say, an electricity bill or a gas bill, could somehow be different between one supplier and another. Perhaps it could be explained to us whether it influences choice or is simply an issue of transparency.</p>

Many years ago, I well remember local government thinking that it would be absolutely disastrous if the ratepayers, as they were then, knew too much about how their rates were made up. Some legislation happened. Since then, more detail has appeared on council tax notices. Noble Lords will have seen this on their own council tax notices. They vary from council to council. Mine in London is quite different from the one in Scotland. The one in London was so good that I took it to show my councillor in Scotland to demonstrate how the council could do it better, like us. There is now great enthusiasm among the public for knowing how their council tax is made up. They are very interested. They discuss it a lot.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08062598000012"></a>This is a similar issue. The Government should not be afraid of this. I think I see how it might vary from supplier to supplier, although I may be wrong about that. The Minister will tell us if I am. Being clear about these green taxes will help people to change their minds about how they behave. We have to take everyone with us, and it would be a great pity to oppose it. It is extremely sensible and should happen. I hope that the Government will be a little flexible on this, if not now then before Report.</p>

This issue was indeed discussed in the other place, and I echo what my honourable friend the Energy Minister said in that debate. We are naturally sympathetic to the motivations  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC631"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column GC631</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>behind the amendment, but we wonder whether there is not a more cost-effective way in which to achieve a similar outcome in terms of greater transparency of energy costs for consumers, without frankly creating the additional burdens and bureaucracy for energy suppliers of requiring this information to be included on consumer bills. Far from being scared, or concerned, about the figures, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, suggests that the Government may be, one of the reasons why we do not agree with the amendment is that we do not want to create additional burdens and bureaucracy for energy suppliers.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08062598000014"></a>First, I shall explain what the Government are doing to empower individuals and to help them to make informed choices about their own use of energy. I will then deal with the amendment. Of course, helping consumers to make those choices is a key part of our strategy to drive energy efficiency in the home&#151;the central theme of the &#147;Saving energy&#148; chapter in the 2007 energy White Paper.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08062598000015"></a>In that White Paper, the Government pledged to help consumers monitor and reduce their energy consumption through the inclusion of historic information on their energy bills or statements, so that they could compare what they had paid in the past with what they are paying now. As announced in the recent government response to the 2007 consultation on metering and billing, we are implementing this by a statutory requirement on suppliers to provide historic information on domestic bills and statements from January 2009. It is intended that this will help consumers to better understand their bills and the energy that they use and encourage them to take a more active approach in managing their energy use.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08062598000016"></a>The amendment proposes that energy suppliers should be required to report on the proportion of the bill that contributes towards environmental taxes, highlighting the renewables obligation, the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and the carbon emissions reductions targets in particular. In short, while we support the principle of improved transparency of costs to consumers, we cannot support a requirement on energy suppliers to set out information about environmental taxes on individual bills of domestic consumers as some sort of route to delivering it.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08062598000017"></a>Members of the Committee will appreciate that each of the environmental support measures mentioned in the amendment are not taxes in the traditionally understood form. Companies have a number of different ways that they can meet their obligations under the schemes I have referred to, including making energy efficiency savings in the home, generating renewable electricity, paying a buy-out penalty, and/or trading variable-priced instruments.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08062598000018"></a>As a result, to require energy suppliers to specifically break down the proportion of every consumer&#146;s bill attributed to each of those mechanisms could impose additional, potentially significant, administrative and cost burdens, especially given the complexity involved and the range of different routes to compliance. In a competitive energy market, any such administrative burden will clearly end up with the consumer in the form of increased bills. It would also be difficult for any requirement to achieve standardisation across

Some of the information sought would be commercially confidential, in the same way as was the information in the amendment we debated last evening.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08062598000019"></a>Moreover, in asking specifically about the detail of consumers&#146; bills during last year&#146;s billing and metering consultation, the responses frankly did not indicate a strong appetite for including any additional information, beyond the better, more accurate historic information on energy use on domestic consumer bills that we set out as a requirement in our government response. We are therefore not convinced that requiring energy suppliers to drill down to the necessary level of detail to produce this information on a consumer-by-consumer basis would provide additional benefits outweighing the potential administrative and cost burdens that such a requirement would impose on the energy suppliers. Any such decision to increase such a requirement would have to be based on a careful and full assessment of the costs and the benefits of providing the proposed additional information on bills.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08062598000020"></a>My noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours made a point about costs and the competitive advantage between suppliers. There is unlikely to be a competitive advantage issue, because the taxes would apply to all suppliers. There may be small differences from supplier to supplier, but they will not be a big driver of choice for consumers.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08062598000021"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, asked how much the windfall profits had been under the first phase of the scheme. The broad, global figure is about &#163;800 million per year; but we must recognise that we are taking action to prevent such a scenario occurring again. I remind the Committee, as I mentioned yesterday, that our commitment is to 100 per cent auctioning for the power sector in phase 3.</p>

<p><a name="08062598000022"></a>As far as information that is already supplied is concerned, for an average &#163;1,000 consumer bill, the contribution of the RO, the EU ETS and the CERT is published on Ofgem&#146;s fact-sheet on its website. That is for an average &#163;1,000 consumer bill.</p>

<p><a name="08062598000029"></a>One can of course see the attractions of the amendment in terms of increasing transparency for consumers in relation to the costs of so-called green taxes. I am happy to announce that the department will continue to work with suppliers and consumer groups, such as the new National Consumer Council, which succeeds Energywatch later this year, and other relevant organisations over the coming months, to investigate whether there are ways in which this type of information can be made more readily available to consumers.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08062598000030"></a>Some of this type of information is already in the public domain. I have mentioned the fact-sheet <I>Household Energy Bills Explained</I>, which Ofgem publishes, which includes, among other things, information about costs to consumers of the environmental taxes mentioned in the amendment in an easily understandable form. No doubt there are other examples. We want to build on what exists and ensure that those consumers who want this information can find it easily. That is what we want to achieve. The noble Baroness is right that the Energy Minister promised to take the issue away to see what more could be done, and that is what he is doing as we speak.</p>

I went on to say that, although it was originally said that it could not be done, when Ofgem gave evidence it was able to break it down in broad terms.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08062598000034"></a>If I can pick up on what the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, said, we have now got very used to seeing all sorts of bills broken down in all sorts of ways for us, and anything that allows the consumer to better understand what is happening to them and to better understand the historical information&#151;which will be how they have behaved with their consumption of energy over time so that we can compare what we did last year with what we are doing this year&#151;is a good thing.

<p><a name="08062598000035"></a>As we said on the last amendment, very often the information is out there but perhaps not always in a place easily accessible to people.

I believe that the Minister has answered my question and has confirmed that the Minister in another place is looking at ways

<p><a name="08062598000038"></a>The noble Lord said: I am particularly keen on this amendment for a number of reasons. First, it aids the Government to reach their 2020 target on renewables by producing priority access for renewable electricity and gas. Last night, we discussed biomethane at some length, so perhaps I will not go back to that in such detail. However, I have a personal issue involved in this. Like many people who have converted to the cause of saving carbon I tried to do my bit, by trying to build a 6.2 kilowatt turbine at a tourist attraction

I found it incredible that building this very small turbine&#151;a 30-foot pole with 10-foot-long blades&#151;should be almost impossible to achieve.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08062598000039"></a>One would think that grants would be available and that, after putting in for planning permission, you would be able to build it very quickly. Grants were available, which I applied for, and I would have had to pay 50 per cent. Planning permission involved the Northumberland National Park taking it through the whole of the planning process plus a review by the inspector, which took months, by which time the grants had disappeared. Even though the grants had gone, I had the planning permission and I thought about going forward. But then there was the massive problem of connecting with Grid Connect. At that point, the cost became prohibitive.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08062598000040"></a>At the micro-level, you are dealing with monopolies which can make up charges at a whim&#151;that is if they believe that you should be given access at all. Those of us who live on the borders in the north-east know a great deal about power cuts. I have completely given up ever reprogramming digital clocks on cookers because a couple of weeks later they will be flashing again. There are quite a few power cuts. However, I understand the difficulty that if you are feeding electricity on to the grid, there is a danger that you will electrocute those people who are sent out to mend the fault.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08062598000041"></a>However, after months of fruitless work on this scheme, which never got off the ground, I thought about how much is put in the way of anyone trying to introduce a scheme&#151;even a small scheme&#151;at this level. On microgeneration, we are talking about only 0.2 per cent of the generating capacity of this country, which is hardly surprising because the number of hoops relating to paperwork and finance one has to go through is incredible. If you then think about larger scale projects, such as CHP, wind and biomethane, the latter of which is covered in the second part of the amendment, the costs become greater and accessing the grid becomes extremely problematical.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08062598000042"></a>This amendment calls for the breakdown of those barriers. I have been to enough debates where we have discussed how the Government are in favour of all sorts of renewable generation. However, if you have ever tried to build such a project and connect it to the grid&#151;and this was only a small-scale one; 6.2 kilowatts is not a large turbine&#151;you will know that the costs are prohibitive for doing it on a multiple or community level. Renewables lend themselves to rural and more remote areas, where the carbon value of electricity is high, because to generate it centrally and pump it out is expensive. The cost of that grid access is a major issue.</p>

<p><a name="08062598000043"></a>People are talking about bringing terawatts of power into the grid with all the wind farms in Scotland.

<ul><a name="08062598000083"></a>&#147;shall be based on objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria taking particular account of all the costs and benefits associated with the connection of these producers to the grid and of the particular circumstances of producers located in peripheral regions and in regions of low population&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="08062598000044"></a>I hope that the Government support the amendment. It is not a free-for-all for everybody to move forward, but it makes transparent the major costs associated with this. Without that transparency and regulated costs, you can find yourself in the difficult position of coming up with a scheme, especially with CHP and anaerobic digesters, that makes every sense in the world on environmental grounds and deals with some of the waste issues in a cost-efficient manner, but is destroyed because connection to the local electricity or gas grid cannot be argued over or taken to review to ensure that the networks do not erect a barrier of obstructive costs. It is not simple to deal with costs that are not currently transparent. The proposed new section is an attempt to remove the barrier to the electricity and gas grids. I hope that the Government support it. I beg to move.</p>

In our debates on these subjects, we often come back to the fact that, for all the rhetoric, people leave the lights on or do not understand the practical aspects of daily living that would lead to more efficient use of energy and other resources.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08062598000046"></a>My wife is from Denmark, where we have often travelled. That country has a good record for renewable energy, partly through banks of offshore wind turbines but also through ready grid access for microgeneration. It is usual to see a couple of windmills on a Danish farm; it is part of the culture. The same is true of environmental awareness in other areas of Scandinavian life, such as campaigns to reduce the average speed on roads. Ultimately, you must engineer a cultural change in the public awareness for the public to realise that a thing must happen. Anything we do to bring home the need to be sensitive to environmental issues is absolutely right.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08062598000047"></a>I keep a few hens in Chester because of distaste with some aspects of factory farming. A school trip was looking around Chester and had tea in the garden. I took some of the young children down to see the hens. One of them had recently laid an egg; there it was, warm. A young girl showed particular interest in it, and I said, &#147;Take it home for your supper&#148;. She said, &#147;I couldn&#146;t possibly eat that!&#148;. To her a real egg came in a box from the supermarket; it was not laid by a real hen. That illustrates the reality of living in our society, and how we can get disconnected, as it were. There may be practical issues in the amendment that I have not picked up, but the real merit of it in principle is that it addresses the need for our communities at a local level to take these issues as seriously as possible.</p>

I am not sure that the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, could be accepted in its present form. I have one overriding reason for saying that. I have discussed the matter with those who operate the grid in this country. To be fair to the noble Lord, he said that they would not find it difficult&#151;and  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC638"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column GC638</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>do not find it so&#151;to accommodate small, genuine, local microgeneration sources because the amounts involved are very small. Applications to join the grid might come from community groups, or business groups, and as the amounts of electricity that the grid would have to accommodate become larger, it becomes more difficult for operators to sustain the viability of the grid.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08062598000049"></a>One has seen the other end of the scale. I was interested in what the right reverend Prelate said about the Danish experience of the larger offshore wind farms. It is now two years since the Danes reached the maximum amount that they can possibly generate by wind before finding that the grid they have to operate becomes unstable. That matches entirely with the report produced two or three years ago by E.ON about its experience in Nordrhein-Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein. I have seen with my own eyes the large number of wind turbines operating in that very flat land, which is suitable for wind power, but the company found that once you went beyond about 18 per cent of total generating capacity coming from wind, the stability of the grid becomes very questionable.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08062598000050"></a>The reason for that is very simple. It is an intermittent source. If you go from full power to no wind power in a couple of hours as the wind falls away, you must have standby generation. Given the process of operating a grid in those circumstances with no doubt variable wind output having to be fed in, and then being offset as it goes down by standby operators, the company said that it could cope up to about 18 per cent. When you move to 20 per cent and beyond, the grid becomes so unstable that it is difficult to operate.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08062598000051"></a>I say with some hesitation to the right reverend Prelate who, through his wife, knows more about this than I do, but I saw the Danish wind farms when we went on a cruise up that way some years ago. The wind was blowing perfectly well but none of them was working as they had reached the point when it was not economic. The amount that the Danish power companies had to sell at rock-bottom prices to other grids in order to get some return was simply not worth their doing it. That was also the E.ON experience. The stability of the grid and its management are a vital factor. I recognise that the noble Lord has sought to take this into account in his amendment, which states in proposed Section 3B(1) that,</p>
<ul><a name="08062598000084"></a>&#147;the Authority shall ensure that ... (a) ... operators guarantee the transmission and distribution of electricity produced ... without prejudice to the maintenance of the reliability and safety of the grid&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08062598000066"></a>It is there, but one then asks how that will operate. How will the microgeneration supplier be able to know when he can feed it into the grid and when he cannot?</p>

<p><a name="08062598000052"></a><a name="80625-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80625-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08062598000107"></a>Lord Redesdale:</b> The noble Lord asks a number of questions, but the real issue is that we are so far from achieving even a proportion of the amount that affects the grid stability that he talks about&#151;it is less than 5 per cent at the moment&#151;that it would take us an extremely long time to get to that position. The second issue is that we are signed up to targets to get to 20 per cent, as the Government know, so his argument is slightly rhetorical.</p>

The same applies if there are fluctuating inputs into the grid at a local level or indeed into the local distribution network&#151;in many cases, the microgeneration has to go to the local distribution network. I have been told by those who run the grid that they can cope with small inputs, but that if they become bigger it will be more difficult for them to cope.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08062598000054"></a>The noble Lord has sought to put protective words into his amendment. I quoted from proposed Section 3B(1)(a). He has also put, into proposed Section 3B(1)(c),</p>
<ul><a name="08062598000085"></a>&#147;insofar as the security of the national electricity system permits&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08062598000067"></a>and so on. He has acknowledged that the problem exists, but it is quite difficult to understand how this can be done other than on a micro scale. If we are to have more and more wind power, we will have to have standby generating power to cover the gap when the wind does not blow. Everyone recognises that. However, that does not happen with microgeneration. If it is very micro, I have no doubt that the distribution system can cope, but does it make sense to guarantee access? I question that.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08062598000055"></a>I am totally in favour of encouraging microgeneration. The noble Lord has laid great stress on costs, and knowing the costs in advance is an important element. One is very sympathetic to that, but I hesitate to support the amendment without knowing a great deal more about how it would work.</p>

<p><a name="08062598000056"></a><a name="80625-gc0004.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80625-gc0004.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08062598000109"></a>Lord Oxburgh:</b> I support the general drift of the amendment, particularly the aspects that seek clarity about the charges. As some noble Lords will be aware, Woking has been at the forefront of energy efficiency and local energy generation in this country. Having looked at the economics of the situation, it was obliged to put in its own local network to distribute to consumers the electricity that was generated by their intermittent sources. It would have been easier for them to feed into the grid at one place and to take it out again a mile away, but that was not acceptable. The prices need to be transparent.</p>

<p><a name="08062598000057"></a><a name="80625-gc0004.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80625-gc0004.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08062598000110"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, for his amendment, which has prompted an interesting debate. The amendment seeks to provide priority of access both for electricity and gas transmission and for distribution systems for renewable energy sources. The text of the first part of the amendment comes from the current draft EU renewables directive, and many of the provisions referred to in the proposed new clause were in the 2001 renewables directive. That is why we recognise both the text and the significance of the issue. This is an important issue, on which I am grateful to have the opportunity to explain the Government&#146;s position.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08062598000058"></a>The key difference between the amendment and the provisions already in place in Great Britain&#151;through licence conditions and underlying industry codes&#151;is that the amendment would mandate priority access to the grid for electricity from renewable sources. It is worth noting that currently, as those who followed the debate in the other place will recall, that is a discretionary matter for member states.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC640"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column GC640</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80625-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08062598000059"></a>Before I analyse the provisions further, I make clear that once the Commission&#146;s proposals for priority access are finalised and the directive agreed, the directive will be implemented in the UK. We should not be implementing legislative proposals simply because we have a legislative opportunity in the Bill, particularly as there is a risk that the directive will change and we could be in the ludicrous position of having produced recent legislation that is an ill fit with the final European directive.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08062598000060"></a>As the noble Lord will recognise, as with any European directive the Government have the option, among others, of using Section 2(2) of the European Communities Act to implement it, if they so wish. In that sense, we do not need the legislation either. The eventual implementation route will depend to some extent on the form of the finalised directive, and we cannot pre-empt that at this stage. Those are relatively minor matters in relation to the amendment&#151;although the appropriateness and accuracy of our legislation is important&#151;which is about priority access from renewable resources.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08062598000061"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, illustrated why the Government would find the amendment difficult. We must not create uncertainty for existing generators and those planning future investments. Uncertainty would discourage investment, which would have serious repercussions on meeting our energy needs and targets. We need certainty, because the crucial responsibility of government is security of provision from the grid. As the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, indicated, the problem with certain dimensions of renewables&#151;we are to foresee for the immediate future the largest contribution being from wind sources&#151;is the element of uncertainty. I never thought, having struggled with the Schleswig-Holstein question many years ago as a historian, that I would be grateful for such a reference many years later, but I was grateful for his evidence on E.ON&#146;s experience.</p>

I did not have any more of an answer to it than the rest of the British or international community at that time, but I have an answer to this issue.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08062598000064"></a>I pray in aid the Schleswig-Holstein experience, as I do the Danish experience. We are concerned that the renewable provision could be intermittent. Therefore, we need to guarantee the necessary back-up from more secure resources. I respect greatly the enthusiasm with which the noble Lords, Lord Redesdale and Lord Teverson, have pursued the renewables agenda in Committee. I emphasise that we have to guarantee certainty of supply. We will address those issues later in Committee. It will be recognised that it is not something over which the Government dare take risks.</p>

Obviously, energy storage would be the holy grail. If the Minster is saying, on the one hand, that we are going to implement the EU directive, but, on the other hand, that we cannot do so due to question marks over the grid, what will change in that intermediate period?</p>

<p><a name="080625116000002"></a><a name="80625-gc0004.htm_spnew16"></a><b><a name="80625-gc0004.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="080625116000141"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> We are involved in substantial consultations on the process by which we adjust the arrangements for the grid and make changes. I emphasise to Members of the Committee that we are seeking some positives from the probing that the noble Lord has made today. We have ended the requirement for planning consent for microgeneration from April 2008. I know that he will regard that as a minor concession in comparison to what he seeks, but it is the intent of the Government to give the support that they can. The Committee will have been saddened by the noble Lord&#146;s personal experience of his microgenerator, and I understand the issues with regard to costs and the restrictions on access to the grid.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000003"></a>However, there is no doubt that we are taking steps to improve the position as regards microgenerators and that the current system provides disadvantages for smaller players. The noble Lord gave his personal experience. That is why we have set out to level the playing field for the distribution of energy. The measures set out in our recent consultation will reduce a whole range of these burdens, as experienced by the noble Lord. A report setting out the measures, which responds to all these issues, was published only a few days ago.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000004"></a>I want the noble Lord to be clear that we are taking the necessary steps to ease the problems of microgenerators and access to the grid. The rather global sweep of the amendment is not well timed and, at this stage, we are not in a position to accept it. We certainly are considering reforms to grid access, which would ensure that the regulatory framework remains fit for purpose in the medium and the long term. That will condition the way in which we are able to respond to the European directive. It is clear from this work that there are ways in which we could significantly improve the connection opportunities for renewable generation. We will set out this analysis when the final report of the review is published this week.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000005"></a>The Government are well charged of the issues which the noble Lord raised on access of minor generation, but I also indicate to him, as did the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, in his contribution, that there are strategic aspects to which we must have regard. It is certainly clear that the growth in intermittent renewable generation will require us to have a serious examination of access to the grid, which is why we are involved in these consultations. Grid capacity needs to be shared between different forms of generation, but no one in the Committee will underestimate the complexities of these matters against a background where the Government are bound to have as their priority security of provision.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000006"></a>On the second part of the new clause proposed in the noble Lord&#146;s amendment, I do not want to return to that intensive debate that we had on biomethane. I was grateful to the noble Lord for truncating his contribution on that today, and I will follow suit. Until  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC642"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column GC642</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we have reviewed the evidence about the costs and processes involved in upgrading biogas to biomethane and injecting into the gas system, we will not be able to assess the potential unintended or undesirable consequences, or the balance between costs and benefits that might flow from any proposed change to access rules. The kind of market enablement provided by the amendment is somewhat premature.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000007"></a>We have said on many occasions that we will do what we can&#151;and we are steadily making progress&#151;on support for renewables. But I hope that the noble Lord will recognise that the Government have a clear priority with regard to the grid and electricity, and it would be somewhat jumping the gun to introduce part of a European directive, which is not finalised at this stage, into our legislation at this point. That is a premature initiative, although the Government share with the noble Lord the broad objectives. The Government have to hit those targets, which we have all identified will involve considerable change to access to the grid.</p>

However, it would be helpful if estimates of the natural limits that would apply in the UK for wind power were more widely available. It would help people to estimate the different values to be given to the various issues around policy. Following on from that, is it not almost certainly the case that the more widely distributed the sources of renewable energy, the higher the natural limit? That seems to be an argument in favour of not simply having a small number of large-scale sources of any given renewable energy. There must be intrinsically an argument in favour of a fairly dispersed mixture of large and small, which I think is behind the amendment moved by the noble Lord.</p>

In Scotland, there is a veritable queue of applications, which presents significant issues for the grid operation as far as Scotland is concerned. I hear what the right reverend Prelate says. Of course, there are desirable advantages to the dispersal of generation, but we also need to ensure that we have this framework right as far as the grid is concerned. I am not sure of the precise terms of the analysis that he is after, but the renewable energy strategy consultation that we will publish this week will include an analysis of the relative contributions. He will have time to digest that before we reach Report.</p>

<p><a name="080625116000016"></a>The noble Lord said: This is one of those interesting occasions where you table an amendment thinking it is the best thing since sliced toast, and then someone tables a better amendment. On that basis, I shall simply mention that the difference between my amendment, which has some merit, and the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, is the inclusion of CHP; and his amendment is better. I shall move my amendment, but I will support the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="080625116000017"></a><a name="80625-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80625-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="080625116000147"></a>Lord Oxburgh:</b> I thank the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, for his kind comments, and I am grateful for his support. It was with a certain diffidence that I tabled the amendment. I did so because of the considerable concern in this House, the other place and the wider industrial community about its subject matter; namely, the way that Ofgem is able to discharge its responsibilities at present. If the Government had been doing as much listening as they say they do, they would have picked this up and put it in the Bill. They did not have to look much further than the report by their own Sustainable Development Commission, <I>Lost in Transmission?</I> which was published last year. I am not sure that I agree with everything in that report, but there was a great deal of compelling argument concerning the way the Ofgem role is discharged at present.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000018"></a>I emphasise at the beginning that this is criticism not of Ofgem but of the terms of reference within which it has to work. I suggest that, although there are many details, we keep this discussion at a relatively high level today. It is matter of what we want Ofgem to do and whether it is properly equipped to do it. Ofgem discharges many aspects of its remit completely satisfactorily. Where it falls down is on infrastructure. The important thing about infrastructure is that it has to be there before the elements that it is to support are built. If you are building a housing development, the first thing you do is put in the roads and the drains and then the houses follow afterwards. If we are building wind farms around the country, unless we make proper provision to get the electricity to where it is needed, a lot of this comes apart.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000019"></a>I do not need to remind the Committee that the wind is around the coast and in the north-west, and electricity demand is in the centre and the south. We shall have a need for massive interconnectors from north to south. I do not want to repeat what I said in my Second Reading speech, but the challenging question is how these interconnectors, which are not going to be cheap, are to be facilitated.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000020"></a>To give the Committee an example, let us say that it made sense to lay a cable from north to south down the length of the North Sea, to connect the offshore wind farms and the near-shore generation into it and to use that cable effectively as a mains to take the electricity where it is needed. It might be needed on the other side of the country, or possibly on both. Doing this at sea would have considerable advantages, in that the multitude of planning consents that are needed on land would be avoided. The important thing is that  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC645"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column GC645</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>this would be a massive investment, at least in part ahead of the elements of the wind farms and so on that it was intended to support. Given the way in which Ofgem operates at the moment, it would have enormous difficulty in approving that expenditure for the national grid, because it would be the responsibility of the national grid to design it, and presumably it would then go out to tender for construction.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000021"></a>I briefly remind noble Lords that Ofgem was set up in the early 1990s in the days of the liberalisation of energy markets in this country to ensure that there was plenty of competition and that the consumer got the best possible deal. Its principal remit&#151;I emphasise principal&#151;is,</p>
<ul><a name="080625116000131"></a>&#147;to protect the interests of consumers, present and future, wherever appropriate by promoting effective competition between persons engaged in, or in commercial activities connected with, the shipping, transportation or supply of gas conveyed through pipes and the generation, transmission, distribution or supply of electricity or the provisions or use of electricity interconnectors&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080625116000105"></a>Over time, a variety of supplementary objectives has been added to that principal objective. In 2000, Ofgem was given social and environmental objectives. In 2004, sustainability was added. Today, Ofgem&#146;s principal objective is as I quoted it. It also has 11 secondary objectives, and it can have guidance from Ministers. However, guidance is only guidance, and Ofgem has made it clear that it sticks to its principal objectives.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000022"></a>I do not believe, and I believe that a lot of other people do not believe, that that original objective, even supplemented with those ancillaries, is appropriate for the situation in which we find ourselves today. Nor will the Government be able to achieve their climate change objectives unless we look much harder at this and provide Ofgem with a remit that gives it the freedom to make the investments that are necessary for the future. The amendment would not take away any of Ofgem&#146;s powers, but it would fundamentally reshuffle its current responsibilities. It puts security of supply and sustainability at the top of the agenda. That is at the top of everyone&#146;s agenda, frankly. We would all prefer our electricity to be a cheap as possible, but security of supply and sustainability need to be up top.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000023"></a>The Government may reply that we cannot do anything about this yet because the regulation is being reviewed. The review may have finished now&#151;I cannot quite remember&#151;but there is one very important point to make that the Government might not have picked up on. I have spoken to a number of people in the industry and elsewhere who were invited to give their views as part of that review. More than half the number of people to whom I spoke said, &#147;We have not replied&#148;, or, &#147;We have been very cautious&#148;, because, &#147;We do not want to upset the regulator&#148;. That is very important. It emphasises not only the enormous power that Ofgem is seen to wield at present but that people are concerned about how they will fare if they rock the boat. The output of that consultation needs to be taken with a serious health warning.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000024"></a>The other concern, I am told, is that Ofgem is very worried about a broadening of the sphere of action under its present terms of reference, because it might be subject to judicial review from consumer organisations  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC646"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column GC646</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that say that by investing in the future Ofgem is not providing electricity or gas at the most competitive prices. Whether or not that is true, I do not know, but I am told that it is a genuine concern.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000025"></a>The purpose of the amendment is not revolutionary but evolutionary. It is to tweak the remit of Ofgem and to be helpful to Ofgem and, I would have thought, to the Government, in meeting the objectives in the Climate Change Bill.</p>

The way in which the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, spoke to it clearly indicates that.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000027"></a>If I had been moving it, I would have gone through the same historical story as the noble Lord did. I was going to use the simile of a Christmas tree. It started off with a clear, bright fairy at the top, namely to promote competition, and over the years, in a series of different and often disjointed legislation, all sorts of baubles have been added on the way down. Like the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, I say that this is no criticism whatever of Ofgem&#146;s work in this field; but it is in danger of breaking down. Part of the purpose of the amendment is, as the noble Lord said, to stop the Christmas tree collapsing under its own overdecorated weight. It has become opaque, which is not Ofgem&#146;s fault but it is because of the rather disjointed way in which our piecemeal process of law-making has taken place.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000028"></a>There is also a policy justification, which is that Ofgem&#146;s existing remit, complicated as it is, with all the baubles that have been added to the Christmas tree, does not remain properly focused to deliver the policy outcomes that we now require. The key output from energy regulation must in future be the development of a secure and sustainable system of energy supply for the UK. Therefore, the overriding statutory objective of Ofgem must incorporate not simply the narrow consumer interest in a high-quality service at a reasonable cost, but the broader requirements on behalf of the whole of society of a fully secure and sustainable industry that is able to deliver gas and electricity supplies securely in the longer term.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000029"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, that an opportunity was missed not to have this as part of the Bill. It is now so widely recognised that one would have thought that the Government might have been wise to have taken it. However, the amendment has been tabled, and similar amendments were debated in another place. We are trying to bring the remit into line with the overall objectives that the Community now has for the supply of energy.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000030"></a>Almost every other clause is designed in one way or another to facilitate and support long-term investment in the wide range of energy infrastructure. We all know that there has got to be over the next 20 to 25 years a huge amount of investment, both in generation and in transmission, but they have got to deliver the national policy goals of combating climate change by reducing CO2 emissions, while also ensuring security  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC647"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column GC647</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of supply. I suggest that, against that backdrop, simply focusing on the narrow consumer interest is not going to produce the result that we want for the wider societal interest.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000031"></a>No doubt the Minister will explain the Government&#146;s view, but as I understand it, they believe that best way of ensuring that regulation is carried out with a view to delivering these longer term energy policy objectives is for them to provide more detailed guidance&#151;explicit statutory guidance&#151;on social and environmental issues. As I suggested briefly at Second Reading, that is a very indirect way of proceeding, which would probably be ineffective given the unprecedented challenges that the industries face over the next 20 years. So the amendment to which the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, has spoken and to which I put my name, starts from the premise that the priority of maintaining supply security on a fully sustainable basis requires an urgent recasting of Ofgem's objectives. The noble Lord was quite right to say that this is a process of evolution. We need to evolve the narrow concern for consumer protection into a broader concept that will encompass the collective interest of the whole community in the maintenance of securing sustainable energy supplies.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000032"></a>Such an approach is more consistent with the almost incalculable social value of energy in today's world. It would also sit more comfortably with the emerging direction of European policy and perhaps eventually global policy. Of course, energy regulation is complex and difficult. It may not always be possible through legislation to resolve the tensions between market mechanisms, security of supply and the delivery of social and environmental goals, but that is what this amendment would achieve.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000033"></a>I have it from Ofgem that it accepts entirely that the question of setting statutory duties is a matter for Parliament. The note from Ofgem states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080625116000119"></a>&#147;We recognise this is an important issue given the challenges ahead, including tackling climate change, securing Britain&#146;s energy supplies and protecting consumers at a time of rising prices&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080625116000106"></a>Ofgem recognises all those objectives, but they are not included in its existing statutory remit. The amendment would be a much better way of achieving this and it is one to which I attach a great deal of importance. The time has come to change things.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000034"></a>Only the other day I was reading an interesting collection of essays entitled <I>The World Crisis. The Way Forward After Iraq</I>, which included pieces by Jimmy Carter, Henry Kissinger, George Schultz, my noble friend Lord Howell, and my noble and learned friend, Lord Howe of Aberavon, and others. I was interested to see that one of them was by someone of whom I am afraid that I have never heard&#151;the honourable Branko Terzic, who is Global Regulatory Policy Leader for Energy and Resources for a firm of consultants, chairman of the United Nations ECE Ad Hoc Group of Experts on Cleaner Electricity Production from Coal and other Fossil Fuels, and a former director of the US grid. Mr Terzic is obviously extremely knowledgeable in this area and I would like to read the summary of his paper. He states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="080625116000120"></a>&#147;The twentieth century demonstrated that markets in energy can work, that private capital is available and that progressive regulation based on correct national policies is a precondition to success in providing adequate energy at reasonable prices.

While no silver bullet exists to address the multiple issues of balancing supply and demand and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, there is a combination of policies that can do the job or buy society time until better solutions come along. Prior experience demonstrates that progressive public policies which engage market forces, treat private capital fairly and provide incentives to efficiency all along the energy conversion and usage path can supply a set of solutions to the energy and climate change dilemma of the twenty-first century&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080625116000107"></a>That is exactly what this amendment seeks to achieve and I give it my warmest support.</p>

<p><a name="080625116000035"></a><a name="80625-gc0005.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80625-gc0005.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="080625116000149"></a>Lord Puttnam:</b> I was delighted to add my name to the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, and I share all his aims and objectives. I do not share his diffidence because I think this is a fundamental amendment. Regulation is a rapidly developing and evolving process, and the very idea that after 15 years a regulator set up in one energy world is going to have a remit that fully equips it for a different energy world is slightly absurd. There is no question but that we are moving into a very different energy environment. My experience of working with regulators is that primary responsibilities and objectives are treated very seriously and dealt with and that secondary responsibilities are nowhere. They are not on the map, and to pretend that a secondary objective is given any serious consideration is fatuous. I strongly support this amendment and its purpose.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000036"></a>I have nothing much to add to what I said at Second Reading, but I have a question that I would like to attach to this amendment. It comes from something I read in the Business and Enterprise Committee brief that came out last week:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080625116000121"></a>&#147;The Chemical Industries Association (CIA) told us that after the new storage comes on-stream in three or four years, the UK will have 19 days of storage, as opposed to 13 days now. That compares to 99 days in Germany, 122 days in France, and similar sorts of levels in the States. Until recently, North Sea supplies have negated the need for large-scale storage facilities in the UK&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080625116000108"></a>I have no idea whether BERR or Ofgem is responsible for monitoring and reporting on what supplies are available at any one time, but I am sure that that is a fundamental piece of information. It is not to do with capacity. A lot of the figures that drift around are about our capacity, but that is not the issue. In the end, the issue is how much oil, fuel and gas is available to this country at any given moment. If there is any confusion about who is responsible for reporting and monitoring capacity and resource levels, it should be dealt with, perhaps in this amendment or possibly in a Statement by the Minister from the Dispatch Box.</p>

We always seek to guard the independence of regulators because they must have a free hand to do their important work. The noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, spoke so eloquently today and at Second Reading about the need for fundamental change in this country&#146;s approach to energy policy  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC649"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column GC649</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that we support this amendment as a serious attempt to empower those who can lead that change. It is a shame that the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, is not in his place because he echoed these concerns at Second Reading. The noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, tabled an alternative amendment tackling the same issue, but he has thrown his weight behind this amendment with good grace. It is clear that there is consensus on all sides of the Committee that something is needed in this area.</p>

The problem is how to invest and deal with the risk of new generating capacity when carbon, which is one of the elements of sustainability, is not active within the regulator, which sees it as outside its remit. That is a major issue that will prevent people building power stations in future and fundamentally undermines many of the purposes of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="080625116000040"></a>We have heard a lot of debate during the passage of the Bill as to whether the duties of Ofgem&#151;I mean the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority&#151;are still fit for purpose, particularly in the light of the EU renewables target. All three amendments&#151;I include Amendment No. 59 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale&#151;attempt to address what some noble Lords feel is perhaps an imbalance in Ofgem&#146;s overall focus, namely that Ofgem should have a primary duty to secure and sustainable energy and a secondary duty to competition and consumers. At present, Ofgem&#146;s primary duty is to competition and consumers. It will be of considerable interest to the outside world to know that the Official Opposition now want Ofgem&#146;s priorities to be changed in this way. The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, made a short but significant speech this evening.</p>

<p><a name="080625116000041"></a>Before I cover the specific issues raised by the amendments, I shall briefly remind the Committee of the rationale for having an independent economic regulator for these markets in the first place. We believe that delivering our energy objectives of tackling climate change and ensuring secure supplies of energy is best achieved through a competitive and effectively regulated energy market. That is our starting point, and I do not think that other political parties would disagree with it. It is important to know their view on that.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000042"></a>Clearly it is the Government&#146;s role to set the framework for social and environmental policy, and it is the economic regulator&#146;s role to police markets and competitiveness. We are therefore committed to delivering

The Committee will hardly need reminding that that is in line with the findings of this House&#146;s recent Select Committee report on regulators, which highlighted the promotion of competition as vital, and even recommended that we use legislative opportunities to require regulators to promote competition where they do not do so already.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000043"></a>Ofgem has been specifically established as the independent regulator for the gas and electricity markets, with consumer protection and competition as its primary duty. The intention of independent regulation is to provide the regulatory stability necessary for investor confidence through a clear statutory framework and independence from government, to introduce competition into the market wherever possible, and to regulate the prices of any natural monopolies where it is not possible.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000044"></a>Unlike in some other sectors, investments in the gas and electricity industry&#151;be it networks or generation&#151;are generally significant financially and are normally long term. Returns can be made only over a lengthy period. Once the investments have been made and the infrastructure built, it can be particularly costly for companies to pull out. That is why companies need to be confident that there will be a stable and long-term regulatory framework to invest in the first place.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80625-gc0006.htm"/>


<a name="80625-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000045"></a>Ofgem&#146;s independence helps to ensure that regulatory decisions about the market will be made for the long term on an economic basis, not a political one, and it has a clear statutory framework of duties under which it takes decisions that are fundamental to crucial investor confidence. That combination provides companies with the stability and regulatory certainty that they need before they will invest with confidence in power stations, gas infrastructure and electricity networks, thereby providing the security of supply that this country clearly needs.</p>

<p><a name="080625116000046"></a>We believe that changing Ofgem&#146;s duties in the ways suggested in the proposed amendments could have serious repercussions for investment, first by creating regulatory uncertainty, and secondly by transferring to the economic regulator political decisions that are properly made by government. Moreover, at a time when we need significant new investment in the system to maintain security of supply and to help us make the transition to a low-carbon economy, and with no evidence to suggest that Ofgem&#146;s existing statutory duties are preventing this investment, such significant changes to Ofgem&#146;s primary remit seems to be an unnecessary risk to take. The Select Committee report on regulators, which I mentioned a moment ago, supported this argument. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080625116000122"></a>&#147;Government should be careful not to offload political policy issues onto unelected regulators&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80625-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000047"></a>During the Bill&#146;s passage in the other place, the Minister talked about the trade-offs involved in making decisions about sustainability issues. Let me reiterate those points. In Amendments Nos. 61 and 62, the third principle defines sustainability as delivering electricity and gas in a manner most likely to minimise adverse social and environmental impacts. However, there is an inherent tension between them. For example, renewables are generally more expensive than conventional  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC651"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column GC651</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>forms of energy, and higher fuel prices will lead to greater pressures on social policy. Should non-elected organisations be allowed to choose where the balance between such vital issues should lie?</p>

<a name="80625-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000048"></a>We argue&#151;I am surprised to hear any other political party argue the opposite&#151;and the report on regulators points out, that it is for an elected Government to make the political decisions about such trade-offs and the intergenerational distribution of costs. Ofgem and others who gave evidence to the Select Committee on regulators said they already thought that there is such a tension between Ofgem&#146;s social and environmental duties. However, these are subservient to its primary duties, and the fact that Ofgem&#146;s primary duty is to protect consumers through competition provides clarity where such tensions exist. Such clarity would be jeopardised if the duties were swapped in the ways suggested here.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000049"></a>Perhaps I will quote for the final time, if I may, the Select Committee report on regulators. It highlighted the importance of,</p>
<ul><a name="080625116000132"></a>&#147;an effective and transparent mechanism ... for resolving potential policy conflicts so that the regulators are able to carry out their economic function without interference&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080625116000109"></a>Moreover, one of the key points is grounded in Ofgem&#146;s economic function. We must remember that Ofgem is an economic regulator, and its tools&#151;for example, price controls&#151;are economic tools. It is the Government&#146;s role to make strategic policy decisions about the level of financial incentive that should be made available to support investment in low-carbon technologies, such as the support available for renewables through mechanisms such as the RO. Ofgem does not have the tools to function in this way, and we do not believe that an unelected, independent economic regulator should have them.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000050"></a>Most importantly, we have received no evidence to show that Ofgem&#146;s duties as currently framed are a barrier to increasing sustainability in the energy market, either in deploying more renewables or in delivering our overarching objective to reduce carbon emissions. Indeed, they are quite the opposite. Representatives of the sector, which between them will be responsible for making the majority of the new investments, in capacity terms, that we need to see in renewables, have told us that they do not want to see a change Ofgem&#146;s duties.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000051"></a>Investors tell us that the barrier to renewables deployment is not the authority&#146;s duties but the difficulties in securing planning consent, grid access, transmission and ongoing financial certainty of subsidy. We have been told that downgrading and diluting the duties on protecting the consumer and competition would not be a solution in the current climate of high prices. In fact, retaining a strong consumer focus, as it currently does in its primary role, will be even more important than before because the transition towards a low-carbon energy system may well raise costs in the short term, even if it leads to lower economic costs in the long term. There must be a need to ensure that those costs are efficient and not excessive, and the regulator can help us with that.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000052"></a>Specific examples of the work to tackle these specific investor concerns include our work with Ofgem on the transmission access review, which we will publish  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC652"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column GC652</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>tomorrow. The review has examined the technical, commercial and regulatory framework for the delivery of new transmission infrastructure and the management of the grid. Its aim is to ensure that the system and framework remain fit for purpose as the proportion of renewable generation on the system grows. The final report will include some proposals on how the regulatory regime might evolve to facilitate essential investment, and we will produce proposals on exactly this point very shortly.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000053"></a>We have also, with Ofgem, recently published new proposals for facilitating the connection of renewables to the lower voltage distribution networks. We are also launching a wider consultation over the summer on increasing our deployment of renewables. This consultation is based on the evidence we have received to date and will include any further measures that might be required over and above what will be set out in the final transmission access review report.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000054"></a>What investors are looking for from Ofgem is to see the Government&#146;s social and environmental guidance, to which Ofgem must have regard, updated and strengthened to properly reflect the significant developments in energy policy since 2004, when the guidance was last revised. We intend to consult very shortly on such new guidance alongside the renewable energy strategy. The updated guidance will set out the Government&#146;s expectation of the contribution that Ofgem should make on these issues. It will, as industry has requested, provide Ofgem with a clear steer on priorities such as facilitating the faster deployment of new generation such as renewables, both onshore and offshore, and the development of distributed energy. On the social side, it will, among other things, address our expectation that Ofgem will play a full part, consistent with its principal objective and general duties, in co-ordinating activity to help consumers who are on low incomes or who are otherwise vulnerable to fuel poverty&#151;</p>

The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, can defend himself, but it is wrong of the Minister to claim from the Dispatch Box that we are reversing the order of the principal objectives and responsibilities of Ofgem. That was not the intention of the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, nor do I believe for one moment that it is the intention of the Conservative Front Bench. This is to do with co-equal principal objectives. There is no reason why there should not be more than one principal objective. I spent a great deal of time on the Bill relating to Ofcom, which has a number of principal objectives. The idea that somehow you have to swap one for another is quite wrong, and it did not do justice to the Conservative Front Bench.</p>

Our reading of the amendment, if it were carried, is that far from just being a tweaking, which was one of the expressions used, it would be a fundamental change to Ofgem&#146;s obligations. That is why I made my comments to the noble Lord opposite, as it is very important that the public understand where he stands on this issue.</p>

By signing up to a target for 2020 of 20 per cent, the Government have already fundamentally changed the nature and cost of how we generate electricity. To say that we have to stick to the original objectives of cost and price at the same time as we are fundamentally altering the way which we generate that electricity seems to completely miss the reality. To turn round and say that consumers should not have to bear the cost in any way that will adversely affect them should have been thought of before signing up to the renewable obligation. What is being expected of Ofgem has changed. It has for many years run on a pantheon of two gods: reliability and cost. We are seeking to add a third equal god: carbon. That is a fundamental issue that we must deal with.</p>

He has already expressed another view: that it is not a fundamental change but a sort of tweaking. Both those views come from people who support the amendment. Our argument is that the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, is right. It is a fundamental change for Ofgem that places secure and sustainable energy as its principal objective. It must only have regard to other areas, including competition and consumer interest.</p>

That is our view. The noble Lord would like to see a fundamental change. I do not apologise for pressing the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, and his Front Bench on whether they see this as a fundamental change and, if so, whether they support it. We think that it would be a dangerous step to take in terms of the confidence of the very people who we want to invest in this industry, which will be vital in the years ahead.

<a name="80625-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000075"></a>The consultation over the summer will also help us to clarify and develop solutions to some of the other practical problems that the renewables sector is facing. Rather than overhauling Ofgem&#146;s duties, investors want to see us tackling the issues that they have identified, including updating Ofgem&#146;s guidance to reflect the latest government policy. I have a paper here that states what Ofgem is doing on sustainability. There is no need for me to quote from it now. As I say, we are extremely grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, and very much respect his independence of mind, his expertise and his courtesy in letting me know before I got to my feet that he would have to go before the end of the Committee. I am sure that we will return to this issue in due course. If noble Lords want to add anything, I ask them to do so before I sit down.</p>

<p><a name="080625116000076"></a><a name="80625-gc0006.htm_spnew34"></a><b><a name="80625-gc0006.htm_spnew35"></a><a name="080625116000170"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> This is a slightly strange procedure because the amendment that has been moved will have to be withdrawn by the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale. In the mean time, at the express request of the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, I shall fulfil the summing-up role. I will do so very briefly. There is some puzzlement about whether what is being proposed is a fundamental change or not. I saw it, as did the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, as an evolutionary change. I was therefore intrigued to hear the Minister say in reply that one of the things that the Government are doing is bringing forward proposals shortly about how the regulatory regime might evolve. One is tempted to ask whether we are going to have an evolved regime only if the Government have thought about it because they are not prepared to take it from anyone else. That would figure on the basis of past experience. I will not cite some of the examples, but we have certainly had them. The noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, was absolutely right to say that once again the Government are confusing ends and means. If we have, as we now do, climate change legislation on the statute book, is it really so fundamental and revolutionary to ask, as we do in the amendment, that the third principle be that,</p>
<ul><a name="080625116000133"></a>&#147;the reference to a sustainable system of electricity supply is a reference to the delivery of that system in a manner that, taken as a whole ... in particular by contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions within the meaning of the Climate Change Act 2008&#148;?</ul>
<p><a name="080625116000110"></a>Is it not therefore unreal to suggest that Ofgem should pay it no regard, or should only &#147;have to regard to&#148; it, or be subject to guidance? If one is to evolve, to use the Minister&#146;s word, how the regulatory regime may develop, and if we are shortly to see proposals, I do not see any difference in this. The Minister has erected a dragon for us to tilt at: there is no way that we can achieve it.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000077"></a>On one thing, however, the Minister is absolutely right: this issue will come back. It remains to be seen whether the amendment will be supported on all sides of the House, but I suspect that the Government may find themselves with an amendment that has happened twice in the past, with amendments I tabled during the  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC656"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column GC656</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>passage of the Utilities Act 2000 and the Energy Act 2004, which I moved, which were resisted, were passed by the House of Lords and were ultimately accepted in the other place. This may be a third example.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000078"></a>On the basis of the Minister&#146;s arguments, however, I remain completely unconvinced. What we propose is attuned to public and parliamentary expectations. There are certainly those in the industry who fully recognise that this must be done. Ofgem has said, as I quoted, that statutory duties are a matter for Parliament. Parliament now has an opportunity to achieve this aim and, when we come to debate this at a later stage, we will find that that is what Parliament wishes to do.</p>

<p><a name="080625116000079"></a><a name="80625-gc0006.htm_spnew36"></a><b><a name="80625-gc0006.htm_spnew37"></a><a name="080625116000171"></a>Lord Puttnam:</b> Purely to help the Minister&#151;and I am certain that this will come back&#151;I am afraid that he puts up a poor argument. The notion that you can somehow conveniently subdivide the political, economic and social concerns of a regulator has been blown away in the past few years. I ask the Minister and his officials to look carefully at the legislation under which Ofcom was formed. It was fought over extremely bitterly in both Houses. As the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, will remember, it was forced upon the Government.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000080"></a>It has been an enormous success. It was held that we were creating an impossible problem for Ofcom by bringing citizen and consumer interests together. It has worked perfectly well. The noble Lord spoke of tensions; any self-respecting regulator in the 21st century must look at the inevitable tensions between the social, the economic and the political. To describe that as an inappropriate job for a regulator would be quite wrong. Sooner or later, it will happen. I suspect that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, is correct: something like this will find its way in on Report. The Government will be forced to deal with it in a Division, and do themselves no favours by hiding behind the notion that, somehow, a banner saying &#147;Invest with confidence&#148; is sufficient to blow every other consideration and every debate we have had in Grand Committee out of the water. There are enormous considerations, and the regulator should be apprised and made responsible for, at least, advising the Government on getting through some difficult times.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000081"></a>Finally, Members of the Committee have spoken about regulatory and investor uncertainty. Nothing can create more investor uncertainty than the possibility of a new Government coming in with a new energy policy. The notion of an empowered regulator with a settled set of views would promote investor confidence far more than anything else I can think of.</p>

<p><a name="080625116000087"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 60 deals with the provision of greenhouse gas emissions performance standards for electricity generation. The amendment sets out its purpose, which is to test the view of the Government on whether greenhouse gases should be seen as a test of generation mix. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="080625116000088"></a><a name="80625-gc0007.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80625-gc0007.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="080625116000176"></a>Baroness Wilcox:</b> I support a greenhouse gas emissions performance standard. This side of the Committee has often said that there needs to be a transformation of the way we use and generate energy in this country. That change requires a fundamental shift in our long-term investment in energy and serious encouragement of new green technologies. We strongly feel that a performance emissions standard will do both those  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC658"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column GC658</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>things. The next 10 years will be crucial. The UK&#146;s energy landscape must be overhauled if we are to meet our target of reducing emissions by 26 per cent by 2020.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000089"></a>The way we produce energy is one of the largest contributors to our emissions. Unabated coal-powered generation, the most polluting technology, accounts for almost 40 per cent of the UK&#146;s current electricity capacity, and much of it is due to be decommissioned. Similarly, a significant majority of the UK&#146;s nuclear supply is also due for retirement, and this is all happening at a time when energy demand is expected to rise. It is therefore necessary for transformative steps to be taken if we are to ensure a secure supply of energy.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000090"></a>Now is our opportunity. We support a legally binding UK emissions performance standard that would mean that there would be a maximum level of emissions allowed per megawatt hour, more or less benchmarked on modern combined-cycle gas turbine plants. The implication would be that new coal-fired power stations in the UK would have to incorporate carbon capture and storage technology from the outset, limiting their emissions to the level achieved by modern gas stations. This proposal has worked well in California. Governor Schwarzenegger describes EPS as operating in a similar fashion to the standard set for household appliances, such as refrigerators, where there are minimum performance standards beyond which it is up to the market to compete as products meet or exceed the minimum standard. This proposal would require the Government to fund a variety of CCS demonstration projects over the next five to 10 years. We on these Benches would be prepared to give such funding and would pay for it out of receipts from the third and subsequent stages of European Union Emissions Trading Scheme.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000091"></a>An emissions performance standard would revolutionise the development of carbon capture and storage. It would send clear market signals regarding the direction of the industry, letting developers know that the energy that they produce must be as clean as the highest efficiency plants currently in operation. That would open up the market. It would let suppliers choose which way they pursue this level of green commitment&#151;through carbon capture, renewables or different types of gasification. The emissions performance standard would prevent plants such as Kingsnorth from being built without technologies that abate its impact on the environment. We would assist the industry in making these changes. This help would ensure a diversified, clean energy mix for the UK and develop the industry in a way that prepares it for the decades ahead.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000092"></a>The long-term benefit extends beyond our borders. The UK would be seen as a test bed for CCS technology. It would be the birth of an industry that is not only exportable, but likely to be essential around the world in the coming years. If problems could be worked out here and the intellectual property rights established in this country, the UK would be able to lead a worldwide energy revolution, with British workers leading the way.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000093"></a>The amendment seems to be a general enabling amendment. I am sure that the Minister will be quick to point out some problems with the drafting, if he can hear me. I am prepared to repeat that.</p>

It is a principle that we fundamentally support from these Benches. We look forward to the Minister's response.</p>

<p><a name="080625116000096"></a><a name="80625-gc0007.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80625-gc0007.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="080625116000179"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I am grateful to the noble Baroness and the noble Lord for speaking to this amendment. I note that the noble Lord wants to hear where the Government stand in general, broad terms on this issue, so he will forgive me if I take a little time. We sympathise with the broad objective, but we do not believe that the amendment would serve to increase the effectiveness of the Government&#146;s actions to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. We believe that, as currently formulated, the amendment could be counterproductive. However, I do not want any unnecessary polarisation of this debate, because as much as anything this is a probing amendment. The amendment is very important and I do not believe that the overall respective positions are very far apart on this matter. In particular, we agree&#151;as does the noble Baroness&#151;with the concept of a cap on carbon dioxide emissions. We differ on how this cap should be set.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000097"></a>We are convinced that the most appropriate level for any carbon dioxide cap on electricity generation is that it should be part of a broader overall cap on such emissions within the economy and not at individual power station level. This gives the market freedom to deliver carbon reductions in the parts of the economy where they are most cost effective. Moreover, because climate change is not a battle just for us in the UK, the effectiveness and credibility of any such carbon dioxide cap is strengthened if the cap is set at multinational not just national level. That is why we believe that the right strategy is to deliver a cap and the resultant carbon emission reductions through the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000098"></a>I will first explain our emissions reduction strategy. We are committed to meeting our greenhouse gas reduction target. The Climate Change Bill, the first of its kind anywhere in the world, will set out a framework for achieving that through legally binding targets and &#147;carbon budgets&#148;, and will help to provide the certainty and confidence that business and individuals need to encourage them to make the necessary long-term investments in low-carbon technologies.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000099"></a>Within the strategic context, our approach is that set out in the White Paper. It is intended to secure the twin objectives of achieving emissions reductions, but at the same time maintaining reliable energy supplies. The key to delivering these objectives is the trading scheme. The EU ETS sets an overall cap on EU-wide greenhouse gas emissions, but allows companies to decide the most cost-effective way of delivering them. The cap is an ambitious one: in the Commission&#146;s proposed draft directive, for example, emissions covered by the scheme will be 21 per cent below 2005 levels by 2020, which is a very challenging target indeed.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000100"></a>Furthermore, the cap includes emissions from all the EU&#146;s power stations that exceed the 20 megawatt threshold, and will continue to decrease annually after 2020 in keeping with the EU&#146;s emission reduction  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC660"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column GC660</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>targets. Importantly, the cap cannot be expanded. Therefore, any new power stations will have to fit within the existing emissions limits set at the EU-wide level. This means that any limit on emissions from a particular power station or group of power stations would not lead to additional carbon savings overall. The EU ETS is at the heart of our global effort to tackle climate change, and we have been working closely with the Commission and other member states to ensure that in phase 3 and beyond, the EU ETS is strengthened and consolidated with increased transparency and improved stability. We have seen the scheme already develop with forward contracts for EU emission allowances currently trading at around &#8364;25 per tonne of carbon dioxide. Companies will have to take that real and substantive financial cost into account when making their investment decisions.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000101"></a>We are confident that going forward, the strengthened EU ETS will play a pivotal role in cutting the power sector&#146;s emissions in the UK and Europe. It will do so in a way that is consistent with the market principles which help to make carbon savings in the most cost-effective manner possible. I do not know whether the Committee is with me or not. Because of this existing framework, the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, would not have the effect of further reducing the carbon emissions from power stations.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000102"></a>Amendment No. 60 would give the Secretary of State the power to make regulations prescribing a greenhouse gases emissions performance standard for new generating stations and would prohibit the consenting of new stations under Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 unless they are compliant with that standard. It would have the effect of constraining the possibilities for delivering the diverse energy mix that the UK requires for ensuring the security of supply, while also impinging on the effectiveness of the EU ETS. The amendment is clearly targeted at energy generated from fossil fuels, particularly coal. We believe, and we hope to explain, the important role that fossil fuels play&#151;and should play&#151;going forward in the UK energy mix.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000103"></a>I return briefly to why the Government believe that the existing framework for tackling carbon emissions is right and how new fossil fuel power stations can be compatible with an overall drive to reduce emissions. As the Committee knows well, the UK potentially faces a growing energy generation gap, with about a third of our existing capacity closing by 2020. Nine fossil fuel power plants, comprising around 12 gigawatts of capacity&#151;about 20 per cent of peak demand this year&#151;are scheduled to close by the end of 2015 as a result of EU environmental legislation. Seven nuclear power plants with a combined capacity of more than 6.5 gigawatts are also scheduled to close by 2020, with another 4 gigawatts in later years.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080625116000104"></a>The Government have made it clear that they want to see a step change in the use of renewable generation by 2020, but because most of that renewable energy will come from wind, which is an intermittent form of energy, we still need significant conventional capacity to provide back-up. In the shorter term, where the build rates of new renewables and nuclear will be  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC661"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column GC661</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>constrained, we will have to continue to rely on fossil fuels for base load electricity generation. This view of the future is not confined to the UK. The International Energy Agency predicts, under its most positive scenario, that fossil fuels will still provide approximately 38 per cent of total worldwide electricity generation by 2030.</p>
<h5><a name="080625116000139"></a>7 pm</h5>

<a name="80625-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000002"></a>Fossil fuel power stations have the capacity to operate flexibly and to respond effectively to fluctuations in supply and demand, which will be increasingly important as we increase the share of renewables in the mix. Any CO2 cap set at a level that prevents new coal-fired power stations without CCS could create a repeat of the &#147;dash for gas&#148; that occurred in the UK in the late 1980s and early 1990s. A further increased reliance on gas-fired power stations in our electricity supplies would leave us even more exposed to international gas markets as availability of our national resources declines.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000003"></a>Coal-fired power generation also plays a key role in balancing the gas market when gas supplies are tight, mitigating security of supply concerns. The risk to security of supply of an overreliance on gas in the UK is not a theoretical point. As we saw in the winter of 2005-06, our power system&#146;s ability to use less gas by increasing the consumption of coal was instrumental during this time of shortage in making gas available to industry and domestic users. Without this flexibility, prices would likely have been higher, thus adding costs to our economy and there would have been a greater risk of capacity-related blackouts. As we move to an era where we will be more dependent on imports for our energy needs, our need for a diverse electricity-generating mix will be greater than ever. We need maximum flexibility to allow us to withstand and respond to any possible fuel supply crunches. Fossil fuels, including coal, need to play a role in the UK&#146;s electricity supply even with a transition to low-carbon power generation and a low-carbon economy. The effect of this amendment would be to rule out new coal power stations until such time as CCS technology is commercially available and economically viable.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000004"></a>The cap imposed by the EU ETS, however, enables new coal-fired power stations to be constructed by requiring equivalent carbon dioxide savings to be made elsewhere in the economy. Significant improvements in design specifications already mean that new coal-fired plants would emit approximately 20 per cent less CO2 than older coal-fired power stations. Moreover, carbon capture and storage offers the possibility of reducing this still further, with a potential of up to 90 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions from such power generation. Therefore, alongside our work on the EU ETS, we are taking steps to ensure that CCS is a real option for the future. We are, of course, one of the very few countries in the world with a definite commitment to supporting a commercial-scale carbon capture and storage project.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000005"></a>We are also considering whether we should require future power stations to be built &#147;capture ready&#148;. We will be launching a consultation on carbon capture readiness shortly. It will seek views on European proposals requiring member states to incorporate capture ready considerations in the consenting process. This is contained in the EU proposal for a directive on geological storage  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC662"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column GC662</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of CO2. In particular, the consultation that we are launching will consider the factors which define what constitutes capture readiness for any new plants.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000006"></a>We believe that a statutory limit on carbon dioxide emissions from individual new fossil fuel power stations would not give us additional help in our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The noble Lord&#146;s amendment would constrain the possibilities for delivering the diverse energy mix that we require as a country for ensuring our security of supply. With each new restriction, we further tie the hands of the market, limiting its options for investing in the infrastructure necessary to meet all our energy policy goals, which include tackling climate change.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000007"></a>Finally, we also believe that advances in the design specification of fossil fuel power stations, the Government&#146;s support for the development of carbon capture and storage and the concept of carbon capture readiness mean that it is consistent with the framework of the EU ETS for new fossil fuel powered plants to play their part in our economy&#146;s transition into low-carbon generation.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000008"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, praised the Californian arrangement. The context is quite different. We have decided to adopt a market-based approach to reducing emissions in the EU; there is no equivalent of the EU ETS in California. Frankly, placing artificial constraints on the market to deliver reforms makes no sense in the EU, where we have a sound market-based mechanism to reduce emission with the EU ETS. I am grateful to the noble Lord for moving his amendment and thus allowing a discussion of where we stand on this important issue.</p>

<p><a name="080625130000009"></a><a name="80625-gc0007.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80625-gc0007.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="080625130000095"></a>Lord Redesdale:</b> I thank the Minister for his fulsome reply, and the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, for her erudite exposition of the amendment itself. I am probably one of the few complete sceptics on the value of the EU ETS in Parliament&#151;but that is personal opinion, not the view of my party. We are reliant on this unproven mechanism producing enormous amounts of carbon reduction, so a degree of scepticism towards a system that has had faults in the past is reasonable.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000010"></a>However, the Minister has been careful in his response, for which I thank him. The amendment looks at testing power stations as we test emissions of cars. I do not see why we should not look at power stations operating on that basis. The amendment looks at reducing the amount of coal, which will be part of the mix for the foreseeable future. However, reducing the amount of carbon dioxide from coal-fired power stations through co-firing and other new technologies should not be limited by capping the released CO2; in fact, it would be veritably encouraged by it. Having said that, the Minister has given a good reply and, on that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="080625130000014"></a>The noble Lord said: Microgeneration is an issue I feel particularly strongly about, as is the removal of barriers to the use of micro-hydro-generation, which have caused many problems for those looking into it. One is the definition of microgeneration being at 50 kilowatts. Many micro-hydro-generation plants operate above 50 kilowatts; a 100-kilowatt level would be much more realistic.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000015"></a>The great benefit of hydrogenation is that it is not as variable as wind. Indeed, the water runs a watercourse and there is no drop in power output, making it a useful form of microgeneration. Of course, you will not get the same level of power, because watercourse microgeneration is limited by the flow of water. I have tramped up and down hillsides in Northumberland looking at different rivers to see exactly what could be generated from the water flow. You need quite a large, steady flow from a river to make micro-hydro-generation realistic.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000016"></a>However, the use of water in power generation is one of the oldest forms in this country. The water-wheel is symbolic. <I>The Mill on the Floss</I> showed that the power of such things can be quite lethal. However, our problem is not just based on the 50-kilowatt limit for microgeneration, which limits the power output, but also that redirecting the water from a watercourse, through a mill and back into the river is counted as water extraction. Even though the water returns to the same river, and you could be rebuilding a mill that has done it for hundreds of years, that is seen as breaking the Water Resources Act 1991, the Environment Act 1995 and the Water Act 2003. This is an unintended consequence of that legislation. I know that the Minister will say that the limit on microgeneration is being reviewed, and I very much hope that he will indicate that a limit of at least 100 kilowatts will be looked at in the case of hydro-micro-generation.</p>

<p><a name="080625130000017"></a>If the Minister is minded to oppose the amendment, will he say at what stage there will be an opportunity to change the legislation with regard to water being taken from a watercourse and fed back into a watercourse? This would be a perfect opportunity to do so, because it is to do with the generation of power and it is easy enough to amend these Acts at this point. However, if he then says that we should look at another piece of legislation, all the people who run these forms of generation at the moment will have to wait even longer to bring them online. That would be extremely unfortunate, because the carbon saving of these devices is particularly worthy of note. Their reliability is not in doubt, unless of course there is a drought and a drop in water pressure. One would hope that that was only a temporary affair, although as the whole Bill is about reducing carbon dioxide and the effects of climate change, it might have to be taken into account.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000018"></a>This is a very small measure that would have a major impact on a large number of schemes around the country that want to make use of such a natural resource. I beg to move.</p>

Part of this will focus on the viability of feed-in tariffs, for which we had such wide support when we debated that amendment last week.

As it happens, I have a piece of paper in my hand that deals with that issue. We have always said that feed-in tariffs for microgeneration would be considered alongside other options as part of the consultation that we are running over the summer, which in turn will feed into our renewable energy strategy. By October, with the consultation closed and the responses in, we will be able to give an initial assessment of the responses on microgeneration and can have a more informed discussion of the issues concerning a feed-in tariff for microgeneration. We will be happy to discuss the issue, and our initial view of those consultation responses received, with interested Peers before Report. I hope that that satisfies the Committee and that it will generally be supported.</p>

<p><a name="080625130000021"></a>I shall now respond to the noble Lord&#146;s very interesting amendment. He wishes in his amendment to encourage the deployment of hydro-micro-generation and talks about a number of issues that have been raised by the British Hydropower Association.</p>

<p><a name="080625130000022"></a>Microgeneration, including hydro-microgeneration, has an important role to play in delivering our renewable energy targets, which is why the noble Baroness&#146;s intervention was appropriate for this amendment. We have already taken a number of steps to promote microgeneration and will be taking a serious look at  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC665"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column GC665</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>what further action should be taken. The amendment would require the Secretary of State within one year of the passing of the Bill to make regulations relating to hydro-microgeneration defined as less than 100 kilowatts and provides for such regulations to deal specifically with regulatory issues relating to such generation.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000023"></a>These regulations fall into two groups. The first group deals with the treatment of hydro-microgeneration under Sections 32 to 32M of the Electricity Act 1989&#151;the part of the Act that sets out provisions on the renewables obligation. The second group deals with requirements set out by the Environment Agency. Let me deal first with the renewables obligation. The details of how the obligation is implemented are set out in a statutory instrument, the renewables obligation order, which already allows for differences between generating stations: differences between the treatment of large and small generators, or differences between the treatment of certain technologies such as co-firing with regular biomass and co-firing using energy crops, for example.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000024"></a>In our view, it is overly bureaucratic to have a separate set of regulations that deal solely with the treatment of hydro-microgeneration under the RO, not to mention increasingly complex and confusing for the generators themselves. For example, a generator using a mix of technologies, such as a small wind turbine alongside their hydro plant, would need to have regard to two sets of regulations that both seek to implement the same system.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000025"></a>We are aware that the BHA has concerns that current proposals do not provide the correct level of support to those hydro-microgeneration stations that fall just above the 50 kilowatt threshold that we use to define microgeneration for all technologies. The Committee will recall that at Second Reading my noble friend Lord Hunt mentioned that issue and was written to by noble friend Lord Jones of Birmingham. </p>

<a name="80625-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000026"></a>It is worth noting that wherever one sets a threshold, there will always be interested parties who fall either the right side or the wrong side of that threshold. But we are sympathetic to this issue and have been in discussions with the BHA to consider this further. We understand that the BHA is currently undertaking a scoping study on hydro-microgeneration. Any evidence from the study will be taken into consideration on the detailed arrangements for a banded RO as part of the statutory consultation due to be published later this summer.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000027"></a>I now turn to the second part of this amendment; the proposal to make the installation of hydro-microgeneration exempt from the Environment Agency&#146;s licensing requirements. Everyone would agree that it remains imperative that while we push for an increase in renewables we must not do so at the expense of the environment, particularly in this case the rivers and the wildlife associated with them. I am aware of the sector&#146;s concerns about the perceived disproportionate regulatory burden that it feels is placed on it. I am happy to say that the Environment Agency and British Hydropower Association are working closely together to scope out guidance that aims to streamline the legislation through a good practice guide. The department

<a name="80625-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000028"></a>The impacts on the environment from hydro-microgeneration, which may be in the form of effects on water resources, flood risk, fish, ecology or navigation, are not always easy to assess. In addition to the guide, I am happy for officials in my department to facilitate a meeting between the regulator and the hydro-microgeneration industry to discuss this issue rather than trying to deal with this through additional regulation. My officials have spoken to officials from the Environment Agency to arrange a meeting to discuss how best to take it forward.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000029"></a>I hope I have given the Committee some reassurance that the Government are working with the industry on the promotion of hydro-microgeneration, and explained why we do not think the amendment is the appropriate way forward today.</p>

I very much hope that he will arrange a meeting between his officials and the British Hydropower Association so that they will have concluded before the next stage of the Bill and we can discuss the outcome of such deliberations.

<p><a name="080625130000037"></a>The noble Lord said: I will be brief as I would hate to keep the noble Baroness in Grand Committee longer than she wishes. This is a simple amendment and one that has been clarified substantially by the Minister very positively in Committee.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000038"></a>We on these Benches are committed to the EU ETS, and we unanimously think that it is a good system, and an important one as part of climate change, but it is only part of the jigsaw. I tabled the amendment for two reasons. First, the auctioning of EU ETS permits post-2012 is essential for the energy sector. The Commission clearly proposes that this should happen, but the proposals have not yet been agreed or become a directive that has received assent in Europe. We do not know the outcome at present.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000039"></a>Secondly, although I strongly welcome the Minister&#146;s indication that it will happen, there will be a general election between now and 2012. Although we have government assurances now, we have no idea who will be the Administration by the time the third stage of the EU ETS comes into play. It could be a Conservatives and a Liberal alliance, or more likely perhaps Labour and the DUP. I do not know.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000040"></a>It is important to bring this into the Bill so that it is far more difficult, under pressure perhaps from industry or other sectors, for any Government to move back on this, even though, I hope, the EU ETS phase 3 directive will make this mandatory. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="080625130000041"></a><a name="80625-gc0008.htm_spnew16"></a><b><a name="80625-gc0008.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="080625130000105"></a>Lord Jenkin of Roding:</b> I have been tabling Questions for Written Answer on what will happen to the proceeds of these auctions. There has been some pressure to suggest that, when the money is raised through the auctions, it should be earmarked for energy and environmental purposes. However, the Answers I have received from the Minister in Defra said that the usual Treasury rules will apply and that it would not be earmarked or ring-fenced in any way, but that it would simply go into the general pot to be part of the revenue that will finance the Government&#146;s total expenditure. I wonder whether that is right. I do not want to insist that one way or the other is right, but it seems that these have a rather special origin and, perhaps, might deserve some special treatment. It would be very helpful if the Minister could say anything about that.</p>

<p><a name="080625130000042"></a><a name="80625-gc0008.htm_spnew18"></a><b><a name="80625-gc0008.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="080625130000106"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I am delighted that the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, is in favour of the EU ETS scheme, which I am sure represents his party&#146;s views. Having spent the past three or four weeks on the European Union Bill, I would have been extremely surprised if it did not. I am grateful to the noble Lord for moving his amendment.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000043"></a>With a motivation similar to that of Amendment No. 54, which was brought forward yesterday, we believe that this proposed new clause is drafted with the aim of eliminating the windfall profits of the companies participating in the trading scheme by auctioning 100 per cent of allowances to the large electricity producers. I hope that the noble Lord will forgive me if I do not go back to that discussion and the background I gave at some length&#151;well, not at that great a length&#151;of the EU ETS.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC668"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column GC668</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80625-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000044"></a>As I said in my response, the Government announced in this year&#146;s Budget that they would auction 100 per cent of allowances to the large electricity producers beyond 2012 in phase 3 addressing the issue of windfall profits. This is our negotiating line in Brussels. The noble Lord will be pleased to hear that we are pressing hard for the directive to accommodate this domestic policy. Given our commitment to 100 per cent auctioning in the UK, we would adopt the maximum permissible level of auctioning in the third phase. However, the Emissions Trading Scheme directive is EU policy and the details of phase 3 are yet to be negotiated, so we would not want to pre-empt it with domestic legislation on this issue now. Moreover, we believe the proposed amendment would add perhaps unnecessary legislation on top of the EU directive, which would not be very good in the practice of better regulation.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000045"></a>Members of the Committee will recall that avoiding pre-empting EU legislation and legislative duplication are consistent themes. We have already spoken of the dangers in relation to priority access for renewables, and during last week&#146;s proceedings we discussed an amendment that sought to duplicate an EU principle of law on non-discrimination in the chapter of the Bill on the renewables obligation. Furthermore, while we are pushing for 100 per cent auctioning for electricity producers in phase 3, we should not be seeking to act unilaterally on this. I hope that the noble Lord would agree with that. As such, we would want to retain flexibility for future phases.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000046"></a>I repeat that we remain committed to the principle of auctioning and to pushing for 100 per cent auctioning for the power sector in Europe. However, we also believe strongly that in the multilateral and long-term arena of climate change and in the EU ETS the principle of climate change in one country is a difficult issue in a global environment, and success depends on multinational agreements. It is prudent to retain some flexibility in policy terms at a national level, which is something that the proposed amendment, which I believe to be a probing amendment, would not allow. I hope that I have given the noble Lord some reassurance that the Government are committed to achieving the goal that he believes in. We do not think that the amendment is needed, and so I ask him to withdraw it.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000047"></a>I am afraid that I cannot help the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, as much as he would like me to. The note that I have in front of me states that the issue he raises&#151;a good issue, of course&#151;is a matter for the Treasury. It may well be that in his long and distinguished career, he has seen, or even had to use, such an argument himself.</p>

As he probably realises, this amendment is drafted so that it does not in any way pre-empt EU legislation.

The Minister is right that it is particularly around windfall

It is important in terms of energy policy and climate change policy that once we introduce significant auctioning we immediately realise a realistic level of carbon pricing that has a much greater effect throughout the economy and means that the market mechanism on carbon, which we all want to work, starts to operate effectively.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000050"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, for his intervention. I tried to table an amendment broadly about the EU ETS and the allocation of that money, but it was not allowed. Having read the proposal to the Commission and considering where the negotiations are, I understood that it was specifically a European proposal as part of the directive that 25 per cent of the proceeds of auctioning under the EU ETS would go towards energy saving schemes and renewables to meet the other targets that are part of the European Commission&#146;s climate change package. I may be wrong on that. It is slightly more complicated post-2012, because it is proposed that there will be no national allocation plans, and I do not know how the Commission proposes to allocate on a sector rather than national basis. It would be interesting to know how those allocations, which are supposed to be auctioned nationally, are to be made if there are no national allocation plans. However, that is another issue.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000051"></a>I welcome the Government&#146;s commitment in the negotiations, which are important, towards a high degree of auctioning in this sector where there is not really international competition. That is why the competitiveness issues do not really come in. In other sectors of industry, the argument is more complicated, but that is outside the ambit of the Bill. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000054"></a>The noble Lord said: I will be a bit longer on this amendment. I do not want to go through all the arguments and descriptions that we went through in Committee last week. This is an important area in terms of renewable power. Geothermal energy is not a cranky technology, but is proven in surface and deep geology. As yet, the elements have not come together to be productive.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000055"></a>The technology has been experimentally tested in the United Kingdom. To give Members of the Committee an idea, the power generated by a typical unit of geothermal energy is around 6 megawatts, and they are often clustered in groups of four or five, coming up to a 30 megawatt installation. They have a small footprint, and most people would probably not even notice where they were; they certainly do not emit noise or anything like that.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000056"></a>This is becoming an active area of research and deployment. Deployment of geothermal at a shallow level operates worldwide; it works in New Zealand, Japan and Iceland, and is a successful form of renewable, non-carbon energy. Deep rocks technology is now being strongly explored in Australia, Germany and the United States. I have a document commissioned by the United States federal Government and produced by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with a number of British experts, on energy security issues and the implementation of hot rocks geothermal energy.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000057"></a>The benefits to the UK of this technology are that is it non-carbon and renewable. It can be used for heating or electricity and has a very small ground footprint and significant generation capacity. If it was in the right place, once developed, it could supply large cities.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000058"></a>I have tabled the amendment because there are high up-front costs, as with all renewable technologies, with investment&#151;although the fuel is free once the system is developed. The hydro-carbon regime for licensing does not really work. There are all sorts of legal complications in British law with mineral and surface rights. Development will probably take 10 to 15 years before operation; it is similar in many ways to the nuclear power industry. It is also similar in that the technology produces a constant base-load of electricity. Unlike other renewables, it is not variable and is therefore particularly important in the renewable energy mix.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0008.htm_para29"></a>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80625-gc0009.htm"/>



<p><a name="080625130000059"></a>The clear problem for this technology is legal certainty: mineral and surface rights&#151;the minerals are not extracted; and who owns the heat generated, which has no physical quality but is a state described as a &#147;fugitive characteristic&#148;. It also takes a major investment, something like &#163;10 million, to put down a five-kilometre borehole to  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC671"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column GC671</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>reach the necessary 200 degrees centigrade. That investment is not certain. Once it is proven that the resource is there and will work, another extractor can come along to the field next door and mine the same heat resource, prejudicing the first borehole, and the risk taken by the first party is not taken by the second. Hence, the amendment looks forward to a legal framework through which this important technology can be exploited within the United Kingdom by both foreign and domestic organisations that are into this technology. Without this legal framework, the technology cannot move forward.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000060"></a>The amendment makes sure that the licensing regime is clearly below 2 kilometres, so that it does not get in the way of areas such as Southampton, which the Minister mentioned last week. It does not involve shallow waters, mine shafts or those sorts of areas. It keeps clear of all the rights above 2 kilometres. It in no way means that there is a right of access to the surface land, which would clearly be unacceptable; nor does it presume a planning permission right, which would have to go through the normal local authority procedures. This is an important amendment to enable a key area of base load renewable energy to be at least explored in the short term, and to lead in the medium and long term to an important potential source of renewable energy.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000061"></a>Finally, I thank the Minister and his staff for already having entered into a conversation about this, which I think will be very productive. A meeting is arranged for July, where a number of experts and potential practitioners in the field will come together. It is appropriate that the next stage of the Bill will probably be after the Summer Recess. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="080625130000062"></a><a name="80625-gc0009.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80625-gc0009.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="080625130000110"></a>Lord Bach:</b> As the noble Lord said, we have already had a good debate on some aspects of geothermal energy earlier in the Committee process. I am delighted to agree with the noble Lord that both sides have been quick off the mark, and the meeting is arranged, as I understand it, for 24 July.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000063"></a>During that debate, I explained that, although the energy sector had not brought forward any proposed new developments for electricity and heat generation from geothermal energy, in the context of the very challenging EU renewables targets the Government would be interested in finding out more about the prospects of that technology. I am sure that the Committee wishes the meeting in late July well.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000064"></a>The amendment proposes the creation of a licensing system for companies exploiting the heat from deep geothermal sources for the direct use of heat and for the use of that heat to generate electricity. It raises an interesting issue. On balance, we think that it would be premature to create such a regime, and therefore I will resist the amendment. I do not propose to revisit in detail all the points that I made previously about the issue, but I will remind the Committee of the points that I made last week.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC672"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column GC672</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80625-gc0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000065"></a>Since the prospects for the deployment of geothermal power were explored in the late 1970s and 1980s, in the face of technical issues there has been no further work undertaken in the UK. However, there has been work at a European level. To date, the Government have not been approached by developers who are keen to explore the potential for geothermal projects, but we are keen to meet developers and that will now take place. The lack of geothermal developments in the UK in no way represents any government antipathy towards the technology, but merely a lack of proposals from the market.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000066"></a>The issue about licensing is not straightforward. Our initial legal analysis&#151;I stress that it is initial&#151;suggests that geothermal projects could be consented under the existing legislative framework; although we accept that, should there be a large expansion in the industry, there could be a case for streamlining legislation in this area. However, given that there are no live proposals, and we are not even aware of any in the pipeline, we consider the amendment to be a little premature. By contrast, other licensing regimes, such as those being created in the Bill, are a result of specific needs to cater for imminent projects and consultations with interested parties.</p>

<a name="80625-gc0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080625130000067"></a>If and when deep geothermal energy reaches a stage where the regulatory requirements are better known and we are getting a clear message that the absence of a bespoke licensing regime is stifling private sector investment, we would look to legislate for such requirements at the earliest opportunity. I do not think that the noble Lord could expect me to go further than that today. On that basis, I ask him to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="080625130000068"></a><a name="80625-gc0009.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80625-gc0009.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="080625130000111"></a>Lord Teverson:</b> That was even more positive than I had expected, so I thank the Minister for that. It will be an interesting meeting in July. An Australian company that is very interested will be there. I welcome the comment that he thinks that a licensing regime may not be necessary at the beginning. If that were the case, I think we would all say hurrah to that, but that will be no doubt be discussed with his department and determined as we go along. I very much welcome the Minister's statement and, at this point, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="08062582000011"></a><a name="80625-wms0001.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80625-wms0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08062582000104"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (Edward Miliband) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08062582000012"></a>On 21 November, the Prime Minister announced that he had asked the Cabinet Secretary, with the advice of security experts, to work with departments to ensure that all departments and all agencies check their procedures for the storage and use of data. An interim report, published on 17 December, summarised action taken across government and set out initial directions of reform to strengthen the Government&#146;s arrangements.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08062582000013"></a>I am today placing a final report in the Libraries of both Houses. The final report summarises work conducted in departments to improve data handling.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="08062582000014"></a>It further sets out how the Government are improving information security by putting in place:</p>
core measures to protect personal data and other information across government;a culture that properly values, protects and uses information;stronger accountability mechanisms within departments; andstronger scrutiny of performance.
<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="08062582000015"></a>The measures being put in place, which represent a new set of minimum mandatory standards for departments, include:</p>
 introducing new rules on the use of protective measures, such as encryption and penetration testing of systems;standardising and enhancing the processes by which departments understand and manage their information risk, identifying the key individuals responsible for information assets and setting out their responsibilities;requiring a quarterly risk assessment within each department of the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information;introducing mandatory training for all staff involved in handling personal data, with training taking place on appointment and reinforced on an annual basis;requiring the use of privacy impact assessments when introducing new policy or processes that involve the use of personal data;introducing greater scrutiny and monitoring through the inclusion of the information risk in statements on internal control, which are scrutinised by the National Audit Office and through spot checks by the Information Commissioner;   


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS102"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column WS102</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>further enhancing transparency of arrangements, through annual reporting to Parliament on progress and the use of information charters which provide clarity to citizens about the use and handling of personal data; anda range of other measures to improve information security across government.
<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="08062582000016"></a>The Cabinet Secretary&#146;s work was informed in part by a review of information assurance by Nick Coleman, which is also published today, with copies being placed in the Libraries of both Houses. To complement today&#146;s report, Sir David Omand is examining the handling of highly classified documents. The Cabinet Secretary is looking at the implementation of the rules for handling documents and will take account of Sir David&#146;s findings.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="08062582000017"></a>Progress in implementing the new measures and actions announced today will be overseen by the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Personal Data Security. Departments will report each year on their individual position, and the Cabinet Office will report annually to Parliament on progress across government as a whole, with the first report following the end of the 2008-09 financial year.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="08062582000018"></a>Effective public services depend on information about the people they serve; but, in order to command public confidence, that information needs to be safely stored and protected. The Government are determined to take the necessary steps to improve data security. The measures outlined today are an important part of that process.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="08062582000019"></a><a name="80625-wms0001.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80625-wms0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08062582000105"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Gerry Sutcliffe) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="08062582000020"></a>In recent months I have received a range of representations from trade bodies in the gambling industry seeking changes to the regulatory regime for gaming machines established by the Gambling Act 2005 (&#147;the Act&#148;), and implemented by secondary legislation from 1 September 2007.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="08062582000021"></a>Through the Act, we have established a comprehensive new system of regulation for gaming machines, with consumer protection at its heart. Our number one priority remains to protect the public, and I have considered the representations we have received with this uppermost in mind.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="08062582000022"></a>A number of honourable Members have expressed support for the campaigns led by the Bingo Association and the British Amusement Catering Trades Association (BACTA). I have also received representations from the British Beer and Pub Association, the British Association of Leisure Parks, Piers and Attractions and the British Casino Association. I wish now to report to the House the Government&#146;s response.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="08062582000023"></a>While the evidence that has been presented from across the industry is mixed, the Government recognise that many operators have found trading conditions difficult.</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS103"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column WS103</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="08062582000024"></a>There are likely to be a range of reasons for the current downturn. While the evidence presented to me concentrates almost exclusively on regulatory factors, it attaches lesser or no weight to a range of other plausible factors such as levels of investment in product development, longer-term structural and technological changes and wider economic factors. Whilst it is open to government to take action within the framework of the Act, the industry must recognise and find its own solutions to some of these problems.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="08062582000025"></a>Representations have also been made to me concerning what were dubbed under the previous legislation Section 16 and Section 21 machines. Whatever the view in some sections of the industry of what earlier legislation permitted, there seems little value in prolonging that debate now. The current legal position is beyond doubt.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="08062582000026"></a>The new system of regulation established by the Act, and the strict limits it imposes, were set only after lengthy debate during pre-legislative scrutiny, the passage of the Gambling Bill, and on the relevant secondary legislation. The principal trade bodies, including the Bingo Association and BACTA, played a full role throughout the passage of this legislation and in the public consultation that preceded it.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="08062582000027"></a>I must consider the requests for changes within the new framework established by the Act and agreed recently by Parliament. That framework gives Parliament the final say; it is for the Government to decide what proposals should be put to public consultation and then presented to Parliament for consideration.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="08062582000028"></a>I have concluded that there is strong evidence that the situation in the bingo industry has been particularly acute. Between 31 March 2004 and 31 March 2007 the number of bingo clubs operating fell from 696 to 634. A further 37 clubs closed during 2007-08, around 6 per cent of the industry.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="08062582000029"></a>Colleagues in the House will recognise that bingo clubs fulfil an important social function in many communities. The 2007 Henley report, commissioned by the Bingo Association, found that for many people, especially older and retired women, bingo is their main or sole leisure pursuit outside the home. Despite the range of deregulatory measures that we have already introduced to assist the industry, it is clear that the future of bingo clubs in many communities is under threat.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="08062582000030"></a>I am persuaded that a number of other special circumstances apply to bingo. These include the fact that under the industry&#146;s business model there is high demand for machines during short periods of the day, which may impair the fair and open conduct of gambling.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="08062582000031"></a>I have also noted two additional points made by the Bingo Association that:</p>
while in recognition of the enhanced social responsibilities imposed by the Act, casinos, betting shops and adult gaming centres (AGCs) received an enhanced gaming machine entitlement, bingo halls retained the same machine entitlement as under the Gaming Act 1968; and, bingo halls provide a softer gambling environment in which gaming machines are ancillary to bingo.  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS104"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column WS104</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="08062582000032"></a>The Bingo Association has argued that, to help arrest the decline, the number of category B3 machines (&#163;1 maximum stake, &#163;500 maximum prize) which bingo halls are permitted should increase from four currently to as many as 16. In my view this goes too far. An increase of this proportion would be inconsistent with the precautionary approach that the Government have taken to gambling regulation.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="08062582000033"></a>Nevertheless I am persuaded that the situation facing the bingo industry is sufficiently grave, and the circumstances surrounding bingo sufficiently distinct, to justify considering whether a smaller increase might be appropriate without jeopardising our principal priority, which remains to protect the public.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="08062582000034"></a>For this reason, I have decided to consult on a proposal to increase to eight the number of category B3 machines which bingo clubs may offer. This enhanced entitlement will only apply to bingo halls which operate a strict over 18s entry policy. If in the light of public consultation we decide to proceed, we will bring forward the necessary order. This will be for Parliament to approve by means of an affirmative resolution.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="08062582000035"></a>I have also been struck by the representations I have received from honourable Members on all sides in support of seaside arcades. Family entertainment centres, which are not permitted to offer high-stake, high-prize category B gaming machines, form an integral part of many families&#146; seaside holidays or day trips. I want to see that continue.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="08062582000036"></a>The Government have already taken steps to help seaside arcades. In October 2006, in response to requests for assistance from the industry and a year earlier than planned, we increased the stake and prize levels for category C gaming machines to 50p and &#163;35 respectively. These changes benefited not only seaside arcades, but also pubs, bingo clubs and AGCs, as well as gaming machine manufacturers and suppliers.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="08062582000037"></a>To give the industry certainty and to enable it to plan properly, we made a commitment to review stakes and prizes again in 2009. However, in view of the difficult trading conditions which many operators are now reporting, I have decided on an exceptional basis to bring forward the planned review by one year for the lowest categories of gaming machine&#151;categories C and D. Category D machines include 10p stake and &#163;5 prize fruit machines, as well as traditional seaside amusements like penny falls and crane grabs.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="08062582000038"></a>The industry must recognise that this is a one off. I am mindful of the risk that, coming so soon after the 2006 changes, an early review could perpetuate a view in some sections of the industry that ever increasing stake and prize levels are the only answer to the pressures it faces. This may lead to tensions in terms of the licensing objectives and act as a disincentive to the industry to explore other ways to freshen its appeal. At the same time, I understand the need for certainty among manufacturers and operators alike on the date of future reviews.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="08062582000039"></a>In addition, I am therefore announcing today that I have decided to reinstitute the system of triennial reviews that grew up by custom and practice under the previous legislation. This will mean that, after the 2009 review, part of which I am bringing forward to this year, the next review will take place in 2012.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="08062582000040"></a>In view of the priority which the industry attaches to an early review, I am adopting a fast track process. We are writing today to trade bodies, faith groups and others with an interest in problem gambling, to invite submissions on what stake and prize levels should apply for machines in categories C and D during the period until 2012.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="08062582000041"></a>Having carefully considered these submissions, I will formulate proposals and, prior to formal consultation, seek advice from the Gambling Commission on whether any of these proposals raise concerns in terms of the licensing objectives. There will then be a formal three-month consultation before any legislation is brought forward. Any changes will be for Parliament to approve, again by means of an affirmative resolution. I intend to complete the consultation with a view to returning to Parliament with any necessary order in the autumn.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="08062582000042"></a>There is no guarantee that this review process will result in increases. It will be for the industry to make that case, and for wider stakeholders to state their views.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="08062582000043"></a>I have considered carefully whether the evidence that has been presented would justify extending this early review to high-stake, high-prize gaming machines in categories B1, B2, B3, B3A and B4. In particular, I have carefully considered BACTA&#146;s call for an immediate doubling in the maximum stake on category B3 machines, found in AGCs and bingo halls, from &#163;1 to &#163;2.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="08062582000044"></a>A key element of BACTA&#146;s case is that customers have found the category B3 machine with its &#163;1 stake and &#163;500 prize unattractive, and that this has led in turn to customers migrating from AGCs to play category B2 machines, commonly known as fixed odds betting terminals, in betting shops. Little in the way of convincing evidence has been submitted to substantiate this claimed migration.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="08062582000045"></a>I have consistently made it clear that I view the growing popularity of category B2 machines and other high-stake, high-prize gaming machines with concern. That is why in March I asked the Gambling Commission to prioritise research in this area. The aim is to explore the available research which assesses whether there is any evidence:</p>
of causal links between the availability of high-stake, high-prize gaming machines and the development of problem gambling;regarding the attraction of these machines to existing problem gamblers; andthat existing gambling problems are exacerbated by access to these machines. 
<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="08062582000046"></a>Work is already under way and, by the end of July 2008, the commission will recommend what, if any, further research is needed. The commission expects to publish the findings from any further work in June 2009.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="08062582000047"></a>If evidence emerges that category B2 machines are a particular problem, I will not hesitate to use the extensive powers under the Act to regulate them more stringently. In the mean time, I have concluded that it would not be appropriate to review stake and prize levels for category B machines, or to agree to BACTA&#146;s specific proposal, before the commission&#146;s work is complete and Ministers and Parliament can consider any new findings which emerge. The Government have  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS106"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column WS106</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>committed to review stake and prize levels on all categories of machine in 2009, and we will make good on this commitment in respect of category B machines once the commission has reported.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="08062582000048"></a>I have also considered carefully a proposal by BACTA that adult gaming centres&#151;arcades restricted to over 18s found on many high streets&#151;should be permitted to make available category B3 machines on a ratio of 20 per cent to the total number of gaming machines provided, in place of the current limit of four machines per premises.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="08062582000049"></a>I have, however, concluded that this proposal would not provide sufficient certainty about the total number of B3 machines in individual AGC premises or across the AGC estate as a whole. It could create the potential for larger machine sheds with significant concentrations of high-stake, high-prize gaming machines in easily accessible high street locations. I am concerned that this could have an adverse impact in terms of the licensing objectives.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="08062582000050"></a>I have also considered whether AGCs should benefit from the increased machine entitlement I am proposing for bingo clubs. However, I am not persuaded on the basis of the evidence presented to me that the same exceptional and special circumstances apply. For instance, no evidence has been presented of closures on the scale of those experienced in the bingo industry. In AGCs, gaming machine play is not an ancillary activity, nor is there any clear evidence of unmet demand for such machines.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="08062582000051"></a>While I understand that this will come as a disappointment to AGCs, they will of course benefit from any increases to stake and prize levels of category C machines, which form the bulk of their machine offer.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="08062582000053"></a>This year sees the biggest changes to Britain&#146;s immigration and border security system for 45 years. Our policy will deliver strong borders, a selective migration system and an expectation that newcomers earn the right to stay. Our ambition is that migration policy maximises benefits for Britain and manages local impacts.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="08062582000054"></a>This strategy underpins our Australian-style points system and reforms to spouse visas, and requires us to modernise visit visas. I am therefore setting out today a strategy for comprehensively overhauling our visit visa system. Copies are being placed in the Library of the House and include our formal response to our consultation on visitor visas published in December 2007. The full analysis of responses to the consultation can be found on the UK Border Agency website.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="08062582000055"></a>In modernising our visit visa system, our ambition is twofold: to let legitimate visitors connect with the UK quickly and to strengthen still further our border security. Significant changes lie at the heart of today&#146;s strategy:</p>




<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS107"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column WS107</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we will create a separate category for business and special visitors to make clear the activities that are permitted while in the UK. We will bring the current concessions for entertainers and sportspeople within the Immigration Rules as special visitors;we will introduce visas for sponsored family visits. Proposals for simplifying the system for family visitors received wide support. I propose, therefore, to bring forward important changes. Individuals who wish to sponsor family members will need to be licensed by the UKBA. Only British citizens or permanent residents will be able to apply. Sponsors, after being thoroughly vetted, must agree to comply with their duties. We will introduce a range of sanctions for sponsors who do not ensure that their family return home, ranging from a ban on future sponsorship, a civil penalty of up to &#163;5,000 and a possible jail term of up to 14 years; andwe will preserve streamlined appeals for family visit visas.
<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="08062582000056"></a>There are two policy areas to which I propose no change following the consultation responses:</p>
 overseas domestic workers (ODWs). We are proud of the protection we afford overseas domestic workers. The current ODW visa will be preserved and then reviewed as appropriate after the first two years&#146; operation of the reformed immigration system, when we have properly road-tested our anti-trafficking strategy; and allowing up to six months for tourist visas. In our consultation document we asked whether we should reduce the maximum length of leave for tourists travelling to the UK from six months to three months. The majority of respondents did not agree with this proposal, and we have agreed to retain the maximum length of leave at six months, although the UK Border Agency will have discretion to grant less than the maximum if it judges appropriate. 
<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="08062582000057"></a>We know that many have a stake in our getting today&#146;s policy right. For this reason we coupled a formal consultation with meetings with parliamentarians, with community meetings with the UK&#146;s ethnic minority community and, for the first time, consultation in India, our largest visa market, supported by a cross-party delegation of community leaders and business people. Six hundred and four additional responses were received regarding the consultation.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="08062582000058"></a>I am grateful to everyone who contributed. I will now bring forward changes to both legislation and the immigration rules to give effect to today&#146;s announcement. Because of the significance of the changes proposed, I will publish detailed statements of intent in advance of introducing change, together with detailed impact assessments.</p>

<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS108"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column WS108</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a><a name="08062582000060"></a>I am announcing today the commencement of a feasibility and scoping study into the operation of no-win, no-fee arrangements in England and Wales.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="08062582000061"></a>We are aware of growing concerns that no-win, no-fee arrangements may not always operate in the interests of access to justice. This includes a perception that consumer interests are not always best served; allegations over the possible misuse of no-win, no-fee agreements and a potential adverse impact on the administration of justice. We feel that now is the appropriate time for a comprehensive, objective and evidence-based examination of the operation of no-win, no-fee arrangements in relation to personal injury, employment and defamation/privacy cases. This work forms an important part of one of the department&#146;s key objectives: to deliver fair and simple routes to justice, including identifying any gaps in access to justice in the above areas.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a><a name="08062582000062"></a>We recognise that the issues at hand are complex and varied and their consideration could potentially be a large-scale exercise. Therefore as a preliminary step, the department has asked Professors Richard Moorhead (Director of Research, Cardiff Law School), Paul Fenn (Nottingham University Business School) and Neil Rickman (Head of Economics, University of Surrey and RAND Europe) to conduct a research-based review of how conditional fee arrangements operate in personal injury, employment and defamation/privacy cases. Today I am announcing the commencement of the scoping work, the purpose of which is to highlight the key issues and identify areas that would benefit from further work.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a><a name="08062582000063"></a>The study will consider how best to:</p>
 identify representative samples of claims data in personal injury, employment and defamation/privacy cases; examine the nature of funding arrangements in these cases and the outcome; identify random samples of clients and legal advisers that may help provide more detailed data about the understanding of quality and change within the legal services sector; and analyse the unmet legal needs in the areas of personal injury, employment and defamation/privacy.  
<a name="80625-wms0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a><a name="08062582000064"></a>Professors Moorhead, Fenn and Rickman are expected to report to Ministers in the autumn. The report will help determine what specific aspects ought to be pursued in more detail and the feasibility of doing so.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a><a name="08062582000067"></a>Sir Edmund has reported, and I have placed a copy of his report in the Library of the House and published it on the department&#146;s website at: <a href="http://www.mod.uk">www.mod.uk</a>. I am very grateful for the effort that Sir Edmund and his team have put into this review.  The report is in two parts, with an executive summary. Part one sets out the events leading up to the loss of data on 9 January 2008, covering the relevant issues surrounding the training administration and financial management information system (TAFMIS) and the attendant policies and procedures. Part two considers the broader MoD approach to personal data protection, drawing on the emerging findings of the Cabinet Office review of data handling procedure in government, whose final report is also being published today. Further detail and a summary of Sir Edmund&#146;s 51 recommendations are given in the annexes to the report. These have been published in full, although the names of those consulted have been redacted.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a><a name="08062582000068"></a>I accept all 51 of Sir Edmund&#146;s recommendations, and am determined that we should learn the wider lessons to be drawn from this incident.  At the direction of the Defence Board, an action plan has been prepared to implement the recommendations, and this is being published today also.  The senior management of the MoD, in the form of the Defence Board, accepts that it has ultimate responsibility for the effectiveness of the department&#146;s information management and assurance, and will supervise the implementation of the action plan.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a><a name="08062582000069"></a>The action plan has been shown to Sir Edmund, who has indicated that it has his support and is in his view capable of delivering the improvements in practice which his report concludes are necessary.  Sir Edmund&#146;s report, and the action plan including the immediate steps we have taken to bring the TAFMIS system into compliance with the Data Protection Act have also been shared with the Information Commissioner; we will keep his office apprised of progress.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a><a name="08062582000070"></a>On the TAFMIS recruitment system, Sir Edmund&#146;s report has set out, to the extent that he has been able to establish the facts, the sequence of events that led to the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force version of the system being unencrypted.  This confirms that efforts were made to encrypt the system through an encryption upgrade, and that this was successful for most of the system. However, in August 2006 the encryption on the 55 TAFMIS laptops containing the Royal Navy/Royal Air Force recruit database was reported not to be working as expected. Despite examining all the available papers and interviewing relevant personnel from the Army Recruiting and Training Division (ARTD), which manages the contract for the system on behalf of all three armed services, and the system provider, EDS, Sir Edmund has been unable to find an explanation of why encryption of these 55 was not pursued by another means, and those using the system came to believe that  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS110"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column WS110</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it was encrypted when it was not.  His main conclusions are that aspects of the TAFMIS project were poorly managed both by the ARTD&#146;s internal project manager and EDS; that for periods in 2006 and 2007 the laptops in question were being used in breach of MoD laptop encryption security policy; and that in certain key respects, detailed in the report, the TAFMIS system is still in breach of data protection regulations.  His findings have confirmed my own suspicion that there was no robust business reason for so much personal data to be carried around by recruiting officers on their laptops.  Action is already in hand to remedy this position.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a><a name="08062582000071"></a>After studying the report, the Chief of the General Staff has ordered an inquiry to investigate whether there are grounds to pursue either disciplinary or administrative action in respect of the management of the contract between the Army and EDS. </p>

<a name="80625-wms0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_56"></a><a name="08062582000072"></a>On the more general aspects of his review, Sir Edmund finds that departmental policies and procedures generally are fit for purpose and he gives some examples of good practice by the department&#151;the role of the MoD&#146;s senior information risk owner; the emergency measures introduced after the loss which have been effective in preventing similar damaging losses; the network of data protection officers; and the good security data protection and information risk management procedures of the organisations within the department for which handling of large volumes of personal data is core business&#151;but he is highly critical of the department&#146;s general treatment in practice of information, knowledge and data as key operational and business assets, and of low levels of awareness of the threats to information and of the requirements of data protection legislation.  Therefore, his recommendations focus on training and steps to raise awareness and compliance, and to raise the profile of the issue within our various management boards.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_57"></a><a name="08062582000073"></a>Sir Edmund&#146;s investigation and other internal inquiries have established more of the facts than were available when I made my Statement to the House on 21 January. Of the 600,000 recruits or potential recruits who were in the TAFMIS data base, about 1,000 dated back to 1977. In a substantial proportion of cases, the records included more limited information about next of kin and contact details for referees.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"></a><a name="08062582000074"></a>We have also established that, in addition to the three stolen TAFMIS laptop computers referred to in the Statement, a further two laptops similar to those stolen in January 2008 and October 2006 were stolen from cars: a Royal Navy laptop in Bristol in August 2004 and a Royal Air Force laptop in Leeds in July 2006.  In both cases the laptops were believed at the time to have been encrypted, and Ministers were not informed of the losses. The personal data held on these laptops was a subset of that held on the laptop stolen on 9 January 2008 and so does not affect anyone not already affected by that incident. </p>

<a name="80625-wms0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_59"></a><a name="08062582000075"></a>Following the theft of the laptop on 9 January, the department conducted a full internal investigation into the details of computer and other electronic storage media lost or stolen since 2003 when mandatory reporting of such incidents was introduced. This investigation has now been completed and the collated  


<notus-date day="25" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS111"></a><b>25 Jun 2008 : Column WS111</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>data was provided to Sir Edmund Burton as part of his review. He has summarised key elements of the data in his report.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_60"></a><a name="08062582000076"></a>Prior to 2003 the reporting of lost and stolen laptops was not centrally collated and it has been found that the figures for the period 1995 to 2002 may be incomplete and therefore unreliable. As the details of incidents for this period are no longer available it is not possible to provide updated figures.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_61"></a><a name="08062582000077"></a>In conclusion, I reiterate my deep regret over both the losses of personal data and the systemic weaknesses within parts of the MoD that led to this situation.  As the Cabinet Office report also published today highlights, these reflect challenges faced by all parts of government but that does not make them any more acceptable.  Both I and senior MoD management are determined to act quickly and decisively on Sir Edmund&#146;s recommendations and bring about an early significant improvement in practice within the department in this important area.</p>

However, the deteriorating situation around the failed and illegitimate elections in Zimbabwe and the imminence of the International Cricket Council&#146;s (ICC&#146;s) annual conference in Dubai mean that the point of decision on this matter has now been reached. We have been in close discussions with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) throughout recent months.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_66"></a><a name="08062582000085"></a>The Zimbabwean Government have ceased to observe the principle of the rule of law: they have terrorised their own citizens, including the ruthless and violent suppression of legitimate political opposition.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_67"></a><a name="08062582000086"></a>The UK Government will always work with the international community to uphold fundamental freedoms and human rights. Accordingly, they have responded with a measured approach which seeks to isolate Zimbabwe internationally and bring pressure to bear on supranational institutions such as the United Nations and the European Union to take yet firmer action against the despotic regime, whilst ensuring that their humanitarian life-saving mission to Zimbabwean citizens continues.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_68"></a><a name="08062582000087"></a>The Government are clear that direct intervention on a sporting matter should not be taken lightly, and our position has been to intervene in this matter only as a last resort.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_69"></a><a name="08062582000088"></a>The Government have previously called on the ICC to reconsider its rules to allow teams to forfeit tours to countries, such as Zimbabwe, where serious human rights abuses are occurring. Unfortunately the ICC has declined to do so. However, with the ICC conference due to take place in Dubai next week, the Government now have to make their position clear.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_70"></a><a name="08062582000089"></a>The Government strongly defend the autonomy of sports governing bodies. We also support the autonomous management of international sporting competitions by international sports federations and independent representation of British sporting interests on such federations by our national governing bodies. The serious human rights abuses occurring in Zimbabwe and the close ties of the Zimbabwe cricket team to the Mugabe regime present exceptional circumstances that justify exceptional measures. It would never be our wish to penalise domestic supporters, and nor would we wish to place players particularly in the uncomfortable position of having to take difficult individual judgments on these matters.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_71"></a><a name="08062582000090"></a>Therefore, it is with regret that Her Majesty&#146;s Government have decided to make clear that they are prepared to prevent the bilateral tour in 2009 and will take all necessary steps to prevent players from Zimbabwe from participating in that tour.</p>

<a name="80625-wms0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_72"></a><a name="08062582000091"></a>I have today written to Giles Clarke, the chairman of the ECB, instructing the ECB not to hold the bilateral tour with Zimbabwe. The Government welcome reports that the issue of Zimbabwe&#146;s involvement in world cricket is on the agenda at the ICC annual conference next week in Dubai. We hope that this letter will help the ECB to play a full part in these discussions, and lead to a positive outcome, particularly in relation to the important event, ICC&#146;s world twenty20 tournament, due to be staged in England in 2009. A copy of this letter is attached to this Statement.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_80"></a><a name="08062582000099"></a>The UK Government consider that it would be contrary to this general approach for the English cricket team to participate in bilateral fixtures with Zimbabwe.

With compulsory participation, our modelling suggests that, nationally, this does not require a big expansion of places. Our current estimates indicate that there will be around 15,000 more 16 and 17 year-olds in schools in 2015 than there are this year and all of this growth is accounted for by the already planned growth in academies, most of which will have sixth forms. Of course, it does not follow that all new demand will go into academies, rather we will need to make sure that every young person has a suitable place in learning and the balance of provision across the system will cater for that. In FE, we estimate that in 2013 13,000 additional places will be needed compared to this year, and in 2015 another 31,000 will be needed. Demographic changes will vary between local areas and local authorities will need to use their own projections to plan accordingly. We do not have modelling on additional places by kind of qualification. However the Government have committed by 2013 to providing young people with an entitlement to a diploma place, and an entitlement to an apprenticeship place for those who meet the entry requirements.</p>

However, voluntary returns are always the preferred option; removal action is only ever considered as a last resort. Victims of trafficking are routinely encouraged to make use of the assisted voluntary return (AVR) programme available to them.</p>

<a name="80625w0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_80"></a><a name="08062581000158"></a>The IOM's network of offices work in co-operation with local non-government organisations and generally provide specialist reintegration assistance for victims of trafficking where necessary. The assistance may include shelter, medical assistance/psychological counselling and vocational training. IOM monitor the provision of such services themselves. However, the availability of such services in a given country depends on what sort of provision the Government of that country have agreed can be made available.</p>
