<a name="60120-11_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Broers: </b>   My Lords, I thank noble Lords who made such excellent contributions to the debate, bringing to it the extraordinary breadth of expertise for which this House is broadly recognised. I also compliment my fellow committee members, many of whom brought much more directly relevant experience to our deliberations than I was able to offer. I thank the Minister for his full response. Inevitably, as he said, because the report contains so many recommendations, and he has had so little time in which to speak, he has not been able today to respond to all the issues that we have identified, but we look forward to the Government&#039;s comprehensive response in the near future.
</p>

<a name="60120-11_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>I assure noble Lords, especially the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, and the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, that the Science and Technology Committee will maintain a continuing watching brief on this issue. Indeed, I hope that everyone who carries responsibility for all aspects of the security and health of this nation will maintain such a brief.

<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="60120-11_spopq0"></a><b> Baroness Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde </b>  rose to ask Her Majesty&#039;s Government what emphasis they place on transport infrastructure in the economic development and social cohesion of the south-west counties of England.
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord Berkeley for joining this debate. It would, indeed, be a lonely furrow without him. I declare an interest as chairman of the South-west Advisory Committee to the Regional Development Agency, the South-west Assembly and the Government Office on the Way Ahead project in the south-west, which came out of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s sustainable communities programme.
</p>

<a name="60120-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>The south-west is a diverse region with disparities the greatest of any English region. It is the largest of the regions, accounting for 15 per cent of the land mass. It has a huge coastline but also, in places, peripherality which impacts on its economic performance. The south-west&#039;s population, now at 5 million, has grown faster than the UK average. But the south-west is unique in having a low birth rate, but the fastest rate of immigration. People like coming to live and work in the south-west.
</p>

<a name="60120-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>Transport is important in any region but in the south-west it is more important than in most. Although this debate is about transport, the core of it is the strategic influence which transport plays on the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_929"></a>

<b>20 Jan 2006 : Column 929</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

economic development of the region. There is much to do. I say this because although the south-west is set to be a big growth area, it will be hindered if we do not improve public transport. Certainly, it lags behind all other regions in that regard. This has an impact on productivity. It is not the only inhibitor but it is a key one. This was identified by recent research carried out by West of England and Bath universities. That showed that the productivity gap is caused by a combination of factors, including the long and variable time distances from key economic markets. Ask any inward investor what they are looking for when deciding a location for their investment and always one of the top three requirements is accessibility.
</p>

<a name="60120-11_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>Currently, private car ownership in the south-west is higher than the UK average. We need investment in roads, the A30/A303 corridor as well as the A358 link road. But just as important are our rail links, as the recent possible withdrawal of the London to Penzance sleeper demonstrated. But rail services to the south-west generally are critical too. For instance, to travel from Bristol in the north-east of the region to Penzance in the west takes a third as long again by road as to travel from Bristol to London. By train, it can take as much as four times longer. First Group now has the franchise. It is an enormous company providing bus services too.
</p>

<a name="60120-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>That monopoly, together with the alarming news on the front of the <i>Times</i> today about fare increases, if true, is very worrying indeed and could be very damaging to the economy of the south-west. What can the Minister tell us and what assurances can he give on the future of the sleeper, which is by no means completely clear, and on rail provision in the south-west generally?
</p>

<a name="60120-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>The region&#039;s airports are a key element of the transport infrastructure for access to both domestic and international markets. Bristol Airport has become one of the top 10 airports in the UK, with an 18 per cent increase in passenger volume. Now it has direct access to Brussels, Paris, Madrid, Rome and, since last year, New York. Those people do not have to come into London to fly out of the UK. Exeter has seen the largest increase, with 62 per cent. Plymouth, which is critical to many of us, wants to see its airport continue to grow as part of the economic development of the region. That leaves the future of Newquay, which is close to my heart, and the question of whether the RAF at St Mawgan is there to stay. If the RAF is to go, investment in that airport through the agencies, such as the Regional Development Agency, and the local authority will be essential. It is a crucial link for Cornwall&#039;s economy, and decisions must be taken. What is the Government&#039;s policy on that, if they have one?
</p>

<a name="60120-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>We have a huge coastline, and ports could be a key contributor to the region. Over 20 million tonnes of freight a year is moved by sea in the south-west, over <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_930"></a>

<b>20 Jan 2006 : Column 930</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

half of that through the thriving port of Bristol, but more could be done. In Cornwall the potential for a real increase in the local economy from cruise ships, which is a major expanding area of tourism, is essential. A way must be found to provide the &#163;10 million that Falmouth needs for dredging to allow the huge ships that are now being built for cruise tourism to come into the dock in the port rather than anchor off in the bay. For every cruise ship passenger coming ashore, some &#163;71 goes into the local economy. Many other European international coastal cities have recognised that already, with investment in their dock facilities. We need it in Falmouth. I know that the Falmouth harbour commissioners are talking with local companies and with the Regional Development Agency, but a decision and action are needed soon, otherwise&#151;to risk a pun&#151;we will miss the boat.
</p>

<a name="60120-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>Two issues not directly located in the south-west could have a profound detrimental impact on the south-west economy. The first is the building of Crossrail. I support that development; however we in the south-west are not convinced that there has been sufficient consultation about the impact of the process of the building of Crossrail on those services that use Paddington. The build years could be severely damaging to the south-west region if transport flow is interrupted or slowed up. Can the Minister give us assurances on that? Secondly, there is the dreadful travel challenge that awaits any potential tourist or visitor to the more western parts of the region who arrives into Heathrow. The only way for them to get on the rail link to the south-west is either to go to London and do a double journey or get the bus to Reading, which risks disruption and you could miss a train, as I have found out. Either way, it is discouraging to the visitor and not good for the environment. There should be&#151;there must be&#151;a direct rail link from Heathrow into the west country rail lines. Again, will the Minister give us information or assurances on this?
</p>

<a name="60120-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>Although this debate is about transport, the real issue is the economy and the social cohesion of the south-west. A good example is the proposals for major new and desperately needed housing and employment developments already planned in Exeter, Plymouth, Bournemouth and Poole. They rest entirely on provision of a new transport infrastructure, without which those developments will not go ahead. Given the opportunity, the south-west has proved in so many areas that it can deliver and that the various agencies work well together. A shining example of that is the Objective 1 initiative in Cornwall. Ministers and the EU, in backing Objective 1, deserve full credit for the confidence that they put in Cornwall&#039;s ability to deliver.
</p>

<a name="60120-11_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>I am not ashamed to say that the Labour Government have been good, very good, for Cornwall. But Cornwall, too, has delivered. I can say with confidence that the success of Objective 1 is probably one of the best examples of the initiative anywhere in Europe. The whole project is marked with success on delivery, on budget delivery, design and innovation.

</p>

<a name="60120-11_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>The key measure for me is that now, instead of 3,000 of our young people leaving the county annually for higher education, not to return in many cases, many of them now stay for higher education, and many young students are actually coming into Cornwall for their education. The reasons for that are a cocktail&#151;for that is how I see it, something to make you feel good and exhilarated&#151;of the education provided by the Combined Universities in Cornwall through University College Falmouth and the wonderful environment in which they learn and live. Growth, development and a sustainable community can thrive together&#151;Cornwall has shown it&#151;if it is done properly.
</p>

<a name="60120-11_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>We have every reason to be proud of the achievements of the south-west, but we need the right transport infrastructure to continue that success.

<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="60120-12_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   My Lords, I congratulate my noble friend on this debate because she has raised an important subject. She pointed out that Cornwall is a long way from everywhere else in geographical terms, which we all know. I often compare what happens in Cornwall, and to a small extent in Devon, with the north of Scotland, where there is a devolved administration. Given the funding and the processes that Scotland now undergoes in providing investment to the islands and the north of Scotland, one occasionally wishes for similar processes in Cornwall.
</p>

<a name="60120-12_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>My noble friend described fully the current economy; and cruise ships are important to it. She omitted to say that the port of Fowey on the south coast is also a destination for the smaller cruise ships. It is suffering, along with other nearby ports, from a reduction in the china clay industry. Following the demise of tin mining, the china clay industry has been one of the major employers in Cornwall and is now facing competition from, I think, a mine in Brazil. I do not think that anyone believes that the volumes produced will increase, which means that jobs will be lost again. Certainly, fewer ships are coming into the harbours of Fowey and Par, which is worrying, because Cornwall will depend even more on the wider tourism industry. Tourism is good, people want to go to live, work and sail there&#151;and the people who sail probably spend as much money as those who go on cruise ships.
</p>

<a name="60120-12_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>Even so, if you are going to rely on tourism a few issues emerge because, for a start, tourists need good transport links, because they compare getting there to getting to wherever they might go as an alternative. When one appraises transport investment and links, one must recognise that tourism is a seasonal occupation and it is no good trying to work out the finances of a railway, a bus service or roads on the basis of 52 weeks a year, because it does not work like that. You would be lucky to get two months of tourism, with a shoulder on either side. So the way that new projects are appraised needs to be looked at.
</p>

<a name="60120-12_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>On Monday we debated railways and I raised the problem of a high-speed line to Scotland that might cost &#163;30 billion. I think that Cornwall could do with <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_932"></a>

<b>20 Jan 2006 : Column 932</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

&#163;300 million. Hundreds would go a long way and would probably bring as much benefit as a high-speed line somewhere else.
</p>

<a name="60120-12_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>My noble friend mentioned some of the transport links and referred to the importance of Newquay and Plymouth airports. At the moment, the problem is that the services to those airports are very unreliable. I have a friend who tried to fly to Newquay last summer and ended up being dumped at Plymouth Airport at about 10 o&#039;clock at night. She asked whether she was going to get to her destination but was more or less told, &quot;That&#039;s your problem&quot;. They locked the airport and that was it. Such incidents do not really encourage you to fly.
</p>

<a name="60120-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>The roads are getting better but could do with a lot of improvement. As my noble friend said, half the problem of the high level of car ownership stems from the fact that there is a pretty awful bus service around Cornwall. Last year, I had the misfortune to try to take the bus around the southern part of Cornwall. I thought that I would go to the Eden Project&#151;you get in more cheaply if you go by public transport. It is too dangerous to walk up the road and so you take the bus. Of course, the bus did not come. We waited for an hour for the next one in the freezing cold and got there eventually. After we had been to the Eden Project, we tried to come back but&#151;hey presto&#151;again the bus did not come.
</p>

<a name="60120-12_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>I happen to know the chairman of the bus company involved, so I wrote to him saying, &quot;Is this the normal way you run buses? Considering you get an enormous subsidy every year from Cornwall County Council to run buses, why didn&#039;t you run this one? Why did we have to wait an hour?&quot; He said, &quot;The driver did not show up&quot;. I am not sure that that is an adequate excuse when you are getting a large amount of funding from the county council. It is possible to have a spare driver on call. Therefore, people go by car because the buses are unreliable.
</p>

<a name="60120-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>I think that the trains are more reliable because it is possible to make more fuss if the train is late&#151;you can even complain to Ministers as they are responsible for the timetable these days. As my noble friend said, the passenger services leave a bit to be desired. Prices are shooting up and, when you are travelling such a long distance, that affects people severely. The railway operators often find it difficult to cope with fluctuations in demand, although Virgin has done well over the past few summers in making the trains from the Midlands longer at weekends.
</p>

<a name="60120-12_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>What really worried me in the last round of passenger franchise bidding, which concluded before Christmas, was that the government specification suggested that the branch-line services could be cut significantly. I do not think that they have been, but the fact that the Government were planning to cut half the trains from the Looe branch and some from the Falmouth branch&#151;I cannot remember which&#151;indicated the thinking, if you can call it that, which goes into such arrangements. If there is only a branch-line service every two or three hours, even in summer, the tourists will say, &quot;Oh hell, I&#039;m not going to do that; <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_933"></a>

<b>20 Jan 2006 : Column 933</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I&#039;m going to take my car&quot;, which is exactly what one does not want in the tourist season in Cornwall&#151;or at any other time, come to that.
</p>

<a name="60120-12_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>My noble friend mentioned the sleeper, and she is absolutely right. I do not know whether there was a victory there&#151;I hope that there was. It is incredible that it is still not possible to book a berth on the sleeper via the website. It is run by the same company that runs the sleeper in Scotland, and it has been possible to book a berth on the sleeper to Scotland for quite a few years. It is rather cheaper going to Cornwall on the sleeper, if you can find a way of booking, which involves phoning the company and so on. I wonder how much some of these companies want people to use the service. If it is not advertised, it is not going to be used.
</p>

<a name="60120-12_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>In conclusion, perhaps I may say a word or two about rail freight&#151;I am chairman of the Rail Freight Group. The level of rail freight to Cornwall should be good because it is a long way from everywhere else, which usually helps rail freight, and it would also remove quite a few lorries from the road. China clay goes by rail freight, but the amount is reducing. A small amount of aggregates and cement go by rail freight, as I think does glass.
</p>

<a name="60120-12_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>At the moment secondary aggregates do not go by rail; they could go by sea or by rail. They are used for the sub-basis of roads or buildings and it has become viable to use them because of the aggregates tax. Many people do not like the aggregates tax, but it makes people use second-hand aggregates, which include those lovely china clay tips in Cornwall and slate in north Wales. That is a very good idea, but the amount is not quite high enough. What about milk and agricultural products?
</p>

<a name="60120-12_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>The problem, in relation to passengers and freight on the railways, is that quite often Network Rail closes the line for maintenance work. There is no diversionary route, as my noble friend said. There could be one via Okehampton, but it would cost some money to reinstate. In the mean time, we have to try to persuade Network Rail to do what they do in every other continental country, which is to maintain one track while the trains go by on the other one. It is called single-line working and trains do not go in two directions at the same time as that would be unsafe. It is possible to do that, but it does not seem to happen in this country. Beyond Exeter, where there is only one line, they should make some effort to come up with a safe procedure for maintaining one track and letting trains go by quite slowly on the other. Then we could have 24-hour, seven-day a week, access to the south west.
</p>

<a name="60120-12_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>Rail freight cannot go by bus, but they put passengers in buses and they really hate it; we all hate doing that with luggage. An enormous amount could be done. Little things like that would make a great deal of difference to passengers&#039; perception. The public at large feel, &quot;Yes, Cornwall is a good place to go; I can get there easily; I can get there quickly and I hope I can get there with not too much cost&quot;. Perhaps the key is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_934"></a>

to see what happens in Scotland and whether some of the Scottish Executive&#039;s policies could not be copied in the south-west.

<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="60120-12_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Tyler: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, and congratulate her on initiating this very important debate, particularly for those of us who have close connections with the great county of Cornwall. I recognise that the experience of the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, fully justifies endorsement of his passport. I hope he will not have quite so much difficulty when he next visits us. If he needs endorsement from a resident next time he comes to Cornwall, I shall be only too pleased to offer it.
</p>

<a name="60120-12_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a> Rail travel is a crucial issue, as both noble Lords who have already spoken have said. Travel by rail in the region is increasing by 5 to 10 per cent each year. I think that may escalate, particularly as we have the fastest growing population in the whole country and there is a direct read across from that into rail passenger demand.
</p>

<a name="60120-12_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>The Greater Western franchise award to the First Group, which has been referred to, recognises both the need for more effective integration of transport services and service improvements, but the original estimates of demand were obviously too low. There will be a temptation to manage excessive demand for train travel by deliberately pricing passengers off the rails, which surely should not be something that we should encourage, rather than finding the necessary investment to create additional capacity. In the debate on 16 January, to which reference has been made, the Minister, in reply to my noble friend Lord Bradshaw, did not seem to be able to give much reassurance on those points, which was disappointing.
</p>

<a name="60120-12_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a> It is particularly important, as has already been implied, that the main line beyond Bristol and the main line from Reading through Taunton to Exeter and onwards to Plymouth and Penzance receives a fair share of future investment. I also endorse what the noble Baroness said about Crossrail. None of us is against Crossrail, but we are concerned about the dislocation of the whole investment programme and of existing services while that is going through. I recognise the truth of the statement by the South West Assembly, which has just been issued, which says that rail services to the south west,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>&quot;could be stuck in a 40 year timewarp if the latest Government proposals are approved&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60120-12_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>Rail services to our area desperately need room to expand. In the immediate future, as the noble Baroness has said, during the six-year construction period, there could be a major dislocation of services beyond the immediate area of London. I hope that the Government recognise that problem and that in the enabling Bill they will give proper recognition to the effect on capacity outside the capital.
</p>

<a name="60120-12_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>There seems to be a bit of a metropolitan obsession about Crossrail. We recognise that it is going to be very important but, if the implications for other parts of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_935"></a>

<b>20 Jan 2006 : Column 935</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

country are not followed through, there is a real danger. Again, a spokesman for the assembly said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;If we are to make a serious attempt to reduce congestion on our roads, and improve sustainability, the region&#039;s rail services are the place to start, not the place to start making cuts&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60120-12_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>Within the south-west&#151;and I mean the far south-west, the real south-west&#151;there are other problems. There are pinch points. I think that the most serious one is the one to which the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, has just referred, which is the line beyond Starcross through to Teignmouth, which runs alongside the Channel. Everybody knows that it is the most wonderful place in the world to see the sea beside the rail track. Nevertheless, it is at the mercy of the weather and the waves. I believe that with climate change we will have more problems. We are told that there will be a rise in sea levels, and an increasing frequency in severe storms which can simply dislocate the whole of the main line beyond Exeter. In those circumstances, we can anticipate more cancelled services and even perhaps the track becoming structurally unstable, so we must look at other possibilities.
</p>

<a name="60120-12_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>I hope that the Government, with Network Rail, will commission a feasibility study into upgrading the line beyond Okehampton towards Plymouth. The restoration of that line must be a viable possibility. If so, that may be an answer to the problem to which the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, referred.
</p>

<a name="60120-12_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>Cornwall has, as the noble Baroness said, the EU structural funds&#151;assuming they continue under Objective 1&#151;which should be used to improve the branch lines. I have a particular interest in the Par-Newquay branch line, but I recognise that the Truro-Falmouth branch line is important, not least of course because the campus for the combined universities in Cornwall is so near to it. We all know that students are good users of passenger services on the rail network, so they must be provided for.
</p>

<a name="60120-12_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>I have deliberately left roads to second place because I think that the railway issues are so important. There have been, over the years&#151;again as the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, said&#151;some disastrous on/off decisions about investment in the main spine roads of the south-west, notably from the cuts in the early 1990s. I am especially delighted that the notorious black spot&#151;the bottleneck on the A30, which I am sure that the noble Baroness knows very well, between Innis Downs to Indian Queens across the notorious Goss Moor&#151;has at last been tackled. I was delighted to be involved in the public inquiry. As a former Member of Parliament for that precise area, I know how important this is, not just in economic terms or for Cornwall&#039;s tourism, but for the communities around that area which have suffered from blight from all the traffic&#151;heavy lorries in many cases that have been forced to take other routes through sensitive areas. Goss Moor is a SSSI. It is extremely important that the new alignment for the dual carriageway takes traffic away from that area. It is the worst bottleneck between Glasgow and Land&#039;s End, and the sooner it goes, the better. Change is on its way, and I am delighted at that.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="60120-12_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>I am also delighted that we are making progress elsewhere in the region. I will not speak with personal experience of the dilemma on the Somerset/Devon border with the A30, where clearly there is a limited capacity. I know that local authorities are having some difficulty in deciding how precisely to deal with that. However, my party colleagues in the county halls of the south-west are tackling some very difficult problems in an imaginative and realistic way. Putting the emphasis in the road programme on those spine roads to make them fit-for-purpose, rather than simply spreading the money everywhere, is probably the right solution. Sometimes of course that can be counterproductive.

<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>I believe that there are a small number of schemes to remove dangerous stretches on, for example, the A39 &quot;Atlantic Highway&quot; in north Devon and north Cornwall. That would be a real help to the holiday traffic. But the most important issue we have to address is how we can take pressure off the infrastructure. I notice, for example, that the Department for Transport has been particularly enthusiastic in recommending Cornwall&#039;s transport access plan for patients, the so-called TAP, which is taking people off the roads most successfully as well as reducing the time wasted by those travelling to our major hospitals. There is also an interesting transport network scheme operating out of the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital. All of that must be to the benefit of the overall structure.
</p>

<a name="60120-12_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>I shall refer briefly to air travel, with which I have been involved a great deal. I should like to add two points to what has been said. First, business passengers are on the whole not coming to London; they want to go to an interlining airport around London to travel to Europe or beyond. It is therefore extremely important that we retain the landing slots at Gatwick. We used to have them at Heathrow, which was even better. It is particularly important for the far south-west. We do not have an option of surface transport which is in any way comparable to what can be provided by air.
</p>

<a name="60120-12_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>With the medium-term survival of Plymouth airport inevitably in doubt because of its limited landing opportunities, it is extremely important that the Government should today declare precisely what support will be given for the transfer from military to civilian use of Newquay. I hope the Minister will be in a position to do so. It is absolutely critical to the region. It would be extraordinary if the Ministry of Defence was allowed to wash its hands of its responsibility and ignore the responsibilities of the Department for Transport. It would make a complete sham of joined-up government.
</p>

<a name="60120-12_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>I do not have time to go further. I am delighted to have been able to contribute to this debate. I again congratulate the noble Baroness on introducing it.

<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="60120-13_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   My Lords, it is always interesting to have a debate in this House which centres on one specific subject, area or part of the country. We are indebted to the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, for having <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_937"></a>

<b>20 Jan 2006 : Column 937</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

brought this matter to the House. I have listened with great interest to the three previous speakers, all of whom have a great deal more knowledge about the south-west and far south-west than I have. I have great love for the south-west when I visit it but I have never lived there.
</p>

<a name="60120-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>The south-west includes some of the most beautiful parts of England, but for years it has been struggling to enable both visitors and residents to reach it. That has been borne out by the speeches today. We have all heard of the road improvements that have taken place over the years but there are still notorious bottlenecks, as the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, has just demonstrated.
</p>

<a name="60120-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has now put extra pressure on the infrastructure with the Sustainable Communities Plan, and the general expectation is that there will be both housing growth in the south-west&#151;particularly in the farthest reaches of Devon and Cornwall&#151;and the establishment of new businesses. Neither of those will be supportable unless there is considerable investment, particularly in transport. That point has been well made.
</p>

<a name="60120-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>The Halcrow multi-modal study on the London to the south-west and south Wales corridor estimated that use of the rail network will grow by nearly 70 per cent and of roads by 25 per cent. It is clear from representations that in order to achieve this by their estimate of 2016 considerable investment will be necessary not only in the road network in and around the approaches to Devon and Cornwall, but also to that which feeds the airports&#151;Bristol and Newquay, if that develops as expected&#151;and Channel ports.
</p>

<a name="60120-13_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>It is obvious that a monumental amount of work is needed, and not so clear when any of it will start, or by when it will be finished. While the rail franchise for the Great Western route has been agreed&#151;with the promise from First Group, the new operator, that there will be investment in both rolling stock and infrastructure over the 10-year period of the contract&#151;the franchise for South Western has not yet been awarded, and no investment for that area will be seen until the franchise begins in early 2007. I am not aware that we know what the contract developments and offers from the bidding franchise companies will be, anyway.
</p>

<a name="60120-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>The trouble with any investment proposals is that the original figures turn out, even before projects start, to be hopelessly out of date. One only has to look at the rise in costs for the Stonehenge tunnel, which is now back to the drawing board since costs effectively doubled between the time of the public enquiry and the latest estimated outturn. Such a situation is true of practically every major investment scheme, not only in transport, but, for example, in new housing developments or hospitals. In the end, either the project is stopped, or the least best option is adopted. It is the latter possibility that the south-west needs to watch to make sure that it does not come about.
</p>

<a name="60120-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>The questions being raised today regarding the south-west are the tip of an iceberg of questions which are also being asked elsewhere. The Government have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_938"></a>

<b>20 Jan 2006 : Column 938</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

placed enormous emphasis on renewal and development, but are not always able to deliver on their promises. I understand that the south-west region has been given an allocation of just over &#163;1 billion for the next 10 years to fund local authority transport schemes and schemes on the Highways Agency&#039;s trunk roads and motorways. While that sounds a magnificent sum of money, experience tends to suggest that it will be nowhere near sufficient to carry out all that needs to be done if this part of the country is to be opened up for new homes and businesses and for increased tourism. Long gone are the days when part of the fun of going to Devon or Cornwall on holiday was to see how long it could possibly take to get there.
</p>

<a name="60120-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>This short debate, while related to the south-west, demonstrates the problems that are inherent across the country and how frustratingly long it takes to put them right. I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, will receive some comfort from the Minister when he replies. If she does not, she will at least have the satisfaction of knowing that she has provided us with an interesting time today.
<a name="time_16"></a>
<a name="60120-13_time0"></a><h5>2.41 pm</h5>
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="60120-13_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I congratulate my noble friend Lady Dean on introducing this debate, which has been extremely useful. I also congratulate her on her work as chair of the advisory group, which is on the way ahead for identifying the economic and social issues in the south-west region and the enormous amount of work and investment necessary to ensure that the region keeps pace with the rest of the country. There are parts of the south-west that do that with great alacrity. We know of the enormous success and development of Bristol and, in this debate, one aspect of Bristol was mentioned in particular&#151;the success of Bristol airport, which is one of the country&#039;s top 10 airports.
</p>

<a name="60120-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>We also know that for people living in the south-west the emphasis on Bristol is exactly the problem: the part of the south-west that is closest to the rest of the country is the area that has developed very well economically. The further one gets away from Bristol, the more the problems increase until one reaches Cornwall, whose situation is recognised with a European designation as an area of significant underdevelopment and deprivation that needs to be tackled.
</p>

<a name="60120-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>At this Box, we are often accused of not providing answers to questions. The question my noble friend tabled for this debate is:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>&quot;To ask Her Majesty&#039;s Government what emphasis they place on transport infrastructure in the economic development and social cohesion of the South West counties of England&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60120-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>I shall give a straight answer: transport infrastructure is very important. There is no doubt that in many respects transport is the key to the economy of the south-west of England. That is why when anxieties are expressed from the area about its economic development, they tend to focus on the crucial aspect of links with the rest of the country. We recognise that we can develop sustainable economic growth to support a more prosperous and inclusive society only <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_939"></a>

<b>20 Jan 2006 : Column 939</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

if we are able to guarantee the necessary investment in transport. We approach transport from that perspective.
</p>

<a name="60120-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>Transport is clearly a key factor that contributes to sustainable economic growth, but it is not an end in itself. It is merely the way in which we enable people and, crucially for the south-west, goods to travel. That is why I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Berkeley for his participation in the debate, although I was somewhat thrown when he started to complain about a particular local bus service. I emphasise to him that we are concerned, but that the south-west region has benefited from the Government&#039;s commitment to and substantial investment in bus services. He said that he recognised that. Whether that can guarantee the nature of the service that he defined is a matter for the local operator, although I entirely agree with him that it is a misfortune if public transport access to a facility such as the Eden Project, which has given Cornwall such renown in recent years as a major tourist attraction, is not what it should be.
</p>

<a name="60120-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>I want to answer specific questions that arose during the debate. My noble friend Lady Dean asked me about the sleeper service. She will recognise that that is included in the franchise. The group that won the franchise is under the obligation to maintain that service. So, in drawing up the franchise, the Government recognised the concern about the sleeper service. That is why we included it in the specification for the franchise; it is on those terms that the franchise has been won.
</p>

<a name="60120-13_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>The development of the airport at Newquay, which my noble friend and the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, emphasised in their contributions, is important. There is no doubt that the intended withdrawal of the RAF from St Mawgan will have a colossal impact on Newquay Airport, because it governs air traffic control and a range of other facilities crucial to that airport. We recognise that the provision of the essential infrastructure will now fall on the civil authority&#151;the airport authority&#151;which will need help. We commend the people of Cornwall for not standing idly by. They have introduced the concept of the &#163;5 levy. I know that there has been a reaction from the airline and I understand its sensitivities, too, but it is obvious that extra resources are necessary to guarantee Newquay Airport&#039;s continuation, which we want. The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, commented that there is an interlocking aspect with Plymouth, which we recognise, as it is important.
</p>

<a name="60120-13_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>I turn to the issue of harbours&#151;I almost slipped into saying that I am on more dangerous ground, but my noble friend has beaten me to that inappropriate pun, so I shall not fall into that trap. My noble friend will recognise that substantial investment is required to develop harbours. These are significant projects. I entirely accept that the development of quite a number of minor European ports in recent years has reflected the growth in the cruise ship market and the investment that it can bring to the local economy. She quoted the precise figure of &#163;71 for each passenger stepping ashore. That is an important figure, which we must relate to the necessary costs incurred in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_940"></a>

<b>20 Jan 2006 : Column 940</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

developing harbours. I accept the noble Baroness&#039;s point; we will look at it very carefully. She will recognise that local authorities and regional bodies will have to work out that investment decision in order that we can make commitments in that area.
</p>

<a name="60120-13_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>I want to reassure the House on Crossrail. It was noticeable that my noble friend Lord Berkeley, who normally berates me about Crossrail issues every third or fourth week, did not contribute to that debate today. The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, and the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, emphasised a dimension of Crossrail that has not featured prominently in our debates on it thus far. This debate has facilitated that necessary examination. The major concerns about Crossrail are the colossal costs involved and the great difficulties in the construction, which will have a significant impact on London.
</p>

<a name="60120-13_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>However, Crossrail is there to serve the nation by increasing facilities and movement between London termini and across England. It would therefore be contradictory if the construction of Crossrail caused years of significant disruption to the availability of a crucial facility&#151;Paddington. We envisage that the significant disruption to Paddington will be at weekends and at times through the night during the week. We do not envisage Crossrail interrupting critical services to the south-west, Wales and the west of England generally. I want to give assurances on that front. I am grateful for this debate because it is the first time that I have been probed in this respect, and it is important that this aspect figures significantly in my department&#039;s thinking.
</p>

<a name="60120-13_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>My noble friend Lady Dean highlighted the desirability of a direct link with Heathrow. I can see its desirability and how it could be facilitated, but the costs involved would be significant. My noble friend will forgive me if I emphasise that we pride ourselves on the considerable investment and improvement in service represented by the Heathrow link from Paddington. It is asking any government to go an extra step to say that you could solve aspects of the problem by channelling the traffic directly to Heathrow before passengers arrive in Paddington. I can see the advantages of that; it is being looked at, but I have to say that it is not an immediate priority.
</p>

<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="60120-14_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   My Lords, I do not think that my noble friend suggested that the Government should pay; the British Airports Authority could pay because, after all, it causes much of the extra traffic through terminal 5.
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="60120-14_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   Indeed they do, my Lords, but the British Airports Authority would say that it pays for other crucial rail links and it is a question of priorities. My noble friend makes a genuine point, but I cannot see it developing in the immediate future, not quite within the timeframe in which the large part of this debate has taken place.
</p>

<a name="60120-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, referred to investment in spine roads. He was kind enough to recognise that significant investment is being made on crucial roads in the south-west, particularly the A303 and the A39. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_941"></a>

<b>20 Jan 2006 : Column 941</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Those roads are important throughout the year, but no one visits Cornwall during anything remotely like the holiday season without realising how critical those roads are as arteries. But the noble Lord will recognise that there is significant investment in those links.
</p>

<a name="60120-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, emphasised that this debate was useful for identifying the very great difficulties which we all face in tackling issues of sustained economic development in a region with <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_942"></a>

<b>20 Jan 2006 : Column 942</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

considerable disparities. At its weakest&#151;particularly in Cornwall&#151;it is one of the weakest areas of the country which needs to be addressed. I want to give an assurance that the Department for Transport recognises that it has an absolutely crucial role to play. I hope that I have given evidence of the significant issues that we are tackling forthrightly to give heart to all who have participated in this debate, for which I thank my noble friend for introducing so ably.

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="60120-14_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  In December 2005, the Government issued one licence for the export of 20 units of body armour to the Ministry of Justice, judicial police in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The equipment will be used by the judicial police in operations to protect against crime and preserve the safety of the civilian community or for humanitarian activities.
</p>

<a name="60120-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a>An EU arms embargo has been in place against Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1996. The purpose of the embargo was to aid the establishment of peace and stability for the people of the region, taking into account in particular the need to ensure the safety of international troops and civilian personnel deployed. The embargo was amended in 1999 to exclude de-mining equipment and the transfer of small arms to the police.
</p>

<a name="60120-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>We fully support the EU embargo. However, we are, in limited circumstances, prepared to make exceptions where denying an export would frustrate the purposes of the embargo. The UK has been active in encouraging Bosnia and Herzegovina to take greater responsibility for maintaining the rule of law and strengthening civilian policing. I am confident that granting this exception is fully consistent with this responsible approach of supporting the development of civilian policing while respecting the aims of the embargo.

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="60120-14_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  Some media reports over the past 48 hours, based on a leaked government document, have suggested that the Government may be aware that there have been cases of &quot;extraordinary rendition&quot; through UK territory or airspace about which they have not informed Parliament.
</p>

<a name="60120-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a>This is not the case. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Jack Straw) has given Parliament clear answers, updated as information has become available to him. The following chronology makes this clear.
</p>

<a name="60120-14_para5"></a>

<a name="column_WS42"></a>

<b>20 Jan 2006 : Column WS42</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

col. 1652W) set out the facts as they had then been established: there had been three instances in 1998 where the US authorities had requested permission to render a detainee through UK territory or airspace; and in two of these cases, where the detainee was to be transferred to the US for trial, the US request had been granted. In the other case, it had been refused. He added that officials continued to search the records.
</p>

<a name="60120-14_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a>13 December: my right honourable friend discussed these issues at length in his public evidence session with the Foreign Affairs Committee.
</p>

<a name="60120-14_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a>10 January: I issued a Written Ministerial Statement saying that Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials had now completed a search of their records back to May 1997. This search had turned up one further case, also in 1998: the Government had declined a US request to refuel a flight carrying two detainees en route to the US.
</p>

<a name="60120-14_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a>To summarise the position: we have found no evidence of detainees being rendered through the UK or overseas territories since 11 September 2001; we have found no evidence of detainees being rendered through the UK or overseas territories since 1997 where there were substantial grounds to believe there was a real risk of torture.
</p>

<a name="60120-14_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a>There were four cases in 1998 where the US requested permission to render one or more detainees through the UK or overseas territories. In two of these cases, records show that the Government granted the US request, and refused two others.
</p>

<a name="60120-14_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a>Since before September 2001 we have worked closely with the US to achieve our shared goal of fighting terrorism. As part of that close co-operation, we have made clear to the US authorities, including in recent months: that we expect them to seek permission to render detainees via UK territory and airspace (including Overseas Territories); that we will grant permission only if we are satisfied that the rendition would accord with UK law and our international obligations; and how we understand our obligations under the UN Convention Against Torture.
</p>

<a name="60120-14_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a>We are also clear that the US would not render a detainee through UK territory or airspace (including Overseas Territories) without our permission. As noted above, the US has sought such permission in the past.
</p>

<a name="60120-14_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a>The Government are committed to fulfilling their obligations under United Kingdom and international law. I have sought throughout to keep the House informed of developments and shall do so again if new information comes to light.

The cumulative breakeven position for North Cumbria Acute Hospitals NHS Trust is made up of the total of the year-end financial positions for the years from 2001&#150;02 to 2004&#150;05. That is the &#163;5.917 million deficit shown year by year in the above two tables, plus the two prior year adjustments of &#163;1.361 million deficit and &#163;0.489 million deficit for 2001&#150;02 and 2003&#150;04 respectively.<br>

</p>

<a name="60120w02_para4"></a>
<p>
Thus the cumulative breakeven position for North Cumbria Acute Hospitals NHS Trust for the financial year 2004&#150;05 is an overspend of &#163;7.767 million. No other organisation in North Cumbria has an accumulated deficit.<br>

<a name="60120w03_wqn0"></a><b> Lord Campbell-Savours </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_18"></a>When the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education carried out an external audit of the arrangements made by Southampton Solent University for ensuring quality and standards; and what was the outcome of that audit; and   [HL3334]

</p>

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_19"></a>Whether the positive pass policy of Southampton Solent University, as described by the university, meets its objectives for standards in higher education.  [HL3336]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_18"></a>
<a name="60120w03_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills  (Lord Adonis): </b>  The Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA) last carried out an audit of the institution&#039;s quality and standards arrangements in August 2000, when the institution&#039;s title was the Southampton Institute. The overall conclusion on quality and standards was that there could be broad confidence in the institute&#039;s ability properly to discharge its responsibility for the academic standards of the degrees it awarded in the name of Nottingham Trent University and for the quality of the programmes of study leading to those awards. The full report is available on the QAA website at www.qaa.ac.uk/reviews/reports/institutional/southampton institute/southampton&#151;institute.asp&#163;34. More recently, the institution has been subject to QAA scrutiny following its application for degree-awarding powers and university title. It was granted taught degree-awarding powers on 1 November 2004 and university title on 8 July 2005.
</p>

<a name="60120w03_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_11"></a>It is a matter for universities to ensure that appropriate standards are being achieved, referenced against national definitions of standards agreed by and for the higher education sector. The QAA publish these definitions and review institutional practice in relation to them, via institutional audits. The &quot;positive pass policy&quot; as presented in media reporting does not reflect the policies of Southampton Solent University on standards and assessment.

<p><a name="wa_qn_18"></a>
<a name="60120w03_wqn1"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_20"></a>What are their current estimates of the gross income to be gained by the university sector in England from the charging of top-up fees for 2006&#150;07; 2007&#150;08; and 2008&#150;09.  [HL3370]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_19"></a>
<a name="60120w03_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills  (Lord Adonis): </b>  From 2006&#150;07, institutions will be free to set fees up to <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>20 Jan 2006 : Column WA142</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

&#163;3,000 for new students. Figures for income from fees from 2006&#150;07 onwards will depend on the pattern of fee charging by institutions and the way that students respond to that pattern.
</p>

<a name="60120w03_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_12"></a>Assuming 91 per cent. of students were charged &#163;3,000 and the remaining 9 per cent. &#163;2,000, we estimate that the fee income on a steady state basis on 2006&#150;07 student numbers would be around &#163;2.25 billion.
