This is an operational matter for Network Rail, overseen by the independent Office of Rail Regulation. As part of the Periodic Review 2008 final determinations accepted by Network Rail on 5 February, the Office of Rail Regulation has set targets and provided funding for Network Rail to reduce the impact of its engineering works on users of the railway.</p>

Who speaks on behalf of passengers when the overall network delays are simply unacceptable?</p>

It is precisely for that reason that the Office of Rail Regulation, which is the body responsible for ensuring that the voice of passengers is conveyed loud and clear to Network Rail, has agreed with Network Rail that over the next five years there will be a reduction of more than one-third in the disruption caused to passengers by engineering work. Of course, it is not possible to maintain the railway without engineering work, which will cause some disruption to passengers, but we expect that the target of a one-third reduction in that disruption will make a big difference to the experience of members of the travelling public.</p>

The noble Lord referred to the Office of Rail Regulation. We have the Office of Rail Regulation, we have the operators, we have Network Rail and we have the passengers. There needs to be more connect between that lot. The passenger loses out all the time. Will the Government think more about how those four bodies can co-operate more fully?</p>

However, there is no absence of responsibility in this matter. The Office of Rail Regulation is clearly charged with ensuring that the passenger voice is heard loud and clear and it establishes the regime within which Network Rail works. As I say, it has set a target for a substantial reduction over the next five years in the disruption caused to passengers by engineering work.</p>

I declare an interest as chairman of the Rail Freight Group and as one of the 100 members of Network Rail.

However, I am sure that that House would expect Network Rail&#146;s remuneration committee to be mindful of the public mood on bonuses and not to award bonuses that the travelling public would consider unjustified by their own experience of Network Rail&#146;s performance. This includes the hundreds of thousands of the travelling public on the west coast main line whose services were cancelled or massively disrupted in the new year by poor maintenance of the overhead wires.</p>

In addition to the near-30 per cent improvements in efficiency that Network Rail has achieved over the past five years, the Office of Rail Regulation is requiring Network Rail to make a further 25 per cent improvement in efficiency over the next five years. That will be achieved only if it plans its engineering work much more effectively.</p>

Does he know of any attempt to find out what happens with engineering works in other countries that seem to run efficient railways? For example, is there any night working? Let me just explain this. We live on what is known as the misery line&#151;Southern railway&#151;which is usually closed for two weekends a month. That means that it will never increase passenger numbers at weekends because no one knows whether the trains are running or not.</p>

Partly as a result of that benchmarking exercise, new targets have been set for Network Rail&#146;s overall efficiency and for the reduction expected in the disruption caused to passengers by engineering work.</p>

Performance has been substantially improving and I do not believe that it is in the public interest that there should be further big changes to the organisation of the railway industry at present. It is important that those who are responsible get on with the job and do it properly. Network Rail&#146;s performance has been improving substantially in recent years, but it needs to continue improving.</p>

We have been among the largest employers in manufacturing, but the situation has now changed quite considerably and the problem is in maintaining skills at a time of rising unemployment, particularly in the engineering and motor car industries, which are particularly prominent here. There is of course the question of the depreciation of sterling. That should have been a considerable advantage to us but we do not seem to have seen it so far. We shall need to watch that carefully. What action should we now take to retain our skilled employees over the difficult time that lies ahead?</p>

It is very important that we do all that we can as a Government to support manufacturing companies through this recession so that they do not, as a result of a temporary loss of demand, cut out capacity capability, be it a plant or skilled employees, as that would leave them at a disadvantage when the upturn comes. That is why we are providing the support for skills that is essential for UK manufacturing both to compete globally and, in particular, to get through the recession. This includes a significant expansion of the Train to Gain service, which will provide more than &#163;1 billion of funding for employer-focused skills during the coming years, and other customised packages, which the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills is discussing with the key manufacturing employers, most recently Corus and Nissan.</p>

The aim of cutting VAT was to get as substantial and quick a stimulus as possible for demand into the economy. I do not believe that alternative measures, notably changes in tax, would have had the same effect and certainly not as quick an effect as the reduction in VAT, which kicked in a week later.</p>

More than 400 loans have been offered under the scheme, amounting to in the region of &#163;40 million.

From the 2,500 originally mentioned, as I understand it, the figure has risen by a further 1,500. I remind my noble friend that there was a time when many in this country thought that there was no future for manufacturing. Indeed, some argued that we were in a post-industrial society.

However, I will make inquiries because I am concerned that a greater number of redundancies may be made than those of which I was originally informed.</p>

The department now cannot even give a date by which it will be. Indeed, the Government are only now starting discussions with lenders over guaranteed pricing.

If one of our major broadcasters or newspapers were in similar crisis, he would be under similar pressure simply to save the broadcaster or newspaper under threat.</p>

In a sense, it is the Iraqis who have authority over this group, not the Iranians, and therefore it is their position that we should continue to monitor. At the moment, we believe that they understand their responsibilities. They are allowing the ICRC access and it is reassured that, at the moment, the treatment is appropriate.</p>

Surely the British Government have a joint responsibility for everything that has happened since 2003 and a duty to see that the rights of the people in Ashraf under international law are respected.

This change is being proposed following discussions through the usual channels, which concluded that in this case such a change to the business might be for the general convenience of the House.

As the note accompanying the list makes clear, making a holder of PCL a person &#147;subject to immigration control&#148;&#151;the first of many terms of art used in this Bill&#151;within the meaning of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 means that he is subject to the condition that he should not have recourse to public funds. In practice, that means that he is ineligible for any of 15 different types of benefit that are available to those on ILR.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="0903028000061"></a>Amendment 105A deals with the case of a person who becomes homeless through no fault of his own during his passage through the probationary citizenship phase. Under the Bill he is given none of the assistance that is normally extended to persons who become homeless. We ask the Minister why this should be so. If someone who is in the middle of a probationary citizenship phase becomes homeless&#151;let us say that a spouse who is attacked by a violent partner becomes homeless during that part of her stay&#151;why is she ineligible for any assistance? That should be added to the list of exceptions in the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="0903028000062"></a><b><a name="90302-0002.htm_spnew22"></a><a name="0903028000336"></a>Lord Brett:</b> I am afraid that I must resist this amendment. It is a fundamental tenet of our proposed reform of the path to citizenship that the rights and benefits of citizenship are reserved for those who have earned the right to them. Migrants earn those rights and benefits by completing both the temporary residence and the probationary citizenship path.</p>

<a name="90302-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="0903028000063"></a>We recognise that migrants make a significant contribution to this country both economically and in social terms. Nevertheless, it has been a long-standing policy that those entering the United Kingdom on the work or family routes should be expected to support themselves without access to benefits. This supports a clearly held public view that migrants should make an economic contribution and should not be a burden on the state. This policy should be strengthened and clarified so that everyone is clear that full access will be withheld until a migrant completes the path to citizenship.</p>

<a name="90302-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="0903028000064"></a>Of course, this does not apply to migrants who are on the protection route. It is right, given the special circumstances that led people on this route to come to the UK, that they should be able to access all benefits immediately. The restrictions on access to benefits and services at the probationary citizenship stage will apply only to migrants on the work route&#151;that is, those highly skilled and skilled workers under tiers 1 and 2 of the points-based system&#151;and the family route, for family members of British citizens and permanent residents.</p>

<a name="90302-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="0903028000065"></a>Further, all migrants, including those on the family and work routes, will have full access to national insurance contribution-based benefits on the same basis as British workers. These benefits are contribution-based jobseeker&#146;s allowance, incapacity benefit, contributory employment and support allowance, retirement pension, maternity allowance and bereavement benefit. This applies equally during the probationary period of citizenship. We continue to believe that full access to benefits should normally be withheld until a migrant has earned the right to British citizenship or permanent residence.</p>

<a name="90302-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="0903028000066"></a>The amendment is also seriously flawed. While it would give probationary citizens access to social housing and homelessness assistance in Scotland and Northern Ireland, it would not do so in England or Wales. Nor

<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="0903028000067"></a>The noble Lord raised two points, one in relation to higher education and the second in relation to homelessness.

If the noble Lord is content with that, I ask him to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="0903028000068"></a>I turn to Amendment 105A. I hope that noble Lords will forgive me; my paper-juggling skills are not great. I beg your Lordships&#146; pardon. I must admit to a certain degree of defeat.</p>

While I entirely accept the noble Lord&#146;s contention that it has always been the case that a person who is on these routes should be expected to support themselves without access to public funds, there must surely be the occasional exception to that. Anybody with a spark of humanity would say that someone who is in the middle of this phase, and who becomes unintentionally homeless through no fault of their own, would look to the public purse for some sort of help. That was the point that I was trying to make. However, I can see that I am not going to get anywhere with the main argument.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="0903028000072"></a>I ask the Minister only one further question: what is the real reason for the change in policy? A person was, for the first five years, a worker, or for two years a family member. These periods have suddenly changed. In every case, the time that it takes to become a citizen has become longer. Why do the Government think that that is a better way of getting people to settle in the community?</p>

This will ensure that a person who is absent in a particular year for more than 90 days for legitimate reasons of business, family crisis or illness abroad does not have to restart the clock on the qualifying period upon his return. It addresses one aspect of the problem that was identified by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, when she spoke of migrants who,</p>
<ul><a name="0903028000242"></a>&#147;will end up in a game of snakes and ladders, by which they may fall down and have to start the process all over again&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 11/2/09; col. 1135.]</ul>
<a name="90302-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="0903028000076"></a>The current rules, which are set out in chapter 18 of the nationality instructions, allow for an exceptional absence for business or family reasons to be offset by shorter periods of absence in other years, but the Bill requires that the 90-day limit be rigidly observed in each year of the qualifying period. For example, a tier 1 migrant employed by a financial services company travelled overseas extensively to secure business, clocking up 150 days in the first year of his stay in this country. This was not a problem if the average for the whole of the qualifying period did not exceed 90 days, but he will no longer be able to do that.</p>

<a name="90302-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="0903028000077"></a>We understand that the Government are against the amendment because they think that a fixed 90-day limit will promote integration. As far as we are aware, there is no research to show that migrants who relied on averaging over the many years that it has been in force are less integrated than others who had kept within the 90-day limit for each individual year. If the Minister has any research on the matter, perhaps he will enlighten us. Conversely, as the effect of the Government&#146;s proposal is that a person who is unavoidably absent for more than 90 days has to start the qualifying period again from zero, that person will take much longer to become integrated.</p>

<a name="90302-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="0903028000078"></a>Our second amendment provides that where a person spends two periods of time in the UK with a qualifying immigration status separated by a period of lawful but not qualifying immigration status, then the two qualifying periods can be aggregated for the purposes of the calculation. An example of how this might operate is that of a worker who, after 18 months in a job, takes a year off to do a full-time MBA degree and then returns to his former or to another employment. Without the amendment, that first 18 months would not count towards the qualifying period because the time spent on the MBA, although it is a lawful immigration status, is not a qualifying immigration status within the meaning of Clause 37(11).</p>

<a name="90302-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="0903028000079"></a>The Immigration Law Practitioners&#146; Association cites the case of a person who studied in the UK for three years and then worked for a single employer for a month short of five years, when at that point she was

Because she had a three-month notice period, the employer wrote in support of her ILR application and it was successful. But if the studies, instead of being at the start of the time she was spending in the UK had been in between two periods of work adding up to the same total, she could not have succeeded if this Bill had been then in force.</p>

<a name="90302-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="0903028000080"></a>Amendment 58 makes the same point about averaging in Clause 38 but deals with family members. It is even more likely that a spouse or civil partner would have a family emergency in his country of origin which requires him to be absent for a period of more than 90 days than a worker whose job could be at stake as a result of the long break, but the arguments are much the same. I beg to move.</p>

At Second Reading I mentioned the concern expressed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and others that the new qualifying period, which is to be extended to three years, should not apply to genuine refugees. In their case, the period ought to start from the first application for entry. An additional probationary citizenship period prior to qualification for naturalisation would leave many of them in a state of unresolved nationality for well beyond 10 years. As a matter of best practice, these delays appear unsatisfactory for those people deemed in need of international protection.</p>

<a name="90302-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="0903028000082"></a>I do not like the term &#147;probationary citizenship&#148; since it creates a second-class category from which migrants and refugees, tripped up by these regulations, may never escape. In the case of migrants, I hope that the Minister will agree with the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that the clause allowing leave up to three months in the year is unnecessarily restrictive. Migrants, by their nature, may have good reasons to return to their first home for long periods even though they have established strong ties with the UK. There is also a potential conflict with the ECHR and the 1997 European Convention on Nationality. What will happen to existing migrants approaching the end of their limited leave who are ready and entitled to apply for indefinite leave? Will their rights be safeguarded or will they have to go backwards to probationary citizenship?</p>

<a name="90302-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="0903028000083"></a>The special category of recognised refugees resettled under the Gateway Protection Programme will surely not have to spend more than five years. The Minister will be aware that the majority of people in this category will already have been recognised by the United Nations for at least five years before their resettlement. The programme provides for this special category of people selected outside the UK by our embassy staff from the group of UN-registered refugees now in third countries. The UK has only recently joined this programme. I have had some experience of this and know how rigorous the selection process is, so I would be grateful for the reassurance. I recognise that this group of refugees comes up in later amendments but I wanted to put this on the record now.</p>

The travel restrictions in Clause 37 could conflict with this. A lot of charitable and relief organisations employ migrants seeking indefinite leave to remain. Those migrants often have the linguistic or specialist skills needed by agencies engaged in international development or relief. Church Communities UK gave a good example in its briefing of a Korean member who speaks Thai and was sent to Thailand for nine months to assist in a school that had been destroyed by the tsunami. She did this while seeking indefinite leave to remain. Her commitment to the culture and values of this country seems self-evident and is embraced by the self-giving action that she undertook as a result of the work of that agency. A law of unintended consequences seems to be at work here, which is why this amendment is so valuable.</p>

The three routes are clear: work, family and the protection route. We require migrants to pass through successive stages on their journey to citizenship, and at each stage they will need to demonstrate that they have earned the right to progress. That supports the key principle that rights are matched by responsibilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="0903028000087"></a>With regard to the noble Lord&#146;s first amendment, I cannot support the notion of an average calculation of absences over the qualifying period, but I can advise that we will not examine that requirement too closely where the absences are in the earlier part of the probationary period. However, as I have said, we require British citizens to demonstrate clearly that they have a close connection and a continuing relationship with the UK and intend to regard the UK as their home. We believe that that can be demonstrated by migrants spending the overwhelming majority of their time in the UK during their qualifying period. We consider that that encourages integration more than an individual spending a large part of their time abroad. If we applied an average of absences over a six-year period, that could in theory allow someone to be absent for up to 540 days in one go, yet still qualify for naturalisation. We do not consider that this is the best way for a migrant to demonstrate a close connection. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="0903028000088"></a>Under our proposals, migrants will be able to spend one-quarter of each year of their qualifying period outside the UK and still qualify for British citizenship. We feel that that is a more than adequate provision. As I said, we will not examine the requirement too closely where the absences take place in the early part of the qualifying period&#151;that is, in the entry into the probationary citizenship stage, which has already been examined. We are not concerned about absences from the UK before the start of the qualifying period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="0903028000089"></a>We want&#151;I think this meets the point made by several noble Lords&#151;to avoid a system that penalises those who we want to stay here from being able to because they have exceeded the set limit by a few days, or who may have justifiable reasons to explain their absence. The Bill therefore provides a discretion to allow the Secretary of State to overlook periods of absence that exceed 90 days in a year in the special circumstances of a particular case. Cases cited in the discussion of this clause would provide some of the basis for that kind of discretion.</p>

<a name="90302-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="0903028000090"></a>We will continue to expect migrants to justify large absences. In such cases we would expect the applicant to demonstrate close links with the UK in terms of length of residence and the presence of home, family and estate in the UK. We would also look at the reasons for absences.</p>

As he knows, my name is also attached to the amendment. I wonder if I understood him correctly when he said that the Secretary of State will have discretion to overlook the requirement for no more than 90 days&#146; absence per year. I note what he says about integration, along with his calculation that it could end up being 540 days. He is implying a level of flexibility. In the interests of transparency, will he explain whether the ability of the Secretary of State to divert from the rules that are laid down will be set out in guidance? How will people who might be affected by that, particularly in humanitarian cases or in emergencies, know that they have the right to use exceptional circumstances as a basis for using that right?</p>

We do not support the view on the aggregation of two periods with qualifying immigration status, where they are separated by a period in which people have held a non-qualifying immigration status but, again, we have the power to apply discretion to the requirement for continuous employment. We recognise that there may be circumstances where economically productive migrants, through no fault of their own, cease to be in employment for short periods: Clause 37(7) gives us the discretion to waive the requirement in compelling circumstances. That will, however, only assist those who have spent the whole of their qualifying period continuously with a qualifying sort of immigration status.</p>

Regarding the intervention from the right reverend Prelate, I, too, read what was said by Church Communities UK, and he quoted an extremely valid example. That individual, who came into the United Kingdom to assist them with overseas programmes, had specialist knowledge of the Thai language and customs and spent a good deal of the first year, as I remember it, outside the country. He was all right, however, because his average was still less than the 90 days. The rigidity of the 90 days will discourage that sort of activity, and although I heard the Minister&#146;s answer to my noble friend, I would like him to assure me that that discretion can be found in the Bill. I did not notice it, and neither did my noble friend, so it would also be extremely helpful if the Minister can point us toward the clause that confers the discretion he has mentioned on the Secretary of State.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="0903028000098"></a>Until we see the guidance that the Minister said would be forthcoming, we really do not know whether his answer is satisfactory. The reasons why people may have to take advantage of the discretion are manifold; we hope that it will be sufficiently flexible to cover every circumstance that we, from previous experience, know that people may invoke. It is frequently the case with this Bill that we are told guidance is coming along later, but we have no means of really getting our teeth into what is proposed because there is no idea of the nature of that guidance, or of how it will operate in practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="0903028000099"></a>I am disappointed by what the Minister said in answer to Amendment 47, because there are circumstances&#151;I quoted an example&#151;where a person&#146;s qualifying residence would be interrupted by a perfectly legal stay in the country which was not qualifying. I do not see why that should be excluded by the calculation and why somebody should have to start again from scratch. By definition, if it is a lawful stay in the country, it is contributing to that person&#146;s integration. We were asking not that it should be counted, but only that the

We hope also to get the Government to explain what is added to the process of getting a permanent migrant to the point of applying for citizenship by having two stages of temporary leave, one after the other, called by different names but in practical terms adding nothing but a layer of bureaucracy and complexity to the process.</p>

<a name="90302-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="0903028000102"></a>The first amendment would omit the requirement that an applicant for naturalisation have a particular kind of leave at the point when the application is made. The second amendment, which is an alternative, provides that the applicant should have,</p>

<p><a name="0903028000218"></a>at that point. All the other conditions, including length of stay, knowledge of English and active citizenship would remain the same under our proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="0903028000103"></a>In the Government&#146;s response to the consultation on the <I>Path to Citizenship </I>Green Paper, no statistics were given, but it was pretty clear that most of the respondents had been highly critical of the probationary citizenship stage. Some felt it was unnecessary because the temporary leave stage was already probationary, while others felt that it would lead to more confusion, which I am sure it will. The new stage would discourage integration, and there is no need to lengthen the timescale. There is no argument in the document to demonstrate how changing the name of temporary leave part of the way through the period of waiting to become a citizen would contribute towards integration, to British society or to clarity, which are said to be the three main aims of the legislation. Requiring the migrant to learn English, to have some knowledge of British society and contribute a recorded amount of voluntary work are all conditions which could equally well be imposed without creating an additional stage in which they have to embedded. Equally, lengthening the time before an application for citizenship can be submitted for people who break the law or who do not satisfy the language or active citizenship tests is not dependent on the name of the status occupied by the person to whom these criteria are applied.</p>

No amount of tinkering with the name should be allowed to obscure the fact that we are dealing with arbitrarily different names for two stages that are the same for the migrant, adding nothing but unnecessary complexity and bureaucracy to the process of becoming either a citizen or a permanent resident.

The noble Lord, Lord West, explained at Second Reading that probationary citizenship was intended to demonstrate that probationary citizens were on a journey. However, interim leave to remain suggests precisely the same: it is the same process, whereby migrants are on a journey to citizenship. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that &#147;probation&#148; is an unfortunate term here. It sounds as if everything is against the person trying to get their citizenship. Probation means that you have to be on your best behaviour all the time, whereas, as the correspondence that we have received shows, everybody understands &#147;interim leave to remain&#148;. Will the Minister tell us what the differences are, apart from the name? Is there anything in probationary citizenship that is different from interim leave to remain? If there is not, please could we stick to the name that we have?</p>

We believe that citizenship should be earned. The second stage will enable migrants to demonstrate their continued commitment to the UK and it will support their integration; it will encourage migrants to continue their journey towards securing British citizenship. The objective of paragraph (d), which the amendment would omit, is to ensure that migrants cannot apply for naturalisation as British citizens until they have substantially progressed on the path and met the associated requirements. The amendments would allow a migrant to apply for naturalisation without having passed through the probationary citizenship scheme, which we see as a key part of the path and the journey. They would also mean that an EEA national could apply for naturalisation without first holding a permanent EEA entitlement, which would not be appropriate. It is therefore crucial that migrants are required to pass through the probationary citizenship stage before they can be naturalised as British citizens. It would not be appropriate to have EEA nationals apply for naturalisation without first gaining a permanent EEA entitlement.</p>

Of course, another connotation has been suggested by the noble Lord, who said that probation in criminal law is seen as something that precedes something more serious. We are not wedded to the word &#147;probation&#148;. We think that it is the clearest way to describe how people should take on board active citizenship activities on the way to naturalisation but, if alternatives were put forward, the Government would be delighted to consider them. If anything clearer and more acceptable were put forward, there would not be great resistance from the Government to accepting it. In the mean time, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I ventured to suggest in my remarks that, although we did not particularly like the term &#147;probationary citizenship leave&#148;, that was not the gravamen of our criticism of the whole scheme.</p>

<a name="90302-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="0903028000118"></a>When the Minister first replied to the noble Baroness, he made three points. When she asked him what the essential difference was between the two parts of the scheme, I carefully took down what he said. First, he said that it was a key part of the Government&#146;s vision. What the hell does that mean? It is totally meaningless. He then said that citizenship should be earned. Nobody is arguing about that; what we are saying is that you do not need two stages in which that earning process can take place. It could be continuous, from the person&#146;s arrival in the country to the date on which he is eligible to apply for citizenship. Having an arbitrary cut-off point halfway through, allowing you to christen the second phase by a different name, is totally meaningless.</p>

<a name="90302-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="0903028000119"></a>The third point that the Minister made was that the second phase enables the migrant to demonstrate his commitment. Well, he has to demonstrate his commitment; there are certain rules that he has to comply with. He has to go through the earned citizenship process; he has to learn English; he has to avoid committing any criminal offence; and all the rest of it. We are not arguing about that. All we are saying&#151;and I do not know how many times one has to repeat this&#151;is that the imposition of a change in the title halfway through does not get us anywhere but simply adds complexity and bureaucracy to the process. I would prefer to call these phases &#147;temporary leave to remain, one and two&#148;; if we have to have two phases, let us make it clear that they are actually the same by calling them by the same name. Then, if we want to have them as different phases, we can attach &#147;one&#148; and &#147;two&#148; to them.</p>

<a name="90302-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="0903028000120"></a>I would prefer a much simpler solution, with a single stage starting from the date of the person&#146;s entry to the United Kingdom. It would have all the hoops that he had to jump through but it would get to a point at the end at which he could apply for citizenship. I wish that I could convince the Minister of that, but I dare say that that is not going to be possible this afternoon. At this stage, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Amendments 50 and 53 are designed only to ensure that Clause 37 corresponds with the common travel area arrangements for Irish nationals, not to expand the rights given to Irish nationals more generally.

Will the Minister explain how an Irish citizen, apart from ceasing to be a qualifying person under paragraph 6(1) of the EEA regulations, could otherwise forfeit the right to reside in the UK? As he explained, the amendments give any such person a qualifying CTA entitlement, which is defined in Amendments 107 and 108.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="0903028000127"></a>Then we have a person with a Commonwealth right of abode, which is also to count as a qualifying immigration status for naturalisation as a British citizen under Section 6(2) of the British Nationality Act 1981 if he has a right of abode under Section 2(1)(b) of that Act. However, when I looked that up, I discovered that it referred to a Commonwealth citizen who had a right of abode in the UK immediately before the commencement of the 1981 Act by virtue of Sections 2(1)(d) and 2(2) of the Act as then in force. However, those sections have been repealed and it is, therefore, no longer possible to tell who is entitled just from reading the Act or even by going to the otherwise wonderful website www.statutelaw.gov.uk. The definition therefore fails the test of being prescribed by law and I suggest to the Minister that, at Report, if he agrees, he should repeal Section 2(1)(b) and re-enact in this Bill whatever was in Sections 2(1)(d) and 2(2). I should be grateful if he could think about that and perhaps not give me an answer off the cuff, but discuss it with me before Report.</p>

The amendments accept part of the proposal in our Amendment 61 in this group that a person with a Commonwealth right of abode and a relevant family association should be able to be naturalised without the former having to be based on the latter, but not that the same principle applies to the permanent EEA entitlement, which was also covered in our Amendment 61. Can the Minister explain this distinction? We protest that this is an example of the complexity of the scheme, which seems to be required by the splitting of the shorter family route to naturalisation into two groups&#151;those with a permanent EEA entitlement whose leave must depend on the relationship throughout the whole of the path to citizenship and those where this is not required through a Commonwealth right of abode or the new CTA entitlement. If I may say so, this is the very opposite of the Home Secretary&#146;s claim in her foreword to <I>The Path to Citizenship</I> Green Paper, in which she says:</p>

I know that we will not get anywhere with that, but I have to keep drumming it in, because it is a simple point that needs to be understood by the Government if they want to know where we are coming from in our criticisms of the whole Bill.</p>

<a name="90302-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="0903028000130"></a>Finally, we have a question about Amendment 60. I thank the Minister for most kindly providing the Keeling schedule, although it incorporates only the amendments to Schedule 1 to the BNA made by the Bill in its original form and does not include the amendments that we are considering. The qualifying CTA entitlement requires the holder to have arrived in the UK on a local journey, as the Minister explained, which is defined in Section 11 of the Immigration Act 1971 as a journey that begins and ends in the common travel area consisting of the UK, the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. For instance, an Irish citizen who comes here on a flight from Dublin acquires a qualifying CTA entitlement, but if he then goes to Paris for a weekend by Eurostar or Ryanair, his return is not a local journey within the meaning of Section 11. Amendments 107 and 108 say unambiguously that he must have,</p>
<ul><a name="0903028000244"></a>&#147;last arrived ... on a local journey&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0903028000220"></a>So, by going to Paris for the weekend, this person has forfeited his qualifying CTA entitlement, which has to begin again from the time of his arrival back at Waterloo. Was that really the intention behind these amendments?</p>

<p><a name="st_98"></a>
<a name="0903028000131"></a><b><a name="90302-0004.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="0903028000370"></a>Lord Brett:</b> When I read my notes and attempted to study the background to these amendments, I gave my officials forewarning that, when questioned, I would certainly offer the facility of writing in greater detail to expand on what is relatively clear in meaning but seems incredibly complicated in writing. We do not want to repeal, for example, the 1971 Act. However, we will cover all those issues separately as part of the consolidated Bill, which is due to be announced before the end of this year.</p>

<a name="90302-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="0903028000132"></a>The noble Lord asked to whom the amendments would apply, apart from Irish nationals who have ceased to qualify under the EEA regulations. That is the purpose; it is to fill the gap for those Irish nationals. Because I thought that some of the questions on this issue would delve back into the 1981 Act, and because I have had difficulty reading the wonderful website to which the noble Lord referred, I should be grateful if he would allow me to write to him on these matters.</p>

<a name="90302-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="0903028000133"></a>However, I should say that the Government resist Amendment 61. In addition to the right of abode of Commonwealth nationals, the amendment would also allow persons with a permanent EEA entitlement to qualify under Section 6(2) and they would therefore benefit from the shorter qualification period. At the same time, the amendment does not extend to persons exercising CTA entitlement.</p>

<a name="90302-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="0903028000134"></a>The government amendments recognise the close and special bond between the UK and countries in the CTA and the Commonwealth. It is right that we continue to recognise that special relationship through our nationality legislation, helping to reinforce the  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_523"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column 523</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>unique bond that exists between the United Kingdom and the people of the Commonwealth. However, it is not clear to me why EEA nationals should be given favourable treatment in this regard compared with everyone else and be able to nationalise via the quicker route. EEA nationals already benefit from being able to qualify for permanent residence, with all the advantages that that bestows, after five years in the UK, whereas, under our proposals, everyone else must wait up to 10 years to attain this status.</p>

<a name="90302-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="0903028000135"></a>I should again make it clear that EEA nationals in a relationship with a British citizen or a permanent resident are perfectly able to qualify for the shorter time periods that apply to the &#147;family&#148; route. They simply have to choose to obtain leave to enter or remain on the basis of their relationship and qualify under Section 6(2) rather than rely on treaty rights. As such, I do not consider that this is in any way discriminatory against EEA nationals.</p>

<a name="90302-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="0903028000136"></a>Our amendments also maintain the current position. At the moment, Irish nationals entering the UK from France do not have a CTA entitlement to re-enter this country. In most cases, however, they will have a right to enter under European law, and that situation will remain unchanged. I hope that the proposals set out in the Government&#146;s amendments commend themselves to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="st_99"></a>
<a name="0903028000137"></a><b><a name="90302-0004.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="0903028000371"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> We did not say that the person who comes back on Eurostar does not have a right of re-entry at Waterloo&#151;my noble friend says that it has now changed to St Pancras; I had forgotten that. We said that his qualifying CTA entitlement begins again from scratch the moment that he comes back to St Pancras, and that is incongruous. If this person has already spent a year in the United Kingdom, having entered from Dublin, the short holiday that he spends in Paris means that he has to begin the clock again from zero, and we find that result of the amendments bizarre. If the noble Lord would like to do so, I am perfectly happy for him to take this away and think about it a little further if he does not have the answer off the cuff.</p>

<a name="90302-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="0903028000138"></a>On the point that the Minister made about the Commonwealth having special consideration, we are not talking about anything very special. We are talking about whether the person who has the right of abode here depends entirely on the relevant family association, which is a comparatively small point. For the sake of making the Bill slightly simpler, I should have thought that the Government would have leapt at Amendment 61, so that people with a permanent EEA entitlement would be treated the same as those with a Commonwealth right of abode.</p>

<a name="90302-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="0903028000139"></a>I am beginning to see that whatever we say, and whatever the merits of our arguments, we are not going to get very far this afternoon. That is a great pity because, normally, the point of Committee is to try to improve the Bill. That is what we are doing; we are trying to assist the Secretary of State in her aim of making the journey to citizenship clearer, simpler and easier for the public and migrants to understand, instead of all the time making it more difficult.</p>

The first amendment deletes the requirement in Clause 37 that a person must remain in continuous employment throughout the whole of the probationary citizenship stage. Again, we are grateful to the Minister for the Keeling schedule, which enables us to see where that fits into the BNA 1981. The expression &#147;continuous employment&#148; is not defined. If the Minister says that that will be done in future in guidance, that would mean that Parliament has no say in the detail of the requirement now or at any future time when the Executive may amend the guidance at their absolute discretion.</p>

<a name="90302-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="0903028000142"></a>The second amendment provides that the person must not have been in breach of the conditions of that leave; there are already conditions attached to employment under the points-based system. For example, where the sponsor of a skilled worker under tier 2 of the PBS loses the sponsor licence, the worker has his leave curtailed if he is out of work for more than 60 days after that, unless he has less than six months of his leave remaining, in which case the leave will not be curtailed. If the worker finds a new sponsor to employ him within the 60 days, is he to be treated as having been in continuous employment, or is the period of his probationary citizenship to start again from the day he begins the new job, even though his temporary unemployment was through no fault of his own? If so, why do the Government consider it necessary to apply more onerous conditions to the worker on the path to citizenship than are already laid down by UKBA in the sponsor policy guidance manual?</p>

<a name="90302-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="0903028000143"></a>There are already inconsistencies between the treatment of tier 2 migrants and that of migrants from the access states of the EEA in 2004 and 2007. To take the case of a migrant from Bulgaria or Romania, the UKBA&#146;s European case work instructions provide:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="0903028000236"></a>&#147;Employment is to be considered to be continuous if the applicant was legally working at the beginning and end of that period and any intervening period in which the applicant was not legally working did not exceed 30 days&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0903028000221"></a>We consider, therefore, that introducing a new and as yet undefined continuous employment requirement will create confusion and is unnecessary when there are already strict conditions that apply to workers changing jobs. We also fear that unknown conditions

The domestic worker who has to leave an abusive employer and will not therefore have a reference may be unable to obtain another job as a domestic servant and special arrangements should be made for people in those circumstances. Your Lordships have debated these problems many times over the past few years, but since the meaning of continuous employment is to be defined in guidance, from now on we are to have no say in the means of protecting this vulnerable group of workers. I beg to move.</p>

A restrictive interpretation of it would be continuous employment with one employer. That in my view would be far too restrictive. In the present economic conditions people may be made redundant, lose their jobs or the firm may go bankrupt. Therefore, they should be given a reasonable period in which to find alternative employment. I would also like to endorse thoroughly what the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said about domestic workers.</p>

I am concerned that employees, particularly domestic employees, whose employer may behave improperly towards them, may have considerable problems. The Minister may say that Clause 37(7) applies, but one does not know whether that is to be flexible and broad or to be inflexible and used only in exceptional circumstances. In the period in which we are now living, when people may have come in under an entitlement to stay here in a particular form of employment but in the present economic climate may lose their job, as the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, said, they are in real danger under the wording of Clause 37 of finding themselves put back to the end of the queue and having to start over again. It seems potentially unjust, and if it is not unjust because subsection (7) applies, why is it there anyway?</p>

It also points out that &#147;continuous employment&#148; is a specific legal term that means that in the majority of cases an employee must be working for the same employer in order to qualify. Is the phrase in the Bill intended to carry that specific legal term?</p>

I was recently in Poland, which is in the European Union and totally different from this country. Some Pols coming here had a job and had been told that they would be all right, but after two weeks their construction firm had collapsed. They had already paid their worker registration fee, although are not talking about that. There is now such difficulty in obtaining employment that it would be totally unfair to insist on someone being in continuous employment before going on to citizenship.</p>

I am afraid that I am going to disappoint the noble Lord, Lord Avebury. As I said, we are changing the way that migrants progress to citizenship. We are creating a clearer journey towards becoming a British citizen by putting in place three clear routes to citizenship, with clear requirements for progression on each route. To qualify for citizenship, those here on work routes must show that they are still working and paying taxes. If they do not meet that requirement they will not qualify for citizenship and will be required to leave the United Kingdom. This is wholly appropriate: those here on the &#147;work routes&#148; are here to do exactly that. If they cease to be in employment, they have ceased to meet the key requirement of their route and therefore should not be allowed to progress to citizenship. If these amendments were to be made, migrants who have come here to work would be allowed to qualify for citizenship despite being completely economically inactive for, in some cases, long periods. That is wholly unacceptable.</p>

<a name="90302-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="0903028000149"></a>Furthermore, the amendment specifically proposes a requirement that the applicant has not breached conditions. However, under the existing proposals this is already achieved by virtue of the good character requirement. Under this requirement a breach of condition will normally lead to the refusal of a naturalisation application. As such, in practice, this part of the amendment is unnecessary.</p>

<a name="90302-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="0903028000150"></a>At the same time, however, we recognise that there may be circumstances, especially in the current economic climate, where economically productive migrants cease to be in employment for short periods and through no fault of their own. That is why Clause 37(7) gives us the discretion to waive this requirement in compelling circumstances. However, this is quite different from removing the requirement for a person who has come here to work to remain in employment continuously, which this amendment would allow and which would be completely inappropriate. I therefore hope that the noble Lord will feel sufficiently convinced not to press the amendments.</p>

<a name="90302-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="0903028000151"></a>Individuals can change employer. This condition is intended to ensure that an individual continually contributes to the United Kingdom economy while they are here, not that they have to be in the continuous employment of one employer. Domestic servants are not required to stay with the same employer but I take the point about references not being given. I also take the point that there are abusive employers of domestic servants. I am happy to take on board the point and, at the appropriate stage, at least explain in greater detail how this area will be dealt with. In principle, however, we do not consider that the Bill requires these amendments.</p>

I think that that needs to be very clear. Continuous employment&#151;not in domestic employment but generally&#151;has been seen in many cases in the courts as involving one employer. That point has been made by UNISON in particular, as the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, said. The Government need to be clear about it. Do they want the courts to

If I had to give an example, I would cite someone working for a company that goes bankrupt. If the person came in with skills and could soon obtain employment with another company that had not gone bankrupt and required those skills then that would not, as I understand it, be in breach of the proposed conditions. However, it might be wiser to put this in writing to ensure that the courts will accept that interpretation. As I understand it, the Government&#146;s intention is simply to ensure that we have continued employment and economic contributions from would-be migrants.</p>

I think that they have put their finger on a number of really important issues which have not been fully resolved in the discussion.</p>

<a name="90302-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="0903028000155"></a>When the Minister stood up and started talking about a clearer journey and clear requirements, I wondered whether he had been listening to us. This is totally unclear. We have no idea what the rules will be for determining whether a person has been in continuous employment or of how the discretion in subsection (7) that the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, has drawn our attention to is to be exercised. The Minister has thrown no light whatever on the Government&#146;s intentions. Before we get to Report, we must have more information about what is continuous employment within the meaning of the British Nationality Act 1981 and how the discretion to disregard it in subsection (7) is to be exercised.</p>

<a name="90302-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="0903028000156"></a>If the Minister really wants to be helpful, he ought to look at parallels such as the EEA regulations which contain definitions of continuous employment. The noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, has referred to cases in the courts. If we had common definitions of what is meant by continuous employment throughout the legislation, that simplification would be of great help to the lawyers, to those involved in casework and to the workers themselves. However, I suppose that that is a little too much to hope for.</p>

<a name="90302-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="0903028000157"></a>The Minister referred to the private domestic workers issue and I am grateful to him for promising to come back to us on that. However, under the Bill the migrant domestic worker has to remain in domestic service. They cannot leave domestic service and go into some other type of employment. When they are unfortunate enough to have an abusive employer, therefore, and do not get a reference, it will become virtually impossible for them to get another job in the same domestic sector. That is a fact of life. I hope, therefore, that we can find some means of allowing them to escape from this dilemma.</p>

Amendment 52ZA is concerned with the language requirement for citizenship. It has been drafted by the London office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Its purpose is to ensure that refugees and those with humanitarian protection or their family members are not disadvantaged by an inability to meet the language requirements because of the special circumstances of their situation and past history.</p>

<a name="90302-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="0903028000160"></a>The UNHCR points out that, before arriving in Britain, many refugees and protected persons will have fled from communities torn apart by conflict or persecution. They may have spent years in makeshift camps. They may have lived in remote areas with little available education, let alone access to English language training. I would add that some have suffered torture or other brutality, while others have a range of mental and physical needs, including dyslexia, speech problems and depression, all of which may make learning a new language difficult or impossible. We are considering a uniquely vulnerable group of people who differ markedly from young, healthy students or economic migrants. The group includes some full-time and part-time carers.</p>

<a name="90302-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="0903028000161"></a>The Minister will notice that this is essentially a permissive amendment. It gives the Secretary of State discretion to waive the requirement if, and only if, it would be unreasonable for it to be met. I therefore ask the Minister to accept this very modest amendment as it stands, or at the very least to say that he will take away the principle behind it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="0903028000162"></a>Amendment 61B also comes with the approval of the UNHCR. The high commission is concerned about the successful integration of refugees in the countries where they are recognised and accepted. The final solutions should not therefore be unnecessarily delayed. In particular, refugees should not be required to show that they were not in Britain in breach of the immigration laws at any time during the qualifying period for citizenship. The reason for this is simple. Article 31 of the 1951 convention prohibits states from imposing penalties on refugees on account of illegal entry or presence,</p>
<ul><a name="0903028000245"></a>&#147;provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="0903028000222"></a>I have quoted directly from the convention. Delaying the start of the qualifying period is a good example of a penalty. Britain helped to draft the convention and has ratified it, and is not entitled to opt out or make a reservation by means of one line in a very miscellaneous Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="0903028000163"></a>If his memory is exceptionally good, the noble Lord, Lord West, may recall that I wrote to him on 24 October last following a Written Question. I stated then that many genuine refugees fleeing persecution have no option but to travel on someone else&#146;s passport or on a forged document. Others may have entered illegally by stowing away or by some other desperate expedient. All will have committed technical breaches of immigration law or rules, but provided that they subsequently comply with the convention, they should not be penalised. I therefore commend this amendment to your Lordships and urge the Minister to accept it. If he wishes to argue that the paragraph in question applies to the totality of applicants for naturalisation, will he please arrange for a redraft which would specifically exempt recognised refugees? Any perfected amendment should probably also take account of Clause 37(2)(f), which is similar. I beg to move.</p>

I cannot understand why the burden of proof should shift on to refugees to satisfy the requirement that they were not at any time during the qualifying immigration period in the UK in breach of immigration laws. I also adopt the argument he adduced that it is impossible for the Government to opt out of their international obligations, which they are seeking to do by virtue of what is in the Bill. I ask the Minister to think again about the provisions in question. That would partially satisfy both my noble friend Lord Hylton and me. I hope he will not object to this issue. I ask the noble Lord who will reply to this debate to be reasonable.</p>

We have to go back to the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. Article 34 states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="0903028000238"></a>&#147;Contracting States shall as far as possible facilitate the assimilation and naturalisation of refugees. They shall in particular make every effort to expedite naturalisation proceedings and to reduce as far as possible the charges and costs of such proceedings&#148;.</p>

<a name="90302-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="0903028000166"></a>That is the declaration in the convention, which we are proud of supporting over so many years. As has already been stated, we should not try to opt out. We need to clarify some points, such as &#147;in special circumstances&#148;. What are these circumstances? When the new simplification Bill comes before us, there will possibly be some elaboration on this so that we know exactly what it is. Which circumstances does the Minister consider to be special? We have sometimes heard the answer that every case is considered on its own merits. However, it is sad that so often we have to battle to get a certain case across. We need an overview of this and to think about it in some depth. What are these special circumstances?</p>

It is frequently suggested, in arguments of this sort, that there is no possibility of the individual concerned being able to understand our language or the circumstances. I am reading <I>Africa </I>by Mr Richard Dowden, director of the Royal African Society, in which he remarks that there are plenty of Africans who, because of the number of languages that are spoken in Africa, are the masters of at least five languages. That statistic is somewhat embarrassing in the context of these islands. We should not be unduly derogatory about Africans&#146; capacity to pick up languages. That said, I understand what underlies these amendments.</p>

His amendment is very modest, as were the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis. Sub-paragraph (2)(f) is mean and unnecessary in the light of legislation passed over the 14 years that I have been a Member of this House, which has progressively excluded refugees at the point of entry and made life more difficult for them. The noble Lord has international experience and will appreciate the situation of many of these individuals. The subsection penalises not only migrants but also genuine refugees who have been forced to enter the country illegally. We have quarrelled again and again about passports and the necessity for destroying documents, and there are many genuine people in this country who have had to go through those hurdles.</p>

<a name="90302-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="0903028000171"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, said, the Government are on dangerous legal ground because states are obliged under Article 31 of the convention not to impose penalties on account of illegal entry. That is fairly straightforward. He also told us that Article 34 requires states to make every effort to expedite naturalisation. Having been stripped of their own citizenship, refugees surely have a strong moral claim to adoption by another state. The Bill as it stands takes them further away from the path of citizenship that the Government intend to lay for them and which we have heard so much about.</p>

Having listened to the arguments that have been made about the near, if not total, illegality of what is proposed, I agree that it must make sense for the Minister and the Government to reconsider this issue.

That is an absurd requirement and must be seen as such. The point has been made again and again about the awful plight of refugees and the way in which they have been persecuted over long periods of time. I hope that the Government will look at the whole issue and find a way that will extend flexibility.</p>

There was understandably no reply at Second Reading because the Minister had too many questions to reply to, but I hope that in his reply to these amendments the noble Lord will give a positive response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="0903028000174"></a>The UNHCR is a UN body and its comments should be taken seriously. These amendments have its support. In particular, the UNHCR briefing states that refugees should not be penalised for illegal entry and that any such penalty should not affect the qualifying period for naturalisation. We are talking here about refugees&#151;people who have fled from appalling circumstances&#151;and, as the noble Lord, Lord West, said in the Second Reading debate,</p>

<a name="90302-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="0903028000176"></a>One of the key principles of our proposals is that anyone who wishes to remain here permanently and become a British citizen must obey the laws, and those are not limited to those who commit criminal acts. We also say that such people should have relevant leave or entitlement to be here; those who do not should not be allowed to become a British citizen. This reinforces the fact that, as well as from the public, we have a right to demand the highest of standards from those who wish to remain here. It has been a long-standing requirement that a person must not be in breach of immigration laws. This is contained in existing criteria for naturalisation.</p>

<a name="90302-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="0903028000177"></a>It is worth mentioning here what it means to be in breach of immigration law. It applies to people who do not have a right of abode, do not have leave to enter or remain, do not have an entitlement to reside under the 2006 EEA regulations, do not fall under Section 8(1) of the Immigration Act 1971 for crew members and do not benefit from an exemption under Sections 8(2) to 8(4) of the same Act. We retain the discretion in Schedule 1 to the British Nationality Act 1981 to treat an applicant for naturalisation as fulfilling the requirement to not have been at any time in breach of immigration law, even though they may have been.</p>

<a name="90302-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="0903028000178"></a>I turn now to the narrower points covered also in Amendment 61B. On the question of language, the amendment would not add anything to the situation that exists. There is already an ability in paragraph 2(e) of Schedule 1 to waive the English language requirement if, because of the applicant&#146;s age or physical or mental condition, it would be unreasonable to expect him or her to meet the requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="0903028000181"></a>Additionally, the requirement does not apply to those aged over 65 or under 18. I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, that many of the people who come here have skills in several languages and that it is wrong to suggest that they will have great difficulty with the English language. However, it would be clearly an advantage for them to have the English language if they are to integrate and to be successful in our society.</p>

I notice that no one in any part of the Committee seemed to oppose them. I thank the Minister for what he has said. If I may attempt to summarise the reply, it was that the amendment about language is not strictly necessary. In that case, why can we not have it in the Bill? It would give an extra degree of clarity. With regard to the second amendment, on illegality and the qualifying period, it is encouraging that we are to have consideration and dialogue, but we need a little more than that.</p>

<a name="90302-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="0903028000188"></a>Regarding language, we need an assurance that discretion will normally be applied so as to disregard any such restriction as is mentioned in paragraph 1(1)(c) of Schedule 1 to the British Nationality Act 1981, in the special case of refugees with humanitarian protection and their families due to the circumstances of their situation. With regard to the second amendment, it would be helpful to have an assurance that penalisation for illegal entry in the case of refugees would not operate to reflect the qualifying immigration status period.

As I have said, we will continue to have discussions ahead of Report. With regard to the noble Lord&#146;s second amendment on the question of penalties for refugees, the Bill does not penalise them in that way. Their qualifying period does not start until they are granted leave as a refugee. Therefore, the requirement not to be in breach of immigration laws does not become relevant for naturalisation until later, when that period has begun&#151;in other words, beyond the point at which the status has been given. Furthermore, the requirement regarding breach of immigration law is about having the rights or the status to be in the UK, not about offences committed.

The effect of the amendment would be to widen the circumstances in which the Secretary of State could exercise discretion to weigh the need to fulfil particular requirements in respect of exceptional Crown services. In particular, it would remove the need for a person to be serving outside the United Kingdom at the time of the application in order to qualify for the discretion. As the discretion is specifically designed to be applied to Crown servants who are serving overseas, we do not consider that to be appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="0903028000193"></a>At the same time, by defining the broad parameters of the discretion as we propose, we provide for greater transparency, which we think will help Parliament. Further, I can advise the Committee&#151;and I hope that this starts to meet the points raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham&#151;that we would be likely to use the discretion when a Crown servant had demonstrated exceptional service by, for example, representing Her Majesty&#146;s Government in a senior position such as vice-consul, or by demonstrating service significantly above and beyond the call of duty that has directly benefited the United Kingdom and its interests.</p>

The naturalisation here is either through an Armed Forces case or one of exceptional Crown service: so far, we have had someone who might have been a vice-consul quoted. It would be very helpful&#151;before the Report stage, or as soon as possible&#151;if we could know exactly who it might encompass. Someone in the Armed Services who is not, by definition, part of this country might be exceptional. We have had the Gurkhas, for example; there must be others who, it is anticipated, could be in that category. I wonder who they are. Are these people who are serving, or who have been here for some reason and are now serving in the forces? What would they particularly need to have done in order for the Secretary of State to consider them for naturalisation?</p>

Amendment 55 is an alternative to the first, which would ensure that those who have made a claim for asylum or who are here on human rights grounds, and those claiming entitlement to exercise rights of free movement under European Community law, can count time spent in the UK prior to the determination of their application as part of the qualifying period, and that</p>

<a name="90302-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="0903028000203"></a>Let us think of a person who arrived in the UK, claimed asylum and was then granted temporary admission. However, their asylum claim was not dealt with for several months and was then refused on incorrect grounds. Although the person successfully appealed against the decision, they were not recognised as a refugee until several years had passed since their arrival. All the time that they had been in the UK, up to the point at which their refugee status was granted, they were on temporary admission, had complied with all the conditions of it and had not been in any breach of immigration laws. Nevertheless, under Clause 37 as it is currently drafted, their time in the UK awaiting the decision to recognise them as a refugee would not be allowed to be counted towards their qualifying period of citizenship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="0903028000204"></a>I would have thought that the Minister, having heard the debate on the previous amendment, of the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, to which many other noble Lords contributed, would have got the drift of the feeling of the Committee by now; namely, that that would be seen by us to be rather unfair. On that basis, I hope that he will consider this amendment favourably as it enhances the agenda of integration. I beg to move.</p>

Without repeating too much what has been said on previous amendments, I say that the country&#146;s support for the 1951 Geneva Convention certainly requires us to expedite the naturalisation process for refugees. Lengthening qualification periods for them in any way is surely a direct violation. It is vital, for example, that pending claims for asylum count towards the qualifying immigration status, so that refugees can begin to rebuild their lives as soon as they are granted asylum here. Although the amendment is yet another in this same sort of grouping, as the noble Baroness said, I hope that the Minister has picked up the general feeling around the Chamber that there is great unfairness, to put it mildly, in what is going on this Bill.</p>

I am pleased to be able say on this important issue not only that the points are recognised&#151;I thank noble Lords for raising them&#151;but also that I agree that the suggested amendments warrant further consideration. L Committee&#146;s agreement has been sought and obtained to table amendments which will partly cover these proposals, which we intend to move on Report.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_537"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column 537</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90302-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="0903028000207"></a>The amendments that I propose to table will ensure that the clauses give discretion to waive the requirement for qualifying immigration status for the whole of the qualifying period in relation to Section 6(1) and (2) of the British Nationality Act. Although it is not possible at this stage to give specific examples of where that discretion may be used, the expectation is that it would be used only in a limited number of cases, but would give the necessary flexibility to the system that we are creating.</p>

<a name="90302-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="0903028000208"></a>The Government remain fully committed to meeting their international obligations in respect of those fleeing persecution. However, we do not propose to go as far as permitting any time spent in detention, or on temporary admission, or temporary release where that is followed by a grant of qualifying leave, or any time spent pending an application for leave to remain in connection with an asylum, human rights or humanitarian protection claim, to count towards the qualifying period. This is in part because, in asylum cases, a decision is based on the prevailing circumstances at the time the case is considered&#151;some 60 per cent of cases are now dealt with in a six-month period&#151;in addition to taking into account the facts of the claim when originally made. For example, the fact that a person is recognised as a refugee does not always mean that he was so from the start. Events in the country of origin, fresh evidence or case law, or a finding on appeal could justify recognition after the initial application was made.</p>

<a name="90302-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="0903028000209"></a>I would advise noble Lords that leave granted outside the immigration rules will fall under the definition of temporary residence leave where it leads to a grant of probationary citizenship. As such, it would be unnecessary to make specific provision in the legislation for exceptional leave to remain to count towards qualifying immigration status.</p>

<a name="90302-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="0903028000210"></a>I hope that noble Lords will agree that a fuller debate on these amendments would be more appropriate. I look forward to bringing amendments to your Lordships&#146; attention on Report and hope that this amendment will be withdrawn.</p>

I will ask about one group of detentions that I think he will agree would have to be counted in whatever system he devises. I refer to cases where it is found that a person was detained unlawfully. I recall the case of a refugee from Cote d&#146;Ivoire who was detained for something like six months. I wrote to Beverley Hughes, who was then the Minister who dealt with immigration, no less than nine times, without getting a reply. In the end, when this person was released, she brought proceedings against the Government in the High Court and won damages of &#163;60,000. In a case of that kind, where the Government are plainly wrong and have had it drawn to their attention that they are detaining a person unlawfully, surely it would be unfair not to count the period that the person spends in unlawful detention towards the qualifying period.</p>

I am also encouraged by the Minister&#146;s reply. In order to facilitate the decision-making of those of us who support these amendments, when the Government are tabling their amendments, could they either give sufficient time for us to see them and respond through amendments if they need improvement, or write to us and tell us the contents of the amendments in good time for us to respond before Report?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="0903028000213"></a>Another point that was not made entirely clear to me concerns a case where the Border Agency has made a mistake, perhaps on the basis of misinformation. Someone could come as a skilled worker and then have their temporary leave curtailed because it is thought that they have not abided by the conditions. If they are then detained to be removed, but can prove that it was the agency&#146;s mistake rather than anything they had done, they might have their leave reinstated: we understand that. However, under Clause 37, they would be required to begin their path to citizenship all over again, because of the insistence that the qualifying immigration status has to apply throughout the qualifying period.</p>

<a name="90302-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="0903028000214"></a>In that case, the period of detention would not count as qualifying status, even though it would have been no fault of the person himself, and would in fact have been the fault of an agent of the Government. The Minister did not really cover that part of it; would he also dress that anomaly in future amendments?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09030216000002"></a>The trouble is that the Government have a bit of form on this. In 2006, they changed the highly skilled migrant programme and then applied it retrospectively, catching quite a number of people within those provisions, for some of them extending the time that they had to wait from four to five years and causing quite a lot of hardship as a result. It is important that this is made clear now. I go back to my comment at Second Reading that, if we are not clear about this and this is not done, many people who are in this country and are progressing on their way forward to citizenship, following all the rules that have been put before them, will be in that position of snakes and ladders. They will think that they are progressing at a good rate and doing the right things but will suddenly find themselves down at the bottom of the pile again and having to start all over.</p>

<a name="90302-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09030216000003"></a>This just needs a simple agreement from the Government that the provisions will be applied only as and when Royal Assent is achieved. That would make it very clear to anybody else in the process at the moment that they will proceed under the rules that pertain at the moment. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_147"></a>

It also provides us with a very useful opportunity to ask the Government on their intentions regarding people with limited leave to remain at that point. Those people will have planned their future lives on the basis of current legislation, which allows them to apply for indefinite leave to remain at the end of their period on temporary leave. If there are no fair transitional arrangements, they will be obliged to apply for probationary citizenship leave, extending the time that they have to spend on temporary leave and persuading many to defer the major life commitments that people undertake, such as starting a family or buying a house, and thus delaying the integration that is claimed to be one of the Government&#146;s main objectives.</p>

<a name="90302-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09030216000005"></a>I refer to a High Court case heard last year, dealing with changes to the scheme known as the highly skilled migrant programme, in which Judge Sir George Newman referred to the adoption of legitimate expectations. He said in conclusion that he was,</p>
<ul><a name="09030216000058"></a>&#147;satisfied that the terms of the original scheme should be honoured and that there is no good reason why those already on the scheme shall not enjoy the benefits of it as originally offered to them&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09030216000051"></a>That was the case involving HSMP Forum Ltd. If the Minister needs to look it up, its neutral citation number is 2008 EWHC 664. That judgment seems to me highly relevant to the amendment moved by the noble Baroness because the High Court found that the legitimate expectations of these highly skilled migrants under the previous scheme should have been honoured. As I understand it, the amendment would ensure that people who have entered with legitimate expectations should not be denied the privilege of remaining in that course of action.</p>

We are continuing our work in this area and hope to make a further announcement in the summer.

We want to ensure that they can proceed as they have been proceeding under the previous legislation. They should get their naturalisation and their citizenship under the rules that apply at the moment. I think that the Minister has said that transitional arrangements might apply to those people. I do not understand that, because it does not seem to make sense. I can understand that some people will apply between today and the commencement of Part 2 and may need transitional arrangements, but I am much more concerned that the people who are already in the system and are progressing their way through it should not be left in a situation where they have to start looking at Part 2 and finding that they cannot comply because they cannot do an activity, cannot speak Scottish and Welsh or cannot comply with other rules and are, therefore, trapped in a system that is changing in front of their eyes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09030216000017"></a>It is important that retrospection does not get caught up in this. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, cited a case that I have before me but did not worry the Committee with. That case left the Government looking not very clever, although I gather that they have been clever enough to manage not to implement the judgment. If this issue needs further clarity, I should be grateful for it, but I hope that I have been as clear as I can be about my concerns regarding those currently in the system and those who will apply before Part 2 commences and whether a different system will apply there. If there are to be transitional arrangement for the people currently in the system, I shall certainly return to this matter on Report.</p>

It probes the Government&#146;s intention as to the circumstances in which the Secretary of State would exercise his discretion and treat the person&#146;s relationship as subsisting. In addition, we wish to provide for the power to make regulations to lay down criteria as to when a person&#146;s relationship shall be treated as subsisting. Clear-cut cases are not subject to arbitrary discretion; however, it may be helpful if the Secretary of State retained some discretion to enable him to step in to help in exceptional cases.</p>

<a name="90302-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09030216000021"></a>Our concern in tabling these amendments is to protect the welfare of children and spouses where there is violence, neglect or abuse. The Committee may recall that we had a substantial debate on domestic violence the week before last. The House recognised at that time that domestic violence was widespread and we are concerned to cover in the Bill the unfortunate circumstances of people who might be caught up in that cycle of violence. It is, therefore, important that the adult from abroad without settled status is in a position to leave the other settled or British partner and, if appropriate, have responsibility for caring for the children, whatever their status. This means that the adult without settled status must not be treated as a person subject to immigration control and should, therefore, be able to access social security and tax credits.</p>

<a name="90302-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="09030216000022"></a>I realise that we will go into more detail on the status and rights of children when we get to Clause 51, but would the Minister like to comment in particular on the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child? The Children&#146;s Rights Alliance for England published a useful critique, which the Minister may have had a chance to look at, making a number of points about immigration and children. The circumstances of this amendment are pretty tight in that it would not, I hope, apply to many individuals, but it would mean that the Secretary of State had the discretion that we mentioned. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="90302-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09030216000024"></a>When we debated Clause 9 last week, I referred backwards to Clause 8, and especially Clause 8(2), which had also prompted comments by the Delegated Powers Committee. Those comments had embraced Clauses 9 and 10, as well as Clause 8. I was obviously not seeking to go backwards then but I indicated that, if the Government had not yet responded, I would return to the matter on Report. The noble Lord who responded for the Government on that occasion said that he was not aware of any reply and accepted the notice, but he later let us know that the Government had replied. I of course accept that my reference was taken from the third report of the Delegated Powers Committee, and the fourth report, which has not yet been published, will presumably contain the reply, but I cannot know whether that reply will resolve the matter. Exactly the same thing has happened with regard to Clause 38(2), which the Delegated Powers Committee has drawn to the attention of the House. I do not want to unsight the Government, so I shall return to this matter again&#151;in this case, on Report&#151;unless the Government&#146;s reply, which presumably by then will have been published, has resolved the matter satisfactorily.</p>

<a name="90302-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09030216000026"></a>Our position on Amendment 56A is that it is not necessary to specify in the Bill the circumstances in which a person will be treated as having a relevant family association on the date of application for naturalisation, even though the association had ceased to exist before that date. Clause 38 contains a power for the Secretary of State to apply discretion in cases where a relevant family association may have ceased before the date of the application and nevertheless allow a person to be naturalised, despite them not being able to meet this requirement. The Secretary of State is provided with the power to use this discretion flexibly in exceptional circumstances and in respect of the specific circumstances of a case.</p>

<a name="90302-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="09030216000027"></a>We do not wish to set down in regulations particular classes of cases where the discretion will normally be used, as the expectation is that discretion will be applied only in exceptional circumstances. We will, however, set down in advance, and make publicly available, guidance regarding the circumstances in which this discretion may be applied.</p>

<a name="90302-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="09030216000028"></a>The noble Baroness raised a question concerning the rights of the child, but I have to confess that I am not currently in a position to provide the information that she wants. As she rightly said, that matter will be part of the debate on a later amendment and later clause. I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

It is crucial, if we get to the end of the period and a relationship has broken down for whatever reason, to know how that discretion will be exercised. We are completely in the dark, as so often with the Bill.</p>

<a name="90302-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="09030216000030"></a>I have lost count of the number of times when the Minister has assured us that guidance will be published and that we will get it in good time, no doubt before Report. Your Lordships are supposed to be discussing the matter in Committee. If we have to wait until Report, it is a bit late to make any alterations or suggest ways in which the Government could improve the guidance, assuming that we have seen it by then. This is a very unsatisfactory way of discussing a Bill of any kind, but especially one that affects the human rights of vulnerable people, as this Bill does. I regret that the Minister has had to keep on getting up to tell us that guidance will be published and that we will see it sooner or later.</p>

On this occasion, perhaps I may say that we are clear that a person who wants to be naturalised under Section 6(2) should demonstrate that they have a relevant family association. However, we recognise that in some cases, limited cases, that connection may have ended, and it would be wrong to refuse an application for citizenship because of that. As I said, we expect that that discretion will be used only in exceptional cases. However, an example where we might apply it&#151;this is the obvious one&#151;would be where a person is bereaved shortly before the qualifying period was due to be completed.</p>

Under the Bill, an additional provision is added that he must have spent the whole of that period in a relevant family association, the definition of which is again to be prescribed in regulations that we have not yet seen under Section 41 of the BNA and, therefore, as I understand it, not subject to parliamentary scrutiny. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I think that the power under Section 41 does not provide for either negative or affirmative resolution of Parliament but is at the absolute discretion of the Secretary of State.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09030216000039"></a>Presumably, the Government are concerned with people who use the marriage or civil partnership route as a device to gain entry into the United Kingdom without having a genuine relationship. There have been many allegations in the past about bogus enforced marriages for precisely that purpose. According to the Home Affairs Select Committee in another place, the Government&#146;s Forced Marriage Unit deals with 5,000 inquiries and 300 cases of forced marriage each year. To quote from the summary of the committee's report,</p>
<ul><a name="09030216000059"></a>&#147;marriage visas are still being granted in cases where the visa sponsor has been forced into marriage and compelled to sponsor the visa. Victims are being failed by the lack of a mechanism consistently to refuse entry to the UK in cases where an individual has been forced into marriage, and this failure is compounded by the absence of a mechanism by which the Government can accept information from third parties on reluctant sponsors. We recommend that visa sponsors are interviewed where there is suspicion of a forced marriage, including where suspicion is raised through information provided by third parties. We also recommend that the Government attach a power of refusal without the need for an evidential statement to visa applications in the case of reluctant sponsors&#148;.</ul>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90302-0008.htm"/>


<a name="90302-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="09030216000040"></a>It seems to us that far more should have been done in the past to check the bona fides of applicants for marriage or partnership visas. To wait for three years to see whether the relationship has continued, as we will do under the Bill, is entirely the wrong approach. The resources intended to be used to check that partners are still together at the end of the three years would be far better deployed in improving checks on sponsors in the first place.</p>

<a name="90302-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09030216000041"></a>In their response to the Select Committee, the Government increased the age at which someone can sponsor or be sponsored as a spouse from 18 to 21. They agreed to improve their current system for investigating allegations of abuse of the marriage route and to ensure that information and advice is available to sponsors, including awareness of the Forced Marriage Unit, by December 2008, and they promised to set out their approach to selective interviewing of sponsors. Can the Minister give us an update on those developments and tell us whether they have made any difference to the 40,000 marriage visas awarded in 2007? It is probably a bit early, but if he can tell us the number of marriage visas awarded in 2008, that will be interesting. What difference do the Government expect the new conditions to make at the end of the three years to the number who will apply for citizenship?</p>

<a name="90302-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09030216000042"></a>On Amendment 63, the definition of relevant family association appears not to include dependent relatives. Are they to be covered under the Section 41 regulations? If so, why were they not mentioned in the Explanatory Notes, which lift the curtain only a little by giving the example of a partner? Will the Minister say why the dependent relative, having put in an appearance in Clause 31 of the draft partial Bill, has now disappeared without trace? Amendment 63 ensures that the migrants whose UK partners have a right of abode in the UK or have acquired a permanent entitlement to reside in the UK under European law can apply for citizenship on the same basis as if the UK partner was a British citizen or had permanent residence.</p>

<a name="90302-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="09030216000043"></a>We need to ask the Minister about the Government&#146;s intentions regarding the right of abode, which the partial Bill proposed to remove altogether. I recognise

I offer the list that comprises the relevant family associations that count. I have to say that the exact content of the regulations is yet to be determined, but we are considering whether to include the following groups: unmarried and same-sex partnerships of British citizens and permanent residents; bereaved spouses and civil partners; unmarried and same-sex partners of British citizens and permanent residents; victims of domestic violence of British citizens and permanent residents; dependent relatives of British citizens and permanent residents; and persons exercising access to rights to a child&#146;s residency in the UK.</p>

<a name="90302-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="09030216000045"></a>The regulations are likely to include other conditions recognising unmarried partners if they have been in a relationship for two years, which is the normal term&#151;we do not intend to change it. When the regulations are presented they will be subject to the negative resolution procedure. We are clear that forced marriage is an abhorrent crime and that the Government will do everything we can to stamp it out and support victims.

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="09030216000046"></a>The principles behind the Bill&#146;s proposals are to provide three separate routes and therefore we require people to pass through these stages as I have indicated. These are the key principles that underline it. We have said that migrants who come here have to work, but we also want to take care of the exceptions in those circumstances we expect in terms of discretion. I regret to say that I have to fall back again on writing to the noble Lord. As I have said, the consultation continues on what will be the guidance subject to the negative procedures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="09030216000048"></a>The Government have been giving serious consideration to further measures following the sixth report of the Select Committee in another place on forced marriages. We are grateful for what it has done so far and I was glad to hear what the noble Lord said about the seriousness with which the Government take the question of forced marriages. It would be useful, however, to

I refer to raising the age from 18 to 21; the improvement of the current system for investigating allegations of the marriage route; and, particularly, ensuring that advice and information is available to sponsors, including awareness of the Forced Marriage Unit. The Select Committee promised that it would respond by December 2008. The noble Lord might have had some news on the matter, but if further measures are being contemplated that would reduce the number of forced marriages, I would be glad to hear about them. However, it does not prevent me insisting that the real solution to forced marriages is to have more thorough vetting of the applications and, in particular, of the knowledge of them by sponsors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09030216000049"></a>I was flabbergasted to learn that because of the number of visa applications&#151;they amounted to 40,000 in 2007&#151;no regular interviewing of sponsors was carried out to find out whether they were genuine and intending to marry the person concerned. There has been considerable abuse of this route and there have been repeated assurances by Secretaries of State going back to Mr David Blunkett some years ago that there was to be a clampdown and all measures that could be taken to avoid forced marriages had been accomplished, yet every time we have a new Bill, fresh measures are announced.</p>

May I at the outset declare my interest as chair of the England Volunteering Development Council, which is part of Volunteering England? I have been briefed by Volunteering England and also by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants.</p>

<a name="90302-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09030230000004"></a>There are considerable concerns about the requirement, some of which have been expressed in the House this afternoon. Volunteering England is a member of the design group. We are not going to do anything about the design group this afternoon, but it is apparently drawing up the regulations which will govern this aspect. We do not have the regulations before us and therefore we have no idea how the design group is designing what it means by &#147;activity&#148;. I know that Volunteering England has taken a major part in this, but it has also put forward some of its concerns to the meetings. However, the legislation is here and now and we need to deal with some of the anxieties that have been raised, otherwise opportunities to do so will fade away.</p>

<a name="90302-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09030230000005"></a>Volunteering is by definition an undertaking that individuals want to do: they want to do it to help others. It is not usual&#151;in fact, I think it is probably unheard of&#151;for it to be a statutory requirement, or one that affects people's future, but that is what it would be under Clause 39. It is there to expedite the route to citizenship. It is blackmail, to some extent, in that by undertaking a voluntary activity you get citizenship somewhat quicker. However, to do that, individuals will have to undertake either community or voluntary work. It begs a number of questions that might have been answered if the design group had completed its work; but it has not.</p>

<a name="90302-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09030230000006"></a>In 2007, according to Home Office figures, there were 160,980 applications for British citizenship. There were 164,635 grants of British citizenship in that year. If we extrapolate those figures, we can presume that even if the regulations for citizenship are tightened up, there will be about 160,000 people wandering around trying to do voluntary work. There are 190,000 registered charities and probably just as many small unregistered ones which may or may not have to be licensed to undertake or help with this voluntary activity.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_551"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column 551</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90302-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="09030230000007"></a>People coming into this country and wanting citizenship all have a very firm view of why they want to be here. But how many of them will know or understand about voluntary service? How many of them will know or understand what they should be doing? How many of them will know or understand how to go about it? And how will they then find those volunteering opportunities? Aspiring citizens may not have any idea where to look for volunteering opportunities in an area.</p>

<a name="90302-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09030230000008"></a>What will be the mechanism by which they are guided or advised on how to undertake this requirement? How much leeway will be given in the amount of time they have to do this work when they are working to keep themselves in this country? They are actually working. They may have a family to support and manage, and they may well have very limited hours to spend outside their home. Many are already working all the hours God gave them to ensure that they meet other citizenship requirements.</p>

<a name="90302-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09030230000009"></a>What is the time commitment they will have to give to this activity requirement in order to qualify for and justify their expedited citizenship? What about those who simply cannot undertake it, such as those working for a very substantial part of the day and those with families? Will there be an exemption for certain categories? If so, who will give it?</p>

<a name="90302-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09030230000010"></a>Who will monitor the voluntary work that is carried out, and how will it be assessed and proved? I understand that part of the system which the design group is working out is that there will be a referee to complete the applicant&#146;s paperwork. But who is that to be, and how can there be confidence that such a referee will have proper and regular direct contact with a volunteer to be able to judge whether they have in fact carried out the activity to the proper, required level? Where will the referees come from, and will they have to have a certain seniority level? These questions will continue. They should have been answered before we started on this legislation.</p>

<a name="90302-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09030230000011"></a>We have reason to believe that a nationality checking service will play a role in signing off the volunteer and sending those signed-off papers to the UK Border Agency. But where does this come from? It is not in the legislation&#151;we do not know anything about it. Perhaps we could be told at some stage what it is. Have the Government made any attempt to assess what extra burdens carrying out the responsibility for these migrants will place on the voluntary sector and on local authorities, which I understand are also to be involved in supporting the nationality checking service?</p>

<a name="90302-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09030230000012"></a>Can the Minister give any assurances about the stage at which this activity is likely to be undertaken during the citizenship process? Can it be at any time? Does it have to be part of the probationary period? Can it be undertaken for a short time, or a long time? For how many hours should it be undertaken? What is the expectation? Will childcare be paid for? What about travel and all the other costs associated with volunteering requirements, and will that be funded by the UK Border Agency? Given that employees are statutorily entitled to a minimum of 24 days a year, how can the Government be sure that that requirement  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_552"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column 552</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for this activity will not have to be taken out of those 24 and therefore not breach this legal entitlement? Will employers be required to give these employees time off to undertake this voluntary activity without jeopardising their employment?</p>

<a name="90302-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09030230000013"></a>These questions are only the tip of the iceberg&#151;there are many more. Presumably the design group will try to answer them. We can brief the Minister on any other aspect he wishes. This enormous proposal is dealt with in just two short lines of legislation, with nothing to back it up.</p>

<a name="90302-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09030230000014"></a>The Minister must understand that this would be the first national scheme in which the state directly rewarded people for volunteering. The design group is clearly important in ensuring that all the problems which I have outlined are overcome. However, when will we have sight of its work? I am advised that it might not be until the summer, but by then this legislation will be on the books and it will be way past Parliament's ability to deal with it. Ideally, we should be able to see what the design group is doing before Report so that we can consider it. This is another area where a letter might be almost too little to explain all that is going on. I hope the Minister can make a good fist of trying to explain it. I beg to move.</p>

I spent the past two Sundays taking part in voluntary activities: delivering leaflets for the Liberal Democrats in Huddersfield on the first Sunday and delivering leaflets for the Liberal Democrats in Streatham on the second Sunday. I am not sure whether that is the sort of voluntary activity that counts under this provision. I can assure noble Lords that we are a non-profit organisation; we are usually loss-making. I raise the point simply to illustrate the problem of defining voluntary activities.</p>

<a name="90302-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="09030230000016"></a>The provision raises a huge number of issues. I have been involved in other discussions, for example on whether we can resolve the issue of students overstaying in Britain by licensing educational institutions so that we have a clearer sense of where students applying to study in Britain are going. We have consistently been told that it is far too complicated to license educational institutions, so controls on each student have to be imposed. We are talking now about licensing a huge number of charities, with full CRB checks on people on a truly vast scale. I am a trustee of two charities and, as both deal with teaching music to children, CRB checks are a major preoccupation for both. Despite the fact that as a trustee I do not usually meet the children, I had to be CRB-checked as well.</p>

<a name="90302-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09030230000017"></a>This provision has a huge number of implications. We on these Benches have some sympathy with the government citizenship agenda, although we are not sure we would go all the way down the road as far as Jack Straw&#146;s rights and responsibilities agenda. We recognise this is all part of that. We are highly doubtful, however, whether it is right to introduce one bit of this in one Bill before we have seen the entire discussion. The citizenship agenda needs active discussion across the parties on how we are going to re-define British

It needs to be taken slowly and gently. We on these Benches, therefore, are not at all sure that this is the right place to introduce one small part of a very large number of issues.</p>

<a name="90302-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09030230000018"></a>Citizenship is something we want people to engage in. References and recommendations are part of it. I have been to citizenship ceremonies. I recognise the importance of encouraging people to have a sense of identification with the United Kingdom. The danger is that a highly bureaucratic process in which compulsory volunteering, so to speak, is built in, all checked by the central state, will be a very complicated road to go down. We need to see much more than we have yet seen about how it might be implemented, how much it might cost, and how many difficulties and costs it will impose upon voluntary organisations and charities which will be engaged in this before we are happy with the direction in which it is going.</p>

UNISON, in its briefing, understandably asks whether trade union activities are part of voluntary activities. I would expect this Government to say yes, but it is interesting that UNISON feels that it needs to ask that question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09030230000020"></a>The point about the CRB is extremely valid. CRB checks take up a vast amount of time. Some of the most important work done currently in the voluntary sector is not only with children but also with vulnerable adults. You have to be CRB checked to work with vulnerable adults. If you do not have a CRB check, that cuts out a huge part of voluntary activities. How on earth is the Government going to monitor them? Are they going to list those that are acceptable and those that are not? This seems an interesting and in some ways rather charming idea, but one that is almost impossible effectively to implement.</p>

Surely, at this stage, we want to discuss some of the principles of activities, which are to be applauded, to integrate people into society. In a few moments, I will be moving Amendment 83 specifically concerning trade unions. I will not, therefore, make that speech now. Noble Lords who have spoken, such as the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, and the distinguished noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, are asking questions that will surely have to be clarified at some stage, but the idea that we should remove the whole thing lock, stock and barrel at this stage seems wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09030230000022"></a>UNISON has been mentioned. My noble friend Lord Morris of Handsworth will correct me if I am wrong, but the Transport and General Workers&#146; Union several years ago started a group.

<a name="90302-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09030230000023"></a>The principle here is very challenging. It is certainly absolutely relevant to some of the nightmares that people are always describing for the future, whether it is Islamicisation or some horror story that some people want to attach to that, or any such worries. How will they be addressed? They will be addressed by activities that integrate people into one society. That surely is not a principle that we can run away from and throw out of the window the first time that it is mentioned. More work needs to be done. I will be opposing this amendment if, as I suspect, it is designed to get rid of the whole idea.</p>

We would all agree with that. Having said that, I would like to strongly support what my noble friend Baroness Hanham said in her introductory remarks. I just about restrain myself from wishing to return to the meat on the bone of the nonsense in terms of formal logic of anything that is compulsory, or semi-compulsory, or quasi-compulsory or opt-in being in any sense voluntary. I am sorry to use such an indelicate word as &#147;nonsense&#148; in your Lordships&#146; House&#151;I know that it offends the ears of many of your Lordships&#151;but I do recognise a nonsense, particularly a nonsense on stilts, when I see one.</p>

<a name="90302-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09030230000025"></a>I would like to expand on one point that my noble friend Lady Hanham raised, which is the burden on voluntary charitable organisations, the third sector or call them what you will, at a time when many such organisations are suffering from a host of problems. Some have made unwise investments and have found their investment income, because of Icelandic adventures and so on, falling like a stone. Still more are seeing their charitable income falling. Understandably, some would say, because of the plight of the unemployed and others who feel that they are threatened by the prospect of unemployment, people may no longer be able to meet those standing orders that they have been giving so willingly. It is the hope of all us, however, that we will be able to continue to help voluntary organisations. We know that some voluntary organisations are laying off staff or failing to fulfil employment beyond a certain period under employment legislation. As my noble friend Lady Hanham said, should the Government have their way, a considerable burden will fall on voluntary organisations.</p>

<a name="90302-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09030230000026"></a>I have a straightforward question for the Minister. It will cost money to these voluntary organisations and charities to carry out some of this monitoring. That goes without saying. Some people who may have been dragooned into volunteering may be disinclined to do it seriously. We see this with community service from time to time. Will each volunteer, whether wholehearted or semi-wholehearted, be carrying with them in the pursuit of citizenship a sum of money that will be a subvention to voluntary or charitable organisations&#151;the third sector&#151;to allow them to meet this burden that is suddenly going to be laid on them by statute without any recompense?</p>

I have seen some of the questions. They are the equivalent of &#147;How high is Mount Snowdon?&#148;. These are questions about things that some people know about and others do not. We have to make sure that, when we test a person&#146;s background knowledge, it is relevant to the lives that they are going to lead here in the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="90302-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09030230000028"></a>We also talked about language a little while ago. If people want to settle in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland&#151;places other than England&#151;the background must be about the localities in which they actually want to live. I am sure that the people of Llandudno would love to know more about Oxfordshire or somewhere like that, but it is more important that they know a wee bit about their own area. This is my first point: people need to know the background of the place in which they will be living and not be made to answer questions of the type found in Trivial Pursuit.</p>

<a name="90302-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09030230000029"></a>Secondly, on the question of volunteering, I agree that this must be thought through fully. It needs to be taken back to the drawing board. Who is going to volunteer, or is it going to be like one organisation that I know of&#151;it shall remain nameless&#151;part of which is moving to another area of the United Kingdom? The organisation wants its people to integrate into the local community. For two weeks each year, people are going to be encouraged to volunteer. But that organisation is going about that by asking local groups what help is needed in the particular area. Instead of someone volunteering, information about requirements is put forward by local organisations and the organisation responds to that information.</p>

<a name="90302-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09030230000030"></a>We are asking a lot of the migrants who are seeking to come here. They must do what 80 per cent of the people of the United Kingdom do not do. We are asking them to know about things that most of the people of the UK do not know about. What I am saying, therefore, is this: yes, it is a nice dream&#151;someone said that it is a charming idea, and it is&#151;but it needs to be thoroughly worked out so that people know exactly where they are. We do not want something that is a dream for the immigration authorities becoming a nightmare for those applying for status here.</p>

I am not sure that the explanation given at Second Reading and in the debate so far is all that clear. I start from the position that we ought all to want to be volunteers in our communities&#151;they are our communities and we have ownership of them, so we should make a contribution. It is about enhancing an individual&#146;s contribution and building up what I would describe as social capital in our communities. However, we need to dissect the principles of volunteering, building social capital and making opportunities for those who want to settle well in their local communities.</p>

<a name="90302-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09030230000032"></a>However, I question why there has to be a penalty for those who do not volunteer or take advantage of the opportunities offered by this form of fast-tracking to full citizenship. If criteria involving penalties are

Someone has to determine whether the quantitative and qualitative value has been sufficiently met. Again, there is an eerie silence around some of these fundamental questions.</p>

<a name="90302-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09030230000033"></a>There are also issues around responsibility, whether fiduciary or otherwise. What happens if there is an accident on a volunteering project or expectations for a proposal are not met in qualitative terms? These matters require consideration, but more important is that they require consultation. At this point I am not satisfied that the proposition as a principle is worthy of support and consideration because it has not been sufficiently thought through in the detail of its application. I would certainly want to seek to persuade the Minister to look again not just at the principle but at the detail and some of the inherent problems for which solutions to the satisfaction of your Lordships&#146; House have not yet been found.</p>

The concept of taking part in social activities as an aid to integration is clearly a good one, but there is such a fog of uncertainty surrounding it at present that we need time to think it through and see if it can be done. Will we be able to include trades union activities, party-political work and so on? We need to be able to get the right exemptions for the disabled, for example, or for those caring for disabled people. I agree strongly with the noble Lord, Lord Patten, about the problems facing voluntary organisations, so I urge the Government to postpone the whole idea at least until after the simplification Bill that we have been promised. If that could be done, I think that we will get much better results from it.</p>

Thankfully, volunteering has become much more respected in terms of how we view offering mutual help to other citizens. However, I go back to the question that I raised at Second Reading. This amendment raises many questions, several of which have been rehearsed already. How costly will the scheme be and what financial provision is to be made available for it?</p>

<a name="90302-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09030230000037"></a>I am worried about what could be regarded as the reward of a reduction in the qualifying period for citizenship, or indeed the penalty, whichever way you want to look at it. If, as someone suggested, we are returning to a period when many people are out of work, it may be that the answer is compulsory volunteering in the form of national service, as it used to be called. That could be on the agenda for everyone. If that was the case, I would be much keener on supporting this, as it would not create two distinct classes of citizenship. Until we reach the point where we think that this is essential to our understanding of what it is to be a British citizen&#151;about rights and responsibilities, both terms with which I agree&#151;I remain unenthusiastic. On top of that, we have to consider how little we know

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09030230000038"></a>What I am really saying is that I query whether it is even remotely the right route to go down for those who are trying to acquire citizenship.

As was explained to us when we had one of our helpful discussions with the Minister, many of the activities would be purely local so that local churches and voluntary organisations would be enlisted to provide the occupations. How will the individual migrant access those bodies?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09030230000040"></a>To take my own area of Camberwell, there are millions&#151;or certainly dozens&#151;of voluntary groups operating in the area. It would be difficult enough for even a well-disposed local person who knew the ropes to discover which particular voluntary organisation fitted his own aptitudes and talents, let alone somebody from the Democratic Republic of Congo who is unfamiliar with our environment. How does he begin to discover which voluntary activities would be acceptable for qualifying? Will there be a central organisation with a list of them? What advice will be available to the individual migrant, so that he does something that is within his own aptitudes and talents? I ask the Minister a specific question: will this simply be left to the existing organisations&#151;in, say, Camberwell&#151;or will there be a central point to which the migrant has access, which will offer him useful advice on the sort of work that would fit his aptitudes and take him on the path to being an integral part of the community?</p>

If there is one issue that really fires up this House, it is volunteering. If the Government get it wrong, they will find themselves in a very small minority in the Lobby. They have to take great care over this. I admire the noble Lord, Lord Lea, for batting in support of his Front Bench, but the noble Lord, Lord Morris, has hit the nail much more firmly on the head. The only new thought that I can offer&#151;because everything has been said&#151;is that the Minister could just consider that what is on somebody&#146;s curriculum vitae is surely much more reliable. This could be translated into legislation, but volunteering will never work if it is required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09030230000043"></a>I need to read the comment of the Delegated Powers Committee&#146; on Clause 39(3), to provide the background. It said:</p>

<ul><a name="09030230000093"></a>&#147;inserted in Section 41(1) of the 1981 Act by clause 39(2), confers power to substitute different qualifying periods in new paragraph 4B(3) and (4), again by affirmative regulations; and the new subsection (1B) (clause 39(3)) enables that power to be exercised so as to substitute the same qualifying period, irrespective of whether or not &#145;the activity condition&#146; is satisfied. Paragraphs 46 to 49 of the department&#146;s memorandum&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="09030230000072"></a>which is reprinted in the third report of the Delegated Powers Committee&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09030230000094"></a>&#147;do not provide any explanation of the purpose of this power, the exercise of which would leave paragraph 4B making separate but identical provision for persons who had, and for persons who had not, satisfied &#145;the activity provision&#146;, without any advantage conferred on the former over the latter in terms of the qualifying period. While the delegated power in clause 39(3) might not necessarily be inappropriate on that ground, its exercise would seem to produce a somewhat odd result which is not explained in either the Notes or the memorandum. We&#148;&#151;</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09030230000046"></a>I am not seeking tonight to unsight the Minister on this Delegated Powers Committee reference, but he said on Clause 38(2) that he had the government reply with him then.

The Second Reading debate on this activity requirement was also most interesting. I apologise to the Chamber for not having been here to speak at Second Reading. I am more sympathetic to what the Government are trying to achieve than most speakers today. It boils down to three central matters. First, there are those who oppose incentives for volunteering per se, and who feel that any kind of incentive obviates the very nature of the deed. I would call them the volunteering purists. The Minister must make clear in his reply that we are talking about an incentive, and not compulsion. Many noble Lords have talked about volunteering as if it were a compulsion or requirement. It would be helpful if the Minister could confirm my reading, which is that there is just an incentive to get you there slightly faster than if you did not volunteer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09030230000048"></a>Secondly, there are those who believe, as my noble friend Lord Roberts does, that it is quite unfair for us to ask others to do what British people do not do themselves. My answer, as someone who has been on both sides of that fence, is very clear. Those who, through an accident of birth, end up with the privilege of British citizenship are indeed lucky. It is true that  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_559"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column 559</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we do not question their ability to integrate. One of the reasons that we do not question that ability is because we suspect that&#151;over a lifetime of living in certain communities, speaking a certain language and understanding certain cultural norms and mores&#151;they probably imbibe some of the values of that society.</p>

<a name="90302-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09030230000049"></a>Thirdly, the noble Lord, Lord Morris, spoke of social capital and trust. I have a lot of sympathy with much that he said, as long as what the Government aim to do is not seen as a means of affirming a certain patriotism, which I would also oppose. The Putnam report clearly shows that the more diverse a society is, the more trust seems to break down. This is a contested area, but no doubt the less we know about each other, the less we speak each other&#146;s languages and the less we value each other&#146;s values, the less we are able to trust each other. The building of networks that volunteering promotes is valuable social capital. However, British people do not have to go down that route and we are setting a higher bar for non-British people. I have said to the noble Lord, Lord West, under different circumstances and on other Bills about youth justice, that young people need to have more of an ethos anyway to do what is right by society and to understand the society in which they are living. Intergenerational issues could be much resolved if young people were to do a little more volunteering, frankly. I would like to see the expansion of this process to British people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09030230000050"></a>The most serious point is that there are many who believe that the practicalities of this will be difficult to achieve and that we really have not thought it through. I am most sympathetic to those arguments. Incidentally, I do not agree that just because no other country does it Britain should not do it. Perhaps I am a radical liberal for that reason. It is quite interesting that there is good, serious thinking around some of the challenges of diversity that we face. We have become more diverse in the past 15 to 20 years than many other similarly sized European countries. I take pride in the fact that we are not responding with sledgehammers in the way that some of those other countries have responded, at least not in the challenges facing my community. It is good that we have been careful and thoughtful about what we have done there. Irrespective of how I feel about terrorism legislation, on the whole we have a good track record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09030230000051"></a>Perhaps I can persuade the Minister, in all good will and in appreciating what the Government are trying to achieve on integration, to perhaps take away the wise words of the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, and the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, and perhaps think about bringing back pilot schemes. I accept the difficulties of a pilot scheme in which there is no real incentive to give, but perhaps we could see how a couple of pilots work and then come back with another Bill containing a more carefully thought through and considered approach as to how we might achieve this objective.</p>

<a name="90302-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09030230000053"></a>I start from the premise that we have described to people why we are doing what we are doing and then deal with the battery of questions about whether it is practical, how are we going to do it and whether we have thought it through. First, we are doing it because we want to integrate migrants fully into society. The advantage of what we are seeking to do is that it will bring contact between migrants and the wider community; it will show British citizens that those who seek to join them are earning their citizenships by participating in British life; and it will encourage those who want to become citizens by opening up to them new experiences and life-long rules. Active citizenship is a positive process: it is a way for migrants to earn citizenship more quickly and it will assist their integration into British society. Its purpose is to incentivise a positive attitude towards Britain. My noble friend Lord Morris feels it will do the opposite. I am pleased to note that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, concurs with that view. As he said in his contribution at Second Reading:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a><a name="09030230000095"></a>&#147;A credit-based system for acquiring citizenship is in principle a good thing, because it makes clearer that becoming a citizen carries with it responsibilities, not just the ability to stand in a shorter queue at Heathrow. For those reasons, it seems right to be able to change the length of that journey through participating in the community in a stronger and more active way&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 11/2/09; col. 1146.]</p>

<p><a name="09030230000073"></a>I think there will be a large degree of support for the things I have said so far. However, the questions that came forward were very much in relation to where we go from here.</p>

<a name="90302-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09030230000054"></a>Let me be absolutely clear: there is no mandatory requirement for any migrant to undertake active citizenship; migrants who are unwilling to undertake any form of active citizenship can simply choose not to do so. They are not prevented from qualifying for citizenship but it will take two years longer than for those who choose to undertake citizenship activities. We have been careful in developing the citizenship activities proposals in such a way that they do not discriminate against any person or group.</p>

<a name="90302-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09030230000055"></a>It is essential that the activities that count are separate from those that migrants undertake as part of their day-to-day employment. Therefore we propose that participation in prescribed activities will count only when it is unpaid, which answers a number of noble Lords&#146; questions about what they see as potential problems. We clearly want as many migrants as possible to undertake active citizenship. However, we recognise that in certain circumstances&#151;for example, in the case of the severely disabled&#151;a migrant may simply be unable to undertake any of the citizenship activities. That is why the Bill allows regulations to be made which treat specific types of persons as having fulfilled the activity conditions even though they have not. Therefore Amendment 83A is not necessary.</p>

<a name="90302-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09030230000056"></a>It is essential that the activities that count as active citizenship represent an extra effort to get involved in the community and are additional to those activities that migrants undertake as part of their day-to-day employment. Hence the prescribed activities will count  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_561"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column 561</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>only where they are unpaid. At the same time, we have made it clear that active citizenship must be designed so that migrants, even where they have significant commitments&#151;for example, work or family-related activities, which were a concern mentioned in the debate&#151;will be able to fulfil the requirements. That is why it is right that people should be able to demonstrate their willingness to participate at any point from the start of the journey&#151;not from the start as a probationary citizen but from the start of the qualifying period; in other words, from the five years preceding it.</p>

<a name="90302-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09030230000057"></a>We have permitted a wide range of activities to ensure that migrants can utilise their particular skills and interests&#151;that is why Amendment 82 is not appropriate&#151;and we have established a design group. This involves local authority and voluntary sector representatives advising us on the practical operation of active citizenship. This is because we want to avoid some of the words used in the debate to describe it, such as &#147;bureaucratic&#148; and &#147;dragooning&#148;. We want to see a level of commitment that we should expect migrants to demonstrate and we will work with the design group to ensure that active citizenship proposals are implemented in a fair and non-discriminatory way.</p>

<a name="90302-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09030230000058"></a>All the questions asked have been perfectly fair. In responding to some of them, it would be quite helpful to recognise that this is still work in progress. To reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, I should say that when the design group has completed its work and we have a formal picture of what it has designed for active participation, that will be subject to an affirmative resolution of the House. So it is not that the House will not have a clear sight of it and an ability to object.</p>

<a name="90302-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09030230000059"></a>I placed a document in the Library last week which I hope the Committee will find helpful&#151;I know that the spokesmen on the Opposition Front Benches have seen it&#151;which outlines the emerging findings of the design group. Again, it covers and meets, at least partially, many of the questions noble Lords have been asking about the type of activities involved and the type of organisations that will be required to be both the referee and the monitor. The list is not yet exhaustive; it can be added to. Any suggestions that people have will be referred to the design group for its consideration, but it already covers volunteering at local museums, conservation work, local environment protection and improvement projects, lunch clubs for the elderly&#151;there is a whole series of examples of what might be suitable.</p>

<a name="90302-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09030230000060"></a>We have also set out in that document a Q&amp;A, which I recommend people should digest because it goes some way to answering the questions that have been posed today. It is not complete but, when it is, it will outline the work of those closely associated with the organisation of the volunteering to which we are looking forward. I take the point made by a number of noble Lords. The noble Lord, Lord Patten, imagined that we would be walking round with bagfuls of money. I will have to disabuse him of that.</p>

<a name="90302-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09030230000061"></a>We are working closely through the design group with the voluntary organisations that will be impacted on by active citizenship to ensure that we implement a system that does not place undue burdens on them. So  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_562"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column 562</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>far those organisations have been supportive of our proposals and have not raised major concerns about the cost schemes would incur. A plus for those organisations would be the work done by volunteers. Those who are closest to the problem, who we are listening to for advice and who will be the people designing a scheme to monitor this do not seem to have concerns to the degree that your Lordships have.</p>

<a name="90302-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09030230000062"></a>The list set out in the document in the Library goes a long way to answering a number of other questions. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, asked if migrants can count activities they were doing before the commencement of citizenship provisions towards active citizenship requirements. The answer is yes. Other noble Lords who raised questions about particular aspects of that can be answered in the affirmative. Greater detail can be read in that document.</p>

<a name="90302-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09030230000063"></a>We also had a number of questions relating to dragooning. Neither the volunteer seeking to enhance and speed through citizenship nor the organisations taking volunteers are being dragooned in any way. I suspect most Members of your Lordships&#146; House are volunteers in one form or another. Why should we expect our migrant community on entry to be less willing to be volunteers than we are ourselves? It is true that a lot of our fellow citizens choose not to be and rely on those who do volunteer but that is no reason for not moving forward.</p>

<a name="90302-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09030230000064"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, asked about checking active citizenship, including the role of the National Checking Service. Again, we want to avoid a heavy-handed approach. To ensure that the organisation where active citizenship was undertaken was bona fide, while not excluding small or community-based organisations as volunteering groups, we would accept registered charities at face value. For non-registered charities and other voluntary organisations we would require an additional reference from the local authority or the CSV. Alternatively, a larger organisation could act as an umbrella monitor for smaller organisations. Again, in the discussions emerging from the design group there has not been the degree of opposition or concern that has been elucidated in this debate. That is understandable because we are talking about people who are very familiar with the concept and management of volunteering.</p>

<a name="90302-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09030230000065"></a>The National Checking Service, for those who are not aware, is a discretionary service available in 87 local authorities. It checks applications for British citizenship, completes corrected copies and certifies all passports before returning them to the applicant straightaway. It then forwards the relevant documents the to UKBA case workers. It is an organisation with a track record. We recognise that extra bureaucracy could form a burden for organisations so it could be mitigated by partnership agreements for 12 months allowing a larger organisation to enter into agreement with a smaller organisation to measure the degree of burden.</p>

<a name="90302-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09030230000066"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, and other noble Lords asked how applicants will find out about volunteering opportunities. Many migrants already volunteer so will not need to be signposted. For those who chose to take up active citizenship we envisage volunteer centres being able to signpost migrants to  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_563"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column 563</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>organisations looking for volunteers. ESOL teachers who signpost students to volunteering organisations are likely to continue to do so. Internet websites are a rich source of voluntary organisations. UKBA already funds the Refugee Integration and Employment Service which actively promotes volunteering for refugees. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, made a valid point in relation to localities and I am sure more work can and will be done by the design group. It is important to emphasise that volunteering is not mandatory and therefore we reject any accusation that it could be seen as blackmail. We believe, rather, that it will encourage the path to citizenship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09030230000067"></a>I hope in answering those questions and drawing attention to the questions asked which have been covered so far in the Q&amp;A, and that work is still emerging, we can reassure your Lordships that the matter is not ill thought out. It is not necessarily fully thought through but the people seeing it through on our behalf are the very people you have confidence in to run our charities and our volunteering services. We will come back to further debate on this undoubtedly at Report. Any information that becomes available between now and then will be made available to the Committee. I have not unfortunately got a response to give to the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, on this occasion. That will have to wait until a slightly later date. The Government appreciate all the contributions made. They have been positive in the sense of wanting to see something we all want, which is the greater integration of our migrant communities. I hope the Government, as we go forward, can continue to confound those who think we have taken up something that we cannot do and to encourage, support and gain the confidence who feel we might not have done so. I hope, therefore, that noble Lords can withdraw the amendments.</p>

Indeed, it is precisely the sort of thing that this House should consider having a session in Committee on to get some all-party discussion about how to get the concept of active citizenship operational. I agree strongly with my noble friend Lady Falkner that we have to be as much concerned about how to give our native young people a sense of participation in the community as about those who wish to come into our community from elsewhere. So part of our concern is that this is a sideways slide into a very large national issue which we all need to address.</p>

<a name="90302-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09030230000069"></a>We are, of course, concerned about the bureaucratic controls and the implementation. Many of the voluntary organisations with which some of us have worked are faith-based&#151;churches, temples or mosques&#151;and that raises some quite delicate questions about integration and how these things operate for Christian, Muslim, Hindu and other organisations. So there are many snags on the road to a praiseworthy intention. That is why we wish to see a great deal more of the detail before we accept this principle.</p>

It would have been helpful to have seen them before. I thank him for some of the reassurance that has been given. I want to make it clear that we are not antipathetic to the idea of voluntary service but we are antipathetic to something which does not look coherent. We need it to be written in the Bill that the recommendations of the design group&#151;which has obviously been set up to deal with some of the problems and make sure that the practicalities are resolved&#151;will be brought to the House for affirmative resolution. Otherwise, those recommendations may not get here and we need to ensure that they are discussed. I also assume that the commencement date for this will be separate from the other aspects. We need to test this a bit more. Are the other elements of that clause, such as language and good citizenship, going to be held up until the design group has discussed this and it has all been sorted out? Presumably Clause 39 must be implemented as a whole and not piecemeal. Therefore, there will have to be an extended starting date.</p>

<a name="90302-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09030230000071"></a>We will almost certainly return to this at Report because the Minister&#146;s response has answered some of the questions I have raised but not all. This will benefit from another airing but for today I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I hope that my noble friend on the Front Bench who has just spoken will draw this accolade to the attention of the Chief Whip, who might need to be revived with smelling salts after he has been told that those remarks were made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09030235000002"></a>A lot of soul-searching is going to be needed about the Bill. My fundamental instinct, though, is that that soul-searching will be not just because of the Bill but because we do not know how to go forward on the question of social integration. I shall put that another way round: for donkeys&#146; years a lot of activities, and I include trade union activities, have done a lot of work to promote social integration and so on, but it is directed particularly at immigrants, for obvious reasons. I agreed with the thrust of the speech by the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, but, unless I misheard her, she was saying that there are things that people who are born in this country do not have to do. No, she did not say that. I am sorry; I was trying to go along with the spirit of what she was saying.</p>

As soon as anyone comes up with a bright idea such as saying, &#147;Learn English&#148;, other people say that that is discriminatory. We cannot have it both ways, and we have to make progress.</p>

<a name="90302-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09030235000005"></a>It is important that we have this debate. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, who is not in his place, suggested that there ought to be some totally different mechanism for monitoring and ensuring that progress is made on social integration, and I think he added that this should be for people who were born in this country as well as for others. That may be arguable, but now we have this planning group.</p>

<a name="90302-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09030235000006"></a>Incidentally, will my noble friend say a word about where trade unions fit into this? Trade unions are by far the biggest voluntary organisations in the country. The fact that we have been sniffy over the years about some aspects of volunteering is because of the suggestion in some quarters that if you volunteer and do not get paid, that can be the same sort of work that members of UNISON, the T&amp;G or any other unions are doing in public services, so volunteering will be viewed by some with suspicion. However, thanks to the work of the trade unions with immigrants and voluntary organisations, particularly over the past 10 years, many of those shibboleths have been put to rest.</p>

<a name="90302-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09030235000007"></a>Anyway, we are where we are. We are at the stage where people have more or less agreed that everyone is going to learn English and support the English cricket team&#151;at the moment, it needs all the support it can get&#151;although I share the misgivings that we can have a rule on the statute book that means various forms of volunteering get an advantage. We have to recognise that in this debate it is almost impossible to see the daylight at the end of the proverbial tunnel, but we might as well have the debate on this subject because it is before us. I do not know whether we need a special committee to look at this, as the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, mentioned, but it is here and now, so let us have a debate on this subject&#151;let us see what can actually be done.</p>

<a name="90302-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09030235000008"></a>I do not like the idea of a probationary period, but I say to those who immediately equate incentivisation with penalty: we do not do that in other walks of life, do we? If you incentivise someone to do something, you do not immediately tear it up and say, &#147;You&#146;re trying to impose a penalty&#148;.</p>

<a name="90302-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09030235000009"></a>It might be useful if we all put into the pot one or two ideas regarding what we are talking about, because it is far too soon to categorise everything. Take trade unions, for example. Incidentally, everything trade unions do, apart from in the case of full-time officials, is volunteering&#151;collective bargaining, the lot. If you are a learning representative working with migrant workers with regard to English language learning, that is absolutely relevant to what we are trying to do in the scope of a Bill of this kind. We all know, since Morecambe Bay, that social integration is often based on organisations that people trust giving them information&#151;regarding

<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09030235000010"></a>At this stage I am putting this probing amendment forward precisely to ensure that we have the richness of all these points in the debate. I hope that my noble friend will be able to say that the principle of this amendment is going to be looked at seriously, as with all the other matters that have been mentioned in the past half hour. I beg to move.</p>

First, though, let me say that the concluding points of the contribution of my noble friend Lord Lea of Crondall are well understood and supported. After all, many trade unions started their existence as friendly societies, not merely confined to representation at work but concerned with the wider and broader social good of communities.</p>

<a name="90302-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09030235000012"></a>I say &#147;qualified&#148; support, though, because unless it is clear what we mean when we talk about &#147;trade union activities&#148;, I see the possibility here for misunderstanding and the misrepresentation of trade unions. In my day, if you linked &#147;trade unions&#148; and &#147;activities&#148; together, you looked to see whether London buses were still running. That is what &#147;trade union activities&#148; conjures up in the minds of many, so we need to qualify precisely what we mean. My noble friend Lord Lea has given examples of teaching or volunteering in evening classes; we would all see those activities as good for citizen-building and integration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09030235000013"></a>My support is qualified, however, because it is a short step from good intentions to what I would describe as project creep. By that, I mean that a lot of general activities that may well come within the list represent employment currently being carried out by people. In simple terms, one person&#146;s volunteering activities can be somebody else&#146;s paid employment. Therefore, a line of possible conflict has to be clarified. I do not want to repeat my earlier contribution in the wider debate about volunteering and where penalties may or may not lie, but I believe that it is incumbent on those with the responsibility of spelling out the details. It is the details that will be practised, whether in communities or elsewhere; it is the details that will form the guiding lines, not just the principles. We can agree the principles here, or elsewhere, but the detailed application carries with it a responsibility for your Lordships&#146; House and for those who draw the guidelines to ensure that what is prescribed is precisely what is meant. On that basis, I offer my qualified support for Amendment 83.</p>

That might seem rather contradictory, at one reading. My position is that if the amendments in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, are not to prevail, I would certainly want to see that moved by my noble friend Lord Lea taken seriously.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09030235000015"></a>I say that not only because I have been a trade union member all my life but because I believe that the trade unions have been, and remain, a very important part of our social fabric. If this is about encouraging people who seek citizenship to identify with and become involved in that social fabric, the trade unions are a very good way to do it. Having worked a great deal of my life in the voluntary sector, there is a great deal of overlapping because the trade unions are, in many instances, working hard on the very issues that some voluntary organisations exist to promote. It might well be that someone seeking citizenship found that they were more convincingly able to further some of those causes through trade union activities than via a particular voluntary agency.</p>

<a name="90302-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09030235000016"></a>All of that underlines what was said earlier: this is a wonderfully interesting idea to have in the Bill, but while my noble friends in Government tell us often that legislation must be specific and beyond doubt&#151;and I am with them 100 per cent on that&#151;it has become absolutely clear that this part of the Bill needs a great deal more thought and consideration before it reaches the state of becoming part of our legislative reality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09030235000017"></a>I must add one word to what the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, said earlier; I am sorry to say it while he is unable to be present. Having worked a great deal of my life in the voluntary sector, I agree with the noble Earl: I am, if I may use the term unashamedly, considerably philosophically disturbed by what lies behind this part of the Bill. It seems to be in danger of demeaning the whole concept of volunteering which, as I have understood it, is about people voluntarily identifying with a cause and wanting to further it&#151;not because they must be required to do it if they are to get citizenship. It reminds me rather of my days in the armed services, when the NCO came along and said, &#147;I need six volunteers; you, you and you...&#148;.</p>

<a name="90302-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09030235000018"></a>We need to keep the concept of volunteering as a rich principle in our society, because it adds to the quality of the work being done for the cause if people are genuinely volunteers, of their own free will and intellectual persuasion. Therefore, I take the opportunity of my noble friend&#146;s amendment to add my name to all those who are begging the Government to think deeply about the wider implications of what they propose and, certainly, to think it through in more detail. Quite apart from the wider issues that I have raised, when it comes to specifying voluntary service I cannot for the life of me see why trade unions should not be part of acceptable voluntary activity.</p>

Listening to the Minister&#146;s summing up&#151;activities would always be totally voluntary and nobody would be asked to do it unless they chose to&#151;reminds me exactly of what the noble Lord was just saying about the &#147;you, you and you&#148; volunteers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09030235000020"></a>To be realistic about it, if you are to become a citizen that much quicker, you will volunteer in order to become a citizen&#151;not because you care about the volunteering. That seems to be the immediate answer to what the Minister said in trying to convince us that this system was genuinely voluntary. It is only voluntary in the sense that you do not have to do it, but there is a major imperative to get into the activities on those who may not have the slightest interest in voluntary service. I profoundly agree with the noble Lord, Lord Judd; this really needs a lot more thought, and I am by no means certain whether it is best placed in this Bill.</p>

I was chief executive of a student volunteering body, Students Partnership Worldwide, and saw volunteering right up close. It seems that there is a rather romanticised view in the Committee of what volunteering is. I wonder whether those who believe that it really is so altruistic, and conducted simply because of passion for a cause, would consider internship for young people as a form of volunteering. Would they accept perhaps that many people, particularly in times of recession, wish to build up their CV and do things that others would consider to be useful contributions to society, things that would give them skills or things that might enhance the employer&#146;s perspective of the broadness of their background? Might they accept that those people do not have ill motives, because they are trying to extract some personal advantage from volunteering, but that they also perhaps have an interest in the cause? You can have multiple motives for what you do at different times of your life. It is not a matter just of needing to be persuaded by the passion of the cause. So incentives are not perverse. &#147;Incentives where we can and compulsion almost never&#148; would be my motto. I suggest to the Minister that he think extremely carefully before he responds affirmatively to the amendment, if that is what he intends.</p>

Does she not agree that there is even the danger that the proposal, far from encouraging sincere commitment and integrity in the forthcoming role of citizenship, may encourage falsehood, because somebody may espouse a cause not because they believe in it at all but simply because it is a way of gaining citizenship? That is not a way of promoting integrity in the decent society. Furthermore, in terms of the credibility of the legislation, we are entering a dangerous and sensitive area in demanding such behaviour of would-be citizens when there is plenty of evidence, as has been said in earlier debate, that it is not the prevailing culture in our society. The prevailing culture, as seen by many at the moment, is that you make as much money as fast you can and that is the way in which you are a successful citizen.</p>

Perhaps I may answer his question very directly. You may have a perverse outcome, and you may go down a road that you do not sincerely believe in. However, all of us in this Chamber volunteer three or four days a week in all sorts of things&#151;accepting a dinner invitation to be a speaker when we do not particularly want to do it and scratching our heads to think what we might say or do, or moving amendments where we are under pressure from our parties or from lobby groups towards which we feel well inclined. We often undertake activities about which we are not entirely convinced.</p>

<a name="90302-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09030235000024"></a>My personal experience has been that when I look at the detail of things with which I am unfamiliar, when I work with people to whom I have not been exposed previously and when I venture into areas where I have no expertise, I have often developed a passion for those people and causes. I learn through my interaction with other people outside my scope of knowledge, friendships and employment. They are amazing people. So volunteering often has the opposite effect to that mentioned, particularly for migrants and newcomers to this country, because it provides the opportunity to work alongside other people who are not newcomers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09030235000025"></a>Newcomers, particularly from my part of the world, are often ghettoised. If you are a woman, you will be ghettoised in your home and with your extended family, many of whom live with you. You will be expected to perform conventional forms of daughter-in-lawship or sister-in-lawship, or whatever else are the bases of your being there. You are seldom permitted time away from those duties, which I consider often to be unpaid domestic chores, even to do English lessons. You will live in a street full of people similar to you and you will have very few opportunities to go out of your ambit, which is often that of the village from which you previously came, and interact with other people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09030235000026"></a>An incentive to volunteer might convince your husband that you might be let out of the house to do it. You might be given a bit of rope to be an adult and make up your own mind about what you wish to do. You might even learn a few words of the language while you are at it. From volunteering in a legal advice centre or a women&#146;s refuge, you might discover how the law works in the country for which you are applying for citizenship. Having spoken to men and women who live in those communities, I only wish that we could create the avenues for them to go out and volunteer, because it is quite often the community that holds them back and keeps them segregated. Unusually, therefore, I am not at one with the noble Lord, Lord Judd, on this matter.</p>

<a name="90302-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09030235000027"></a>I urge the Minister to desist from agreeing to the amendment. He will have heard expressed during the previous hour and a half the divergent views on, and strong reservations about, the Bill. If we were to introduce an element of partisanship by including trade unions&#151;the other side will say, &#147;In that case,  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_570"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column 570</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>why not also political parties?&#148;&#151;we would immediately kill off any good that he is trying to achieve in the Bill, because it will not get through. I think that he will recognise that trade unions and political parties would introduce an element of incentivisation that may not be construed by others to be just for the good of active citizenship; it may be construed as a means of their recruiting members to their cause and making them partisan.</p>

<a name="90302-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09030235000028"></a>If political parties were to come into the frame, you would have another problem. We know of many migrants who, once they have come here, want to close the door behind them. It is a common phenomenon for migrants to say, &#147;I&#146;m here now; we shouldn&#146;t let any more of those bloody foreigners in&#148;&#151;I hope that your Lordships will forgive my unparliamentary language. What would we do if joining political parties was considered active citizenship and the BNP managed to recruit a large number of members as a result? Extremist parties might benefit, too. My noble friend Lord Wallace of Saltaire mentioned religious groups whose political ethos we may not like.</p>

<a name="90302-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09030235000029"></a>I would have thought that trade union and political party activity was ruled out because you would have to pay a membership fee. The Bill states that you cannot have financial interaction of any sort. Payment of a membership fee for passive citizenship, whereby you have joined a political party, you carry the card in your pocket, but you do nothing more than that, is not what active citizenship is about at all. I urge the Minister on that basis to resist the amendment at this stage until we have a clearer idea of where we going.</p>

I should explain first that my enthusiastic nodding represented not necessarily government policy but the experience of someone who has spent most of his life in the trade union movement, a lot of it as a full-time officer and general secretary in a trade union that never paid one penny to any political party. However, I was always genuinely grateful for the many activities of the union&#151;not those that directly benefited the membership, but those that benefited the community at large&#151;that were carried out by people serving as nominees of the trade union&#146;s governing and regional bodies at no expense to the union and at no benefit to the people doing them. There are some 7 million people in the trade union movement who are doing a whole host of things, such as health and safety education and the various representative activities mentioned by my noble friend Lord Lea. There is a lot of opportunity there, which, in the context of volunteering overall, it would be a mistake to ignore.</p>

<a name="90302-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09030235000031"></a>However, I am seeking to resist the amendment. It would not be appropriate to include trade union activities in the Bill. That makes it necessary for me to answer the question posed by noble friend Lord Lea, which was where trade unions fit in, and that of my noble friend Lord Morris, on qualification.</p>

<a name="90302-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09030235000032"></a>I think that the answer is relatively simple. We should ask the design group to consult the TUC. The TUC knows which of its activities would fit in the areas that are identified as being voluntary work. We would know from that discussion how that would  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_571"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column 571</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>relate to the question of refereeing and monitoring. That would provide the opportunity to avoid some of the fears that the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, expressed in her contribution, the first part of which I was in total agreement with. I have volunteered for a number of organisations, including political parties, in my life, but I have to say that in few cases have I been moved by passion. It has come about normally by accident, or I have been pushed by somebody who has said, &#147;Do me a favour and come along to this meeting&#148;. Often, getting involved without any great commitment has led to my being very interested and continuing the involvement long after the pressure from friends has subsided.</p>

<a name="90302-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09030235000033"></a>I agree with the point made by the noble Baroness that we should not see volunteering as some kind of passionate activity, with everybody having to be motivated by passion and no one having to be incentivised. It is different from being told, &#147;You, you and you will volunteer&#148;. When my noble friend Lord Judd felt that he could not resist the volunteering request, he knew that there was a penalty, which presumably was not necessarily that he would be put on charges, but that something would be held against him in relation to his service by the same NCO. It was therefore an invitation that he could not refuse. We are not doing that in the Bill. People who do not wish to volunteer will still qualify as citizens. They will take a decision based on their understanding of what they can volunteer for, which is why the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, is very important: we must tell people what they can do that will benefit them, as well as society, when they become active citizens. I ask my noble friend to withdraw the amendment, but express my enthusiasm for what is being done by trade unions by nodding my head.</p>

For the person applying for citizenship, where is the evidence that any of the people who will be handling his application have ever undertaken voluntary community service? It is not something that is required of people who are born into citizenship in this country. We do not require citizens to participate in voluntary activity. It seems to me that there is a credibility problem that the Government need to address if they want to move forward with this idea.</p>

I do not want to reopen that wider debate on this narrow amendment. I will happily discuss this again on Report. In the mean time, I ask my noble friend to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09030235000037"></a>I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, for being so frank in her concerns. One of them is absolutely misconceived, if I may say so, and that is the idea that we are somehow being &#147;partisan&#148;&#151;that was her word&#151;as though anything to do with trade unions implies the involvement of the Labour Party. My noble friend Lord Morris and I have about 100 years of trade union activity between us and we know that that is a total misunderstanding. For 90 if not 99 per cent of the time, it is not like that at all. You represent your members on day-to-day matters. In the context of the Bill, it is nothing to do with being partisan.</p>

<a name="90302-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09030235000038"></a>I would put the point the other way around. My concern&#151;I have experience in these matters&#151;is that when people talk about NGOs and this sort of thing, one minute they say, &#147;Of course trade unions are included&#148;, but when they set up meetings, the unions are not there. My worry is about being excluded. I am very glad that we have had this discussion. I have had this discussion in many forums. When CPA and IPU delegations have gone to Nigeria, I say, &#147;Are we meeting the Nigeria Labour Congress?&#148;. They say, &#147;Why? What has that got to do with it?&#148;. I say, &#147;We are meeting so-called NGOs: what is wrong with the Nigeria Labour Congress?&#148;. I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, with her development experience, will recognise my point.</p>

On three occasions, I have placed before the FSA details of cases that seemed to me to be serious breaches of market regulatory practice and control, and on each occasion I have been refused. On two of those occasions, I have proceeded to take independent action; usually, I hasten to add, with the support of the noble Lord, Lord Dear, who now sits in your Lordships&#146; House and was then the head of the West Midlands Police. On each occasion, I secured custodial sentences for the company chairmen whom I was replacing; one for six years and one for two years.</p>

<a name="90302-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09030239000002"></a>The third case is even more concerning, as it represented a serious security hazard for the country. It unearthed a practice of the IRA, which targeted British listed public companies and used them to raise fictitious invoices that could be satisfied by the proceeds of criminal activity by the IRA, thus ramping up the profits of these companies, and with them their stock exchange values, for the benefit of the friends and allies of the IRA, who had been given prior warning to invest in those companies. Each of those three companies collapsed completely, with an aggregate market value of &#163;2 billion. Unlike at the present time, there was no recession, but it was serious enough in its own terms.</p>

<a name="90302-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09030239000003"></a>I had to spend &#163;10 million of my shareholders&#146; funds to pursue the first two cases. In each case, that was an unreasonable burden for the official investigating authorities to pass back to the shareholders. There should be some better willingness to pursue investigation on such cases. I got it back, because I managed to sue my auditors for &#163;24 million&#151;but I was lucky. As regards security, their attitude was that it was a financial issue and not one that they could cope with. So we now know at least that James Bond, whatever he is licensed for, is not licensed as an auditor. The FSA&#146;s response was that it was a security issue, so I was caught completely between two stools, and nobody wanted to know.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09030239000004"></a>As things stand from that point of view, I regret very bitterly the old days of the DTI. In the inimitable words of my noble friend Lady Gardner of Parkes, with her Australian twang, &#147;you need a go-to person&#148;.

<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="09030239000005"></a>In each of these cases, a huge amount of investors&#146; money was lost and there was massive, deliberate manipulation of the London stock market to the detriment of investors. Apart from those cases that I have noted, in both of which I acted as chairman, I have no interest to declare. I confirm that I have no participation in the past or present affairs of the principal concern which I wish to place before your Lordships tonight. My immediate and present concern is with another case in which the FSA has declined to become involved, which raises for me the question that if it does not become involved in such cases what is it for?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="09030239000006"></a>The issue here is this: Merrill Lynch and its subsidiaries organised a bid for the equity of a company named Greycoat PLC, and that bid was successful. Merrill Lynch then proceeded to suck out the equity from the company without setting aside sufficient cash to repay the company&#146;s bonds, which ranked in priority to the equity. In order to get round the asset covenants in the bond conditions, intercompany loans were put in the Greycoat balance sheet at full value when, in fact, the money had been paid up to Merrill Lynch to repay part of the purchase loans. As the intercompany loan could, thus, never be repaid this treatment was, at best, questionable.</p>

<a name="90302-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="09030239000007"></a>When the bonds matured there were, as a result of the Merrill Lynch scheme, insufficient assets to repay more than part of the bonds&#146; face value, in spite of the fact that such bonds had been covered over five times by real assets before the Merrill Lynch takeover. The liquidator, on the instructions of the liquidation committee, commenced legal action against the directors but, due to their lack of resources, these together with the remaining assets in the company and allowing for several years of unpaid interest since the default still leave today a loss to bondholders in excess of &#163;35 million when the interest is included. Where is that money today? One must assume that it is in the hands of Merrill Lynch.</p>

<a name="90302-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09030239000008"></a>Many of the bonds are held by tens of thousands of smallholders through bond funds, and they will suffer loss as well as the larger holders. As a result, the only way in which compensation can be obtained from Merrill Lynch is through action by the FSA against Merrill Lynch on the grounds of, first, market abuse&#151;leaving the quoted bonds outstanding when bidding for the equity and not putting cash aside for the redemption of the bonds before removing the equity; and, secondly, the FSA&#146;s duty to protect investors, particular small ones, against such manipulation. I am informed that when MEPC was acquired in a similar manner to Greycoat, the purchasers ensured that funds were set aside to repay the bonds in full, before the purchasers took out cash. The FSA, which was initially sympathetic when the case was first presented to it, became progressively less interested and finally stopped answering letters and phone calls.</p>

<a name="90302-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09030239000009"></a>The FSA&#146;s remit in relation to Greycoat must surely relate to the period when it had listed securities and covered only the company&#146;s compliance with listing rules and whether there had been market abuse in relation to the securities. As I have said previously, such matters, whether illegal or not, fall within the FSA remit as they were in effect a device to suck resources from Greycoat via the equity in priority to repayment of the bonds which ranked ahead. Surely, that is market and regulatory abuse in any language. A responsible purchaser of Greycoat would have purchased the bonds at the same time as the equity or ensured that there were sufficient funds left in the company to meet repayment obligations.</p>

<a name="90302-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="09030239000010"></a>At the time of the purchase by Merrill Lynch companies, the Greycoat bonds were covered five times by real property assets, yet the holders received nothing. Sir Callum McCarthy, then chairman of the FSA, wrote to me on 20 December 2007 defending the  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_575"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column 575</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>FSA&#146;s position on the grounds that Greycoat had not been a listed company at the time of the alleged offence. I believe his letter contained a crucial error, in that the Greycoat bonds in question were still quoted until 1 October 2003, and payments up to Merrill Lynch companies, which may well have been illegal, were made from September 1999 to May 2003, so they fall directly under the FSA by its own definition. That was during a period when the present FSA&#146;s chairman, the noble Lord, Lord Turner of Ecchinswell, was vice-chairman of Merrill Lynch Europe. That does not cause me any concern, and I am sure that it will not concern the noble Lord, Lord Turner, because we have a reputation in this country of very skilled and knowledgeable people rotating between senior positions, and as such they take with them their integrity, commitment and experience. I know that the noble Lord, in his avowed intention to review the terms of the FSA at this moment, would not be in any way influenced by his past association and would ring-fence himself from any investigation that took place.</p>

<a name="90302-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="09030239000011"></a>Callum McCarthy replied to me further on 12 March 2008, stating that the FSA&#146;s remit in relation to Greycoat is limited to its compliance with the listing rules and whether market abuse has been committed in relation to the securities. I can see no reason to doubt that the purchase of the equity in the market, and then the denuding of the company of its assets to the detriment of the quoted bonds left outstanding, is an appalling case of market abuse judged by Callum McCarthy&#146;s own criteria, in that Greycoat remained a listed vehicle throughout the key period.</p>

<a name="90302-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09030239000012"></a>This issue is not less outrageous for being a fairly simple matter. Legally, the bondholders ranked ahead of the equity and were protected by the assets. However, over the period, those assets changed from being tangible properties to being an intercompany loan, given a parent that itself had no assets. Subsequently, after a majority of the assets had been sucked out of the company, Greycoat defaulted on its bonds. The intercompany loans proved worthless, because the parent had used those funds to repay the initial loan to Merrill Lynch together with a substantial profit, which is presumably where the funds remain today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09030239000013"></a>By Callum McCarthy&#146;s own definition, I submit that the FSA rules were severely breached by Merrill Lynch as, I also contend, was the case in examples I quoted earlier, which were refused. I now call on Her Majesty's Government to give clear guidance as to the due process and preconditions required to trigger a proper FSA scrutiny and review in such cases. It could hardly look for a better case on which to start than the one of Merrill Lynch and Greycoat.</p>

<a name="90302-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09030239000014"></a>Given the present state of our national economy, it is now time to seek a clear signal that can be shown to the market in general as to what an FSA is for and what it will do to regulate matters in future. I suggest that a good starting point would be to demonstrate this by initiating the long-overdue scrutiny of the Greycoat-Merrill Lynch bondholder scandal, and initiating the required legal process to obtain compensation for the bondholders from the Merrill Lynch companies.</p>

I found the specific experiences that he described most illuminating. Regulation of the financial services sector must become much more effective in the future, as I am sure the noble Lord, Lord James, will agree. The current crisis has clearly revealed the weaknesses shared by the Treasury, the Bank of England and the FSA to monitor and supervise the activities of the City of London. But, as I have remarked previously in the House, that does not absolve in the slightest degree those bankers and other financiers from their responsibility in bringing about the crisis in the first place&#151;not that they, for their part, seem to recognise their culpability and publicly fully and unequivocally apologise for that. In that regard, it is good to see in today&#146;s <I>Evening Standard</I> that Mr Stephen Green, chairman of HSBC, has apologised for the unwarranted, out-of-control bonus system that has occurred in the City.</p>

<a name="90302-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09030239000017"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Turner, the chairman of the FSA, trailed last week that there is to be a &#147;regulation revolution&#148; in how the authority will work in future. He was also frank enough to admit that he would not have predicted the crisis in which we are all now engulfed, and that the FSA's past record was unsatisfactory. We eagerly await the imminent publication of the FSA's plan for its future mode of operation.</p>

<a name="90302-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="09030239000018"></a>As has been remarked by Robert Peston and other authoritative commentators, the future UK economy will be very different from that which obtained during the previous three decades. Privatisation, and the self-centred greed culture that was its inevitable concomitant, dictated public policy during that era. All that, perforce, will now have to change given the unprecedented increase in state intervention and investment of public money deemed necessary to prop up those institutions previously regarded as the quintessence of capitalism. How times are changing. As I have remarked before in your Lordships' House, it gives a quite different complexion to the term &#147;private/public partnership&#148;. In their original manifestation, PFIs were a rip-off in terms both of public accountability and value for money; now, the new types of PFI&#151;the bail-outs to the banks and other industries&#151;will be a total drain on the taxpayer.</p>

<a name="90302-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="09030239000019"></a>It is clear from the continuing arrogance and stubbornness of the bankers themselves and other financiers in hedge funds and the like that there will have to be much closer regulation by way of scrutiny and assessment; the public's universal anger demands  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_577"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column 577</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>no less. It is imperative that the FSA and other regulatory bodies take the strongest action if public outrage is to be contained. Two rigorous policies must now be pursued. First, there must be a step increase in the criminal prosecution of those directors and senior managers whose conduct has flouted the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. My Oral Question last week to the noble Lord, Lord Myners, sought to elicit how many such prosecutions are in train and I await his promised response. In yesterday's <I>Observer</I>, Andrew Rawnsley's column was entitled,</p>
<ul><a name="09030239000023"></a>&#147;These bankers are lucky that they are not going to jail&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09030239000022"></a>Along with Sir Ken Macdonald, the former DPP, I fervently hope that the guilty ones will soon be sentenced to serve long terms of incarceration. The FSA, the serious fraud squad and the Serious Fraud Office have not shown the zeal that is needed to root out the perpetrators. The authorities in the USA, France and Ireland have shown much greater energy in this regard. Will the Minister say whether the relevant UK agencies are showing enough determination? I echo the sentiments expressed by the noble Lord, Lord James, in that regard.</p>

<a name="90302-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="09030239000020"></a>Secondly, the FSA must be vigorous in policing excessive remuneration packages by enforcing its code of practice. Since entering your Lordships' House in 1997, I, together with the noble Lord, Lord Lea of Crondall, and the late Lord Dormand of Easington, have regularly asked Questions about &#147;fat cat&#148; pay. Until very recently, there were no critics from the Tory Benches; they kept very quiet for fear of upsetting their financial backers. Successive Ministers&#151;at least five, I recall&#151;parroted the same complacent reply that it was up to shareholders to deal with such enormities. It was rather worrying that in answer to a question today on bonus payments for the directors of Network Rail, the Transport Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, said that it was not for him to interfere in those bonuses, even though Network Rail is a wholly government-owned body. I was going to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Myners, on being the first Minister to condemn such rewards until it was reported over the weekend that the thinking behind his rhetoric had not influenced his initial endorsement of Sir Fred Goodwin's pension package.</p>

<a name="90302-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09030239000021"></a>It is not an easy task for the FSA and other regulators to devise smart policies that achieve effective supervision and policing of the recidivists in the City while at the same time avoiding the over-reaction of a Sarbanes-Oxley type that occurred in the USA following the Enron debacle. We must hope that the noble Lord, Lord Turner, and his colleagues are up to that formidable task.</p>

I have never had any reason to initiate procedures aiming to involve the FSA in following up a problem. Indeed, I rather think that I never would have done because my indirect impression is that the FSA is of little account. It has not managed to establish itself with a personality and a track record and has made a bad start to its seven years&#146; existence.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_578"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column 578</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90302-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09030241000002"></a>What steps are being taken? A major management change has occurred. The new chairman, the noble Lord, Lord Turner, has been in place for not quite six months and the new chief executive, Hector Sants, has been in place for some 18 months. As your Lordships will know, last week they appeared before the Treasury Select Committee down the other end of the Corridor. As I think has already been said, the chairman promised fundamental change amounting to a revolution. Whenever I hear about revolutions, my mind turns to Edmund Burke and I become suspicious. Like him, I do not really believe in revolutions. Institutions have a life of their own. They make a start, which may be a good or bad one, but, above all they operate&#151;as does the FSA&#151;under a long and complicated Act of Parliament. Although we have had much discussion in your Lordships' House recently of financial stability, interestingly it is not mentioned in the Act which sets out the FSA&#146;s four objectives: market confidence; public awareness; protection of consumers; and reduction in crime. They are expanded in the next section in what I can only describe as very imprecise language. Indeed, it is a feature of the FSA&#146;s language that it is in general imprecise and even woolly.</p>

<a name="90302-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="09030241000003"></a>I think that it is fair to compare a regulator with a policeman. The Act tempted the FSA to become Dixon of Dock Green and not the CID, and the FSA fell for that temptation. But it gets worse than that. The objectives are qualified. The FSA is to be careful because others running institutions also have responsibilities. It is to be proportionate and it is to work out whether any of the costs incurred as a result of its regulation exceed the benefits. It is to be wary about competition. It is to encourage competition, not to reduce it, and to remember that London is very important internationally. Finally, it is to encourage innovation. Of course, we all know where innovation has led us. You can imagine the dialogue between the FSA and one of the larger financial institutions in which the FSA makes its points and the larger institution says, &#147;But I thought you were supposed to be the gentlemen of the light touch and to keep your hands off us&#148;. I think that the FSA accepted that and became PC Plod interested in relatively small fines and not Inspector Morse. It is no wonder that the FSA says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a><a name="09030241000033"></a>&#147;There are many situations where our statutory objectives are potentially at odds with each other&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030241000029"></a>That is a bureaucratic euphemism for saying &#147;We have been given a muddle and we don&#146;t quite know how to solve it&#148;.</p>

<a name="90302-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09030241000004"></a>Last week, the noble Lord, Lord Turner, was for driving through the middle of these problems with the &#147;revolution&#148; and the &#147;fundamental change&#148;. At the heart of what he was saying was that there should be less process and less bureaucracy. Or was he really saying that in addition to the process and the bureaucracy there was a need to have an understanding of the system as a whole, a detailed evaluation of the position of large financial institutions and a willingness to reach judgments about impending risks and the likely pattern of events? If he is to be as bold as that, he does not have a particularly good inheritance. What he inherits are 2,500 inward-looking people who have been trained to see the trees rather than the wood. A massive cultural shift would be needed to achieve what the noble Lord, Lord Turner, promised the Select  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_579"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column 579</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Committee last week. Of course, many staff would find that massive cultural change very uncomfortable and quite possibly unacceptable.</p>

<a name="90302-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09030241000005"></a>In the discussion in the Treasury Committee as to whether or not the evidence given by the chairman and the chief executive meant that the FSA was or was not fit for purpose, the chief executive almost wondered aloud as to whether his chairman&#146;s vision was within the statutory remit as it existed in the 2000 Act. That is a very good question. The Act is not fit for purpose if the view of noble Lord, Lord Turner, of the FSA role in the tripartite structure is correct. Of course he may try it. Who would object if he tried it anyway? However, the question would then be: how much progress will he make? The FSA&#146;s outstanding need is the interpretation of the highest order of market intelligence. That is unlikely to be available within the FSA. Surely, therefore, it would be a better bet not to increase numbers, as is being suggested, but to spend the money on high-level advice from those closer to the market and to the way in which the operators in the market behave, particularly when under pressure.</p>

<a name="90302-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09030241000006"></a>The FSA may be able to raise its game. Given its first seven years, it will not do so from within. Its chairman would do better to streamline the organisation and to look for the help that he will need from wherever he can find it.</p>

I was not entirely sure to whom he was suggesting it should be given. If I am right, we on these Benches would not agree with that. Certainly, there have been many failures. We do not believe that these matters have been investigated nearly rigorously enough, but taking that responsibility away would not solve anything.

I was also aware that the noble Lord, Lord Turner, worked for Merrill Lynch for part of that time and, like him, I am sure that the noble Lord will distance himself from it, but I ask the noble Lord, Lord Myners, if he will bring the things that are being said tonight to the FSA&#146;s attention. I hope that he will undertake to find out from the FSA who is looking into this matters, which would be helpful, since that clearly would not be appropriate for the noble Lord, Lord Turner. I hope that we will have some response. The way that the bondholders, rather like the minority shareholders, were treated requires further examination. If, as the noble Lord, Lord James, said, the FSA&#146;s trail ran cold and the authority did not seem very interested, it was probably taking a very narrow view of its responsibilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09030241000012"></a>This is not a general debate on the FSA, but it is very topical, and the way that the FSA carries out its responsibilities was discussed in an interesting and frank way by the noble Lord, Lord Turner, when he was before the Treasury Select Committee last week. What he said, although significant, was somewhat overshadowed by the furore about Sir Fred Goodwin&#146;s pension, which I do not intend to discuss tonight. It is relevant to the debate that the noble Lord said to the Select Committee of Gordon Brown&#146;s watch at the Treasury:</p>

Can&#146;t you make regulation a bit more light touch? We were supervising people like HBOS within a particular philosophy of the way you do regulation which I think, in retrospect was wrong&#146;&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="09030241000014"></a>Like, I am sure, the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, I have also looked at the Act regarding the way that the FSA in my view is not properly complying with paragraph 10 of Schedule 1 to the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, whereby it is meant to make an annual report to the Treasury on the extent to which, in its opinion, the regulatory objectives have been met. For the first few years, the FSA&#146;s annual reports complied with those requirements, but they have not in recent years. I have been helpfully briefed by an ex-FSA employee who is, in fact, a former member of the Treasury&#146;s original Bill team which, as he puts it,</p>
<ul><a name="09030241000036"></a>&#147;is why I am so familiar with the legislation&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09030241000031"></a>He points out that there is a clear dereliction of the FSA&#146;s statutory duty to give such a report. I ask the noble Lord, Lord Myners, why it has not done so.  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_581"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column 581</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The noble Lord has not been here for all that time, so perhaps he can look into why the Treasury has not picked it up, if he is not aware of it. The FSA&#146;s public documents&#151;the annual report, business plan and website&#151;even in 2009 almost redefine the aims. The website states that the FSA is a statutory body set up under the Act,</p>
<ul><a name="09030241000037"></a>&#147;which sets out four statutory objectives&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09030241000032"></a>However, the FSA does not say what those objectives are&#151;the noble Lord already listed them&#151;and sets out its aims under three broad headings. I fear that we are almost in a situation whereby the FSA has decided that it knows better than Parliament what its objectives should be and has redefined them in a much vaguer way. In particular, they are: the need for market confidence and public awareness; the protection of consumers; and, specifically, the reduction of financial crime. Obviously, those objectives are very specific and very carefully worked out by Parliament, and they are very relevant to the way in which the noble Lord introduced the debate.</p>

<a name="90302-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="09030241000015"></a>The noble Lord, Lord James, raised one or two interesting examples. I have stood back and thought over the past few years about where we have got to. I do not necessarily think that the noble Lord, Lord Turner, would agree with me, but I should be very interested to know the view of the noble Lord, Lord Myners, who has been actively involved in these matters as a participant and has regulated much more, even more so than as part of his responsibilities over the past few weeks. My view is that the Financial Services Authority has spent far too much time over the past few years making little people tick little boxes. It should have focused much more energy on putting big questions to the big fish and making them give proper answers or change their ways.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="09030241000017"></a>The more one examines what the FSA does, the more one asks what its real purpose is&#151;or, as my noble friend Lord James put it, what the FSA is for&#151;and how it has benefited the country. How does the Minister, who is an experienced businessman capable of distinguishing success from failure, measure success by the FSA? Can he tell us what the purpose of the FSA is, whether it has succeeded, and what changes he will be discussing with the noble Lord, Lord Turner?</p>

<a name="90302-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="09030241000018"></a>Is the only purpose of the FSA to examine the minutiae of how businesses in the financial services are administered? If so, why is such a huge number of staff needed? At 31 March 2008, the FSA had 2,665 employees. At that time, the Treasury had a mere 1,451 full-time staff. The FSA needs nearly double the number of employees to monitor the City as the Treasury needs to run the finances of the entire country, and I see from the press that the FSA is looking to employ more people. What on earth do they all do? Or is the FSA responsible for drawing attention to banks

If so, given the dismal debacle of recent years, has the system put in place by the Prime Minister been a failure? In general terms, can the Minister tell us the criteria that he sets to judge success when he scrutinises the performance of the FSA? How often, indeed, does he meet the FSA to review progress?</p>

<a name="90302-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="09030241000019"></a>When the Act which created the FSA went through Parliament, my noble friend Lord Saatchi pointed out that the FSA was being made policeman, judge, jury and executioner. Furthermore, the FSA has immunity from damages. As a result of my noble friend&#146;s intervention, at least an appeal procedure was introduced, but this is a cumbersome process and there is little incentive to go through with it, not only on the ground of cost but due to the danger of creating a powerful enemy which could, with ease, destroy a career.</p>

<a name="90302-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="09030241000020"></a>With the benefit of hindsight, does the Minister agree that the result is an organisation with too much power and too little accountability, and, as so often with organisations with these characteristics, the tendency is to avoid difficult problems and go for easy solutions.</p>

<a name="90302-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="09030241000021"></a>The FSA has, in its present existence, issued fines of more than &#163;107 million. A number of these fines were for administrative errors which the culprits themselves had reported to the FSA and where there were no findings of deliberately wrongful conduct or systems failure. Can the noble Lord tell is whether the &#163;14 million of bonuses paid to FSA employees related to fines collected? If so, can he explain how justice can be thought to be fair if those responsible for administering it, like some team of inner-city wheel-clampers, personally benefit from their actions? Goodness knows what the cost to the public has been of the many bureaucratic rules imposed on the industry by the FSA, some of which defy common sense and are all too easy to circumvent by those who wish to do so. Those rules were referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott.</p>

<a name="90302-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09030241000022"></a>However, the FSA also needs to be looked at for what it has not done. Examples were given to us today by my noble friend Lord James of where the FSA refused to take action. Surely these cases would come under the statutory objective of reducing financial crime. More importantly, the FSA appears to have ignored the trouble being stored up by banks overgearing, with flaky finance, to buy dubious assets. It is not rocket science to see that this was a recipe for trouble. There were enough commentators pointing out the dangers&#151;not least the Bank of England, which gave a number of warnings. There is little point in an organisation such as the FSA if it is not able to work this sort of thing out for itself. The quality of assets may have been a challenge but overgearing and excessive reliance on short-term and volatile finance should have been easy to spot.</p>

<a name="90302-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="09030241000023"></a>Certainly the former and the present Prime Ministers asked for banks to be treated with a light touch, but there is a difference between a light touch and turning a blind eye to danger signals. Can the noble Lord categorically deny reports in the media that the Prime Minister suggested the employment of Sir James Crosby, who, when at HBOS, ignored warnings of risks from his own senior staff on the basis that the allegations

They had been investigated by the very auditors who had given the situation a clean bill of health in the first place. Does not auditing your own audit pose a conflict of interest?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09030241000024"></a>The Prime Minister and his loyal Deputy Leader now say that the pension of Sir Fred Goodwin is unacceptable. His pension may be indefensible but it is not illegal and was agreed by the Treasury. Can the Minister confirm that he personally discussed and agreed to the severance package? Since 1689, this country has been subject to the rule of law. Now Miss Harman, one of Her Majesty&#146;s Executive, says that, although the pension was lawful under the law established by Parliament and approved by government, she must now &#147;step in&#148; to block it in what she calls a &#147;court of public opinion&#148;. Since when were hue and cry and people&#146;s courts part of British justice? Do we exist under the rule of law or the rule of the mob? Sir Fred deserves censure, but the storm being whipped up by Labour serves only the cynical purpose of diverting attention from the culpable policy failures of Ministers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="09030241000025"></a>I ask the noble Lord to tell the House whether it was the duty of the FSA to warn of the impending collapse of our banks&#151;one of the most catastrophic failures of recent times. In pursuit of its statutory objective of maintaining confidence in the financial system, what role did the FSA have in promoting the merger of what Mr Daniels told the Treasury Select Committee in another place was a perfectly viable bank, Lloyds TSB, and the basket case, HBOS?</p>

<a name="90302-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="09030241000026"></a>Did the Prime Minister take advice from the FSA at any stage in his talks with Sir Victor Blank? Did anyone anywhere in the FSA warn the Government at any stage that for Lloyds TSB to take over HBOS was to condemn hundreds of thousands of small shareholders, many of them pensioners, to lose both capital and income? If not, does the noble Lord, Lord Myners, agree that it would be wise to scrutinise that failure by the FSA?</p>

<a name="90302-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="09030241000027"></a>I ask the noble Lord, Lord Myners, specific questions about the deal between the Government and the Royal Bank of Scotland. Can he confirm whether he or his officials were in touch with either the Royal Bank of Scotland or Sir Fred Goodwin about the terms on which Sir Fred Goodwin left the bank's service? Were the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Prime Minister informed of those discussions, and was their approval sought at any stage? Does he agree with his right honourable friend Ms Harman that for those involved in financial failures to receive pensions is unacceptable? If so, does that doctrine also apply to the FSA, Ministers and other public officials involved in supervising the failures of the financial system?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="09030241000028"></a>Will the Minister answer those points as well as the troubling questions put by my noble friend Lord James? If he cannot answer them now, will he undertake to write to me with the answers?</p>

However, I shall seek to answer the more important ones, but not in a way that detracts from the important message and issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord James.</p>

<a name="90302-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="09030248000002"></a>Before I proceed, I would like to explain briefly the different roles of Government and the FSA and remind noble Lords of the FSA&#146;s independence, which prevents me discussing the specifics of the case raised by the noble Lord, Lord James. The Government are responsible for the legal and institutional framework, as well as for setting the boundaries of FSA regulation. We are also responsible for appointing FSA board members in accordance with public appointment processes, those appointment processes applying to the appointment of the chairman and vice-chairman of the FSA.</p>

<a name="90302-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="09030248000003"></a>The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 gives the FSA four objectives, one of which is to reduce financial crime. In meeting its objectives, the independence of the FSA is vital to its role as supervisor of financial services firms and as an investigating and enforcing authority. Its credibility, authority and value to consumers would be undermined if it were possible for the Government to intervene in its decision-making processes. It is for that reason that I cannot comment in detail on the case under discussion or direct the FSA to reconsider the case.</p>

<a name="90302-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="09030248000004"></a>The noble Lord, Lord James, asked about the FSA&#146;s decision-making process around taking action on the basis of information that it receives. Like other bodies with investigation and enforcement powers, the FSA needs to have both independence and discretion in deciding which cases to pursue and which of its tools to use. Noble Lords will appreciate that the FSA receives many potential cases for consideration. It takes a risk-based approach in selecting which cases to pursue, considering factors such as consumer detriment; evidence of financial crime; indications of a more widespread problem; and the risk of undermining public confidence. If members of the public feel that their concerns have not been adequately addressed, they have access to the FSA complaints scheme.</p>

<a name="90302-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="09030248000005"></a>It may be worth mentioning that the Financial Services and Markets Act restricts the FSA&#146;s ability to disclose information that it has received from firms, and its freedom to criticise firms, unless it has followed due process. It may be frustrating to complainants, but in the interest of fairness and to reduce the risk of jeopardising any further action, the FSA does not normally disclose the fact that an investigation is ongoing. I hope that the background that I have set out is helpful in explaining how the FSA, as an independent regulator, operates in considering cases brought to its attention.</p>

<a name="90302-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="09030248000006"></a>If I may, I shall make two general observations on the issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord James. The first is that all authorities investigating cases face choice in deciding which cases to pursue. For example, does the evidence presented suggest that there is a potential case of rule-breaking or even criminal activity? In making that judgment, any investigating authority will do its best to make a proper assessment based on the information that it has been given. That assessment may change if additional information becomes available. Hence the importance of the FSA keeping a record of the cases that it has assessed.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_585"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column 585</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90302-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="09030248000007"></a>The second observation is more wide-ranging and concerns whether the FSA&#146;s powers are appropriate and whether, for example, the scope of market abuse is widely enough defined. As part of an ongoing review of the regulatory framework, the latter point is one that my officials will be considering, along with the FSA, in the upcoming European Commission review of the market abuse directive from which the UK regime mainly derives. The noble Lord, Lord James, may want to offer his experience in that wider debate during the Commission consultation that is expected to start later this month. I would be happy to alert him to the consultation once it has been published, if he would find that helpful.</p>

<a name="90302-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="09030248000008"></a>I turn to points made by other contributors. The noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton, made a cogent and coherent series of observations about financial regulation and behaviour in financial markets, which are consistent with his many comments on those issues to this House. I thoroughly agree with him that there must be a moral basis for people&#146;s behaviour in industries and activities that depend on trust. The noble Lord, Lord Turner of Ecchinswell, the chairman of the Financial Services Authority, will produce his report on 18 March on his conclusions on the FSA and the changes that need to be made. That will address a number of points also made by the noble Lord, Lord Howard of Rising.</p>

<a name="90302-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="09030248000009"></a>From my perspective, I think that there needs to be a zeal and determination in the pursuit of those who have done wrong. There also needs to be a strong set of requirements about behaviour and conduct that are deserving of trust. The issues of remuneration that have been referred to will be at the heart of some of the recommendations made by the noble Lord, Lord Turner. Supervision and the behaviour of individuals must always be the first port of call in stopping poor judgment and bad behaviour. There are limitations to what regulation can achieve, as we have seen in other jurisdictions, which do not operate under our FSMA but under their own particular regulatory processes, which have also been found to have shortcomings in the recent global crisis.</p>

<a name="90302-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="09030248000010"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Smith and Lord Howard, raised questions about Sir Fred Goodwin. I am happy to have the opportunity of saying something on the matter. Noble Lords will remember that I was involved over the weekend of 10, 11 and 12 October in decisions relating to the capitalisation, funding and liquidity of Britain&#146;s banks; discussions which, if they had not been successfully completed, would have made it difficult for us to have seen markets open on the Monday morning with the confidence that emerged as a result of the decisions made.</p>

<a name="90302-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="09030248000011"></a>I understand that the board of the Royal Bank of Scotland agreed with &#147;regret&#148;, in its words, that Sir Fred Goodwin should leave on Friday 10 October. I did not meet with Sir Tom McKillop and the senior independent director, Mr Bob Scott, until the evening of Saturday 11 October. In my meetings with the senior independent director and the chairman of both the Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS, I was accompanied by a partner at Slaughter and May acting on behalf of the Treasury. In those meetings, I used a standard script. I said that in exchange for support, we would expect there to be  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_586"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column 586</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>no rewards for failure. We would expect the boards to minimise the cost of any severance that would arise and we would expect those departing from the banks to mitigate to the maximum possible amount the cost of their departure.</p>

<a name="90302-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="09030248000012"></a>I also added that I respected legal commitments and the rule of law&#151;here I addressed the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Howard of Rising&#151;and that I would not expect any company to break a legal and contractual agreement to which it was committed. I was assured that the pension arrangement for Sir Fred Goodwin reflected 30 years of service and no mention was made to me of discretion in that respect. No sum was mentioned, although Mr Bob Scott told me that Sir Fred&#146;s pension would be a large sum. However, that would come as no surprise to Members of this House, who have studied the large pension rights that self-appointed chief executives and leaders of our financial institutions have negotiated for themselves with their boards of directors. I believe that I was only advised of the sum of the pension a few days later. I did not seek approval from the Prime Minister or the Chancellor of the Exchequer because I was not being asked to give approval. To pick up the term used by the noble Lord, Lord Smith, I did not endorse the pension of Sir Fred Goodwin; indeed, I have taken action to persuade Sir Fred Goodwin, as a matter of honour and decency, taking into account the huge losses that that bank has now reported and the substantial dependence it has placed on public funds, to make a significant gesture in terms of forgoing his pension or a major part of it. However, that must be a matter for Sir Fred Goodwin.</p>

<a name="90302-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="09030248000013"></a>I repeat that I do not believe that it would be incumbent on a Minister to encourage directors of the board of any company, bank or any other industrial enterprise, to seek to break a legal agreement. That said, UK Financial Investments, the body that holds the investment in Lloyds and RBS, has written to Sir Philip Hampton, the new chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland, seeking a full explanation of the decision-making process and, in particular, ensuring that all directors of the Royal Bank of Scotland were fully informed. But for the avoidance of doubt, I did not approve Sir Fred&#146;s pension, I was shown no papers, I was given no advice because no decision was sought from me in respect of his pension. I am grateful to the noble Lords, Lord Smith and Lord Howard, for providing me with an opportunity to set the record straight that I did not expect to receive this evening, but at which I have leapt with relish and alacrity.</p>

The Financial Services and Markets Act does give the FSA a financial stability objective in respect of its need to maintain market confidence.

I would be horrified if bonuses paid at the FSA were in any way related to fines. Wheel-clamping mentality is not the way forward. On the issue of employee numbers, I believe that this is a matter that the noble Lord, Lord Turner, will no doubt consider. However, noble Lords will perhaps reflect on the fact that the cost of any shortcomings in regulation is very expensive. Therefore, we have to weigh resource against risk.</p>

It will perhaps benefit the Committee if I speak to Amendments 85 and 85A as well as to Amendment 84 in order to speed matters. Clause 39(2), for example, gives remarkable and unacceptable powers to the Secretary of State. It says nothing about whether or not the Secretary of State can increase or reduce the powers given. The Delegated Powers Committee says of Clause 39(2) that it inserts a new section into the British Nationality Act 1981,</p>
<ul><a name="09030248000132"></a>&#147;under which regulations may be made which amend the length of the qualifying time period&#151;both the default qualifying period, and the period by which it may be reduced for those who meet the activity condition&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09030248000024"></a>As drafted, this clause also allows the Secretary of State to increase the period allowed. That seems to us to be far too flexible and the sort of thing that needs therefore to be constrained.</p>

<a name="90302-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="09030248000025"></a>The merit in Amendment 85A is that it adds a further degree of advice and therefore an extra degree of autonomy in enabling the Secretary of State to consider whether completed activities are of benefit to the individual. We are immensely concerned by the breadth of powers given to central government in this Bill, as in so many other Bills that come before the House. The idea that the Secretary of State will be able to determine whether the Women&#146;s Institute in Upper Medlicott or wherever is a viable body for which a young Muslim woman can volunteer stretches the imagination. My daughter is a civil servant and I recognise that civil servants in London are tremendously efficient and far-sighted, but their ability to check on what is happening in Upper Wharfedale, Upper Wensleydale or wherever is relatively limited. The purpose of Amendments 84, 85 and 85A, therefore, is in different

<a name="90302-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="09030248000026"></a>I have to say more strongly that, if the Government are not able to bring back a more restrictive version of page 32, line 3, many of us will be strongly motivated to vote against that at Report. As Amendment 84 suggests, we are extremely unhappy with the laxity of flexibility given to the Secretary of State by the whole of this section. I beg to move.</p>

It attempts to establish who is going to be in charge of deciding where volunteers are invited to go and what the process is by which it is then known that they have volunteered: they will presumably have had some box ticked by the referee in order to tell somebody that they have undertaken the voluntary work in order to presumably have another box ticked by the UK Border Agency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="09030248000029"></a>The Minister said that the paper on the design group was in the Library. It is not. I wonder, therefore, if we could arrange to have copies sent to us as soon as possible or to make sure that, if it is meant to be in the Library, it is in the Library. The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, asked for it during the dinner break and it was not there. Perhaps we could be directed towards it, as I think that it is very important.</p>

<a name="90302-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="09030248000030"></a>Also, the Minister answered only indirectly the question that I raised earlier about how long applicants would have to do voluntary work for. I think that he said at the end of his remarks that it would be done all the way through from the pre-probationary stage right to the end of probation. However, there must be a time limit because applicants cannot be expected to do four years of voluntary work in order to reduce their time limit by two years. Perhaps we could have an answer on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="09030248000031"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, said, a lot of unanswered questions remain. In order to decide whether this is going to be of any benefit to anybody&#151;the country, the applicant or the people ticking the boxes to make sure that they have their bits of paper in the right place&#151;questions have to be answered about the right place for those bits of paper and who will make the final decision on whether someone has achieved what is required to enable them to be fast-tracked.</p>

If this amendment comes before us again, should we not devolve that decision to the Assembly in Wales and the Parliament in Scotland so that those who are in touch with the grass roots will be the people who decide whether an activity is of benefit to the individual or the wider community?</p>

I can give noble Lords an assurance that it was placed in the Library. Indeed, I was rather surprised, not to say perturbed, when I heard that the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, had not been able to get a copy of it during the dinner break. I asked my colleagues in the office to check that it is indeed in the Library. It may have taken a little finding, but it is there, and I can assure the noble Baroness that it is available as we speak. As I said earlier, it gives a lot of answers that show at least how far we have got in relation to our discussions at great length before dinner. Hopefully enhanced by our communications twixt now and Report, it will form the basis of our discussions at that stage.</p>

<a name="90302-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="09030248000034"></a>The noble Baroness asked how long the volunteering should last. It will be on the initiative of the applicant who can state on the form applying for probationary service that active voluntary service has been, is being or will be undertaken, so it will be driven by what the applicant seeks to do. If they can say that they have been volunteering for a number of years before they get to active citizenship, and the claim can be refereed and proved, they will have demonstrated their commitment. It may be that the referee feels that more evidence is needed to justify the applicant having met the criteria for sustained volunteering, particularly from the voluntary organisation that the applicant has been assisting, but this should be seen not in terms of having to complete a course of action but as a proper act of volunteering.</p>

<a name="90302-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="09030248000035"></a>I turn to the point made by the noble Lord. Questions of migration policy, the UK Border Agency and everything that goes with them are national rather than regional policy issues. We have already said that the organisations monitoring and therefore tick-boxing the applicants will, in many cases, come from the 87 local authorities that have already formed a body for dealing with this. They will come from the larger charities and organisations that have banded together to provide the monitoring service. In that sense, the scheme will be local in nature. I cannot see a role for the Assembly and the Scottish Parliament in this, given that a unit is to be formed to assist in migration policy, which, as I have said, is a national area.</p>

<a name="90302-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="09030248000036"></a>I assure noble Lords that we will respond with further information as soon as we can. Indeed, I am strongly reminded by the comments of the noble Baroness&#151;if I was not by our one-and-a-half hour debate before dinner&#151;that this is not seen by noble Lords to be developed sufficiently to the point at which they would sign off on it, as they say. I have also given an assurance that, when the design group has completed its work and the Government seek to put the details into regulations, it will be necessary for them to be affirmed by a resolution of the House. I hope, therefore, that the amendment can be withdrawn at this stage so that we can return to the debate on Report, by which time, I hope, we will have a much more comprehensive picture available to us.</p>

<a name="90302-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="09030248000037"></a>Again, I apologise for the fact that there may have been some confusion about the availability of the paper, which I can confirm was placed in the Library in the latter part of last week. It should have been available to Members because it would have been helpful to our debate before dinner.</p>

It is all right to say that the referee will sign it off, but it is not in the applicants&#146; interests not to know whether there is a minimum or maximum amount that they have to do. One person might get away with a week, whereas someone else might still be flogging it out two and a half years later, and they would both be equitable in terms of the reduction of two years. It is a bit flimsy to leave it so that they do not have to do a specific amount of volunteer work.</p>

<p><a name="st_231"></a>
<a name="09030248000039"></a><b><a name="90302-0014.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09030248000157"></a>Lord Brett:</b> I am not necessarily saying that that would be the case. The design group will work on this. Undoubtedly, the design group will discuss with the organisations that it represents what would be, in each case, a considered amount of voluntary activity. We have to avoid, on the one hand, someone delivering one leaflet for a good cause on one day being equal to, on the other, someone spending lunchtimes helping out at a local community centre two days a week for two years. That is for the design group&#146;s consideration and will undoubtedly form part of its recommendations when it has completed its work.</p>

<p><a name="st_232"></a>
<a name="09030248000040"></a><b><a name="90302-0014.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09030248000158"></a>Lord Wallace of Saltaire:</b> I am not entirely happy with the terms in which the noble Lord has answered this debate. Volunteering is, by its nature, a local activity. It takes place within local communities and you are likely to operate, quite often, with local charities. I was thinking, as I sat down, of the Rylstone Women&#146;s Institute, which I happen to know well. Indeed, my wife has autographs of all the leading members of the Rylstone Women&#146;s Institute from when it first produced a calendar. Noble Lords will know how well it did with that calendar. It is not, except by several degrees, a national organisation; it is very much rooted in the local community. To say that the border agency is a national agency and will therefore deal with larger charities rings all sorts of alarm bells.</p>

<a name="90302-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="09030248000041"></a>I recall that, when I was engaged in the Offender Management Bill last year, the Government talked again about larger voluntary organisations. It is much more convenient to handle larger organisations than to deal with little local bodies that get in the way. The Conservative Party is these days converted to localism, at least in principle. If we are trying to get active citizenship off the ground at the local level, we must find a better way of doing it. That is my first point.</p>

<a name="90302-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="09030248000042"></a>Secondly, the noble Lord has not answered the question about the laxity of the drafting of Clause 39(2), which allows the Minister to increase, as well as to reduce, the qualifying period for citizenship. Unless that is tightened up considerably, so that very careful procedures are required before a change is made, we are minded to divide on that on Report. As it stands, it is clearly not satisfactory.</p>

Therefore, one of the suggestions from the paper that is in the Library is that it may mean larger organisations validating the work of smaller organisations if the smaller organisations do not have the resources to do it themselves. Again, local authorities are often candidates for providing that kind of validation, either by granting aid or by having a register of charities in the local authority area. We are anxious to avoid a situation where only large charities are beneficiaries and, indeed, where volunteers can offer their services only to larger charities. We require the agreement, understanding and support of larger voluntary organisations to take smaller organisations under their umbrella and look after them, either on a geographical basis or perhaps on the basis of one form of social or other activity.</p>

<a name="90302-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="09030248000044"></a>On the point raised by the noble Lord about the ability to extend or reduce the length of time, the simple and brutal point from the Government&#146;s point of view is that, as the noble Lord said, the amendment would restrict the power to amend the qualifying periods. I resist the amendment, as it would represent an inappropriate restriction on the Secretary of State&#146;s power to develop immigration policy. We live in a dynamic and fast-changing world and it is wholly appropriate that the Secretary of State should have sufficient flexibility within the legislation to react to changes as they happen. I can reassure the Committee that any regulations brought forward that sought to change the qualifying period would be subject to the affirmative procedure. That is the assurance that we offer and I hope that the noble Lord will feel that it is sufficient for him to withdraw his amendment. However, on the basis of what he said, I recognise that he might not simply withdraw it but may well return to it at a later stage. The reassurance that we put before the Committee is that we will follow the affirmative resolution procedure should the Government desire to extend or change in any way the pattern established in the clause.</p>

After all, the Government have signed, but not yet ratified, the convention on naturalisation, which refers to a maximum of 10 years for qualification. Do the Government wish to retain the freedom to extend way beyond 10 years or are there no limitations on the variability that one might introduce under Clause 39(2)?</p>

We are seeking to have on the face of the Bill the ability, in extraordinary circumstances and in the dynamic society in which we live, to make proposals that will be subject to confirmation under the affirmative resolution procedure. We have no desire at this stage to make any changes; the changes are in the Bill that we have brought forward. It is wrong to presume from the fact that we need an enabling clause that there is any intention at the moment to do anything. However, we do live, and have lived over the past half-century, in extraordinary circumstances of migration. One thinks of the current problems in Zimbabwe and the problems in east Africa

<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="09030248000049"></a>We move now to consider Clause 40 which relates to children born in the United Kingdom to members of the Armed Forces. Its provisions follow the publication of the Ministry of Defence Command Paper of July 2008, <I>The Nation&#146;s Commitment: Cross-Government Support to our Armed Forces, their Families and Veterans.</I> In Clause 40, the Government make provision for those born within the United Kingdom or a qualifying territory, at least one of whose parents is serving in the British Armed Forces, to be born as British citizens. So the clause benefits those who are born after a day to be appointed. It also makes provision for children born in the United Kingdom but not in a qualifying territory after the appointed day, whose parents enter the British armed services while a child is under 18, to register as British citizens subject to the good character test set out in Clause 43.</p>

<a name="90302-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="09030248000050"></a>Those eligible to serve in the British Armed Forces are British citizens, British nationals other than British citizens, Commonwealth citizens and Irish citizens. It seems very complicated that children should be distinguished according to whether they are born in the United Kingdom or in a qualifying territory, and according to the particular status in the Armed Forces of their parents. If the Government are seeking to be generous in their treatment of the armed services, it would be quite simple to draft a clause which said to parents, &#147;You are eligible to become members of the Armed Forces because of the close ties that you have with the United Kingdom. Your service in the Armed Forces has strengthened those ties and because of that your children will either be born British citizens or be eligible to register as British citizens&#148;. That would be a simple way of looking at it rather than the way that the clause has been drafted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="09030248000051"></a>Amendment 86 would ensure that all those born to serving members of the Armed Forces in the United Kingdom or in a qualifying territory, whether before or after the commencement of the Act, are entitled to be registered as British citizens. The Act specifically reserves entitlement to those born after its commencement. The clause, as drafted, can create a situation where a child born after the provision comes into force may be a British citizen but a child born before the Act comes into force to the same parents is not. The younger brother becomes a British citizen; the older brother does not. Distinguishing between children born before the Act comes into force and those born after is not, in my respectful submission, a sensible provision.</p>

<a name="90302-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="09030248000052"></a>The first group of children to benefit from the amendment will be those born between now and the appointed day. In case anybody thinks this is an academic point, one has only to look at the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 in which the Government amended the British Nationality Act 1991 so that children born after the appointed day to British fathers not married to their mothers could, on proof of paternity, acquire their father&#146;s British nationality. The appointed day did not arrive for four years so all those children born before the day that the Act came into force when the Bill was passed did not have the benefit of those provisions. A four-year delay took place. You can imagine that in the future children who were born in the interim period will be campaigning because they were born on the wrong side of the blanket, if I may use that expression, and I hope your Lordships are following me. If you are in the forces, what do you do? Do you refrain from having children until the Home Office decides that it is time for this Act to be passed?</p>

<a name="90302-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="09030248000053"></a>The second group of people to benefit from Amendment 86 will be those already born in the United Kingdom or a qualifying territory to a mother or father who was a serving member of the Armed Forces at the time of their birth. The provision comes into force, as I have already commented, on or after the appointed day. I am referring to children who were born before the Bill was passed. To be serving members of the Armed Forces, their parents will have had to have been eligible in the sense that I have described and have built on that connection through their service. Why should their children not also benefit? Amendment 86 removes the starting point, the appointed day, whenever that should be&#151;when the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State or whoever decides that these provisions should come into force.</p>

<a name="90302-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="09030248000054"></a>The purpose of the second amendment is to ensure that the application for registration need not be made while the person is still a child. The third amendment would ensure that the parents must have been in the Army while the UK-born child was under 18, if a person is to register under this clause. The purpose of these amendments is to ensure that UK-born children whose parents served in the British Army while the child was still a child may register even when they have ceased to be children themselves, when they are adults at the time of the application. By removing the words, &#147;while still a minor&#148;, the amendment would continue to require that the parents were serving during the child&#146;s minority but would not require that the person be a child at the time of application for registration.

<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="09030248000055"></a>We think that this makes some sense of the way in which the Government have drafted these provisions. I am sure there is a great deal of good will behind the Government&#146;s purpose, and I hope that that extends at least to considering in some detail the submissions that I have made to the Committee now. I beg to move.</p>

It would be unjust to the children of members of the Armed Forces if, by the accident of their being born the year before this clause came into effect, a child who was born a year later had a right that his elder brother or sister did not have. That has a degree of discrimination against children who are equally children of members of the Armed Forces. I cannot at the moment see the logic of that, other than just to reduce the number of people who would be entitled to become British citizens. In the context of a clause that is intended to be generous, this shows a lack of generosity to child members of the family.</p>

The question here, as the noble Lord said, is what happens to children before we commence Clause 40. To deal with the question of delay, and he cited substantial delay, it is intended on this occasion to implement Clause 40 by order in late 2009, following commencement of the final parts of the Armed Forces Act 2006. Those born before commencement continue to benefit from citizenship at birth or by registration under Section 1(3) of the British Nationality Act 1987. I shall explain.</p>

<a name="90302-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="09030248000058"></a>The amendments would enable them to apply for registration as British citizens as if they would have qualified had the new clause been in place when they were born. To reply to this, I should explain that Clause 40 does not provide the children of members of the Armed Forces with a new entitlement to British citizenship; it clarifies an existing eligibility and puts it on a clear statutory footing. So, a child born in the UK today would be recognised as a British citizen if either of his parents was a member of the British Armed Forces at the time of his birth. Equally, if that child is born in the UK today and one of his parents then enlists, we will register him as a British citizen if the application is made while he is still a child.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="09030248000059"></a>The amendments propose that an application or registration can be made by an adult if, when they were a child, their parent became a member of the Armed Forces. However, Section 1 of the British Nationality Act 1981 is principally concerned with the British citizenship rights of minors. Furthermore, there are alternative avenues for an adult who is or was resident  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_596"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column 596</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in the UK to acquire British citizenship, most notably under Section 1(4) and Section 6(1) of the 1981 Act. It is also important to note that those persons born since 1983&#151;when the British Nationality Act 1981 was commenced&#151;to a parent who then became a member of the Armed Forces are already captured by the current parameters of Section 1(3) of that Act, because their parent has, for nationality purposes, been treated as settled from the point of joining the Armed Forces.</p>

<a name="90302-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="09030248000060"></a>The reason for this hinges on the definition of &#147;settled&#148; used for the purposes of Section 1 of the 1981 Act. Under Section 1(1), a child born in the UK or qualifying territories is automatically a British citizen if either parent is settled when he is born. If a child is born in the UK and does not gain British citizenship under that section, but one of his parents subsequently becomes settled here, that child can apply to be registered as a British citizen under Section 1(3) of the Act. The application must be submitted before the child&#146;s 18th birthday and, if the child is aged 10 or over, he must be of good character. If those conditions are met, he is entitled to British citizenship.</p>

<a name="90302-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="09030248000061"></a>Those serving in the British Armed Forces are exempt from immigration control under Section 8(4)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971 and have, as a matter of policy, been treated as settled for nationality purposes since commencement of the British Nationality Act 1981. This means that any child born in this country today will be eligible for British citizenship under either Section 1(1) or Section 1(3) of the 1981 Act, depending on whether the parent is in our Armed Forces when the child is born, or enlists later. We will continue to apply this policy in practice until Clause 40 has commenced, which means that there should be no children missing out on British citizenship because of their birth date. I hope that reassurance is helpful to the Committee, and that it allows the noble Lord to withdraw his amendments.</p>

<p><a name="09030248000110"></a>The Prime Minister confirmed that a couple of days later, adding that those concerned were potentially stateless and now had a nationality.</p>

<a name="90302-0015.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="09030248000070"></a>Following this decision, under the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997, some 9,000 members of Hong Kong&#146;s ethnic minorities have been able to register as British citizens. Unfortunately, the remaining few hundred do not qualify because of an arbitrary residence test. British nationals (overseas), British overseas citizens, British subjects and British protected persons who apply under the 1997 Act must have been ordinarily resident in Hong Kong on 4 February 1997. In 2002, when Section 4B was inserted in the British Nationality Act 1981, the ordinary residence test was abolished for otherwise stateless British overseas citizens, British subjects and British protected persons. Amendment 90 would put solely BNOs on an equal footing with persons holding one of those lesser categories of British nationality.</p>

<a name="90302-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="09030248000071"></a>At the time of the passage of the 2002 Act, a senior official wrote that the reason for the exclusion of BNOs from Section 4B was that British nationals overseas were excluded from the registration entitlement because the vast majority of them held or had held another nationality, and those who did not were believed to be already satisfactorily catered for in terms of the 1997 Act. I am afraid that that was not correct, because, on the qualifying date, some were abroad on temporary assignment, some were studying overseas, some minors were abroad with their parents, and there were a few cases where a child was living in Hong Kong, but, because his parents were abroad, the child was not deemed to be ordinarily resident of Hong Kong.</p>

<a name="90302-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="09030248000072"></a>The elimination of the ordinary residence condition is consistent with general principles set out by Home Office Ministers. On a separate point related to BDTCs, the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland, specifically told me:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a><a name="09030248000124"></a>&#147;We would prefer not to base our policy on the application of notional registration dates and it seems unnecessary to do so&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 26/2/06; col. <I>WA40</I>.]</p>

<a name="90302-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="09030248000073"></a>When I have raised the plight of these people on previous occasions, Ministers have said that all of them have the right of abode in Hong Kong and that they regard that position as satisfactory. Technically, they are wrong, because, under the basic law, an ethnic minority BNO can lose the right of abode&#151;and, in fact, quite of them have lost it, as I have pointed out in correspondence with Ministers. They are theoretically subject to deportation by the director of immigration, and would lose all their civic rights and privileges.</p>

<a name="90302-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="09030248000074"></a>A more critical error by the Home Office was to wrongly equate right of abode with nationality. Since 1997, solely BNOs have been living on Chinese territory as aliens. They have no country or nationality of their own. Britain, the country of their passport, refuses to accept them. It is only right that we equalise the position of solely BNOs with that of British overseas citizens, British subjects and British protected persons. To do this, Amendment 90 brings BNOs into Section 4(b) of the British Nationality Act 1981, which covers otherwise stateless British overseas citizens, British subjects and British protected persons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="09030248000075"></a>The amendment would also remove two bizarre paradoxes in our nationality law. First, it penalises any member of the British ethnic minority in Hong Kong who took steps to retain their British nationality prior to the handover. An otherwise stateless former Hong Kong BDTC who registered as a BNO needs to meet the arbitrary residence test that I have described, whereas if he failed to register as a BNO, he automatically became a British overseas citizen on 1 July 1997 and does not need to satisfy any ordinary residence test to register for British citizenship. Why should the law penalise those who took steps to remain British? Surely we ought to fix that.</p>

<a name="90302-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="09030248000076"></a>Secondly, the child of an otherwise stateless BNO becomes a BOC at birth, giving him the right to register for full British citizenship even though his parents are denied the same entitlement.</p>

<a name="90302-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="09030248000077"></a>Before Labour came to power in 1997, the present Justice Secretary, Mr Jack Straw, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52"></a><a name="09030248000125"></a>&#147;A British national overseas passport carries with it the right of abode nowhere. The claim that this amounts to British nationality is pure sophistry. Common sense and common humanity demand that we give these people full British citizenship&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="09030248000078"></a>Amendment 96 gives effect to Government commitments that children will not be born stateless to persons from the solely British ethnic minority. In 1984, a Home Office memorandum stated unambiguously:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a><a name="09030248000126"></a>&#147;Firm assurances were given by the Government during debates that no BDTCs would become stateless as a result of the agreement with China, and neither would their children born after 1 July 1997&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030248000111"></a>In the Second Reading debate on the Hong Kong Bill, at the end of 1984, the then Home Office Minister, Lady Young, told me:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54"></a><a name="09030248000127"></a>&#147;The Government&#146;s position is that no former Hong Kong BDTC nor any child born to such a person, should be made stateless as a result of the amendments envisaged in the Bill&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 14/3/85; col. 237.]</p>

<p><a name="09030248000112"></a>In October 1987, the Home Office published a Command Paper stating that,</p>
<ul><a name="09030248000135"></a>&#147;the underlying principle is that no one who loses BDTC status as a result of the order, nor any child born after 1 July 1997 to such a person, should be stateless&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90302-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="09030248000079"></a>We have at least three policy statements on the record that no one who lost BDTC status as a result of the handover of Hong Kong to China, nor any child born to them, should be stateless. However, the provisions for reducing statelessness in Article 6 of the Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order 1986 have resulted in children being born stateless to former Hong Kong BDTCs. Amendment 96 will rectify this breach of faith and eliminate the statelessness of children born to former Hong Kong BDTCs. It will entitle the beneficiaries to acquire British overseas citizenship, including all stateless children born on or after 1 July 1997, consistent with the arrangements in the 1986 order.</p>

Ajab Taha Barma was born in Hong Kong on 30 July 2007 to parents who were both Hong Kong-born BDTCs otherwise than by descent. The parents lost their BDTC status on 1 July 1997 by virtue of Article 3 in the 1986 order, and the young

She does not qualify for BOC citizenship under any of the automatic provisions for conferral of this status to the children of former Hong Kong BDTCs, because they do not cover children of Hong Kong BDTCs whose parents qualified as British citizens under the British Nationality Hong Kong Act 1990.

It would of course be open to any future Home Secretary to make use of this provision in relation to the descendants of non-Chinese BDTCs in Hong Kong if he were satisfied that in any particular case the circumstances justified it&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 14/3/85; col. 238.]</ul>
<p><a name="09030248000113"></a>Ajab&#146;s parents applied for British overseas citizenship on her behalf under Section 27(1), quoting the policy commitments already mentioned, but were refused on the perverse grounds that she has no connection with British territory. This amendment serves to put the matter right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="09030248000081"></a>We have reneged on the firm commitments to the solely British ethnic minorities and made children such as Ajab stateless, in spite of numerous ministerial statements and command papers that said that that could not happen. That should now be rectified, and this amendment does so in a manner consistent with provisions for others in the same group. I beg to move.</p>

I spent a great deal of time in Hong Kong in the 1980s and early 1990s, and I was aware at that time of the very considerable fear felt by those who were likely to lose their nationality and become stateless under the provisions of the 1997 handover.</p>

<a name="90302-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="09030248000086"></a>I draw to the attention of the Minister the report of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, in February 2008&#151;his review of citizenship entitled, <I>Citizenship: Our Common Bond</I>. He considered the position of British nationals overseas who have their status by virtue of their connection to Hong Kong and were not affected by the changes in 2002. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55"></a><a name="09030248000128"></a>&#147;They hold the only extant and significant form of British citizenship which is not full citizenship and does not allow an unqualified right to enter and remain in the UK&#148;.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_601"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column 601</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09030248000114"></a>It is a very poor form of nationality granted to these people if they cannot even come to the United Kingdom and stay here. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a><a name="09030248000129"></a>&#147;The only option which would be characterized as fair would be to offer existing BN(O) holders the right to gain full British citizenship&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030248000115"></a>So it is recognised by the noble and learned Lord that that is something that should be tackled. The qualification that he put in was that he had been told by somebody that it,</p>
<ul><a name="09030248000137"></a>&#147;would be a breach of the commitments made between China and the UK in the 1984 Joint Declaration on the future of Hong Kong&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09030248000116"></a>and that it would not be possible to vary the terms of that treaty. But when one examines the exchange of memoranda that occurred at that time, one sees that the Chinese memorandum said only:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57"></a><a name="09030248000130"></a>&#147;Under the Nationality Law of the People&#146;s Republic of China, all Hong Kong Chinese compatriots, whether or not they are holders of British Dependent Territories citizens&#146; Passports, are Chinese nationals&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030248000117"></a>So if you are ethnically Chinese, you automatically had Chinese nationality. The memorandum continues:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58"></a><a name="09030248000131"></a>&#147;Taking account of the historical background of Hong Kong and its realities, the [... Chinese Government] ... will, with effect from 1 July 1997 permit Chinese nationals in Hong Kong who were previously called &#145;British Dependent Territories citizens&#146; to use travel documents issued by the Government of the United Kingdom for the purpose of travelling to other States and regions. The above Chinese nationals will not be entitled to British consular protection in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and other parts of the People&#146;s Republic of China on account of their holding the above-mentioned travel documents&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030248000118"></a>That is all that they said on the topic, and that really has nothing to do with the plight of these people who have been left in limbo or of their children, as my noble friend pointed out. It is time that we did something to right that wrong. The amendment that my noble friend has brought forward this evening can do that and should have the Government&#146;s support.</p>

<a name="90302-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="09030248000087"></a>Hong Kong is a very special place. In any event, on a cold March day such as today I cannot imagine that many people living in Hong Kong who come into this category would prefer to come to this country or to attempt to make their living here in today&#146;s economic climate, but at least they should have the right to do so. We have an obligation that must be fulfilled. Far too long a period has passed since 1997 without the injustice that has been done to those people being put right.</p>

I join the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, and others in commending the endurance of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, and his commitment to end what he sees as an injustice. However, I am afraid that I must resist these amendments as we believe that British National (Overseas) citizens, who gained that status from a connection with Hong Kong, and British overseas citizens resident in Hong Kong are already fully catered for within British nationality legislation. We also believe that associated provisions in law to prevent the statelessness of those persons, and their children, formerly resident in Hong Kong are sufficiently comprehensive as to make statutory change unnecessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="09030248000089"></a>Section 4B of the British Nationality Act 1981 was introduced in 2003 to benefit particular categories of persons because of the historical implications of the break-up of the British Empire. It is our position that it would not be appropriate to extend this to further groups. The status of British National (Overseas) was introduced to cover those British dependent territories citizens from Hong Kong who may not have acquired Chinese citizenship when sovereignty was transferred to China in 1997. This status was provided for under the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Order 1986. Those who could not register as a British National (Overseas) could become a British overseas citizen if they would otherwise be stateless. This also applied to their children if they would otherwise be stateless following the partition of Hong Kong.</p>

<a name="90302-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="09030248000090"></a>The Government at the time recognised that there may be some who would not become Chinese citizens after the handover, and so also provided in the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997 for those British nationals who were ordinarily resident in Hong Kong both on the date of application and immediately before 4 February 1997 to become British citizens.</p>

<a name="90302-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="09030248000091"></a>The Government accept that there may be some who cannot benefit under this provision, as they have not maintained ordinary residence in Hong Kong. These people, however, having established themselves elsewhere in the world through choice, will have a route to another citizenship. Section 4B of the British Nationality Act 1981 was introduced following the abolition of the special voucher scheme to allow those who would have been eligible to come to the UK under that scheme from East African countries, had it continued, to do so as a British citizen following their registration.</p>

<a name="90302-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="09030248000092"></a>We do not intend to extend the registration provisions of Section 4B to British Nationals (Overseas). Most of them will already have a right of abode in Hong Kong or elsewhere. This contrasts with the difficulties faced by other types of British nationals around the world, many of whom do not have a right of abode in any other country. Presumably the people that noble Lords wish to include, apart from those I have already stated, are those who have not maintained a link with Hong Kong through ordinary residence and, therefore, may not be able to register.</p>

<a name="90302-0015.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="09030248000093"></a>The majority of unsuccessful applicants under the 1997 Act are currently from people with a Nepalese connection who are not living in Hong Kong. This is because they do not meet the requirement of being ordinarily resident in Hong Kong, which is critical to registration under the 1997 Act. In the 12 years since that Act was passed, it could be argued that such people had the opportunity to settle elsewhere and acquire citizenship and thereby are not stateless. This includes the possibility of acquiring British citizenship or another nationality by naturalisation on the basis of residence.</p>

<a name="90302-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="09030248000094"></a>Amendment 96 also proposes to enable British overseas citizenship to be acquired by a person born stateless to a parent who held British Dependent Territories citizenship before 1 July 1997, and therefore to a parent who neither acquired British National (Overseas) citizenship by registration or British overseas citizenship under Article 6(2) of the relevant order. This would in

We do not believe there to be many children born to former British Dependent Territories citizens in Hong Kong who have not acquired another nationality.</p>

The Minister has a copy of the letter of refusal, so I cannot see how he can maintain that it was possible for people to apply for discretionary leave.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="09030248000097"></a>There are also extensive avenues by which a child born stateless can acquire a form of British nationality in particular areas. I was going on to say something in light of the comments made, which I shall deal with after I have first dealt with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. We have no knowledge of Red Cross passports and their role, although I shall inquire to find out what they are and, I hope, send the noble Lord a note on that.

<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="09030248000098"></a>Returning to the main issue, I note that the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, raised a number of individual cases, on which I cannot, of course, comment. I am happy to set out the policy which has been applied when deciding on particular categories of cases. I continue to offer him and other Members of the House an opportunity either to visit the UK Border Agency nationality group in Liverpool to see how the caseworking process in action is operated and to discuss how decisions have been reached. If noble Lords are unable to travel to Liverpool, we would be happy to provide the facilities for such a meeting in London.</p>

After all, we have now been arguing the case for 22 years since the Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order 1986 and the handover of Hong Kong to the Chinese in 1997, and we have not been able to get anywhere with successive Ministers, although we have had undertakings from them. I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, and to my noble friend Lord Thomas for their support for the propositions that we have advanced.</p>

<a name="90302-0015.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="09030248000103"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, said, statelessness is a very severe disability and it is monstrous that the Government should be visiting this on a small number of helpless people who, they know, cannot retaliate. We are not talking about a vast number of people; we are talking about the people who failed the ordinary residence test, not because they had left to go to some other country, as the Minister pretends, but because they were absent on short-term assignments, were studying abroad or were children whose parents had taken them out of the country. The fourth category that I gave was the children who were in Hong Kong on the date of the handover but who were not counted because their parents were abroad and therefore they were deemed not to be ordinary residents.</p>

<a name="90302-0015.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="09030248000104"></a>The Minister did not reply to any of those points. He just ignored them and said that all these people must have departed Hong Kong to live permanently in another country. That is completely false. He also ignored everything that I said about the assurances that had been given by successive Ministers that no person who lost BDTC status as a result of the handover of Hong Kong to China, nor any child born to such a person, would be made stateless. Therefore, these people are not fully catered for, as the Minister pretends. The provisions are not sufficiently comprehensive to make these amendments unnecessary, as we have shown, and I can produce other examples if he wishes. I do not want to have to go to Liverpool to produce examples of people who have been made stateless, because everything is in the correspondence. If the Minister asks his colleagues at the Home Office, he will find that there are plenty of letters from me about these individuals who have been made stateless, either because they were not ordinary residents at the time or because they could not fulfil other conditions.</p>

<a name="90302-0015.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="09030248000105"></a>We are not talking about thousands of people; we are talking about a very few people who were BNOs and who should have been granted the privileges that the Government promised them at the time. The Government have undoubtedly reneged and failed a small but significant minority of people. Although I shall withdraw the amendment, I do so with&#151;</p>

I shall take on board for consideration the points that he makes at such a meeting. I do not believe that that is ignoring the issue. It is recognising that there is a point that needs to be investigated. I also offered the assurance of a further discussion on Report, so I feel slightly wounded. I repeat that we are not ignoring the noble Lord&#146;s argument; I am suggesting that it has to be taken on board and, in the light of investigations, we can look again at the problem that he has set out.

<a name="90302-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="09030253000004"></a>We also argued that our amendment to remove the cut-off date would enable the Government to lift the reservation that they maintained on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. That must be the acid test of whether Clause 41 is good enough in its present wording. Article 9.2 of CEDAW provides:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a><a name="09030253000030"></a>&#147;States Parties shall grant women equal rights with men with respect to the nationality of their children.&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030253000027"></a>The UK entered a reservation to that on the basis of what we inaccurately described as certain temporary or transitional provisions, which continued from 1 January 1983 for 28 years since your Lordships approved the BNA 1981.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="09030253000005"></a>Unfortunately, as in many other clauses, the Government have made Clause 41 so convoluted that it is hard to see the wood for the trees. The critical question is whether the Government are confident that, with the passage of the clause, we will be able to withdraw the reservation that we entered to CEDAW and whether we intend to do so. I ask the Government to reply to that question now.</p>

<a name="90302-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="09030253000006"></a>One thing is clear: it will be more difficult for those born after 7 February 1961 to register and those difficulties extend to the new beneficiaries born prior to that date. The reason for that appears to be that no distinction was made in the 2002 Act between mothers who were British citizens by descent and those who were full British citizens when they gave birth. Subsection (3)(c) does not clarify, as the Explanatory Notes pretend, but restricts the rights of British mothers to transmit British citizenship to their children and to require a person wishing to take advantage of the clause to establish that his mother was not a British citizen by descent at the time of his birth, in some instances some 50 or 60 years ago.</p>

<a name="90302-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="09030253000007"></a>That reintroduces an element of discrimination between mothers and fathers who were British only by descent at the time of the child&#146;s birth under Section 5(1)(b) of the British Nationality Act, which continued in force beyond the February 1961 cut-off date in the 2002 Act. The child of a male British citizen by descent born in a foreign country was automatically a British citizen by descent immediately his birth was registered at the local British Consulate, but the child of a female British citizen by descent had no such right and now cannot claim equal treatment because of the involved wording of the clause. If that is incorrect, I hope that the Minister will say so, but as we read it, the Bill may not allow us to lift our reservation to CEDAW.</p>

<a name="90302-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="09030253000008"></a>So while we are grateful to the Government for getting rid of the February 1961 cut-off date, the removal of which the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, kept telling us, when he was the Minister, would cause the world to fall apart&#151;we never quite got an elucidation of how that would happen&#151;we are disappointed that the Government have gone to enormous lengths and added new levels of complexity to the clause simply to exclude the small number of children who might otherwise have benefited from being descended from mothers who were British citizens by descent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="09030253000009"></a>Amendment 91 deals with persons who would have been entitled to register under Clause 41 but are now dead. If that person, who could not have acquired British nationality under existing legislation, had given birth to a child in the UK after 1 January 1983 but the mother was not settled at the time, the child would not have been born British. The amendment would allow the child to register as a British citizen. The child would have a close connection to the UK because her grandmother was a British citizen and her mother, if she had lived, would also have been entitled to British citizenship. Since it has been only since 1983 that children born in the UK are not British by birth, those who could benefit from the amendment must be 26 years old at the most and many of them who wish to do so would no doubt have gained British citizenship by other routes, so the number of beneficiaries would be quite small. I beg to move.</p>

At the time of the 2002 legislation and in 2006 the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked me to support him in his efforts to secure the substance of the clause. My part was modest, but I warmly congratulate him on his constancy and his achievement. I should perhaps add that in the words of Lycidas, the noble Lord and I were,</p>

<p><a name="09030253000028"></a>and attended an Oxford college that is almost three-quarters of the way to its millennium. It is a tribute to our mutual college that we were coached in stamina and taught to take a long view. It is happy to find our goal at last achieved, even if it is in a somewhat complicated mode.

<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="09030253000015"></a>This change will benefit those born before 1948 and even those born before the 1914 legislation, if such people are still among us. The amendment suggests, in the absence of evidence for a particular application of action, that the Government should assume that a mother would have taken the necessary action to enable her child to acquire British citizenship had she been able to pass on her citizenship status by descent but for previous discrimination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="09030253000016"></a>The Government&#146;s reservation on the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women is not to our knowledge linked at all to this clause. However, new Section 4C(3C) is intended to ensure that Section 4C covers only provisions that are about a child automatically acquiring British nationality from their parent, rather than any provision where the acquisition would have required an application to be made by that parent. This is because we cannot now be sure whether such an application would have been submitted and, even if it had been, whether that application would have been successful. Therefore, this subsection provides that an applicant for registration under Section 4C can rely only on those provisions that depend on the nationality of one or both of their parents and does not depend on an application being made for registration as a person who holds that status.</p>

<a name="90302-0016.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="09030253000017"></a>New Section 4C(3D)<I></I>provides that it will not be assumed that any registration or other requirements have been met. There are a number of provisions that enable someone to acquire British nationality if certain requirements are met. For example, Section 5(1)(b) of the British Nationality Act 1948 states that a child born overseas would have been a CUKC if their birth was registered at a British consulate within a year. According to new Section 4C(3D) we will not assume that any such requirement would have been met, had previous nationality law provided for descent from a mother in the same way as a father. It is also proposed to introduce a new registration entitlement for a person born in the United Kingdom or overseas territory, whose parent would have been able to register under Section 4C&#151;as the child of a British mother&#151;but for his or her death.</p>

<a name="90302-0016.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="09030253000018"></a>For ease, I will focus here on children born in the United Kingdom. Similar provisions apply to those born in overseas territories, although there are slight differences in the routes by which those born in the territories can acquire British citizenship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="09030253000019"></a>We do not think that there could be many people who would be affected by this amendment. A person born in the United Kingdom before 1 January 1983 would have become a British citizen automatically, unless their parent was a diplomat or enemy alien. A child born after that date will become a British citizen if either parent is a British citizen or settled here. &#147;Settled&#148; is defined within the legislation as being free of immigration time restrictions and ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom.</p>

For example, those parents who were Commonwealth citizens with a mother born in the United Kingdom would have had a right of abode in the United Kingdom or the parent may have naturalised as a British citizen on the basis of their residence in the UK. Others, even though not British citizens, could have acquired settled status here by the time their children were born, such as by acquiring indefinite leave to remain in the UK.</p>

<a name="90302-0016.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="09030253000021"></a>For those born after 1983 who did not become British at birth because their parent was not settled or British on that date, there are a number of provisions by which a child born in the United Kingdom can acquire British citizenship. Any child born in the United Kingdom after 1 January 1983 who was not a British citizen at birth has an entitlement to register as a British citizen, either if the parent becomes a British citizen or settled in the UK, or if the child lives here for the first 10 years of his or her life, regardless of the status of their parents. If a child does not have an entitlement to registration, an application could be made under Section 3(1) of the Act, which provides for registration at the Home Secretary&#146;s discretion. While we would normally expect one of the parents to be a British citizen in order for this discretion to be exercised, a child could be registered if it was deemed to be in his or her best interests. In addition, there are provisions for children born in the UK who would otherwise be stateless to acquire British citizenship, which enable us to meet our obligations under the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.</p>

<a name="90302-0016.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="09030253000022"></a>I note noble Lords&#146; intention in providing for children who might be disadvantaged because of the death of a parent before that parent had an opportunity to register under Section 4C. However, I must point out that this situation would not be unique to parents who might have an entitlement to registration under Section 4C. It is wrong to assume that the parent would have wanted to register as a British citizen under Section 4C before their death. It is also wrong to assume that the parent would have met the requirements of registration under Section 4C, including after 2006 the requirement to be of good character. Furthermore, it is possible, for example, that the child&#146;s foreign parent might die before having been naturalised as a British citizen. It is not therefore appropriate to make provision only for children whose parents might have had a faulty entitlement in this respect. However, we feel that there is sufficient provision within the British Nationality Act to allow children to become British citizens. This section will

The wording of the section that we are discussing excludes certain children, although the Minister did not explain this. He did not say anything about the children of these women who were British citizens by descent, which is what I understood to be the whole point of the involved nature of the amendment compared with what is in the 2006 Act.</p>

<a name="90302-0016.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="09030253000024"></a>I take issue with the Minister&#146;s assertion that this has nothing to do with our reservation to CEDAW. I have already quoted the article in CEDAW that provides that,</p>
<ul><a name="09030253000032"></a>&#147;State parties shall grant women equal rights with men&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09030253000029"></a>with respect to the nationality of their children. The UK specifically entered a reservation to CEDAW relating to Article 9. That was that,</p>
<ul><a name="09030253000033"></a>&#147;the United Kingdom&#146;s acceptance of Article 9 shall not, however, be taken to invalidate the continuation of certain temporary or transitional provisions which will continue in force beyond that date&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09030253000025"></a>That means the date when the BNA 1981 came into force. It is clear, therefore, that there was a connection between the reservation and the provisions of Article 9, whatever the Minister may say. There may have been other reasons why there was a reservation to CEDAW, but this was certainly one of them.</p>

<a name="90302-0016.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="09030253000026"></a>I do not understand why, if there was no problem in 2002 on registration, this problem has arisen now. Obviously we will not get to the bottom of that this evening. We will have to look carefully at what the Minister has said and probably return to this matter on Report. Meanwhile, I have to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Many of those amendments stand in my name, and I offer no apology for having tabled a great many detailed amendments on this subject. I promise that I will not unduly detain the Committee, because there are much more exciting debates awaiting us down the line. However, this is a very major policy change, and in this Committee we have perhaps a unique opportunity to ask the Government some far-reaching and searching questions about a policy that potentially has enormous consequences for individual patients and for providers of healthcare services.</p>

<p><a name="09030214000004"></a>On Second Reading, the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, captured the attention of noble Lords with her story, and I am glad that she did. She gave an introduction to the subject that was informative and engaging. I want to start today with another story.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000005"></a>At the end of last week, I was sitting in my office chatting to a colleague about the fact that we were going to be having this discussion this afternoon. Someone who occasionally works in my office heard what we were saying and asked, &#147;Are you talking about direct payments?&#148;. When we said that we were, she said, &#147;Let me tell you this. We have two lots of direct payments. We have direct payments for my brother, who has learning disabilities, and that is great. I use those to have respite care for him and for me. When it gets to a point when neither one of us can cope any more, he goes away and he has some respite, and so do we, and that enables the family to restore its batteries and to carry on. I also have a direct payment for my mother, who is elderly and who has a number of different health problems. It is great, because it enables us to get a carer to come in and be with her at the times when I cannot be there. Because we get a  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC204"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column GC204</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>direct payment, we can use a private carer. We used to have to use an agency, but that was no use, because the agency carer could not come when we needed them, and now, because we have a direct payment, we can have someone at the times when she needs them. It is brilliant, because it enables me to go on working. But it is difficult, because when the local authority comes to see you, it tells you about the minutes&#151;not the hours&#151;that you&#146;re entitled to have. However, it doesn&#146;t tell you anything about insurance or national insurance. It doesn&#146;t tell you anything about what to do if it does not work out with the person whom you&#146;re working with. It doesn&#146;t tell you whether it&#146;s up to you as the employer to deal with it and, if you are, how you do that. There was an organisation that helped us a lot, but unfortunately it&#146;s packed in and there&#146;s nothing now&#148;.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000006"></a>She went on to say, &#147;In many ways, direct payments are great. They help you to do things that you couldn&#146;t otherwise do. But I am a very strong and clued-up person and I know people who understand about all this, and I find managing this a struggle. My brother and my mother could not manage this on their own, and God help anybody who doesn&#146;t have the help to get them through this, because&#151;believe you me&#151;it&#146;s a nightmare&#148;. That was her story, which is no more or less valid than that of the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell; it is just different. I mention it today because I think that it will help some Members of the Committee to understand why they have in front of them what appear to be an awful lot of detailed, technical and niggling little amendments. They are not; they seek to probe how this policy will work in practice in healthcare.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000007"></a>Most of the amendments are informed by the experience of and research conducted in social care. I remind the Committee of the genesis of direct payments. The 1993 community care Act gave care managers responsibility for purchasing packages of care for individuals who needed them. The Community Care (Direct Payments) Act 1996 gave local authorities the power to make cash payments in lieu of services to adults. Section 57 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001 made it mandatory to offer direct payments to eligible individuals; I make it clear to the Committee that, since 2000, eligible people have included those over 65 and carers for and parents of disabled children and young people, as well as people with learning disabilities and adults with physical disabilities.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000008"></a>There has been a growing sense that the way in which social care has been provided traditionally needs to be changed. That is not new; Members of the Committee will know from various policy papers that there has been a growing sense that we need to move towards personalisation of social care. Papers such as <I>Valuing People</I> in 2001, the Prime Minister&#146;s strategy report of 2005&#151;<I>Improving the Life Chances of Disabled People&#151;</I>and the strategy for an ageing population, which came out in 2005, all point in that direction. That was underlined in the Department of Health Green Paper <I>Independence, Well-being and Choice; </I>if I did not tell you that, I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Warner, would. All that coincided with the emergence of an organisation called In Control, a social enterprise&#151;a business&#151;that offers services to people who want to use direct payments, but has a wider agenda about redesigning social care systems towards self-directed  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC205"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column GC205</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>support. Over several years, there was that growing body of thought in policy&#151;it was beginning in practice as well&#151;that there should be ways in which we could make direct payments a reality and set about changing the way in which social care was delivered to, and in conjunction with, the client users.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000009"></a>In July 2005 the department announced that it would set up a pilot programme for individual budgets&#151;pilots in which people would be given payments to organise their own care. In November 2005, 12 pilot sites were announced. It is worth remembering as we go on to look at the research emanating from them that each of those sites had resources of between &#163;350,000 and &#163;400,000 from a pilot budget to enable them to be set up. Each pilot was encouraged to use tools that had been previously developed by In Control in conjunction with people who had learning disabilities. One was a resource allocation system for determining how individual budgets should be worked out.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000010"></a>The evaluation of those pilots, which is written up in a fascinating document called the IBSEN report, <I>Evaluation of the Individual Budgets </I><I>P</I><I>ilot </I><I>P</I><I>rogramme</I>,<I></I>ran from April 2006 to March 2008. It is significant that in December 2007, before that evaluation finished, Ivan Lewis, the then Minister responsible for social care, declared that individual budgets were the future direction of social care. The IBSEN report is a very interesting and substantial piece of work in which teams of researchers attempted to get into the pilots as deeply as they could to understand what was going on. They looked at people in the pilot groups and control groups of people who were not in the pilot groups and applied different statistical analysis, not just to assess people&#146;s stated feelings and well-being, but to see whether they could find verifiable evidence of improvement in people&#146;s health and social well-being&#151;for example, in their ability to manage daily life activities. The study looked at the extent to which people benefited from the process of having individual budgets, and at whether they found that process difficult or stressful. The research teams considered the impact on commissioning and on both statutory and voluntary providers. Crucially, the IBSEN research looked at cost and cost-effectiveness.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000011"></a>In relation to the proposals before us it is important to state that health and health budgets were no part of this. They could not be as there was no legal basis on which to do that. The pilots were solely about social care. There were people in receipt of both healthcare and social care who found it difficult and frustrating that their healthcare was subject to a completely different regime from that of their social care. The report is open about some of the limitations of both the pilots and the research. The pilots were run by local authorities which volunteered, and the report recognises that there is tendency for those who are most keen and enthusiastic to put themselves forward. Indeed, a number of authorities had more experience of working with In Control than others.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000012"></a>The timetable for the pilot slipped, which meant that by the time the evaluation took place, some people had only their individual budget for a matter of a few weeks or months. Indeed, some of the people  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC206"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column GC206</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>interviewed had not had their budget at all. Therefore, the timetable during which the evaluation ran was greatly condensed.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000013"></a>There were many key findings, but I do not have time to go into all of them. It is accurate to say that individual budgets worked for some people. The greatest recorded benefits were for people who had physical disabilities or mental health problems. On the whole, people in those client groups benefited. For others, notably older people, the findings were at best&#151;I stress &#147;at best&#148;&#151;inconclusive, and there were mixed outcomes for people with learning disabilities. That perhaps reflects the fact that older people tend to come to individual budgets at a time of crisis. They can be going along fine, and then they are hit by a stroke or a heart attack and are suddenly in a moment of trauma and vulnerability, and their ability to cope with what is going on around them is different from that of somebody who has had learning difficulties or a physical disability for many years. The report, which is highly tentative in its statements, states that,</p>
<ul><a name="09030214000053"></a>&#147;a potentially substantial proportion of older people may experience taking responsibility for their own support as a burden rather than as leading to improved control&#148;.</ul><h5><a name="09030214000058"></a>3.45 pm</h5>

<a name="90302-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000014"></a>Since then, there have been other reports. I hope that many noble Lords will have seen CSCI&#146;s report, <I>The </I><I>S</I><I>tate of </I><I>S</I><I>ocial </I><I>C</I><I>are in England 2007-08</I>, which is a thematic research study into assessment. It arrived at very similar conclusions about individual budgets. One of its key findings was that the resource allocation system, which was piloted for use with one client group, may need to be changed. Perhaps some of the most important parts of the report were the limited findings about the potential impact upon providers of services and the acknowledgement that a great deal more research needs to be done before a system like this is rolled out.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000015"></a>I say all that to underline that I am in favour of individual budgets. I want to see them work. I want older people to be able to go out and buy a home-help service when their local authority does not provide one. I want carers to be able to get some help at a time that suits them and enables them to go on working. However, there are a great many unanswered questions about the way in which this policy has worked in social care and a great many more about the impact that it may have in health. That is the background to all the amendments before us.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000016"></a>I now wish to move on to Amendment 50. It questions what happens when somebody lacks capacity and has not made a prior statement that he wishes to nominate somebody else to act on his behalf as the recipient of his direct payment. One would conclude from the Bill that in those circumstances a person would not be able to receive a direct payment. The amendment probes that to establish that where somebody lacks capacity, to be consistent with the Mental Capacity Act, it would still be possible to nominate somebody to act as the person to whom the payment could be made.</p>

They all appear to be based on very real concerns. I identify myself with everything that she has just said. I shall speak to my Amendment 51, which I signal to the Minister at the outset deploys the standard Committee device to leave out a passage of the Bill in order simply to debate it rather than to indicate dissatisfaction with it.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000018"></a>On talking to people outside Parliament in the medical community and the voluntary sector, we have a division of views about direct payments. As the Committee knows, I am very much in favour of the concept, although we need to tread carefully in introducing them, which is why I very much support the idea of pilots. I think that much of the voluntary sector would express a similar view. However, the BMA is very wary of the idea. In fact, I think that one could say that it has considerable reservations about the whole notion. It sees direct payments as making continuity of care more difficult and not easier, and fears that they will increase bureaucracy and transaction costs. While I think that those concerns are overplayed, we should not ignore them, coming as they do from the BMA. It would be helpful if the Minister would address those particular issues in his reply.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000019"></a>Setting those concerns aside, there is no getting away from the fact that with direct payments there is a trade-off between patient empowerment&#151;leading to, one hopes, better outcomes&#151;and financial risk for PCTs, which lose control of commissioning while having to pick up the tab for the services commissioned. Most enthusiasts for the concept of direct payments would say that this risk can be managed and minimised if we are careful about how the scheme is rolled out, and to whom.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000020"></a>Like the noble Baroness, I should like to hear more from the Minister about the kinds of people for whom the Government regard direct payments as being suitable. An example is eye care. Like pharmacists, opticians tend to be conveniently located in shopping areas and supermarkets. As we all know, optical practices already provide high-quality eye care, yet too many patients travel to overstretched hospital eye departments for relatively routine check-ups which could be managed equally well or better in the community. In Wales and Scotland, community optometrists play this sort of enhanced role in eye health services, so there would seem no reason why the same should not happen in England.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000021"></a>Many people with mental health problems would say that the chance to be in the driving seat when it comes to choosing and buying services is exactly the kind of empowerment which will contribute to a more rapid recovery. Of course, certain kinds of mentally ill people may not prove suitable to handle direct payments, but many will be. I therefore would be glad to hear the Minister say that mental health care will not be ruled out as an area for trialling when the pilot schemes are commenced.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000022"></a>From all that the Government have said, they see direct payments as being suitable for those with stable, long-term conditions whose healthcare needs are reasonably predictable. I agree with that. As we discussed at Second Reading, very often the people in receipt of direct payments for healthcare will be those who receive  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC208"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column GC208</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>means-tested social care&#151;I am thinking here of the physically disabled. Will the Minister say whether children, for example, or people who lack mental capacity and are looked after by other people, as asked about by the noble Baroness, will be excluded?</p>

<a name="90302-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000023"></a>There has been a lot of discussion about maternity services. On the face of it, if we believe in choice for expectant mothers, why not empower them to buy the kind of service that they want when they give birth? However, this is one area in which things are not quite so simple, because giving birth is not always a predictable process, given the risks and complications that may arise. Will the system be able to cater for a situation in which, say, a woman who has opted for a home birth with a midwife suddenly needs to be moved to a consultant-led obstetric unit? In other words, how much flexibility will be built in to enable people to switch the service that they purchase, especially bearing in mind that the cost of two alternative services may be very different?</p>

<a name="90302-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000024"></a>Finally, will the Minister clarify the extent to which those in receipt of direct payments will be allowed to use them for purchasing services that are not available on the NHS? One of the principles set out in <I>Personal Health Budgets: First Steps</I>, a copy of which I have here, is that having a personal health budget does not entitle someone to more, or more expensive, services. Nor does it entitle them to preferential access to NHS services. If a service is not available from the NHS locally, will it be possible for someone to buy that service from the independent sector?</p>

<a name="90302-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000026"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, and the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, for the briefing meeting that they held last week, which I found very helpful indeed. I have also found very helpful the document&#151;<I>Personal Health Budgets: First Steps</I><I>&#151;</I>to which my noble friend referred. At that meeting, I told noble Lords that I am strongly in favour of personally held budgets, and particularly direct payments. At Second Reading, the Minister told your Lordships that he believed that,</p>
<ul><a name="09030214000054"></a>&#147;the potential for personal health budgets ... is significant. The opportunities they present are exciting&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 4/2/09; col. 673.]</ul>
<p><a name="09030214000048"></a>I so agree.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000027"></a>I was interested to hear the history of the policy, which the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, outlined. I took through the Community Care (Direct Payments) Act 1996. I remember that there was very little opposition to it, and it went through quite easily. In the intervening time, we have seen evidence of a very successful social care policy. I appreciate that it is not all wonderful, and that there are people who have found it quite challenging, but that is no reason not to go ahead with this legislation.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000028"></a>I have been particularly impressed by Kent County Council, whose inspirational director has introduced the Kent card. It is very similar to a credit card and  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC209"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column GC209</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>has a monthly allowance that is based on the user&#146;s needs for the service or services of their choice. The strength of the Kent scheme appears to be the minimum bureaucracy, and I understand that the county council is now having detailed discussions with Eastern and Coastal Kent Primary Care Trust to see how the card can be used as a vehicle for the implementation of personalised health budgets.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000029"></a>I have also read the evaluation report which the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, mentioned. She is quite right that it highlights things that have proved to be a challenge, but it also says that individual budgets were generally welcomed by users because they gave them more control over their lives and produced better outcomes for the costs incurred compared with the standard care. I am very tempted to get into a Second Reading debate, but I am not going to do that. I take the lead from my noble friend, who was trying to explore the range of people who could benefit from direct payments. That brings me to the amendment in my name, Amendment 58A, which would enable the Secretary of State to make regulations,</p>
<ul><a name="09030214000055"></a>&#147;as to circumstances in which a direct payment may be used to secure the services of an independent midwife&#148;.</ul><h5><a name="09030214000059"></a>4 pm</h5>

<a name="90302-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000030"></a>In the foreword to <I>Changing </I><I>C</I><I>hildbirth</I>, which was a policy document for maternity services that I wrote when I was a Minister, I wrote:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09030214000052"></a>&#147;Pregnancy is a long and very special journey for a woman. It is a journey of dramatic physical, psychological and social change&#151;of becoming a mother, redefining family relationships and taking on the long-term responsibility for caring and cherishing a newborn child. Generations of women have travelled the same route, but each journey is unique&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030214000049"></a>I suspect that there is not one person in the Palace of Westminster and beyond who has not been touched by a midwife. There is an understanding that every mother and every newborn baby needs a midwife and, of course, some need a doctor as well.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000031"></a>At such a time, the relationship between mother and midwife is critical. Choice of midwife, choice of clinical care and choice of place of birth make for a more confident mother, a more successful pregnancy and birth and better postnatal care. Giving birth is not only a unique experience: it is a team effort involving mother, midwife and sometimes a doctor. If I were to write that foreword again today, I would include the father. I witnessed our son bathing his newborn baby from the day that he was born. I wondered at this tall, handsome fellow, tenderly holding in his huge hands this tiny mite, who was hardly bigger than a packet of flour, and tending him with huge confidence. Every night it is he who reads the bedtime story and he, like many other fathers, is totally involved in bringing up his son. Compared with past generations, that is a huge social change.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000032"></a>Fifteen years ago, <I>Changing Childbirth</I> did make a difference. Its three tenets of choice, continuity of health professional, and control by the woman over her care were adopted and implemented in most maternity services around the country. Its philosophy was embraced, putting the mother at the centre of care. In recent years, although that philosophy has not been eroded,  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC210"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column GC210</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>its implementation has. We hear too many stories of mothers being left alone in labour and their partners traumatised by what should be a joyful experience. The problem is principally due to the shortage of midwives. Again, it is not recruitment; the service is under such pressure that midwives leave.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000033"></a>The impact on parents and their families of a traumatic experience is simply devastating. There is strong evidence that the emotional turmoil and distress that follows is profound and long lasting. The last official inquiry into unexplained stillbirths&#151;the Confidential Enquiry into Stillbirths and Deaths in Infancy&#151;found that nearly half of all unexplained stillbirths might have been avoided with better antenatal care.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000034"></a>At Second Reading, the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, stated that his aim was for,</p>
<ul><a name="09030214000056"></a>&#147;an NHS that gives people more information and choice, works effectively in partnership and has quality of care at its heart&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 4/2/09; cols. 671-72.]</ul>
<a name="90302-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000035"></a>With regard to maternity services, we have a long way to go to recover the quality that was apparent in the mid-1990s. Where we do see outstanding quality, it is in the care given by independent midwives. The underlying core principle of independent midwifery is that the woman chooses her midwife at the beginning of her pregnancy. She is not simply allocated one. That enables a true partnership between a woman and her midwife to develop, with all the benefits that that brings. Our modern acceptance that women should give birth with total strangers just because our system of provision has evolved into an industrial model needs to be challenged. We need a more humane, supportive and essentially safer model based on the genuine continuity of care offered by independent midwifery.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000036"></a>Some women are able to choose an independent midwife and do so because these midwives are able to give the time and information to enable women to make their own informed choices. They choose independent midwives because they want the continuity of care, because they want to know who will be with them when they give birth to their babies, because independent midwives know about and support their intentions, and because they are with them throughout their postnatal period. They choose them, especially, if there may be complications and the woman may need extra support during her labour and giving birth. The results are self-evident. There is a much higher home birth rate&#151;64 per cent, whereas the national average is around 2 per cent. There is a much higher normal birth rate&#151;77.9 per cent. There are fewer interventions, high breast-feeding rates and fewer admissions to special care baby units.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000037"></a>In contrast to the NHS services, independent midwives can give the care that meets all a woman&#146;s needs, including her emotional ones. Women who have had a traumatic first birth make up approximately a third of an independent midwife&#146;s caseload, including vaginal births after a caesarean section. Women frequently comment on the importance of having time to talk through their fears and their previous traumatic birth experience, resulting in a normal, positive experience for their second and subsequent births.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000038"></a>In the Minister&#146;s next-stage review, he embraced the concept of social enterprise and the opportunities for clinical leaders to deliver innovation for the benefit of users. Independent Midwives UK is now a social enterprise in the form of an industrial provident society. It stands ready to deliver services to the NHS within the tariff that a PCT invests in each birth, meeting the national choice guarantees.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000039"></a>We know that many midwives who are frustrated and disheartened with the current structures are keen to work in this way. Until now, there have not been the mechanisms to make this happen, but I am aware that this is changing. Commissioning by PCTs will, in future, embrace a plurality of providers to extend choice and drive up quality. This choice and quality of service should be available to as many women as possible via the NHS, so that maternity choice is not only for those with the means to pay. The Royal College of Midwives is hesitant about direct payments, but if they were linked to the maternity care pathway&#151;that is, normal births&#151;a component could be added based on payment by results if and when complications arose. I have no doubt that direct payments, with women voting with their feet and choosing independent midwives, is the quickest way to improve services.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000040"></a>In response to my amendment, I suspect that the Minister will reply that it is up to the PCTs to decide which services they will offer to individuals. I understand that. However, believing that we are at one on the need to improve maternity services, I seek that the regulations may provide for direct payments to be made for the services of an independent midwife. The circumstances need not be controversial. If the Care Quality Commission found that specific maternity services did not meet the necessary registration requirements, the Minister could then make a direction. It would at least open the door, although, I confess, not as far as I would like. I ask the Minister and his officials seriously to consider the suggestion, and to think through the means to encourage PCTs to include maternity services as part of their plans in piloting direct payments.</p>

<p><a name="09030214000041"></a><b><a name="90302-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09030214000065"></a>Lord Warner:</b> I was first involved in introducing direct payments 20 years ago as a director of social services in Kent, which I think was the first local authority to do so. We did this through involvement in a new care management system. I confess that we did so before there was legislation to permit us to, working on the sound principle&#151;which is still a sound principle&#151;that if there is no legislation to stop you doing it, you should innovate and try things. That scheme, which was initially for elderly people, has gone from success to success under my successors. As the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, said, it has been expanded to, in effect, a kind of credit card, used to enable people to buy services.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000042"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, raised some doubts about whether direct payments always worked with elderly people. On the basis of the Kent experience, it has worked well with elderly people, for the two reasons that underpin why direct payments work. First, they give people more choice and flexibility about how to get care, what type of care and how it is tailored to their needs. The noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, made that point extremely elegantly and eloquently at  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC212"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column GC212</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Second Reading. Secondly, direct payments often enable elderly people to have flexibility of services that allow them to stay in their own homes longer than they would otherwise be able to do. That is well documented in the Kent experience, which is now about 20 years old.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000043"></a>The other reason why the Kent system worked well was that it was integrated into a care management assessment process. There will always be people who do not quite know what they are entitled to or how to fit together a range of services and help in the way that most meets their needs. It is important that we do not see direct payments as an isolated activity. They have to be integrated into the assessment of needs and the help people will be provided with, often by a public service of one kind or another. However, that does not mean that people do not know how to run their own lives or that they do not know what their needs are. They are coping with their conditions and have usually been doing so for quite a long time.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000044"></a>One reason why direct payments have not been extended across local authorities as much as they might have been is professional resistance. We must face up to that. When we introduced direct payments, not everybody in Kent thought, &#147;Yippee! Good for the director of social services. This is a great idea. We are going to go forth and do this&#148;. That was not the reaction. I remember some quite interesting meetings with the trade unions on this issue. There will be a question about whether the professional culture will enable some of this stuff to happen. I am not surprised by the BMA&#146;s reservations and anxieties. I recall the BMA having many of the same anxieties about practice-based commissioning in the early days. There will always be some professional reservations about giving budgets, in effect, to patients and service users to make their own decisions, and we must take them with a pinch of salt. However, that does not get away from the fact that most direct payment systems that have worked have been good value for money and have produced a lot of user satisfaction.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000045"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, who has had to leave, asked me to make a point, with which I agree. It is that direct payments sometimes cause problems when people find it difficult to conceptualise the services they need. They know they have needs in a general sense, but sometimes struggle to know precisely how to get services in response to them. That is why the direct payment system needs to be integrated into the process of assessing their needs. Pilot schemes will start to iron out some of those problems.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000046"></a>In taking this initiative forward in the NHS, I hope we will learn from the local government experience. I have often thought that the NHS, which, as a Minister, I sometimes found a somewhat inward-looking organisation, is rather slow to learn from local government, which has often been much more innovative in some of these areas when responding to individual needs.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09030214000047"></a>My final point relates to the text of the Bill. I think the regulations about direct payments in new Section 12B were drafted by the Treasury. They seem to shut off many bolt-holes and ensure that there will be a fair amount of control over the way direct payments are used. I hope we will not get into a situation where this  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC213"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column GC213</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>innovative change that the Minister and the Government are introducing is stymied by very restrictive regulations in the inevitably blurred boundary area between health and social services. That is why I quite like the look of Amendment 60A&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, is not here to move it&#151;which starts to spell out in an interesting way some of that blurry boundary area. It is important that we do not end up with another area of dispute, of which there are often many and as we had over hospital discharge, between social services and the local PCTs. We need a lot of good will about how we will use direct payments, so that this does not become another cost-shunting area or an area of dispute between health and social services.</p>

<p><a name="09030217000001"></a><b><a name="90302-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09030217000037"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> Once again, as the non-professional, I shall speak on behalf of the consumers of these services. I listened very closely to the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege. Something worried me about her whole contribution and perhaps the Minister will comment on what she said. In the 1980s, a row took place in Workington when the local health authority decided that it wanted to close a maternity unit. Then there were arguments about further maternity units in Cumbria. One of the objections was that people simply wanted their children to be born in a particular area because it goes on the birth certificate. It might not seem particularly relevant for us when we are considering matters of health, but where people or their children are born features on the agenda.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09030217000002"></a>One argument regarding the closure of maternity units in Workington was about where babies would be born. I wonder whether, in the event that we develop a system that allows people effectively to opt out of using the local maternity unit&#151;that is what we will do by providing a system of direct payments to independent midwives, as I understand it&#151;we will pursue a policy that could lead to a reduction in the number of maternity units in an area, which will have consequences. If a maternity unit is taken away from an area, the distance travelled by anyone wanting maternity services is much greater. Consequently, some women might feel under pressure to have the baby at home, which may not be what they would choose. They may want to have the baby in a maternity unit, but may not want to travel a great distance or such a distance from where they live that their relatives are not in a position to visit them. This is a consumer perception of how this would work in the system.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09030217000003"></a>I do not want to do anything which would lead to a reduction in the number of maternity units. It might be that I have completely misunderstood what the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, was advocating. But the consequences of what she seemed to be advocating would be a reduction in the number of maternity units, along with the availability of obstetric facilities and expertise.</p>

As is plain from the implications of Amendment 60A in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, the main purpose of such direct payments will largely be at the interface between medical and social care, I hope. Nevertheless, I appreciate the reservations expressed by the British Medical Association. I suppose I have to declare an interest as a past president, although that was 27 years ago, and I am not in any way involved any more with the policies of the organisation. My anxieties are largely dispelled by the content of the regulations, which, if properly applied, should protect against potential abuse. However, if direct payments are to be used to cover the costs of specific items of medical care, I am somewhat concerned about the extent to which that will be based on evidence. That is rather important. For instance, can someone who is receiving direct payments from a primary care trust use those to pay top-up costs of drugs not approved by NICE?</p>

<a name="90302-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09030217000005"></a>I have another anxiety on the situation for complementary and alternative medicine. I again have to declare an interest: I chaired the House of Lords Select Committee inquiry into complementary and alternative medicine that reported a few years ago. We recommended and accepted that those forms of complementary medicine regulated by law, such as osteopathy and chiropractic, might reasonably be paid for by the NHS if the general practitioner recommended that the individual in question needed to have the services of a chiropractor or an osteopath. However, if such direct payments were held by a patient, I would be concerned if they were to be spent on so-called disciplines such as crystal therapy, iridology and radionics for which there is no evidence at all.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09030217000006"></a>What control and monitoring would be undertaken of the use of direct payments in specific areas of medical care by the individual? I would like the Minister to give me some reassurance about that.</p>

<p><a name="09030217000007"></a><b><a name="90302-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09030217000039"></a>Baroness Campbell of Surbiton:</b> I was not going to speak until the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins&#151;on which, of course, I have a lovingly crafted speech&#151;but I felt compelled to speak now because of some of the interesting and important comments that Members of the Committee have made.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09030217000008"></a>I would like to add to the history lesson. Actually, the first direct payments in this country were in 1983. Four young disabled people in Hampshire decided that they wanted to use the money that was there to care for them in a residential home as their own and move out, get a home and design their own support arrangements. That was called the 1981 project. They started in 1981 and got out in 1986&#151;it took them that long to persuade the local authority that they had the wherewithal to live the life that they chose and arrange their own care support. In those days, that was completely unheard of; we have come a long way.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09030217000009"></a>I did not want the Committee to feel that I was too much of a Pollyanna about direct payments. If the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, had not told her story, I too would have told a horror story, because there are horror stories, largely when people&#146;s support arrangements fall apart because their impairment suddenly increases  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC215"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column GC215</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>or a loved one leaves them and they do not have enough hours in the day to get support in. All those things can happen; life happens. When things fall apart, you need a good local support service to help you through it. You need somebody to assist you to find a new personal assistant or look for the support that you need. Often when direct payments fall down, it is because the local authority does not have support services and does not have people there to assist you&#151;to know how to recruit, employ and maintain your personal assistance. Also, often the advocacy and extra support for people who have extra support needs&#151;for example, people with learning difficulties and older people&#151;simply is not there because it is not invested in. We will need to look at that investment. However, I am getting a little confused as to whether we are talking about direct payments or individual budgets. They are different. I use direct payments; I do not use an individual budget. We need clarification of what we are talking about.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09030217000010"></a>It is important that we understand that direct payments are simply a mechanism. They are not a service in themselves; that comes after the direct payment. You receive your direct payment, then you develop your service. Until you are assessed, your hours have been decided and the direct payment has gone into your bank account, you cannot begin to build your service. Again, it needs to be understood that direct payments are much more than simply handing over the cheque. That is when the real work begins, and again that is why we need decent support services, which I will talk about a little later when I support the amendment in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09030217000011"></a>Clarification from the Minister of what we are discussing here would help. I thought that we were discussing direct payments as a mechanism. I also remind the Committee that the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, assured us that this will simply be a pilot, through which we begin to look at what works and what does not. So far as I am concerned, everything is up for discussion.</p>

<p><a name="09030217000012"></a><b><a name="90302-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09030217000040"></a>Baroness Cumberlege:</b><b></b>Before the Minister replies, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours for entering the debate. I have never heard the argument about the birth certificate before. It is a very interesting one. I was born on the north-west Indian frontier and have a birth certificate that is very strange indeed. It is quite a treasure, really. It is written on a piece of tracing paper and is signed by the Minister of People. I have never found it to be a problem.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09030217000013"></a>I have a very simple line on the closure of maternity units; if women do not want to choose them, they should close. There must be something about them that really is not very satisfactory. The tremendous strength of independent midwives is their partnership with the woman with whom they are dealing. They would never force a woman to have a baby at home if she did not want to, but they give real choice, which in some areas in this country is simply not available to women. If a pregnant woman goes to a GP, that GP will say, &#147;No way should you have a home birth&#148;, but when the woman builds a relationship with the midwife, and the midwife and the woman are confident that home is the right place, the woman should have a  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC216"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column GC216</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>home birth. The one problem at the moment is that independent midwives do not have access to acute maternity units, but that is changing; it will alter quite soon. That makes employing an independent midwife even more appealing, as the midwife follows the woman into the hospital and delivers the baby in the hospital, as well as doing the antenatal and postnatal care.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09030217000014"></a>I have a quick word to say to the noble Lord, Lord Walton. I remember when we had GP fund-holding. It was very interesting to see the enormous difference that that made to complementary therapies and the number of people who went to their GP. We should remember that it was the last time that patients really had some power over their care. The GPs wanted to respond to patient choice because it affected their income. A number of people&#151;the figures are quite startling&#151;chose to have complementary therapies, and, so far as I know, no damage was done. As soon as GP fund-holding was done away with, those figures fell.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09030217000015"></a>Lastly, I should say to the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, that I am talking about direct payments.</p>

<p><a name="09030217000016"></a><b><a name="90302-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09030217000041"></a>Baroness Emerton:</b> I shall speak on two issues: learning disabilities, which my noble friend Lady Campbell raised; and what happened in Kent, which the noble Lord, Lord Warner, mentioned. I declare an interest as a regional nursing officer responsible for managing the closure of a large institution. We could not have effected that change without the direct payment system for learning disability clients who went to individual homes, so I fully support it.</p>
<h5><a name="09030217000036"></a>4.30 pm</h5>

<a name="90302-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09030217000017"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, spoke about independent midwives. I declare an interest as a regional supervisor of midwives for 17 years, with the implementation of independent midwives happening during that time. There were considerable problems with the implementation, but the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, is right that from the mother&#146;s point of view, it was absolutely right. The noble Lord, Lord Warner, raised a question about professional antagonism to changes. Here, we have a problem, because with the independent midwives, just as with any other midwives, the bottom line is the safety of the mother and the baby. As long as that is the bottom line, it can be a very healthy and happy outcome.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09030217000018"></a>At the same time, I have sat on and chaired the professional conduct committee for what was the UKCC, where we had one or two cases where the independent midwives had acted as independent and not within the regulations. As long as independent midwives are prepared to accept self-regulation through the Nursing and Midwifery Council and the Care Quality Commission, it will be fine.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09030217000019"></a>Travelling from home to hospital has to come into the equation in the assessment of antenatal care. If it is not near enough for the mother to be transferred in an emergency in the case of an abnormality happening during labour, it is the responsibility of the independent midwife to seek assistance. That is part of her role. I raise those points and ask that the Minister might take them into account when he looks at the role of independent midwives.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC217"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column GC217</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

I must be the only obstetrician in the land who thinks that mothers have a choice at birth, and that choice includes having an independent midwife. I have said so for many years, and I have been looked at disapprovingly by my colleagues. The noble Baroness said that continuity of care during labour is of paramount importance to the mother. It is a shame that we do not have enough midwives to provide that care, either in the home or the hospital. Women will choose independent midwives for the very reason that they will provide continuity of care.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09030217000021"></a>One other point that the noble Baroness made is also correct. Independent midwives have to abide by the regulations set by the midwifery council. Therefore, they are professionals, and they know that if the mother requires transfer to a hospital for care, there is no reason why they should not continue to provide that care, even if that care then requires a doctor or a consultant. The independent midwife is as much a professional as a midwife working in a hospital and is perfectly capable of assisting a consultant obstetrician to provide care if required. I support the amendment, and I hope that we will have the opportunity for direct payments to be included for mothers if they wish to have home delivery and the services of an independent midwife.</p>

<p><a name="09030217000022"></a><b><a name="90302-gc0002.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09030217000043"></a>Baroness Murphy:</b> I rise to add my tuppenceworth to this debate. I very much support the amendments but, at the same time, I support direct payments. We have tended to forget that, at the moment, the NHS Act prevents any direct payments, which has meant no choice at all of people such as community physiotherapists, community occupational therapists and community chiropodists. My own service&#151;I declare an interest as a supporter of that which I proposed&#151;took over the scheme from Kent into a scheme in Lewisham and integrated it into our dementia services. We also successfully used the scheme of direct payments from Lewisham Borough Council, which was at first a great anxiety for social services. Again and again, I heard arguments from professionals in social care services about why direct payments would not work and why mentally ill people and their families would not be able to use this scheme directly.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09030217000023"></a>This proposal will create the same sort of anxieties. The arguments that will be used will be similar to the ones proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours. For example, should we allow people to buy their own toenail-clipping service? That is one of the huge arguments in services for the care of the elderly. You have to have a dedicated chiropodist doing an assessment who then comes along, looks at your toenails and allocates you so many minutes of toenail cutting. Most elderly people say, &#147;I just want someone to come along and cut my toenails every month&#148;. I am glad that the Minister agrees about that point.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09030217000024"></a>There are opportunities to reduce costs from some of the areas that are currently organised for us. Audiology, optical services of various sorts, chiropody, community physiotherapy and other services would benefit from this sort of approach, where cost allocations by senior managers or middle-grade managers in the NHS make it very difficult for people to get the services that they  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC218"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column GC218</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>need. Community speech therapy is another example. There will be arguments about this, especially if direct payments are coming from patients going outside the NHS or to another team. I have seen huge arguments between the great edifice of Barts and the London NHS Trust and community health services in Hackney about who should be allowed to look at feet and do minor podiatry operations because of the movement of one tiny budget from a hospital to a community service. I see this proposal as a positive thing and a bit of a Trojan horse to drive into areas of competition which, in community health services, have been pretty well non-existent.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09030217000025"></a>I also take the point about individuals and I remind the noble Lord, Lord Warner, that there was tremendous support from the case managers in Kent for the handling of individual care budgets in the same way that there had to be in the Lewisham scheme, but that was the joy of watching case managers actually develop the skills. Enormous skill in case management will still be required to handle these cases properly and for case managers to learn a lot more about employment law, contracts and so forth with which they are not very familiar at the moment in the NHS. I strongly support this at the same time as wanting to see some of these amendments reflected in our overall scheme for the direct payment pilots that are so important.</p>

<p><a name="09030217000026"></a><b><a name="90302-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09030217000044"></a>Baroness Finlay of Llandaff:</b> I have hesitated over whether to speak now or later, but this debate has gone on for some time so I thought that I might chuck my questions for the Minister in now.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09030217000027"></a>How will evidence-based care be monitored? The term &#147;complementary therapy&#148; has been bandied about but we should be clear about whether we are talking about complementary or alternative therapy. Indeed, if we are talking about complementary therapy, how will that be assessed? To comment on what was said by the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, I should say that one of the difficulties is that many patients like certain things, but the trial of benefit&#151;comparing some of these therapies against things such as going to the hairdresser&#151;has never been done. All those things make patients feel better, but should NHS money pay for them? There may be no evidence of harm, but we need evidence of benefit if we are going to spend NHS money on something. I am not sure that anyone has died for lack of complementary therapy, but I think that patients have suffered for lack of complementary therapy given in conjunction with their mainstream therapy to support them through it. That is different from alternative therapies, and it must be sorted out.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09030217000028"></a>Will the Minister say how commissioning from the voluntary sector will be worked out? How will the tariffs be worked out? How will patients who want to go to direct payments be affected if they wish to buy a service from across one of the borders&#151;either into Scotland or into Wales? It is very unlikely that they would want to buy a service in Northern Ireland, but certainly patients who live just on the English side of Offa&#146;s Dyke may well wish to purchase from Wales.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09030217000029"></a>Another issue is the speed of allocation. If someone has been assessed as eligible for direct payment but decides not to go for it, the service is too slow and they purchase something, will they be able to claim

Indeed, will they have some sort of appeal mechanism for the way in which they are assessed for payments?</p>

<a name="90302-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09030217000030"></a>Will there be a requirement that patients must buy an indemnity for any service that they buy, as they must for midwifery services, for example? Certainly, trust indemnity is a requirement and is part of the services that an NHS trust provides, but what if patients go outside that? What happens if the budget is overspent? If a patient buys more or suddenly has to go back into the NHS, which has been covered already, how is that worked out?</p>

<a name="90302-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09030217000031"></a>How will the tariffs be determined? The Motor Neurone Disease Association has evolved a year of care and has broken down the care requirements of patients with motor neurone disease into discrete packages, which it has also costed. It is a fantastic piece of work and a great service for anyone who is trying to provide end-of-life care. Will patients be able to mix and match? If they are, how much will they be able to mix and match, dip in and out and top up? It strikes me that the devil will be in the detail and that it will work well if it is well managed, as the noble Lord, Lord Warner, said. If it is not very carefully managed and defined, it may well fall apart and run into big problems.</p>

<p><a name="09030217000032"></a><b><a name="90302-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09030217000045"></a>Baroness Masham of Ilton:</b> I have a question, too. Will drug and alcohol services be included in direct payments? So many people are sitting in prison now and not getting the right treatment, because it comes from another budget and health or social services simply do not want to pay for it.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09030217000033"></a>I asked the Minister at one of our meetings who was going to do the assessments. Again, like my noble friend Lady Finlay, I would like to know what happens if the budgets run over, which I can see happening.</p>

Will my noble friend take that into account when he deals with the previous two contributions, so that we can deal with them in our debate on the next group of amendments?</p>

In doing so, I declare an interest as a trustee of the Michael Sieff Foundation, a child welfare organisation, and as a trustee of TACT, the Adolescent and Children&#146;s Trust, a foster care organisation. I declare that interest because it is so important for a child&#146;s welfare that there is a secure attachment between mother and child, which must be protected. We must protect a good start. Good maternity services must protect children later on, perhaps from family breakdown and dysfunction and being lost into care, so I strongly support the thrust of what the noble Baroness, the noble Lord, Lord Patel, and others have said about the importance of continuity of care for mothers.</p>

<p><a name="09030229000002"></a>I visited the Albany midwife service in south London, which operates a caseload midwifery model and is similar to the independent midwives to which the  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC220"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column GC220</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>noble Baroness referred. The midwives get to know the parents several months prior to the birth, providing the induction and pre-natal sessions. One midwife will work with a family until the birth of the child. She will carry a pager and, ideally, often will help at the birth, at which we found there were fewer interventions. Although this service takes place in a deprived area, it does not focus on those people who are most excluded. It was found that breast-feeding was far more prolonged and widespread, which is a positive indicator of the welfare of the child, both physically and emotionally in terms of the bond between the child and the mother. I welcome the thrust of that proposal.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09030229000003"></a>When sitting in on a maternity meeting run by the noble Baroness, I remember being distressed on hearing a mother describe giving birth in a hospital. She said that the midwives changed and that she was left alone for long periods after a difficult pregnancy. From the other side, I can see that it is important to have choice. My concern is that this new model might disadvantage those who are less aware of the new options being offered to them. There is a danger of reinforcing social exclusion because the most intelligent and proactive people will seek out independent midwives. I would appreciate reassurance that there will be a means to ensure that women from ethnic minorities who perhaps have not had the benefit of a good education will not be left in the lurch. Should many mothers opt for independent services, what impact would that have on caseload midwifery? I am not sure that I have explained that clearly, but I hope that I have.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09030229000004"></a>On the first day in Committee, I welcomed the reminder from the Minister that the constitution document puts great emphasis on support staff and on ensuring that they have a right to support. I take the point made by midwives about how often they work in departments where they do not get the support or supervision that they need. I am very grateful to the Minister for reminding me of the priority that the NHS document puts on supporting staff.</p>

<p><a name="09030229000005"></a><b><a name="90302-gc0003.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="09030229000032"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Lord Darzi of Denham):</b> Direct payments for healthcare form part of a wider programme, which I announced last year in <I>High Quality Care f</I><I>or All</I>, to explore the potential of personal health budgets in the NHS. The aim is to deliver better quality care by enabling patients, if they want&#151;that is the principle&#151;to take more control over the way money is spent on their healthcare. The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, referred to a change in policy. I believe that empowered patients who exercise that power in deciding on the treatments they wish to receive is an improvement in policy. We also recently published details of our programme in <I>Personal Health Budgets: First Steps</I>, a fairly comprehensive document, which invites expressions of interest from the NHS in taking part in the pilots.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09030229000006"></a>In many cases, a personal health budget would be notional or would be held by a third party on a patient&#146;s behalf. That is permissible under current legislation and we hope the first pilot schemes of this kind will run from later this year. Here we are talking about direct payments as variations of personalised or individual budgets, including notional payments, which are permissible under law, as I said. We want to test  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC221"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column GC221</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>direct cash payments to patients where it makes most sense for individuals. The powers in the Bill allow for that. Subject to parliamentary approval for the Bill and subsequent regulations, the pilot programme could be extended next year to include pilot schemes for direct payments for health care.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09030229000007"></a>The amendments in this group are concerned with the coverage of direct payments for healthcare, including to whom and in what circumstances it is appropriate to make such payments. Amendment 50, tabled by the noble Baronesses, Lady Barker and Lady Tonge, would allow direct payments for healthcare to be made to a suitable person on behalf of a patient who does not have the capacity to consent and who has not nominated a surrogate beforehand. The Bill is drafted to enshrine the important principle, outlined in new Section 12A, that direct payments may only be made with a patient&#146;s consent.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09030229000008"></a>However, as noted by the noble Baroness, it is important that patients who are unable to give consent should not be denied the opportunity of benefiting from a direct payment. As we set out in the department&#146;s briefing note, we intend to allow a representative to hold direct payments on behalf of a patient who is unable to give consent. The role of this person would be to act in the best interests of the patient by holding the direct payment, securing services for them and supplying information to the PCT as necessary. It is important to emphasise that the regulations to achieve this would only apply to people unable to give consent.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09030229000009"></a>In those circumstances, we expect that, where a person lacks capacity, their representative is likely to be either a court-appointed deputy or a donee of a lasting power of attorney made at a time when the patient had capacity. Next-of-kin or long-term carers may also be suitable. Regulations under new Section 12B(2) would allow us to define the details&#151;for example, to put in place safeguards to ensure that a surrogate is suitable and is acting in the patient&#146;s best interests. This is a similar approach to that used in social care, where it has worked well to ensure that people unable to give consent or who wish to nominate another are able to benefit from direct payments. I hope that I have reassured the noble Baroness, and that she will find this explanation helpful.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09030229000010"></a>Amendment 51, tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, would remove the specific provision for defining the scope of direct payments for healthcare. Amendment 58A, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, concerns the use of direct payments for maternity services. It would enable regulations to set out the circumstances where direct payments could be used to secure the services of independent midwives.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09030229000011"></a>I have every sympathy with the desire to make the Bill as clear as possible about our intentions for direct payments. However, it is precisely for that reason that I would be reluctant to agree these amendments. As we said in our policy document <I>Personal </I><I>Health B</I><I>udgets: </I><I>F</I><I>irst </I><I>S</I><I>teps</I>, personal health budgets would not be right for everyone, nor in all areas of the NHS. That is especially true of direct payments, the form of personal budget that gives most direct control to the individual  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC222"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column GC222</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>patient. It would not be appropriate&#151;or even possible at this stage&#151;to specify what services or groups of people would benefit most from personal budgets or direct payments. Instead, we want to encourage local innovation and build the evidence base through piloting. Numerous examples have been mentioned earlier: eye care, mental health&#151;as pointed out by the noble Earl&#151;children, chiropody and, certainly, speech therapy. All are good examples of the innovation that we very much hope that PCTs at a local level, in partnership with other stakeholders, would be encouraged to pilot.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09030229000012"></a>As I said earlier, PCTs should consider where personal health budgets might have the greatest benefits for patients. Personal budgets might work especially well in areas where choice is available but where current NHS services are not meeting patients&#146; needs. That might be one very good driver for personal health budgets. Several service areas have been suggested by stakeholders and our policy document has listed some of them.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09030229000013"></a>The department is currently running a series of regional events&#151;I have attended at least one&#151;to encourage applications for the pilot programme, and I would be delighted if we received applications covering all the service areas listed and many services that noble Lords have suggested today. I would certainly be very interested in proposals for maternity services, where I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, has a particular interest. There is plenty of evidence, not only in this country but elsewhere, where we have seen independent midwives working very well, such as in New Zealand and certain parts of England where such a service exists. I was delighted to hear the support expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Patel.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09030229000014"></a>The noble Earl raised the issue of safety in a transfer to hospital in the case of emergency of a woman who decides to have a home birth. As was said by the noble Baroness, Lady Emerton&#151;she is well equipped to answer that question&#151;most midwives with their professional values have very sophisticated tools for assessing risk and making sure that, if a risk arises, the appropriate transfer arrangements are made in the best interests of the safety of the mother and of the child. I do not believe that direct payments, or any form of budget, should have any impact on the transfer protocol that must exist between the midwife, whether independent or not, and the hospital that might be receiving that patient at a local level.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09030229000015"></a>We are keen for the pilots to explore a range of different service areas and models. However, it would be premature at this stage to specify these types of services on the face of the Bill. I have concerns that including a list could turn out to be misleading if, for example, the pilots reveal that one of the listed services is not suitable for personal budgets, but that other, unlisted, services are. We have a lot to learn here. That is the experience and the evidence base that we need to gather on the effectiveness of such a policy.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09030229000016"></a>Equally, the services that are suitable may evolve over time. As the concept of personalisation becomes more embedded within the NHS and its culture, and as improvements take place in the way in which services are commissioned, it may become possible to extend personal health budgets more widely in the future.</p>

What is the impact not only on the individual but on the local health economy? That is all based on the types of services, the demand and the supply at the local level. Once we know the impact of that, we can address these issues and we will have a greater evidence base that we can debate at a local level with the local public and patients who are the users of such a service. As I said earlier, it would be premature to have such services in the Bill. I also have concerns about having a list, which could be misleading.</p>
<h5><a name="09030229000030"></a>5 pm</h5>

<a name="90302-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09030229000019"></a>The approach taken in the Bill provides the overarching framework but at the same time the flexibility to prescribe specific details in regulation where necessary. This mirrors the legislation for direct payments in social care.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09030229000020"></a>I turn to the detail of how we intend to use regulation-making powers, set out in the department&#146;s briefing notes on direct payments, which I hope noble Lords have seen, and the department&#146;s memorandum to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, which the committee has endorsed. A few other issues have been raised by this informative debate. First, the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, asked about where to buy such services. If agreed by the care manager and the care plan, such services could be bought from the private or voluntary sector. That is exactly the ethos of the policy. Patients will be empowered to make those decisions based on the quality of the services that they receive. Secondly, what can they buy? A number of noble Lords referred to crystal therapy, which is not my area of expertise, but hydrotherapy would probably be a better example. Any intervention that will improve the health and well-being of the patient that is signed off by the care manager within the care plan would be implemented.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09030229000021"></a>The noble Earl raised the issue of the transaction costs. We have said that personal health budgets, including direct payments, should be used only when the likely benefits outweigh the transaction costs. I recognise that this will not be suitable for all patients, or certainly all services, which is why we are piloting them. He also raised the issue of the BMA and I declare an interest as I am still a member, despite my interactions over the past 18 months. It is important always to recognise the concerns of continuity of care, which is the issue that has come up. The patient must always remain the continuum. The patient is always challenging us as professionals about integration of care, rather than

The &#163;200 mattress became the symbol of that debate in many ways.</p>

<p><a name="09030229000023"></a><b><a name="90302-gc0003.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09030229000036"></a>Lord Darzi of Denham:</b> That would probably fall within the direct payment budget of social care rather than healthcare, so the answer is yes if the care manager has signed off on it.

<a name="90302-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09030229000026"></a>I turn to the other question raised by my noble friend Lord Warner in relation to integration between health and social care. The answer is yes. Social care direct payments and the personal health budget should be pooled as far as practicable and legally possible. I hope that the Bill will enhance that rather than create any obstacles to it.</p>

I could see that the war of the noble Baroness&#146;s mattress could go on in some parts of the country where the relationship between health and social services is not very good. I hope that the Minister can give us strong assurances as we go through this. People out there are under no illusions about the importance of not allowing individuals to be caught in the crossfire between two budget managers on different sides of the NHS and local government.</p>

If they were not trained, they were not allowed to get me up on to a gutter frame to help me walk. All they had to do was give me a little push, but if they were from one discipline, that was not possible for them. If they were older women who were more practical, they said, &#147;Of course I will help you&#148;. That got me walking again. At a low practical level, it is important to know the difference between the two, and for there not to be such a difference between the two. It is nonsense if one is literally trying to get back on one&#146;s feet after an illness.</p>

One of the six principles that we have adopted in the initiation of this programme is that personal health budgets should be designed to tackle inequalities and protect equality. We intend that there will be support for patients to manage their direct payments. We want to make sure that that is tailored to the different needs of patients that the noble Earl eloquently expressed, particularly those who are less well served by existing services. With appropriate services, personal health budgets and whatever support we put around patients will be tremendously powerful tools. For example, if we go back and look at the evidence based on choice, the areas that have the greatest deprivation in equality actually exercise the most choice. That is what we need to encourage: empowering patients to tackle some of the inequalities to which the noble Earl referred.</p>

They will bring us the best pilots to look at, and different PCTs may have different pilot schemes. We will evaluate these and identify the evidence base.

<p><a name="09030231000020"></a>As ever, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Walton, for raising a point that I wanted to raise. Far be it from me to wander into the age old, perennial argument about alternative therapies, but I want to raise a potential scenario. Let us say that, in a given geographical area, people are given direct payments and choose to have osteopathy or chiropractic rather than physiotherapy because they find it good for them. I do not think that even the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, would get upset about that, but what if the consequence of that is that the physiotherapy unit, which also serves the needs of acute patients, becomes unviable? That is the issue of concern to some of us, and we have not answered it this afternoon. We will have to return to it in later debates.</p>

<p><a name="09030231000021"></a>There are other things that I could say, but I do not want to say them at the moment. I am in favour of transforming services to make them more effective for users, but I return to some of the misgivings that, I hate to say, I do not think the Minister answered. I do not think that he can answer them at the moment. Therefore, I thank him for the spirit in which he answered our questions, but the lack of detail serves to underline the problems that some of us still have.</p>

I have enormous sympathy with the considerations that have prompted Amendments 63A and 69B, tabled by the noble Baronesses, Lady Wilkins and Lady Campbell, and I support the probing amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker. Very few patients will be able to purchase services on their own without well informed support and advice. If we want direct payments to succeed in their health outcomes and to achieve the best value for money, patients will need advice to help them to take decisions and make choices.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09030231000023"></a>One of the problems that certain people foresee with direct payments is the lack of a level playing field when it comes to informing patients about the services on offer and from whom. I do not want to knock GPs, but if a patient receives advice only from a GP who is a service provider, how will that patient get a balanced picture of other, perhaps equally good, alternative ways of spending the budget: for example, via a local pharmacist? I know that the pharmacy profession is anxious about this. A pharmacist may set up in an area and invest in order to provide a first-class service, but if no one knows about it, it will cease to exist.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09030231000024"></a>If we look at eye care, an example that I raised earlier that is not in the normal field of general medical practice, we need to make sure that those who advise patients about the services they can buy with their budget know about the full range of services available to those patients and which services are good. For instance, if no one tells you that you can receive eye care services in your own home, the system is falling short.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09030233000001"></a>The other brief point that I wanted to make was about accreditation, which we debated earlier. To the extent that healthcare services are being provided on the NHS but by non-NHS providers, should we not encourage a system whereby service providers are kite-marked for quality? I realise that patients will not make choices entirely on their own. Nevertheless, without some form of quality assurance and accreditation system in place, the market could become a minefield in certain areas. I would be glad if the Minister could comment on that. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09030233000002"></a><b><a name="90302-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09030233000027"></a>Baroness Barker:</b> I, too, have amendments in this group. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, is absolutely right to focus attention on support, which people who are contemplating the use of a direct payment need to have. I am absolutely sure that a number of patients will need very little help at all. There will be people who might have been through the expert patient programme and know as well as, if not better than, the people engaged in their treatment what they need, and they will know where to get it and what to do with it. However, there will be others who do not.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09030233000003"></a>It is quite telling that many of the amendments in this group have been put to us not by provider organisations but by representatives of quite widespread users. Amendments 53 and 54, I am afraid, reflect another failure on the part of the people responsible for setting up the pilots in social care. It was initially proposed that the pilots in social care should include people who had sensory disabilities, but when the pilots took place, lo and behold, those people had been missed off the list and never properly got a chance to have a role and a say in those pilots. We know that quite a number of people who have sensory disabilities are users of NHS services. People who have sensory disabilities have a type of vulnerability that is different from that of learning disabilities or people who are old. It is not that those disabilities are worthier of attention; they are simply different and need to be involved.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09030233000004"></a>I have not framed the amendments in terms of risk, and I have not chosen to speak about risk overall, because one of the great benefits of direct payments is  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC229"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column GC229</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that they enable people to take risks if they choose to do so. There are particular and potential risks of abuse that have not been investigated in the pilot programmes, and we need to look at them. Amendment 53 proposes that, where there is the potential for abuse, providers must be checked and vetted. Amendment 54 is about providing training and guidance to patients and their carers if they feel that they need it to be able to manage direct payments and to safeguard themselves against potential abuse.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09030233000005"></a>Amendment 69 is somewhat different. It would place a duty on PCTs that intend to make direct payments to commission advice and advocacy services. I accept some of the implicit criticism of this in some of the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell. I know that it is slightly deficient. None the less, it points up a significant issue.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09030233000006"></a>I do not know whether other noble Lords go to conferences at which people, particularly those in local authorities, tell people about the imminence of direct payments and self-directed support. There is usually a very informed, zealous and passionate analysis of the benefits of individual budgets, self-directed support and direct payments. Then when it comes to the practicalities of how the system will work, it becomes a little quiet. If someone in the audience then asks about support and advocacy, it becomes very quiet indeed and sometimes silent. Sometimes the person giving the presentation says, &#147;Of course there will be advocacy&#148;, but when asked if they will pay for it, the answer is no. That is the key to this issue. This is one of the most essential amendments of the lot. If there is no readily available source of support, which people can use or not as required, the potential for this policy to fall rapidly and immediately into disrepute is extensive.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09030233000007"></a>I give notice to the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, that I have a point to make on her amendments when she speaks to them.</p>

<p><a name="09030233000008"></a><b><a name="90302-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09030233000028"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> I shall speak to two amendments: Amendment 57, which I tabled, and Amendment 54. In speaking to Amendment 57, I should point out that this comes from the UNISON stable. As I have said before, I have a non-pecuniary relationship with UNISON. Its concern should be heard during a Bill&#146;s proceedings, particularly on the viability of services, which to some extent was my case when we considered maternity services.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09030233000009"></a>UNISON is very much in the front line when it comes to the implementation of the Bill in the sense that many of its members will be affected by it. That does not mean that it is bad, but we have to be sensitive about what we are doing, particularly in relation to the interests of staff. The union is concerned that the impact of the proposals on staff, such as workforce planning or accountability when a patient embarks on a course of treatment that conflicts with professional opinion, has not been sufficiently considered. The union is keen to have proper assurances that staff will be properly protected and supported when dealing with a patient using direct payments. I am sure that the Committee is well aware of the implications of what might happen, and of the circumstances.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09030233000010"></a>As in social care services, while some will use their budgets to opt out of generic health services, those who cannot or choose not to do so will be left with a service that perhaps no longer has the vital critical mass of service users to make it viable. The union believes that these complex questions have not been satisfactorily addressed, and continues to be concerned that although the NHS is based on the principle of universal service, direct payments could fundamentally undermine that. My noble friend will know that the unions are following the proceedings of the Bill very closely because thousands of their members will be affected. It does not mean that the union is totally opposed in every way to the principle of direct payments, but it has considerable reservations about how they might operate in particular areas. I hope that my noble friend will deal with some of those concerns as we proceed.</p>

<p><a name="09030233000011"></a>Amendment 54 would,</p>
<ul><a name="09030233000024"></a>&#147;ensure that appropriate training and guidance is provided for patients and (if different) payees to manage their direct payments and to safeguard effectively against potential abuse&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90302-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09030233000012"></a>In the excellent document that my noble friend produced last year and which I have read several times in the past few weeks, there are references to the circumstances in which payments will be made. On page 24, there is a reference to the:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09030233000022"></a>&#147;NHS continuing healthcare ... mental health services ... learning disability services ... maternity services ... end-of-life care ... and ... some long-term conditions, especially where there are complex needs or opportunities to focus on preventive interventions&#148;.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09030233000013"></a>Page 31 states that,</p>
<ul><a name="09030233000025"></a>&#147;personal health budgets can be used for any goods or services agreed as part of a care plan that are likely to meet the individual&#146;s agreed healthcare outcomes and would be appropriate for the state to fund&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09030233000020"></a>It talks about any goods or services that are agreed. On page 38 is a section that deals with the rights of patients to determine what they wish to purchase:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09030233000023"></a>&#147;People should have flexibility to spend the resources allocated to them to meet their needs flexibly, and in ways which reflect their own priorities&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09030233000021"></a>I presume&#151;I am just a consumer not a professional&#151;that there will be circumstances in which the patient argues with the person designing the care package about what should be made available, and there will be divisions of opinion. In many ways, we are absolutely dependent on the expertise of the people who are designing that care package.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09030233000014"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, in her very famous speech, which deserved a parliamentary award&#151;it was a marvellous speech&#151;commented that she could not get through to the person in the National Health Service what she wanted. They kept telling her that they wanted to spend &#163;3,000 and she kept telling them that she wanted to spend &#163;200. There did not seem to be the ability to communicate. Obviously, she is very articulate and she told them what she wanted, but they were not giving her what she wanted. Do not get me wrong; I am not against the whole idea, but I wonder whether the expertise is there in healthcare, which I would have thought is

<a name="90302-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09030233000015"></a>I can imagine circumstances in which the patient might say, &#147;I want a &#163;200 mattress&#148;. The manager might say, &#147;It is in your care package, but we think you should have this mattress&#148;. I cite my own example. I have a whole series of complaints, one of which is ankylosing spondylitis, which noble Lords will know is an extremely painful and disabling condition. I have three beds in three different places, all of which could have cost me &#163;3,500 apiece if I had bought them from Adjustamatic and not Dreams, where I paid &#163;450 apiece for exactly the same bed. Who is going to determine where the bed is bought? Will the source of the bed be determined? Mine rises and falls. I might wake up three or four times a night, and I press the buttons to change the position of my spine to relieve pain. If I had one of these packages, I might well want a particular kind of bed and they would disagree. I will not have one of these packages, because I will be one of those people who do not want to go into the system. I will rely on the health service to provide for my needs. I am just a little concerned about how that might operate in practice.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09030233000016"></a>However, I am also worried about firms, such as Adjustamatic and other companies, which line up to pressure their patients to buy products and ring me up because they know from the records of firms with which I have been in contact to buy pain-relieving equipment that I have a particular problem. People who are in receipt of these payments may suddenly start receiving phone calls and be targeted by people saying, &#147;We think this is a very good product for you. We think you should buy this. You need this massage machine or that exercise machine. You need all these so-called alternative medicines that are now on the market&#148;.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09030233000017"></a>When all this pressure is put on patients, will they be able to resist the purchase of the product, particularly in the area of pain relief for arthritis and other such conditions, rather than what the person building the care package has decided might be in their best interests? Last week, I received a catalogue from a firm called Verdict. It shows a massage seat that costs &#163;1,299. I know that that chair can be very helpful to people who have a particular kind of pain because I have sat in one in St Bartholomew&#146;s Hospital, and it works very well. What happens if the patient says that he wants one of those chairs, and the person producing the package thinks he does not need it? That potential area of conflict interests me.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09030233000018"></a>Amendment 54 refers to abuse. I do not know what the safeguards might be, but is it possible that in a care setting someone might want the client to buy a piece of equipment for him, not for the person who is the patient being funded by direct payment? I hope that these problems will be dealt with in the regulatory arrangements that Ministers will subsequently introduce. Unless I misunderstood the amendment moved earlier by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, I think that he was trying to relax the regime by trying not to have too heavy regulatory control over what could be acquired in those circumstances. I

In those circumstances, there might be greater potential for abuse.</p>

What will the Minister say about complementary and alternative medicine? Let me reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, by making it clear that there is no doubt that osteopathy and chiropractic by well trained personnel are valuable in the management of musculoskeletal disorders of various kinds. There is also no doubt that there is a physiological basis for the use of acupuncture in certain situations and that it has a role to play. Equally, patients with certain chronic conditions, not least those with terminal illness who may for instance be dying of cancer or other conditions, get great comfort from complementary medicine such as aromatherapy, massage and similar techniques that have no direct curative or therapeutic effect but are complementary to the other treatments that they are receiving. I support all of them. On the other hand, there is no way in which direct payments should ever be used for such things as iridology, radionics or crystal therapy, which have no evidence base and should never be paid for by the NHS. How can that be prevented?</p>

<p><a name="09030249000001"></a><b><a name="90302-gc0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09030249000152"></a>Baroness Wilkins:</b> I shall speak to Amendments 63A, 69A and 69B in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Campbell. I hope that this group of amendments will help to provide a solution to the various points that have been made. I hope that it is clear that I support Amendment 69, but I believe that more than advocacy services and advice is needed because managing the direct payment is important. I was pleased to hear the strong case made by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, in her introduction to the first group of amendments, on the vital need for support services for people receiving direct payments, and I look forward to the further point that she wishes to make on this group.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000002"></a>The purpose of these amendments is to ensure that the importance of effective support is recognised and built into the pilot schemes on direct payments. My noble friend&#146;s reply on Second Reading was somewhat tentative, when he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09030249000134"></a>&#147;We would expect the PCTs to work with local authorities and third sector organisations to provide guidance and support&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report, </I>4/4/09; col. 752.]</p>

<p><a name="09030249000130"></a>He said that &#147;independent or peer advocates&#148; may also have a role in supporting people through the process.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000003"></a>I urge the Minister to make it clear that effective support is an essential element in establishing successful direct payment schemes, and in doing so I again declare my interest as vice-chairman of HAFAD, which is a user-led organisation that runs a support scheme for direct payments users in social care. The social care model in direct payments has clearly demonstrated the benefits of peer support from user-led organisations. The benefits of taking control over one&#146;s services are considerable, as the famous speech of my noble friend Lady Campbell, spelt out so well on Second Reading.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC233"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column GC233</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90302-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000004"></a>The transition of being a passive recipient of services to take control is not a simple one. As any employer knows, there are many pitfalls to be avoided, which can be serious if people do not have the right advice, advocacy and support. Managing support is crucial.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000005"></a>HAFAD&#146;s support scheme has numerous examples of people who have been put on direct payments by the local authority without any reference to support but who are left to negotiate the transition on their own. Last summer, a woman faced huge bills because she had not paid any national insurance for her personal assistance or paid tax, assuming that that would be dealt with by the council. Others have faced the trauma of a threatened employment tribunal because they advertised wrongly and were totally unaware of their legal responsibilities as an employer.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000006"></a>Our experience at HAFAD shows that the professionals&#151;social workers, in this case&#151;are not aware of employment obligations and are not equipped to give this time-to-time support. The most successful direct payment scheme is in social care, where new users are put in touch with a local body of expertise that is built up by their peers who have gone through the same process as themselves.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000007"></a>User-led organisations give people the confidence to take up the direct payment, as too often people are put off by the notion that they will be cast adrift to do everything themselves. The National Centre for Independent Living, which has long experience in this area, supports the pilots but warns that the schemes could be ineffective if support is not available. The health pilot schemes will benefit considerably if the Minister ensures that we learn from the social care precedent and establish effective support arrangements. The right support will mean that people can maximise the use of their direct payments, greater numbers will be attracted to take part, which will help in the analysis of the pilots, and most important, there will be higher user satisfaction and the increased likelihood of people&#146;s health aspirations being met. It is a false economy not to ensure that people have the backing of such user-led support, advocacy and advice in the pilot schemes. I hope that my noble friend will support the amendments.</p>

Some organisations, such as In Control, have a wealth of experience in this area. So, too, do other organisations, in a different way. My former employer, Age Concern, has a tremendous amount of experience in enabling older people to access services, just like any number of other voluntary and carers&#146; organisations. However, those organisations have a direct interest in these pilots. In Control is a social enterprise and is therefore a business, and has an interest in seeing that the pilot work well. So, too, do some of the service providers. I do not think that those financial interests, those conflicts of interest, are wrong; they are just a fact of life. In a pilot, however, they and the role that they play need to be acknowledged. I hope that the noble Baroness would agree with me that, in the design and review of the pilot, that very

<p><a name="09030249000009"></a><b><a name="90302-gc0004.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09030249000154"></a>Baroness Campbell of Surbiton:</b> I will speak briefly in support of the amendment, because we have gone over all the arguments on the importance of a support scheme quite well. There is an awful lot to learn from the 28 years of experience of setting up support to help people to become independent and to self-manage. I hope that we will truly draw on that experience in the pilot and not reinvent any wheels.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000010"></a>The one important thing that we have not spoken about much is advocacy in these support schemes. I do not mean advocacy simply to get the care package that you want, but advocacy to enable the organisation and the development of this different culture of self-operated care to be discussed and understood by the providers, local authorities and PCTs in the future. There is still very little knowledge about what direct payments are. You go to a PCT and talk about direct payments, and they kind of look at you, a little blurry, and say, &#147;Ooh, isn&#146;t that something they do in social care?&#148;.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000011"></a>There is resistance, which we have already heard about, from the social care workforce. It took us probably about 28 years to persuade social workers that we were the experts in our own situation, and that this could actually be a shared approach to the development of social care in this country. I spoke to an older person, who was 70 and using direct payments, last week. She said, &#147;Fundamentally, it comes down to doing things with people, not to them or for them&#148;. She emphasised the &#147;with&#148;. We do not do this on our own; it has got to be a contract.</p>

<p><a name="09030249000012"></a>It is important to look at support services not only in terms of the information and advice on the nuts and bolts of employment, contracts or pay and conditions. That is all very important and has been vital. Resistance from the local social services has also been looked at, people have been talked to who have said that the people down at their day centre could not manage, and truly believed it. Those people said, &#147;It is all right for you. You&#146;re articulate, you&#146;re okay, but not my people&#148;. An element of cultural shift still has to be made.</p>

<p><a name="09030249000013"></a>In the IBSEN analysis, I was particularly struck by the statement that most pilot sites report major challenges in the changing attitudes and culture of care managers and other staff. That resistance was reported among the team working with mental health users and older people, which shows that we still have a long way to go.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000014"></a>In supporting the amendment proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, I would say that it is not possible to take pilots forward without support services and that it is not possible to have support services without good funding, about which we have not talked. One of the best support services for direct payments in this country is the Bristol centre for independent living. Hundreds of disabled people became effective direct payments users. The centre did not have a single issue for about six years. Then its funding was cut, and I know of two ongoing tribunals, simply

I am a big supporter of the proposal and I do not think that we should look at pilots without also looking at support services, as proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins.</p>

To date, I have not seen any evidence of any conflict of interest, but I hope that their role will be clearly shown.</p>

I cannot leave my home in Yorkshire without my helpers. One of my helpers is pregnant, which causes problems for the disabled person. There are certain things that the helper cannot do, such as helping someone into bed, out of a car or so on. The father of my other helper had a brain operation last week, so both my helpers had to go to their homes. I had to call in an agency, which is five times more expensive. I am worried about the expense of such care. Direct payments must be flexible because things happen. Employing people is not straightforward. It has its problems, as was illustrated by the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins.</p>

A feature of voluntary sector organisations&#151;I declare all my interests and involvements, which I hope will count&#151;is that they listen to the person in front of them par excellence, which is why patients and carers seek them out and use them and they continue to thrive. They also build enormous experience through listening, so that when problems arise they can advise in a flexible way. Nor are they locked into the rigid guidance, protocols and formats that there may be in more standard organisations. It is very important that people using direct payments can obtain advice and support from outside the statutory sector as well as commission such services. Outside support will probably prove to be the most invaluable thing of all, which is why this amendment is so important.</p>

<p><a name="09030249000019"></a><b><a name="90302-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09030249000159"></a>Lord Darzi of Denham:</b> These amendments deal with the provision of information, protection and support for recipients of direct payments for healthcare and the protection of staff providing services under a direct payment. I will address the amendments in turn, starting with those that relate particularly to information, advice, advocacy and support.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000020"></a>Amendment 52 was tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe. It introduces a specific power to make provision for ensuring that the recipients of direct payments for health care have access to relevant information. Amendment 54 was tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, and explicitly enables regulations to provide for patients or their representatives to receive training and guidance to help them to manage direct  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC236"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column GC236</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>payments for health care safely and to safeguard against potential abuse. Amendment 69 restricts new Section 12D to enabling the Secretary of State to require primary care trusts to commission advice and advocacy services. Amendment 69A, which was tabled by the noble Baronesses, Lady Wilkins and Lady Campbell, expressly allows arrangements to be made with user-led organisations to support direct payments, and Amendments 69B and 63A create an expectation that voluntary and user-led organisations will be commissioned to produce advice, advocacy and other support to people using direct payments.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000021"></a>I entirely agree with noble Lords that patients and their representatives should be able to access the information and training that they need to make informed choices. This policy is about patients&#146; care and their direct payments, which are fundamental to the success of the policy. Personal health budgets, including direct payments, will succeed in giving greater choice and control only if people have information and support that is tailored to them.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000022"></a>In our document, <I>Personal Health Budgets: First Steps</I>, we said that PCTs should work alongside local authorities and voluntary organisations to give appropriate support and information to patients. One of the six key principles of the programme is ensuring that people can make well informed decisions about the care they need. Organisations that are led and controlled by people who use services and voluntary organisations may well play an important part in providing advice and advocacy and may have a wider role: for example, in carrying out assessments, acting as care co-ordinators or supporting patients in other ways. The Bill allows flexibility for that.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000023"></a>Information and support could be delivered in many different ways, including through existing social care systems, independent advocates, peer support, brokerage organisations or self-management courses. The best way of delivering support to patients is likely to vary between different groups and different individuals. This is something that will need to be decided locally and depending on the conditions. An overly prescriptive approach in legislation could inadvertently become a barrier to innovative practice. Instead, we want to encourage local innovation and build the evidence through piloting to show where direct payments are of greatest benefit and which forms of support are most effective.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000024"></a>We are talking about pilots. If the Bill receives Royal Assent, there will be draft legislation and we will consult on it. It will include all the debates that we have had today and the amendments that have been tabled. We will bring the regulations before Parliament before the pilots of direct payments start. I do not want to be prescriptive at this stage, and I hope that noble Lords agree that the approach under new Section 12B is sensible.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000025"></a>Amendment 53 would require that regulations be used to ensure that all providers of services for vulnerable patients be vetted and undergo mandatory checks. I start by emphasising that the safety and welfare of all patients who receive services using direct payments are  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC237"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column GC237</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>obviously paramount. Clearly, patients who lack capacity to make decisions about safeguarding are an especially vulnerable group. Mandatory checks of providers provide important safeguards for vulnerable patients. However, it is important that these mandatory checks are proportionate to the risks presented. I can assure Members of the Committee that we intend to be consistent with the approach set out in the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000026"></a>The department has recently consulted, in the context of direct payments for social care, on how best to ensure that a person lacking capacity is safeguarded from any potential abuse that may occur while they are receiving social care. Our thinking is that, for vulnerable patients who do not lack capacity but wish to have someone else deal with their payments, the patient will be responsible for nominating a person to receive direct payments on their behalf. Where a patient lacks capacity to consent, regulations could contain provision for payments to be made to a third party, as I explained in the debate on the previous amendment.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000027"></a>If the person receiving direct payment is not a family member or friend, they would have a duty to check that providers of services are properly vetted, monitored and not barred from working with vulnerable patients under the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act. If, on the other hand, the person receiving a patient&#146;s direct payments is a friend or family member, then the provider may be checked, but it would not be mandatory. I hope that Members of the Committee will agree that this is a proportionate and sensible approach to the issue of safeguarding.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000028"></a>Finally, Amendment 57, tabled by my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours, deals with the issues of protecting staff who provide services funded by direct payments. As we set out in <I>Personal H</I><I>ealth </I><I>B</I><I>udgets: </I><I>F</I><I>irst </I><I>S</I><I>teps</I>, the success of personal budgets and direct payments will depend on staff: those who support and agree care plans and budgets for patients; those who monitor those budgets and the conditions of individuals; and, obviously, those who deliver services. This is a lesson that came across clearly from the evaluation of individual budgets in social care.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000029"></a>It is likely that the development of personal budgets will require significant cultural changes at all levels of the NHS, which should not be underestimated. There may be far-reaching changes to the way in which staff work. It is vital that the pilots help us to understand fully the implications for staff, including issues such as employment status, terms and conditions, training and development, professional development, career progression, and workforce planning and development.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000030"></a>In social care, we know of concerns from recent research that care workers employed using social care direct payments may not have received sufficient training opportunities. In a minority of cases, there may not be full compliance with employment law. However, we also know that other people using direct payments to employ care workers are keen to see that their staff have good terms and conditions and access to training. Only if directly employed staff have terms of employment that are legal, reasonable and fair will the quality of care they deliver be of the required standards. All  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC238"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column GC238</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>those who directly employ staff will need to understand their responsibilities. PCTs overseeing the pilots will need to ensure that patients and carers have the information and support they need to act as responsible employers.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000031"></a>All staff should be involved and engaged in steering the implementation of personal health budgets and direct payments, and in developing appropriate training required. We will therefore be looking for evidence that front-line staff and unions are engaged and supportive during the pilot selection process. I assure my noble friend that we are constantly working with UNISON at the moment to get an agreement on this. More importantly, however, both we and the unions have a lot to learn from the pilots in tackling some of these important issues. The success of the national rollout will be based on that.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000032"></a>I hope that I have reassured Members of the Committee that the evaluation programme will specifically look at the implications of personal health budgets for staff. Again, if the evidence from the pilots showed that there was a case for setting explicit conditions to protect staff, I would like to put it on the record that the existing regulation-making powers in the Bill would allow us to do so.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000033"></a>Before moving to my conclusion, a few other points have been raised. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, raised how the direct payments would be regulated. The direct payments will be consistent with the existing policy of regulation of health services, where services would otherwise need to be registered through CQC, or a practitioner would, obviously, be subject to professional regulation.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000034"></a>The different examples of my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours, whether it was a chair or a mattress, made the case of why we need these pilots and how much we can learn from them. At the same time, however, the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, also said that we can learn a lot from what we have already evaluated in social care. I hope that we can capture many of these things as we bring legislation back, rather than putting them in the Bill, as I said earlier.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000035"></a>I am not sure that the noble Lord, Lord Walton, was in his seat when I addressed crystal therapy, which I know very little about, in the debate on the last amendment. The whole purpose of these direct payments is to have agreement with the care manager; it should be part of the care plan. Osteopathy or hydrotherapy, to which I made reference earlier, are two good examples whereby such interventions could be part of the care plan.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000036"></a>My noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours also mentioned individuals or providers who may abuse this money for their own self interest, rather than in the interest of the patient. We intend that the care plan must be agreed by the care manager, as I said earlier, but also by the PCTs, before any money is spent. I hope that inappropriate treatment will not be agreed by the PCTs. Again, I hope that we can learn more about that from the pilots.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000037"></a>I hope that I have given enough explanation on this group of amendments. I am sympathetic to all of them in this group: information, education and training, whether you happen to be a patient or the staff delivering  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC239"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column GC239</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that care, are extremely important. I hope that I have reassured Members of the Committee that we will capture all of that and bring it back to Parliament in regulations before these pilots are instigated. I hope that Members of the Committee will feel able to withdraw their amendments.</p>

<p><a name="09030249000038"></a><b><a name="90302-gc0005.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09030249000160"></a>Earl Howe:</b> This has been a useful debate. I thank the Minister, in particular, for his reply.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000039"></a>I am still unclear about two things. How will the evaluation of the pilot be able to assess the quality of the information and support that patients have received? That will not be very easy. Patients themselves will not necessarily know how good or bad their support and information have been, so that area needs thinking about.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000040"></a>Can the Minister clarify to what extent patients will be employers with the legal responsibilities that go with employer status? He spoke briefly about that in his reply, but I want to be clear about it. In the field of social care, one of the things that has weighed heavily on certain people who have received direct payments is that they have suddenly found themselves in the position of being an employer, with PAYE, statutory sick pay and everything like that which a business has to contend with as a matter of routine but which an individual is not necessarily well prepared for. Can the Minster comment on that as it applies to healthcare delivery?</p>

<p><a name="09030249000041"></a><b><a name="90302-gc0005.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09030249000161"></a>Lord Darzi of Denham:</b> The evaluation issue will come up in debates on later amendments, but I will touch on it now. We will, I hope, get an independent evaluator, an academic organisation. We are also looking for calls of interest, and I have no doubt that this will include not only qualitative but quantitative appraisal of the pilots from a patient&#146;s perspective against the evidence base to which we referred earlier.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000042"></a>Will patients be employers? The answer is yes; they could become employers, as I said earlier, with all the employment regulation that comes with that. We are not ruling that out of the pilots. Again, I hope that, through the pilots, we can learn not only from a patient&#146;s perspective but, as I said earlier, through the staff&#146;s perspective, a lot about employment roles, employment laws and staff training.</p>

<p><a name="09030249000043"></a><b><a name="90302-gc0005.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09030249000162"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> Would not the pilots collectively be a good subject for the National Audit Office to consider in a value-for-money inquiry that could be reported to the Public Accounts Committee? It would probably throw up some of the difficulties that had arisen, particularly where there might be concern about the use of public money.</p>

<p><a name="09030249000044"></a><b><a name="90302-gc0005.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09030249000163"></a>Lord Darzi of Denham:</b> If that is another avenue that we can use to evaluate the pilots, I will certainly look into it.</p>

It is probably time that we moved on. We can always come back to these issues at a later stage. In the mean time, there is a lot in what he has said to digest. I therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I think he will find that it is perhaps preoccupied with contemplating Armageddon at the moment; I refer to the article in last week&#146;s <I>Times</I> by Mr Steve Bundred, in which he talked about the prospects for the future of funding public services&#151;an issue that is not unrelated to the debates that we are having now.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000047"></a>We have taken a great deal of time over things this afternoon. I simply wish to move Amendment 52A and speak to Amendment 60, for two simple reasons; nowhere does it say that someone can refuse to have a direct payment, and I want to establish that you do not have to have lost mental capacity to exercise the choice not to have a direct payment. That is a very important thing to do, not least because, it is fair to say, there is a degree of enthusiasm that sometimes borders on overestimating the appropriateness of direct payments for people. It is important that we have on record the fact that it is a legitimate thing for people to say, &#147;No, I don&#146;t want this. I just want a service, thank you very much. That will sort out my needs&#148;. That is a very good marker, which we should put down.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000048"></a>Amendment 60 has a different purpose. It would do two things. First, it calls into question and seeks to probe the part of the Bill that says that the Secretary of State has the power to recover a due debt that is paid in a direct payment. It also seeks to flag up to noble Lords the fact that you cannot read directly across from social care to health. Issues arise in health that do not arise in social care. One is misdiagnosis. It is possible in social care to have different views about what people&#146;s needs might be, but that does not arise from misdiagnosis.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000049"></a>I shall give a quick example. Noble Lords might remember a case a few years of an older gentleman who was treated for mental illness, including being subjected to ECT. It transpired after about three years, during which time he was sectioned and subject to compulsory medication, that he was not suffering from mental illness; he had Lewy disease, a degenerative brain condition&#151;a form of dementia. That is just one small example of diagnoses going wrong. What happens if a set of direct payments have been put in place on the basis of a misdiagnosis?</p>

An issue flagged up earlier this afternoon was what happens when the amount of a direct payment runs out? If someone is in receipt of a direct payment and then discovers that it is insufficient to pay for the healthcare that is needed, two risks arise. First, the person will not receive the care that is needed and, secondly, he or she might regard the budget as something to be adhered to at all costs and start self-rationing to

What will be done to ensure that recipients of direct payments are not put in that position, which could arise even with treatments for a long-term condition that is stable and predictable? Will the Minister confirm that the fact of a personal budget being fixed at a set amount does not mean that the NHS would not step in and either top up the budget or pay for other treatment if that was clinically indicated?</p>

<a name="90302-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000051"></a>The second issue refers to clawback. How practical would it be in a given set of circumstances to claw back money that has already been paid out? How would that be done? Would it not be better to allow for unspent portions of personal budgets to be carried over from year to year if the care plan allowed scope for that to happen?</p>

<p><a name="09030249000052"></a><b><a name="90302-gc0005.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="09030249000168"></a>Baroness Cumberlege:</b> I shall address Amendment 55 in relation to top-ups. At the briefing last week, I asked whether a person who was granted a direct payment for a nurse for three days a week and wished to employ her for another two days would be allowed to top up from their private resources. Page 27 of the <I>Personal Health Budgets: First S</I><I>teps</I> document states that,</p>
<ul><a name="09030249000142"></a>&#147;people may not &#145;top up&#146; their personal health budgets from their own resources. If, for any reason, a person wanted to purchase additional care privately, this would have to take place separately&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90302-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000053"></a>Taking my example, if someone had a nurse daily for an hour and a half and decided that she wanted more services, so paid for an extra hour on the same morning, presumably that would not be separate and would not be allowed as it would be considered to be a top-up. I am in some dilemma as to when it is or is not a top-up and how can it be done separately if you are employing the same person on the same morning for an additional service that is not allowed in the care plan?</p>

<a name="90302-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000055"></a>I will go back to the issue of the position of UNISON and say a few words on my Amendment 58. UNISON feels strongly on this issue. I wonder whether my noble friend might respond. As I have already said, the union is not absolutely opposed to the principle; its opposition is centred on the potential for service reductions arising out of the proposals as they are currently set out. It recognises and supports the need for health services to be more responsive and able to provide more tailored support to some patients, but it does not believe that direct payments will be either a long-term or a satisfactory solution as currently proposed. While it is wholly opposed to a policy that could easily lead in its view to means-testing patient top-up fees for services or greater barriers to services for those who most need them, it does not feel that at this stage it is a risk worth taking, particularly at a time of tightening economic conditions.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000056"></a>I refer my noble friend to the words on page 26 of his document, where he refers to the fact that there are no additional resources to be made available and more

If they cannot inject more money into the system and the budget runs out, what happens? Additional money has to come from somewhere. I presume that, in the circumstances of someone&#146;s budget running out, additional money will have to be injected into the system, which is in breach of the principle set out on page 10 of the document. Will my noble friend explain the contradiction which is built into that statement and the assurances that we have been given from the Dispatch Box on Second Reading?</p>

I seek assurances from the Minister that discussions have been held with both the National Assembly for Wales and the relevant department in Scotland on cross-border issues, particularly for those people who live close to the border. Has there been consideration of whether people want to purchase from NHS Wales or NHS Scotland? What happens where care is given for patients who live right up against the border?</p>

As I explained earlier, we do not believe that personal health budgets would be right for everyone, or in all areas of the NHS. One of the core principles that we have outlined is that personal budgets will be purely voluntary.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90302-gc0006.htm"/>


<a name="90302-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000060"></a>Specifically in relation to direct payments, the Bill enshrines the importance of consent at the outset. The very first sentence of proposed new Section 12A gives power to,</p>
<ul><a name="09030249000143"></a>&#147;make payments, with the patient&#146;s consent, to the patient or to a person nominated by the patient&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90302-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000061"></a>Also, as I mentioned before, the NHS Constitution makes clear that patients have the legal right to accept or refuse treatment that is offered to them and not to be subjected to any physical examination or treatment unless they have given valid consent. I hope that the words &#147;patient&#146;s consent&#148; in that first line and the rights in the constitution will reassure the noble Baroness in relation to the amendment.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000062"></a>I now turn to Amendment 55 tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, and Amendment 58, tabled by my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours. These amendments make particular provision under new Section 12B to regulate whether patients can receive services in  addition to those for which a direct payment for health care has already been made. I understand that there have been concerns on this issue from two perspectives. Some noble Lords have been concerned that patients might be turned away from essential NHS care if their direct payment runs out. Conversely, others have raised concerns that patients might spend their direct payment  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC243"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column GC243</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>inappropriately and come back for more, diverting NHS resources away from other patients. I hope that I can reassure noble Lords on both counts.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000063"></a>First, I should emphasise that direct payments are absolutely not a matter of handing over cash payments and walking away. As we outlined in <I>Personal Health Budgets: First </I><I>Steps,</I> there would be safeguards at several stages. To start with, we intend that personal health budgets will be offered only where there are potential benefits for the individual. There will be many patients and many services where personal health budgets will not be suitable. They will include circumstances where the patient&#146;s needs are fluctuating or unpredictable so that it is not possible to set a budget sensibly. Alternatively, a budget might be set for only some aspects of the care pathway, not all of it, enabling the patient to receive other services in the traditional way, so having two parallel services, one paid for by direct payments and the other paid for by the NHS through the usual commissioning processes.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000064"></a>Secondly, there will be an agreed care plan, as I have said before, for how the personal health budget will be used to ensure that the proposed services are suitable for the patient&#146;s agreed needs and that the budget is sufficient to pay for it. Thirdly, there should be effective arrangements for monitoring and review, looking at both the clinical outcomes and the financial elements of the personal health budget. Only then can PCTs be sure that high-quality services are being delivered, and that the patients are safe and making progress towards their agreed outcomes. Regular monitoring should ensure that any shortfall in the agreed budget or a need for a change in services or provider can be spotted promptly and corrected. If a personal health budget or direct payment proves unsuitable, a patient could be offered traditionally commissioned NHS services in the usual way.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000065"></a>To answer the point made by my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours, paragraph 14 on page 26 clearly states that there will be a &#147;contingency component&#148; so that if the money runs out we will at least be ready to meet the aspirations of the patient. In addition, <I>Personal Health Budgets</I><I>: First Steps</I><I></I>sets out a clear principle that no one should be denied essential treatment as a result of having a personal health budget. There should be no question of patients being turned away from NHS services if they need them. In conclusion, I am confident that the safeguards I have described should avoid problems arising in the way that some people have feared.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000066"></a>I now turn to Amendment 56 tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, and Amendment 60 tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker. These amendments relate to the provision for reclaiming a direct payment from a patient. It may be helpful if I explain why we believe we need this flexibility.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000067"></a>The provision as it currently stands is designed to allow the NHS to reclaim money if a direct payment is underspent. I envisage that the need to consider repayment will be very rare in practice. Normally, underspend will be carried over and deducted from the next direct payment. However, it may be appropriate to reclaim it; for example, if the direct payment stops, the patient  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC244"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column GC244</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>stops that direct payment or opts out of being part of a direct payment scheme. This power is important for managing taxpayers&#146; funds responsibly. In addition, we expect regulations to require that direct payments be paid into a separate bank account on a regular basis, possibly monthly. This means that where payments are recovered, they would usually be taken from the same dedicated account and would cover only a short period. That should avoid the risk of creating financial hardship for individuals, should such a rare case arise,</p>
<h5><a name="09030249000148"></a>6.30 pm</h5>

<a name="90302-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000068"></a>As we set out in the department&#146;s briefing note for noble Lords, we wish the Secretary of State to be able to use discretion in exercising this power. For example, there might be cases where it would be disproportionate or inappropriate to recover payments. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, that that might well be the case where there had been a wrong diagnosis, and that power would not be exercised. However, it is conceivable that there might be deliberate fraud by a patient, which has been touched on before, as well as a mistaken diagnosis. We would not want to rule out recovery in that situation. Misdiagnosis is only one of many potential circumstances where recovery might not be desirable. I would be reluctant to specify that in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000069"></a>In the unlikely event of fraud, the Bill provides power under new Section 12B(4) for reclaiming direct payments as a civil debt. For serious abuse of the system, criminal sanctions would be available under the Theft Act 1968 or the Fraud Act 2006. Our provisions, which follow the approach taken in the social care legislation, are deliberately flexible to allow for discretion in dealing with these difficult circumstances and to ensure we can learn lessons from the pilots.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000070"></a>I turn to the question raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, about top-ups. Personal health budgets must be compatible with the core principle that NHS care is based on clinical need, not ability to pay, so top-ups will not be allowed when it comes to personal health budgets. However, we have debated top-ups on numerous occasions. If, for any reason, the patient wishes to purchase additional care privately, it will have to be taken separately and with clear accountability in line with the response that the Government gave to Professor Mike Richards&#146;s review of additional private drugs. I doubt the issue will arise. I expect most patients to go back to their care manager and negotiate some of their extra needs if the issue arises. The partnership working between the patient and the care manager or provider that the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, mentioned will address some of these issues. If top-ups come up, we have clear guidance from the Richards review.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000071"></a>In the light of these explanations, I hope noble Lords are reassured and will agree to withdraw their amendments.</p>

There was wide scepticism about the nature of the pilots in social care and the extent to which they genuinely reflected the concerns of different client groups within social care. Scepticism also arose from the department&#146;s response to the IBSEN review. If one were to read the press release that went with it, one would be tempted to see the pilots as having been an unqualified success. Yet when one studies the report in detail, there is a great deal in it that shows that there are issues that are yet to be fully and adequately addressed, and there are some differences that are capable of interpretation in different ways.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000074"></a>My amendments are an attempt to say that when it comes to piloting individual budgets in healthcare, where there is not only a far greater number of client groups but also different categories of patients, there is a need to make sure that we have different demographic and geographic pilots that encompass all those differences. I beg to move.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09030249000137"></a>&#147;Given the huge impact that the introduction ... could have on patients ... UNISON is very concerned that the Bill does not outline a satisfactorily detailed pilot scheme. While we welcome the fact that a pilot process has been written into the Bill, we believe that any pilot process would need to ensure sufficient consideration by the Secretary of State before a decision ... is taken. The whole piloting process will lack credibility if it is not thorough, independent, transparent and detailed and UNISON would urge the Government to give more statutory assurances that this will be the case&#148;.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000076"></a>In my amendment, I argue that strategic health authorities in different parts of the country are faced with different problems. It might well be that the arrangements that apply in central London will be  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC246"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column GC246</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>very different from the arrangements that exist in west Cumberland, from whence I cometh, south Wales, the north-east or wherever. It is important that we get a wide spread. I hope that in replying on the amendment my noble friend will assure us that this will proceed only on the basis that there is that kind of national coverage and that every condition in every part of the United Kingdom is covered by whatever arrangement is made.</p>

<p><a name="09030249000077"></a><b><a name="90302-gc0006.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09030249000177"></a>Baroness Masham of Ilton:</b> I support that amendment because conditions in a rural area are totally different from those in a large urban area. I know this very well, having been in the Yorkshire region where you have big cities such as Leeds and sparsely populated areas such as north Yorkshire.</p>

Amendment 61, tabled by the noble Baronesses, Lady Barker and Lady Tonge, is about the impact of the pilots on different demographic groups. Amendment 63 is about control schemes for the pilots, and Amendment 64, tabled by my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours, would require at least one pilot scheme in each strategic health authority in England. I should start by assuring noble Lords that we will commission a rigorous scientific evaluation of the pilots, as outlined in our policy document. The pilot programme and evaluation will start later this year for models of personal budget that are allowed under current legislation: in other words, the notational budgets. Then, subject to parliamentary approval, the pilots will be extended next year to include pilot schemes for direct payments, to which the Bill relates.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000079"></a>The department is currently in the process of tendering for a team of researchers to carry out the evaluation of the personal health budgets programme as a whole. Our aim in the tender is to specify the outcomes that we want to measure&#151;we have already debated most of them&#151;not to prescribe the evaluation method. However, I have no doubt that we can learn a lot from this debate. We will be looking for innovative and rigorous proposals from bidders. For that reason, I am unable at this stage to give noble Lords exact details of how the evaluation will work. However, I reassure them that we will be looking for the most innovative bids that try to address most of the questions that we have debated.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000080"></a>The evaluation will be based on a wide range of qualitative and quantitative evidence, and we will draw on the lessons of the IBSEN review in social care. That examined in detail the effect of individual budgets on a range of people, conditions and social groups. As the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, pointed out, a lot has been learnt from it and we could probably do better and make our evaluation more rigorous. We are also now seeking expressions of interest from PCTs to become part of the pilot programme. Applications are due by the end of March.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000081"></a>The department is currently running a series of regional events. I reassure my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours that we are going through all 10  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC247"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column GC247</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>strategic health authorities trying to engage as many PCTs as possible and encouraging them in order to get applications from across the country. I anticipate a positive response from the NHS. I saw the excitement in one of the deliberative events. We hope that pilot proposals will cover a range of services and conditions. I would be very pleased if we received applications from PCTs in every strategic health authority.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000082"></a>However, where PCTs do not wish or are unable to apply to be pilot sites, I do not want to force them to do so. We are looking to harness existing enthusiasm in the NHS for personalisation, rather than to impose pilots on PCTs by selection by the Department of Health. I would be reluctant for the Bill to specify a precise geographical spread, but I reassure the noble Lord that we will do all we can to encourage innovative bids from across the country.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000083"></a>On demographic groups, I agree that it is important to examine the effect of personal health budgets on different groups of people. <I>Personal Health Budgets: First Steps</I> made it clear that the evaluation would look at the impact across different groups by condition and background. This is particularly relevant because the IBSEN review of social care individual budgets revealed that not every group benefited equally. In particular, older people were less satisfied with the use of individual budgets. It will be important for the evaluation to look closely at these issues to help to understand how personal health budgets can be introduced in a way that benefits all groups. One of the challenges that we have in the next 10 years, as highlighted in <I>High Quality Care for All</I>, will be caring for more older people. I sympathise, but I do not want legislation to restrict individual pilot sites to looking at a particular demographic group. The current clause would allow that flexibility if necessary, but it is more likely that pilot sites would cover a range of different groups of people. It would be for the evaluation team to synthesise information from all the pilots and draw conclusions about the impact on different groups.</p>
<h5><a name="09030249000149"></a>6.45 pm</h5>

<a name="90302-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000084"></a>Finally, on of control sites, I assure noble Lords that we expect the evaluation team to gather evidence from control or comparison groups. There are various ways of doing this. For example, there could be separate control sites outside the pilots from different PCTs with similar characteristics. There might be control areas within the pilot sites: for example, GP practices that do not participate in the pilot. In principle, although we believe this to be less likely, the evaluation could use a randomised approach, as in the IBSEN study. We are leaving that open, depending on the bids that we receive.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000085"></a>Again, our aim is to prescribe the outcomes that we want to measure, not the evaluation method. I hope that I have reassured the Committee about that. We are committed to commissioning a high quality and rigorous evaluation for the pilot programme. That assurance is backed up by the safeguard in the Bill, which we will discuss in our debate on the next group of amendments. Parliament will have to give explicit approval, through the affirmative procedure, for any future decision to roll out direct payments more widely. I am sure that noble Lords will wish to see robust and

I hope that I have convinced the Committee of the evidence and the way in which we plan the rollout, and that noble Lords will not press their amendments.</p>

<p><a name="09030249000086"></a><b><a name="90302-gc0006.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09030249000179"></a>Baroness Barker:</b> I thank the Minister for that reply. The amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, is very timely and well meant. I say that for a particular reason. There are different forms of evaluation of direct payments and individual budgets. The IBSEN review is clearly the biggest, but there are others. According to the last edition of In Control&#146;s newsletter on its website, 9,068 people had individual budgets for direct payments in social care. That is a huge increase on the year before. If one looks behind that headline figure, we begin to unravel some interesting points. Some 50 per cent of those involved are older people, but 50 per cent of the people in that group of just over 9,000 come from only three local authorities: Manchester, Oldham and Hartlepool. That is quite surprising given that it is currently a performance measure for local authorities that they should be trying to get people on to individual budgets. It is clear that not all local authorities are reporting back to In Control.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000087"></a>More than that, we know for a fact that, until two weeks ago, one of those local authorities was refusing FOI requests to find out how many of the people they were funding were older people, people with learning disabilities or people with mental health problems on the grounds that it was a pilot. Therefore, those data are of limited value. We should be clear when we take the potentially significant step of rolling out individual budgets to health that the data on which we do that are sufficiently robust that criticisms cannot be levelled at the programme and it cannot be undermined. This will happen at a time when budgets will be under great pressure. The data have to be robust, and we cannot allow enthusiasm to run away with us. That is part of the reason for that proposal.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000088"></a>I understand what the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, was trying to do. He was right to point out some of the population differences. Having said that, over the past 20 years, there have been a number of pilots in different places&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, mentioned some of them&#151;but they do not quite capture all the issues. They do not, for example, capture some of the issues about which older people feel more intensely than younger people. Older people being supported and enabled to return to work is not as big an issue as it is for younger people. Yet loneliness is a very big issue for older people. That is why we must make sure that the population groups included in these pilots are as big and diverse as possible, so that the data are sufficiently robust. On the basis of the Minister&#146;s assurances, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09030249000089"></a><b><a name="90302-gc0006.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09030249000181"></a>Baroness Barker:</b> We continue to talk about the review of the pilots, which again is one of the most important things that we will talk about today. All afternoon I have been explaining why, just in the field of social care, there has been a great deal of reservation about the way in which the pilots have been conducted. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, that the IBSEN review is thorough and commendable research. However, it is telling that as thorough and detailed as it is, even today it has been interpreted in very different ways.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000090"></a>On an earlier group of amendments, the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, said that it had demonstrated that direct payments were cost-effective. However, it does not quite say that. It says that measures of cost-effectiveness vary across client groups. On page 240, the review says that in social care the market may change and the impacts on costs may play out. Direct payments may in future be less cost-effective than they are now. Even with such thorough research, an awful lot is left open to question and a lot of issues are left dangling even by the researchers, because they were unable to answer them.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000091"></a>With that in mind, a number of these amendments have been put forward. Amendment 62 probes a part of the Bill that has caused interest across social care. The Secretary of State seems to be being given a power to revoke the pilot without reference to other people. Amendment 65 asks not only that there should be an independent review, but that there should be an independent review of all pilots. Amendment 66A reiterates the point made by various Members of the Committee today on the need to look at the impact on different client groups and to ensure that what is rolled out is applicable to all.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000092"></a>Amendment 67 says that the pilots cannot be moved on to further status before all of them, not just one, have been reviewed. To a certain extent, that reflects the surprise at the department&#146;s announcement in December 2007 that individual budgets would be the way forward for social care, even before the reviews of the pilots had been completed.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000093"></a>Amendment 68 asks that there be a report to Parliament. Amendments 68A and 68B would address something that was raised in IBSEN research: that people should have been in receipt of direct payments for a year. There is a reason for that. In some client groups, a person&#146;s health can change dramatically over the course of a year. One of the shortcomings, which is admitted by the researchers from the University of York, was that, in the report of the IBSEN pilot, some people had had a direct payment for only a matter of few weeks or a couple of months, and some of them had not even actually had it. When looking at the impact on people&#146;s health, and given that older people are the majority users of the health service and that the majority of those users have multiple health conditions, we need to see how this works out over a period of time, during which a proper health assessment can be made.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000094"></a>These amendments are tantamount to some quite severe reservations about the pilot programmes. I beg to move.</p>

We cannot predict all the difficulties that may arise as the pilot schemes run on, but, more to the point, I would feel comfortable if the Secretary of State&#146;s evaluation of the pilots was a closed process. There is a lot of enthusiasm out there for direct payments in healthcare, as we have heard, but a lot of nervousness and apprehension as well. It is important that we get this right. I bring us back in particular to support and advice, the quality of which needs to be evaluated as part of the overall exercise if we are to learn the right lessons for the wider rollout of direct payments.</p>

<p><a name="09030249000096"></a><b><a name="90302-gc0007.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09030249000183"></a>Baroness Cumberlege:</b> I pay tribute to the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, and her diligence in taking through legislation. However, she implied that I had perhaps got wrong what the IBSEN report said. The report says that individual budgets,</p>
<ul><a name="09030249000144"></a>&#147;appeared cost-effective for social care outcomes&#151;i.e. they produced better outcomes for the costs incurred, compared with standard care&#151;but not for psychological well-being, with some differences between groups. IBs were cost effective for mental health service users and physically disabled people with respect to both social care and psychological well-being outcomes. For people with learning disabilities, IBs were cost-effective with respect only to social care. For older people, there was no difference in social care outcomes, but standard care arrangements remained slightly more cost-effective and people receiving these felt happier&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09030249000132"></a>Perhaps we are quoting from different parts of the same report. I am quoting from the pr&#233;cis that they did to ensure that people could see all the report but in an encapsulated form. I am quoting directly from the IBSEN individual budgets evaluation network.</p>

I am considerably reassured by what my noble friend has already said about the evaluation of these pilot schemes, particularly that there will be a reputable, independent, academic body that will carry out the review. Will he confirm that the department will be bound by the findings of this body and that the Government will withdraw or suitably amend certain parts of the scheme according to the recommendations of this independent report? As we have heard, many highly complex issues are involved in these schemes, and it is important that as many as possible of these are ironed out before the scheme spreads to the whole country. I deliberately did not use the term &#147;rolled out&#148; because it has been overused.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000098"></a>The evaluation team and its protocol should be well in place before the pilot starts so that it knows exactly how to conduct the study. Is that in the plan? What proportion of PCTs will undertake these pilots? Will they be involved in mounting the schemes and hosting the valuation teams?</p>

<p><a name="09030249000099"></a><b><a name="90302-gc0007.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09030249000185"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> Would it be possible for the local authority overview and scrutiny committees and county authorities to have a role in evaluating the

Often their reports are what I would call near to the ground. I understand the use of independent expert teams, and so on, but the danger is that these organisations are from outside and do not understand all the local circumstances. I should think that overview and scrutiny committees would have a local input role.</p>

<p><a name="09030249000100"></a><b><a name="90302-gc0007.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09030249000186"></a>Lord Darzi of Denham:</b> There are many amendments so I may take a little time to go through them. Most of them are concerned with the review of the pilot scheme for healthcare direct payments. I re-emphasise that we intend to carry out a thorough and rigorous evaluation of the personal health budget in general and of direct payments pilots in particular. We acknowledge that there are many unknowns and uncertainties, which we have debated today. That is precisely why we need to pilot them. On that same note, I made it clear in <I>High Quality Care </I><I>f</I><I>or All</I><I></I>that a number of policies in that document need to be evaluated. We debated the quality accounts last Thursday. On personal health budgets, the department should and will be heading to evaluate policy as academically rigorously and independently as possible. That research will be commissioned independently by an external research group, which I hope will happen some time after the tender has gone out in March.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000101"></a>Amendment 62, moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, would omit our current clauses which provide explicit powers to use regulations to enable us to revoke or amend a pilot scheme. Our general intention is that the pilots should be clearly defined from the start, like any other study, and should be properly evaluated as they run. We hope that there will be little need to change the scope fundamentally once the pilots are up and running. However, and I say this as an academic, there will need to be a degree of flexibility. For example, the power in regulations would allow us to adapt pilots in response to emerging lessons. We will learn a lot of lessons as the pilots are launched. We would be able to extend the scope of a pilot midway if it became clear that there were benefits for other services or for patients, or perhaps if the full effect of the pilot could be measured only if more patients were recruited.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000102"></a>In the last resort, we will be able to cancel a pilot scheme if the model being tested is obviously not working as intended. Being able to have the power in regulations to adapt or stop a pilot scheme is a sensible precaution, but that should not impact the academic evaluation. Even a failed pilot would tell us a lot that we needed to learn, if those rare circumstances arose.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000103"></a>Amendments 65 and 67, tabled by the noble Baronesses, Lady Barker and Lady Tonge, and the noble Lord, Lord Rea, require an independent review of all pilots. Amendment 68B ensures that the pilots run for a year before any decision about national roll-out. At this stage, I can put on record our intention to evaluate all the direct payment pilot schemes, not just some of them. We will probably learn more from those that fail about how we can address the issues that caused that failure. We intend the personal health budgets pilot programme to run for at least three years, with direct payments being used for at least two years. The one-year requirement is surpassed by our policy.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC252"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column GC252</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90302-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000104"></a>However, it would be unnecessarily prescriptive to put these details in the Bill. For example, the current drafting requires a review of &#147;one or more&#148; rather than &#147;all&#148; pilot schemes. This wording does not signal any intention to cut corners on evaluation, but it provides a degree of flexibility. There may be circumstances where it is not appropriate to review all pilots together before a decision on national roll-out is made. If one pilot took significantly longer than others to produce results relating to certain demographic groups or a certain condition, but the evidence from other pilot sites for or against direct payments was overwhelming, I would not wish to create unnecessary delay before making a decision. These pilots will deal with different conditions and different demographics. Noble Lords will also appreciate that there may be a range of pilot programmes running covering a range of services. The legislation allows us sufficient flexibility to allow direct payments for one service, while continuing to pilot others.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000105"></a>Amendment 66, tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, requires the department to carry out a formal consultation before any review takes place. As an integral part of the review, I envisage that the evaluation team will gather the views of individuals and organisations. My noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours raised a point in relation to the overview and scrutiny committee. It will be one of the stakeholders, and I have no doubt that that academic evaluation will include it as part of its stakeholder team. I am confident that the review of the pilots will draw on a far wider and richer range of evidence than would be produced by a conventional consultation exercise.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000106"></a>Amendment 66A ensures that regulations require that the review evaluates the impact of direct payments on specific patient groups. At this stage, as I explained earlier, we do not intend to define the types of patients or services that would be eligible for a personal health budget, and we are awaiting the different and, we hope, innovative bids that will come in following the call.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000107"></a>Amendment 68 requires the Secretary of State to present Parliament with the findings of the review of the pilots before making any decision to roll out direct payments for health care nationally. I emphasise that before the Government can extend direct payments more widely, both Houses of Parliament must give their express approval through the affirmative resolution procedure. That is an important safeguard; it is a stronger safeguard than these amendments provide. At that stage, we will need to lay out our evidence, so that your Lordships may make an informed decision. It is not necessary to add an explicit requirement to present Parliament with the findings from the evaluation.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000108"></a>I turn finally to Amendment 68A. New Section 12C provides a power to extend direct payments nationally by allowing the Secretary of State to make an order repealing the limitation that direct payments may be made within pilot schemes only. New Section 12C also provides a power, at subsection (6)(b), for an order to amend, repeal or modify any provision of the 2006 NHS Act. This amendment would remove that provision.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC253"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column GC253</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90302-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000109"></a>I can understand that, on first glance, this may seem a sweeping power for the Bill to contain. However, it simply provides the power to make any consequential amendments to the NHS Act that may be necessary to facilitate the wider rollout of direct payments. It is tightly constrained by subsection (7), which makes it clear that the power may be used only for the specific purpose of making changes relating to direct payments and not for any wider reason. We believe that this is a balanced and proportionate approach, which was endorsed by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in its report on the Bill.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000110"></a>The need to retain flexibility for the pilots inevitably means that we cannot prescribe every detail in the Bill. However, I hope that Members of the Committee will be reassured by my answers, particularly by the use of the affirmative procedure as a safeguard before any future extension of direct payments. Therefore, I hope the noble Baroness is able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09030249000111"></a><b><a name="90302-gc0007.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09030249000187"></a>Baroness Barker:</b> I thank the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, for that very full response to the large number of issues raised in this group of amendments. When I moved the amendment, I should have said that I took considerable care to look at the material provided by the department, for which I am very grateful to the noble Lord. The other week, his department gave Members of the Committee a briefing on direct payments, specifically about the evaluation.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000112"></a>This may be known in the business as the curse of PowerPoint, because there are some very brief headings, about which I meant to inquire. What the evaluation that the department is about to commission will cover is set out and includes financial impacts. What do the financial impacts concern? Does the evaluation refer to the financial impact on patients, providers or commissioning? That is not clear. Analysing innovation and responsiveness in the provider market is also referred to. What about market failure? We know that when market mechanisms are introduced, that can bring about market failure. Part of this is designed to do that. We have not had extensive market failure in the social care world, because the pilots have been running alongside the existing system of commissioning block contract services. That might be the case for the pilot phase, but I imagine that, ultimately, it will not be further down the line.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000113"></a>I should say to the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, that I did not seek to imply that she had not done her homework or that she was misquoting. She was reading from the summary and it is right to say that that is part of the report. It is a bit like going to the theatre and seeing the Reduced Shakespeare Company do the &#147;To be or not to be, that is the question&#148; soliloquy, and then not hear the rest of it.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000114"></a>In the full report, the points made by the noble Baroness are put into more detail and more context. The researchers are more tentative about what their findings may mean for the future: for example, when there is a more fully developed supplier market in social care, individual budgets have been running for a considerable time and no longer is block contract tendering going on by local authorities. It talks about how, if the price of an individual care service goes up,  


<notus-date day="2" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC254"></a><b>2 Mar 2009 : Column GC254</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it may have an impact on the cost-effectiveness of that service, particularly if it is being provided for only one user as opposed to a large number of users, and there are no economies of scale. I am not accusing the noble Baroness of misquoting: it is just that there is a more detailed picture in the fuller report. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, will answer my points.</p>

I spend a fair bit of time teaching the Department of Health how to do PowerPoints, but this one comes from the policy strategy unit, which knows how to make PowerPoints. That is why the words used are &#147;financial impacts&#148;.

That is what the bullet point refers to.</p>

The noble Lord will understand why there has been the concern that there has been about the pilots. The potential impact of individual budgets on the healthcare service is enormous. The pilots in social care were not able to talk about longer-term effects, such as the effects on the number of providers, choice and so on. There are still many questions to be answered. That is why I moved the amendment, and I welcome the Minister&#146;s response. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

It is a particular issue for older people, but it also applies to other client groups. This is to do with perhaps one of the few occasions when healthcare takes place not in an individual&#146;s home or a hospital, but in a residential home or a care home. It is important to stress that this is that person&#146;s home; it is where they live while they happen to receive healthcare.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000119"></a>The problem is that sometimes the NHS is willing to only pay a certain level of hotel costs. That means that older people in particular may not be able to go into a home that either is of a quality or a standard that they want, or is not near their relatives. The amendment seeks to establish that people who are in receipt of continuing healthcare can make a top-up to that to enable them to receive that healthcare in a home that they wish to be in, but which the NHS may perhaps not fund or not fund to that level. We are talking about a group of people whose needs are such that they cannot manage some of the more creative arrangements used by other people in order to get round their health problems because they are restricted in mobility. The amendment could make an immense difference to a small but significant group of people. Therefore, I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09030249000121"></a>Our position is clear on the general question of patients wishing to pay for additional private care. As noble Lords are aware, we debated the Richards review and the Government's response to it. Similarly, we have made it clear that personal budgets and the direct payments that we will be piloting may not be used as part payment for privately funded healthcare. I know that noble Lords will wholeheartedly agree that there must be no question of creating a two-tier system where those who can afford it can buy a better standard of NHS care.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000122"></a>However, we know that there have been concerns about a specific question relating to NHS continuing healthcare patients who want to make a contribution towards the &#147;hotel&#148; costs of their accommodation. From the perspective of the patient, those costs may not appear to be part of the core clinical package of NHS care, so I agree with the noble Baroness that there can be confusion among patients about whether they are allowed to pay for them. The issue was raised during the consultation on our draft guidance on secondary care and we are currently considering consultation responses.</p>

Our principles are clear; no one has the right to pay for a different level of NHS care. However, I recognise that there may be a need to clarify the position on the very narrow question of &#147;hotel&#148; costs.</p>

<p><a name="09030249000124"></a><b><a name="90302-gc0007.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09030249000193"></a>Lord Walton of Detchant:</b> Might I raise an issue about which the Minister may not be aware? At the beginning of the National Health Service&#151;and I remember it well because I was practising medicine before it came in&#151;it was possible for individuals to purchase what was known as an amenity bed while continuing to have hospital care. They could pay an additional sum simply to have the convenience of a more comfortable room, for instance. It was purely for the hotel component of their care and not for anything to do with their medical care. That went out a long time ago, but this rather reminds me of that method.</p>

I believe that that still happens although we may be talking about slightly different things. The issue needs more clarity. It was raised in the consultation and most of us would agree that NHS continuing healthcare is a complicated area and there are many implications to think through.</p>

<a name="90302-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09030249000126"></a>I reassure the noble Baroness that we will continue to look at this. I hope that we will be able to address the issue, although perhaps not in the context of this Bill. It is an issue that the department is looking out with great care. With that reassurance, I hope that the noble Baroness is able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="0903025001056"></a>EU: European Council</h2>
<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="0903025000003"></a><b><a name="90302-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="0903025001053"></a>The Lord President of the Council (Baroness Royall of Blaisdon):</b> My right honourable friend, the Prime Minister (Gordon Brown) has made the following Statement in the House of Commons.</p>

<a name="90302-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="0903025000004"></a>I attended an informal meeting of the European Council in Brussels on 1 March with other EU leaders.</p>

<a name="90302-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="0903025000005"></a>We discussed the EU's continued response to the economic downturn and measures that will be part of the agenda for the G20 London summit on 2 April. Leaders agreed on the need for co-ordinated action to meet unprecedented economic times and restore confidence in the global financial markets.</p>

<a name="90302-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="0903025000006"></a>First, EU leaders agreed to improve regulation and supervision of financial institutions. We need new regulatory standards, improved risk management and systems to foresee, prevent and manage crises in the banks and in the markets. There should be no financial market in the world where risks can be run that threaten the very integrity of the global financial system. We will need cross-border supervision of financial institutions.</p>

<a name="90302-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="0903025000007"></a>Secondly, the whole world must agree that protectionism is not the answer to the crisis. EU leaders therefore agreed in Brussels on the need to reject protectionism while continuing to make maximum use of the single market as the vehicle for recovery to support growth and jobs. We agreed that the European recovery programme, finalised last December, continued to provide the right framework for EU action to help jobs and growth, and agreed we should assess the implementation of it both at the European and national levels at the spring European Council on 19 and 20 March.</p>

<a name="90302-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="0903025000008"></a>Thirdly, we agreed that the EU must continue to play its part in stimulating the global economy with a co-ordinated fiscal stimulus and European-wide action to keep interest rates low. Europe's recovery plan must have high skilled, high technology and low carbon priorities at its heart.</p>

<a name="90302-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="0903025000009"></a>Fourthly, we again agreed on the need to deliver urgent and substantial reform of the international financial institutions. We need more resources for the international financial institutions to prevent and deal with financial crises in different countries. We agreed on the need for early warning systems and reform of the World Bank.</p>

<a name="90302-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="0903025000010"></a>On employment, EU leaders agreed on the importance of measures to counter the negative impact the economic crisis was having on employment. I welcome Prime Minister Topolanek's decision to convene a special

<a name="90302-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="0903025000011"></a>We discussed the particular impact of the global financial crisis on central and eastern Europe. We acknowledged the clear differences between member states in the region, but noted the longer-term benefits to those countries of EU integration. We agreed and welcomed the importance of EIB finance to the region and welcomed the recent announcement by the EIB, World Bank, and EBRD of a &#8364;25 billion joint initiative to support the banking sectors and businesses in the region. We agreed to keep assistance provided to those countries under review.</p>

<a name="0903025000012"></a><b><a name="90302-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="0903025001054"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord West of Spithead):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Crime Reduction (Alan Campbell) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90302-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="0903025000013"></a>I have today published a consultation paper, <I>Controls on Deactivated Firearms</I>, which seeks views on how to reduce the use of deactivated firearms in crime.</p>

<a name="90302-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="0903025000014"></a>The Government do not want to interfere with the legitimate collection of deactivated firearms and are looking for a proportionate but effective response to the problem. The consultation paper sets out a range of possible options for reducing the availability of deactivated firearms to criminals.</p>

<a name="90302-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="0903025000015"></a>Copies of the consultation paper are available in the House Library and on the Home Office website at <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk">www.homeoffice.gov.uk</a>. We should be glad to receive views by 25 May.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="0903025000017"></a>The latest figures from 1 April 2007 to 31 March 2008 show that the number of police operations in which firearms were authorised was 21,181&#151;an increase of 17.5 per cent on the previous year.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="0903025000018"></a>The number of authorised firearms officers (AFO&#146;s) was 6,780&#151;an increase of 52 (1 per cent) officers overall on the previous year.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09030244000001"></a>Notes</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09030244000002"></a>i) Source: Home Office Public Order Unit, based on information aggregated from figures provided by individual police forces as part of the Home Office Annual Data Requirement. This was followed by a further quality assurance process involving the Home Office asking individual forces to verify and sign off their figures.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09030244000003"></a>ii) * indicates revised figures for 2006-07 from Bedfordshire Police.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09030244000004"></a>iii) The information provided is a regular annual update of figures previously published (<I>Official Report</I>, 31 January 2008, col. <I>WS49</I>), and on the Home Office website.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09030244000005"></a>iv) Home Office guidance to forces for providing these figures is contained within the booklet Annual Data Requirement, Police Personnel and Performance Data, Notes for Guidance. For the purpose of this statistical return AFOs are deemed to be deployed when &#147;they are required to conduct a specific task during which their possession of a firearm (with appropriate authorisation) is a required element&#148; (Chapter 3, paragraph 3.1 ACPO Manual of Guidance).</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09030244000006"></a>v) In addition to the total number of operations, a further sub-category is required regarding those operations where the initial or sole response is by armed response vehicle (ARV).</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09030244000007"></a>vi) Each incident will be classed as only one operation regardless of the number of personnel/deployments or tactics employed to deal with the incident.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09030244000008"></a>vii) Deployments also include those incidents where AFOs &#147;self-authorise&#148;.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09030244000009"></a>viii) The number of officers authorised to use firearms as at 31 March 2008.</p>

These build on measures announced on 8 October last year.</p>

<a name="90302w0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a><a name="09030220000004"></a>The Government intend to negotiate lending agreements with the banks participating in certain facilities. These will have specific and quantified lending commitments, and will be binding and externally audited.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a><a name="09030220000005"></a>These measures have helped to stabilise the credit market. This is an essential condition for banks to develop greater confidence to lend to creditworthy businesses, homeowners and consumers.</p>

<ul><a name="09030220000102"></a>

<a name="90302w0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a><a name="09030220000007"></a>Although the general picture on charitable assistance to Gaza is positive, many people have raised concerns about the position of the UK-registered charity Interpal following difficulties with retaining banking services in the UK.</p>

<a name="90302w0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_3"></a><a name="09030220000008"></a>The banking issues affecting the charity are unusual, and are not representative of the wider picture on the ability of UK charities to provide aid to those in need. However, we still share concerns about any interruption to humanitarian aid. While commercial decisions on providing accounts and clearing services are for the banks themselves, we are discussing with relevant parties how best to ensure that charities can retain access to the banking system.</p>

The recent cuts in interest rates announced by the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee are expected to have a positive effect on inter-bank lending and credit markets more generally. As credit conditions ease, the banks should pass on savings to their customers wherever they can. The Chancellor has met with the CEOs of the major UK banks to make this clear.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_58"></a><a name="09030220000082"></a>British nationals without the right of abode do not enjoy a right as set out in the Protocol 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights. This is because the UK has signed but not ratified Article 3 of Protocol 4 to the European Convention on Human Rights. The protocol was signed in 1963 but not subsequently ratified because of the potential conflict with our domestic law in relation to the issue of British passports and the acquisition of a right of abode by categories of British nationals who do not currently have that right.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_59"></a><a name="09030220000083"></a>British nationals continue to be admitted freely to the United Kingdom on production of a United Kingdom passport issued in the United Kingdom and Islands or the Republic of Ireland prior to 1 January 1973, unless their passport has been endorsed to show that they are subject to immigration control. British nationals may also naturalise or register as a British citizen under the British Nationality Act 1981 and therefore acquire the right of abode in the UK under the Immigration Act 1971.</p>
