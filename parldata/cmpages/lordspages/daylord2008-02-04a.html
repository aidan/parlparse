Our plan is for symptomatic patients to be treated irrespective of the profession to which they belong. If the pandemic virus necessitates any form of prioritisation, the decision will be taken in the light of evidence available at the time.

Decisions of this nature are difficult. However, we believe that initially limited supply will depend on the clinical impact of the pandemic. For example, if certain population groups are more severely affected, other members of the same group might be inoculated once a vaccine becomes available. A pandemic-specific vaccine could also play an important role in preventing a second pandemic. As for consultation, we will consult our advisory groups, which include both the scientific and ethical communities.</p>

We have highlighted through a number of educational websites and through the BMA and colleagues at doctors.net.uk the way in which we could educate healthcare workers in the provision of vaccinations.</p>

The possibility of export bans was discussed during the negotiations process for the advanced supply contract. As a result, the risks of nationalisation or the closure of borders have also been minimised as far as possible with the following provisions. First, the production facilities must be located in the EU and remain within the EU unless the UK Government give written consent otherwise. Secondly, manufacturers have warranted that the host country of production has either already sourced all the vaccines it needs for its own population or it is aware of its commitments to the UK Government.</p>

It is important to remind the House, however, that it was not in Sir John&#146;s interim report, which was published in October, so we have had very little time to consult on it. There are good things about the idea but we have learnt, not least through MMC, as I am sure the noble Baroness will agree, that structures without clarity and explicit lines of accountability can create major problems. We will respond to this recommendation as soon as possible as part of our reply to Sir John&#146;s report.

For example, when I was a trainee, for my first job I wanted to apply to become a brain surgeon, but I realised very quickly that the opportunities in that area were fairly limited.

With regard to the UK being a centre of excellence in providing training for those who come from abroad, that is well known historically.

This provides a more broadly based post-16 qualification, meeting the criteria that the noble Lord has set out. That is available at the moment in an increasing number of state schools and colleges, and within the private school sector. It is the Government&#146;s policy that it should be available from at least one provider, be it a college or a school, in each local authority area. However, we do not believe that it is right to deprive young people of the ability to choose to study A-levels, as they can at the moment. As the noble Lord, with his immense experience of the university world, will be only too well aware, opinions in the maths and science community are by no means unanimous on this subject. There are many admissions tutors and teaching professors, including some in our top universities, who would not welcome any dilution of the concentration which sixth-form students are currently able to give to give to maths and science. That is part of the reason why there is at the moment no consensus about the move towards a more broadly based baccalaureate system post-16.</p>

Recently, Professor Douglass Turnbull from Newcastle University has taken matters further. Through a simple process of in vitro fertilisation an ovum from a woman with mitochondrial disease has been fertilised by her partner or husband&#146;s sperm, and as soon as the first cell is formed it contains two pronuclei, one from the woman and one from the partner or husband containing  100 per cent of the partner&#146;s DNA and 99.95 per cent of her DNA. That process has been successfully carried out under licence from the HFEA.

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="08020422000100">In many ways, this amendment is linked to the next one, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, and the noble Lord, Lord Walton, which is about purposes of infertility. These two amendments could include the making of embryos with altered nuclear and mitochondrial DNA cells added to the embryo other than their own cells. An embryo would not need to be made by fertilisation. This amendment cannot be considered in isolation. It would be better considered when this Bill goes to another place and is considered in Committee there. It is best left to the proceedings that will ensue there rather than being resolved today.

The noble Lord, Lord Walton, may recall that the Government accepted the recommendation made in June 2000 by the Chief Medical Officer&#146;s expert group on stem cell research that this type of research should be permitted subject to the controls of the 1990 Act and that we subsequently brought forward regulations to achieve that. The Government are aware that promising research is under way that could lead to the development of methods for avoiding serious mitochondrial diseases. We are grateful to the noble Lord for his update following Friday&#146;s symposium. We took full account of this research in drawing up our proposals in the draft Bill and subsequently in the Bill presented to this House.</p>

<a name="80204-0002.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="08020422000102">The Bill provides, in new Section 3ZA in Clause 3, a power to make regulations covering eggs or embryos that have had applied to them, in prescribed circumstances, a process designed to prevent the transmission of serious mitochondrial disease. There is always a powerful case to be made for anticipating future developments in the Bill so that no time is lost if research bears fruit quickly. However, in this case there are a number of reasons why the Government have opted to come back to Parliament with future regulations to be decided by affirmative resolution, and we believe that this remains the most appropriate route. I assure noble Lords that we keep developments closely under review, as does the HFEA with its horizon scanning panel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="08020422000103">The safety aspects of implanting an embryo that has undergone a process of mitochondrial repair would need to be assessed carefully before this could be deployed as an option for patients. Moreover, the status of the egg donor in these circumstances&#151;the person providing the healthy mitochondria only&#151;would need to be considered, and we feel that further consultation is needed on this. This may be rather a different case from the current situation of egg donors. These are issues that we believe Parliament should be asked to take a view on when more facts are available about what the therapy involves, and what implications follow. We have ensured that the Bill contains the flexibility to return to this issue, in recognition of the progress being made. I hope that noble Lords will not feel it necessary to press this amendment before Parliament and the public are fully able to assess the implications of that progress. I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="08020422000110">On Report, we had a debate about this issue in which it was clear to all noble Lords that the potential to create artificial gametes offers an unprecedented opportunity in the treatment of infertility. Nevertheless, it is a scientific development that carries potential ethical questions, and it is important that Parliament debates the matter fully in order that scientists are given a clear indication of what the ethical limits to such scientific developments should be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="08020422000112">The second reason is perhaps more substantial. Noble Lords will remember that during our debates on the previous occasion, in replying to the noble Lord, Lord Patel, the noble Baroness said that the Government had some concerns that there may be issues of human rights compliance under Article 14. Therefore, the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, helpfully wrote to all Peers who had taken part in our debate on 31 January setting out the Government&#146;s response to a number of different issues. However, he did not mention what those concerns were in relation to this matter. Therefore, to enable Members of this House and of another place to understand the Government&#146;s concerns fully, can the noble Baroness tell the House what they are in relation Article 14? I realise that we are not in a position to resolve this issue today but I think that that would be helpful in enabling Parliament as a whole to take this matter to the point where it should be, which is as a potentially very exciting treatment for infertility and power to do good. Can the noble Baroness also tell us whether this matter will be discussed when the Bill goes to another place? I beg to move.</p>

It is very important to understand that the maturation of a gamete which has been artificially derived is a very complex procedure. It requires careful maturing of different events within the egg cell or the sperm cell. It has to ensure that the chromosomes are correct. It has to ensure that all the genes are expressing in a normal way. None of us wants to assume that this technique is going to be rapidly here. It is excellent that it is on the statute book but I hope that the Government will recognise that this has potential risks for the unborn child which need to be taken into consideration at whatever stage this technology is finally introduced. In my view, a huge amount of animal work will be needed before one can contemplate this procedure going to the human embryo.</p>

New Section 3ZA defines permitted embryos and gametes. With respect to gametes, this means that only an egg produced or extracted from a woman&#146;s ovary or sperm produced or extracted from a man&#146;s testes can be used in treatment. The Bill does nothing to prevent the creation or use of other types of gamete, including so-called artificial gametes for the purpose of research. The use of artificial gametes, or in vitro-derived gametes as they may also be called, refers to the creation outside the body of eggs and sperm from stem cells. If this technology were to be used in treatment, it would enable, for example, an infertile man who does not produce sperm to have a genetically related child. At Report stage we heard some persuasive arguments on the use of in vitro-derived gametes and we acknowledge that there is a lot of support for a regulation-making power that would allow at some point in the future gametes derived in such a way to be considered to be permitted gametes and therefore to be used in assisted reproductive treatment.</p>

We are also gathering information about progress in this area and the feasibility of this technology for use in treatment. This advice is in part being obtained from the HFEA&#146;s Scientific and Clinical Advances Group and its international horizon scanning expert panel and from discussions with other scientists and stakeholders.</p>

However, it provides for the possibility of limiting who could use this technology&#151;for example, limiting its use according to types of infertility or to same-sex couples wishing to have a child related to both partners. Developments in the field of assisted reproduction and embryo research can be fast moving, and the area of artificial gametes is no exception.</p>

That possibility, distinct though it may be, means that the Government must give serious consideration to what other technologies may realistically become available to determine the scope of any regulation-making power. Although the amendment would allow for the power to be limited, it would not necessarily be. Careful consideration would need to be given to such limitation to ensure that it is not discriminatory.

The Government are concerned about whether the technique is available for same-sex couples or whether they will be treated differently. If they are treated differently, the Government&#146;s view is that this must be justified to comply with Article 14 of the ECHR. Techniques for same-sex couples may be a lot further off or unsafe at this moment, and different treatment may be justified, but we are exploring these issues and will consider them further in the Commons.</p>

Noble Lords have debated extensively issues around fathers and mothers. The use of in vitro-derived gametes could mean children being born without a genetic father in some circumstances or a genetic mother in others.

It was probably the topic that the Joint Committee of both Houses that scrutinised the draft Bill spent most time considering. That was followed by a specific inquiry on the issue by the Science and Technology Committee of the other place. Noble Lords will agree that it has been the subject of most interesting and helpful debate while the Bill has been in this House. That the terms used during this process have ranged from &#147;hybrids&#148; and &#147;cybrids&#148; to &#147;interspecies embryos&#148; and &#147;human admixed embryos&#148; is indicative of how thinking on this has been modelled and shaped as views and debate have developed. I recall comments being made that the scientists who are expert in this field themselves struggled to reach a consensus on how to define an embryo. That indicates the difficulty that the Government and noble Lords have faced in trying to define the appropriate way through this complex and important area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"><a name="08020422000131">Throughout this period, we have been highly fortunate to have the input of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay. His views and amendments have been most welcome, and have given us a great deal of cause for thought. The definition of human admixed embryos in Clause 4 is accepted as hitting the mark by stakeholders, such as scientists working in this field, the Home Office and the HFEA, and this reflects the pressing of the Government by the noble and learned Lord to get this right. We should all thank him for that.</p>

<a name="80204-0003.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="08020422000132">We are now facing what we hope will be the final steps in this journey. At the moment, Clause 4 includes a regulation-making power to extend the definition of human admixed embryos if necessary. It has been included to ensure that if someone comes up with the type of human-animal embryo at the human end of the spectrum that is not captured by the definition, there is a power to extend the definition to catch it. This is a future-proofing mechanism. The noble and learned Lord is concerned that such a future-proofing provision is too broad and does not have relatively easy-to-understand phrases to indicate what it covers. His amendment seeks to make the provision more specific by applying it only to cases where the human DNA, not the animal DNA, predominates. His aim is to reflect the Government&#146;s intention that the Bill ensures that the HFEA regulates human-animal embryos at the human end of the spectrum.</p>

<a name="80204-0003.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="08020422000133">Yet, much as we are grateful for the hard work which the noble and learned Lord has put into this, we have concerns that phrases such as,</p>
<ul><a name="08020422000496">&#147;throughout the period of its keeping or use&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08020422000396">are ambiguous. For example, it could be read to mean that an embryo must predominantly be human for the entire period it is kept in order to be regulated by the HFEA. Clearly we want to ensure that any embryo that is predominantly human in its genetic make-up is regulated, however short the period that human DNA predominates.</p>

<a name="80204-0003.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="08020422000134">We believe that the principle behind the amendment is correct, but we cannot accept the wording as it stands. We also want to maintain the regulation-making power to extend the list of entities, which the amendment to Clause 4 removes. It is important to ensure that we can bring within the HFEA remit anything that we should need to. As we all know, this is a fast-moving field and we should be secure in the knowledge that we can amend the list should the need arise. We also believe that it would be best to give more time to the scientific community for it to reassure us that this approach does not give rise to any practical difficulties.</p>

<a name="80204-0003.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="08020422000135">In conclusion, we are grateful to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, and are content with the principles of predominant DNA that his amendment is intended to achieve, although we cannot accept it in quite the way it is drafted. We will give very serious consideration to bringing forward a government amendment in the other place. I invite the noble and learned Lord to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The Statement is as follows:</p>
&#147;With permission, Mr Speaker, I should like to make a Statement.&#147;As the House will be aware, there appeared in yesterday&#146;s <I>Sunday Times</I> allegations that conversations between my honourable friend for Tooting and a constituent of his, Mr Barbar Ahmed, detained in prison on an extradition warrant, had been subject to covert recording when my honourable friend visited Mr Ahmed on two occasions, in 2005 and 2006, at Her Majesty&#146;s Prison Woodhill.&#147;I was made aware of the burden of these allegations on Saturday afternoon. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary and I discussed the matter and we agreed that an immediate inquiry should be established. In a statement to the <I>Sunday Times</I> issued on my behalf early on Saturday evening I announced this, and expressed my concerns about the allegations, if true. &#147;It may assist the House if I now give some detail of the differing ways in which the statutory authorisation regimes for intercept and for intrusive surveillance operate. &#147;Just before I do so, let me underline, from my experience as a Minister directly involved in these matters over many years, that no authorisations are granted unless by law they are necessary for the detection or prevention of crime, or the protection of national security, or for related matters, are proportionate, and that the information concerned cannot be obtained by other means. &#147;Any authorisation for the interception of telephone calls and other public telecommunications requires a warrant personally signed by the relevant Secretary of State&#151;usually the Home Secretary in respect of the police, Security Service and other domestic law enforcement agencies; and the Foreign Secretary in respect of Secret Intelligence Service and GCHQ. Such a Secretary of State warrant is also  required for surveillance operations&#151;including eavesdropping&#151;by the three intelligence agencies.

<notus-date day="4" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_856"><b>4 Feb 2008 : Column 856</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The telecommunications regime is overseen by the Interception of Communications Commissioner, normally a recently retired member of the senior judiciary, currently Sir Paul Kennedy. This is laid down in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. Surveillance under this regime is overseen by the Intelligence Services Commissioner under the Intelligence Services Act 1994. &#147;Under the 2000 Act, the regime in respect of intrusive surveillance operations by the police and other domestic law enforcement agencies is different. Under these provisions, which originated with the 1997 Police Act, passed in the closing months of the previous Administration, with our support, there is a hierarchy of approvals depending on the nature of the surveillance concerned. In the case of eavesdropping operations, authorisation is required of a chief officer of police or officer of equivalent rank in the Metropolitan Police Service. This regime is supervised by the Chief Surveillance Commissioner, currently Sir Christopher Rose, formerly a senior judge of the Court of Appeal.&#147;Ministers play no part in these authorisations. Where any operation involves the use of HM Prison Service premises, neither the service, nor the Minister concerned, are asked for any additional authorisation for the operation. What the service is asked for, on the basis of a brief summary, is permission to conduct the operation and that judgment, by the service, is based on whether any order or control issues arise, and not on the merit of the authorisation itself. &#147;The <I>Sunday Times</I> story related to claims in respect of an alleged operation sought by and authorised by the police. It follows that this matter falls within the regime supervised by the chief surveillance commissioner. I can now announce to the House that with the agreement of my right honourable friend, the Home Secretary, the Chief Surveillance Commissioner, Sir Christopher Rose, has agreed to conduct an inquiry with the following terms of reference. To investigate the circumstances relating to the visits to Barbar Ahmed at HM Prison Woodhill, by Sadiq Khan MP, in May 2005 and June 2006, to establish whether the visits were subject to any form of surveillance and, if so, by whose authority, and with whose knowledge, and to report his findings to the Prime Minister, the Home Secretary and the Justice Secretary.&#147;This inquiry will be fact-finding. Sir Christopher has told me that his aim is to conduct the inquiry as quickly as possible, but consistent with the thoroughness required. He will do his best to complete his task within two weeks. A further Statement will be made to the House once we have received and have been able to consider Sir Christopher&#146;s findings.&#147;It may also assist the House if I mention two other matters. The first is the Wilson doctrine. This, as the House knows, was originally promulgated by the then Prime Minister, the late Harold Wilson, in 1966. He said that he had given instructions that there was to be no tapping of the  


<notus-date day="4" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_857"><b>4 Feb 2008 : Column 857</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>telephones of Members of Parliament and that, if there were a development which required a change of policy, he would, at a moment that was compatible with the security of the country, make a statement about it. &#147;The terms of this Statement have been endorsed by successive Prime Ministers, including Tony Blair in a Written Ministerial Statement to this House on 30 March 2006. In a Written Answer in September 2007, my right honourable friend the Prime Minister said:<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"><a name="08020422000439"> &#147;The Wilson doctrine applies to all forms of interception that are subject to authorisation by Secretary of State warrant&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 12/9/07; col. <I>WA 2103</I>.]</p>
</ul>&#147;Secondly, the question has been raised of interception or surveillance of conversations with any person, whether a suspect, a convicted criminal or otherwise, by their legal adviser. These are all subject to explicit safeguards which generally prohibit such interception or surveillance&#148;.

In particular, the House will wish to know whether it was known in advance that a Member of Parliament would be bugged and, if so, whether an explicit decision was taken not to switch off the recording equipment. It will also wish to know whether any higher authorisation was sought for any such decision, if such a decision was taken. The Government will need to establish whether this is an isolated case or whether the MP concerned has been bugged on other occasions, and whether other MPs, or indeed Members of your Lordships&#146; House,

It will be necessary to have a thorough inquiry, evidently conducted by a senior judge, to establish the wider facts.</p>

<a name="80204-0004.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="08020422000146">An important substantive issue arises from this. Everyone in Parliament understands and accepts the virtually absolute nature of the privileged relationship governing communications between a Member of Parliament and a constituent. The question arises: what would happen if a Member of Parliament were to become implicated in actions or communications relating to a terrorist plot? Frankly, and perhaps unsurprisingly, the Wilson doctrine is silent on this. We on this side of the House feel that the inquiry might usefully consider these issues.</p>

<a name="80204-0004.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="08020422000147">This case has exposed two rather serious risks. First, the Executive can apparently ride roughshod over the relationship between an MP and his constituents&#151;a relationship that is the basis of parliamentary democracy. Secondly, the necessary authorisations for secret anti-terrorist activity are apparently being ignored. The Government need to reassure this House on these two points, among others, and to do so quickly.</p>

The manner in which it has come out also causes concern. We have had a leak, clearly instigated by a whistleblower; the postal service, Royal Mail, is implicated in letters going missing; and, after some pressure since yesterday, we have now had this Statement in the House. It is a very brief Statement that is as sketchy as it could be to be any kind of meaningful summary of what has happened. It says very little and tells us very little. The noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, has asked a few questions, and I wonder whether I might add to  some of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="08020422000149">The inquiry is of course very welcome, and important things will come to light as we see the results. There are a few specific points to make. We understand that the security agencies asked for a review of the Wilson doctrine. Is that correct? If they did, what has been the Government&#146;s response to the request? If the Government do not wish to disclose that at this point, will they ensure that we get an idea through the inquiry of how applicable they think the doctrine is in the world we now live in? We also understand that the doctrine does not apply to e-mails. Is that correct, or are e-mail communications now subject to it? If not, are they likely to be in the future?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="08020422000150">My final concern is about the impact on and the damage done to the subject of the intercept. Although Barbar Ahmed might rightly have been of concern to the security services, you would not expect the finger to be pointed at a Muslim MP seeing a constituent. Will the inquiry look at whether the authorisation, if granted legally and lawfully, was specific to the particular Member of Parliament or to the particular person held in custody?</p>

<a name="80204-0004.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="08020422000151">Finally, can the Minister tell us whether he is holding any meetings with members of Barbar Ahmed&#146;s family and others as a matter of urgency to reassure them as to the agenda that was in place here?</p>

On the question of the letter from Mr David Davis, I reiterate that No. 10 has no record of its being received. I was asked whether the Wilson doctrine applies to the House of Lords, to which I can answer that yes, it does. Indeed, I understand that Lord Balfour of Inchyre, as Lord Privy Seal, made a Statement on 22 November 1966 stating that exceptionally, a Statement made by the Prime Minister in relation to the Wilson doctrine made it clear that it would apply to the House of Lords.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="08020422000153">The noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, asked about who authorised this, what rank were they, who knew in advance and whether there was a higher authorisation. I am not going to answer any of those questions because it is best left to the review I have announced. I thought that the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, was a little unfair. My right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor dealt with this matter the moment he heard about it by announcing that there would be a review. We have come to Parliament on the first day possible to make a Statement, and of course we will continue to engage with Parliament. My right honourable friend has already said that at the outcome of the review, a further Statement to Parliament will be made.</p>

<a name="80204-0004.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="08020422000154">On the Wilson doctrine, I specified clearly that it applies to all forms of interception that are subject to authorisation by the Secretary of State warrant. In response to the more general question the noble Baroness raised, it is better to see first the outcome of the inquiry. The Government can then consider what further action might need to be taken. The best thing is to have what it is hoped will be a very short inquiry which will answer some of the specific questions that have been raised. Then, in the light of that inquiry,  we can consider whether any further action needs to be taken.</p>

Perhaps I may ask for the Minister&#146;s assistance in this regard: in the 1960s I was a Minister in the Home Office, dealing with police matters from day to day. My understanding of the Wilson undertaking was that the protection given to a Member of either House of Parliament would be as close as possible to absolute terms, so as to make it an almost unique case if it was used exceptionally. Can I be given an assurance that that is still the case? Furthermore, whereas it seems that the protection is given to a Member of Parliament for a communication with a constituent, who, in such a situation, should the respondent be in relation to a Member of this House?</p>

<a name="80204-0004.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="08020422000178">Research into deriving embryonic stem cell lines for treatment purposes is proceeding, and UK-based researchers are widely regarded as among the leaders in the field. There have been recent reports, for instance, of embryonic stem cells having a great potential to treat acute macular degeneration, and researchers from Moorfields hospital in London and Sheffield University are now developing embryonic stem cells in a GMP-compliant facility&#151;meaning good manufacturing practice&#151;to take that work to the next stage of clinical testing. The Medical Research Council, with the Department of Health, has invested &#163;1.2 million to create laboratory facilities in which embryonic stem cells can be developed to appropriate standards for clinical application in humans. The MRC plans further investment in the development of tissue-typed embryonic stem cell lines.</p>

We were therefore surprised when, either in Committee or on Report, the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, suggested that the use of such cells in treatment was not allowed under the Act and that it might even require new primary legislation. However, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Darzi,

The Government&#146;s position has clearly changed. There appears now to be common agreement between the Government, my noble friend Lord Patel and I that the therapeutic and research use of embryo-derived stem cells in clinical trials would be regulated by the MHRA in consultation with the Human Tissue Authority and will not&#151;and should not&#151;be regulated by the HFEA. Indeed, the framework of EU directives and the like for that regulation is already in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="08020422000180">Neither I, nor the scientists, nor the Government are arguing that the HFEA will be involved in regulation beyond the use of the embryo to derive the cell lines. For those of us who wish to see the therapeutic use of this technology without the need for further legislation&#151;that now appears to be the Government&#146;s view&#151;the question is whether the terms of the original licence to create or use embryos, which can only be a research licence as the Bill stands, are adequate to enable us to say, with the certainty required by research scientists, their funders and investors, that therapeutic use will be permitted. That assurance requires more than an assertion of ministerial hope or parliamentary belief&#151;it requires legal certainty.</p>

<a name="80204-0005.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="08020422000181">I therefore ask the Minister to give a clear assurance that stem cell lines derived from embryos under a research licence can ultimately be used for treatment purposes once all stages of clinical research are completed.

<a name="80204-0005.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="08020422000186">The Government have consistently supported the use of cells derived from embryos for the treatment of human disease and medical conditions, and have therefore given the issue very serious consideration. On the basis of advice and discussions we have had following Report, the Government are of the view that the licensing framework which would be in place following the introduction of the Bill would allow the derivation of embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, it would allow the development of those cells into a therapeutic product without the need for further amendment. Any embryonic stem cell line intended for therapeutic use will need to be subjected to considerable research activity, including rigorous safety assessment, before entering into preclinical and clinical studies. As each cell used would be different, significant investigation would be required in each case prior to, and during, preclinical and clinical study.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="08020422000187">Regulatory oversight by the HFEA finishes once a stem cell line is derived. This means that once embryonic stem cell lines have been developed, the HFEA regulatory framework under which the embryo was produced is not relevant to any further use of that cell line, whether for further research or for therapy.</p>

<a name="80204-0005.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="08020422000188">There are a number of ethical and safety issues regarding the use of stem cells in patients that go wider than the regulatory remit of the HFEA.

The work will include providing, for patients who are to have treatment with donated sperm, eggs or embryos, guidance on the process of donor conception, its implications and its particular responsibilities. The aim is to prepare them for being the parents of a donor-conceived child. The work will also involve a &#147;telling and talking&#148; project that aims to encourage parents who have donor-conceived children to tell them, from a young age, about their origins.

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="08020422000200">Amendment No. 7 addresses concerns expressed in relation to the importance of parents discussing with their donor-conceived children, from an early age, details of their conception. Amendments Nos. 8 and 16 have two effects. The first strengthens the Bill  with respect to the provision of counselling and information, in addition to requiring that all patients be offered counselling and provided with information. It also requires that the HFEA produces, in its code of practice, guidance for the clinics about doing so. In addition, Amendment No. 16 introduces a provision which ensures that it is a condition of all licences that people being treated using donor gametes, or embryos taken from a woman who is not being treated, must be provided with information about the importance of telling their child that they were donor conceived, as well as information about the best way to do this. The combined effect of these amendments will mean that clinics are obliged to provide patients with information about the importance of talking to children about their donor conception, and that the code of practice should provide details of what information should be provided, as well as how the offer of counselling should be made.

While I am entirely supportive of the amendment, I am one of those who share the anxiety that children are denied their childhood these days by sometimes being treated as adults when they are too young.

I should like to make two brief points. First, I say to the right reverend Prelate that I hope that children are brought up in an atmosphere where they know from a very early age. We know from all the work in adoption that children fare much better when they know about their situation when they are very young indeed. It does not then come as a shock later on. Children who suddenly discover, at quite a young age, that they are adopted, find that extremely difficult to deal with. I remember talking to a child of four, when I was on Childline, about what &#147;adopted&#148; meant because she had just found out and was in a slight state of shock. She was being helped by an older child to call Childline to talk about this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="08020422000207">I did not have the opportunity to make my second point, but having spoken to a number of donor families, the thing that really concerns them is not being ordinary families. I understand that and we want them to be ordinary families as much as they can in bringing up their children. We want to get to the most resistant families who do not want to engage in telling the children at all about their backgrounds.

<p><a name="stpa_95"><a name="08020422000240">I will be brief and begin by saying that the potential of adult stem cells is now widely recognised in the scientific field. I will mention three quick examples, all very recent. Professor Thomson of Wisconsin, a leading figure in the field, says of retroprogrammed adult stem cells:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"><a name="08020422000457">&#147;By any means we test them, they are the same as embryonic stem cells&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020422000398">Rudolf Jaenisch, head of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in the United States, says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"><a name="08020422000458">&#147;This demonstrates that IPS cells have the same potential for therapy as embryonic stem cells, without the ethical and practical issues raised in creating embryonic stem cells&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020422000399">Sir Martin Evans says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"><a name="08020422000459">&#147;This will be the long-term solution&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80204-0006.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_96"><a name="08020422000241">We have to ask why it is important that wherever possible adult stem cells should be chosen instead of embryonic stem cells. I underline the phrase &#147;wherever possible&#148; and will come back to it in a moment. One reason, mentioned in our debates by the noble Lord, Lord Winston, is the shortage of human eggs, which is now serious. Professor Wilmut says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"><a name="08020422000460">&#147;Cloning is still too wasteful of precious human eggs, which are in great demand for fertility treatments, to consider for creating embryonic stem cells&#148;.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"><a name="08020422000461">In short, embryonic stem cells, as far as possible, should not be used because they are much more important for other purposes. One significant thing about this that I mentioned at Report stage last week concerns the market. No market is permitted in the United Kingdom, but there is a clear market in the United States, and the price of human eggs for fertilisation  


<notus-date day="4" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_871"><b>4 Feb 2008 : Column 871</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>purposes has gone up very sharply. There is a real danger in introducing the market into a field where people are ready to pay for something that they desperately desire and need. Therefore, as far as possible, steps that one can take to reduce the market pressure should certainly be taken.</p>

<a name="80204-0006.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="08020422000242">Scientists increasingly argue that embryonic stem cell research may be needed as an assessment tool&#151;as a reference point, if you like. That has been argued by a number of people, including Professor Wilmut and Professor Thomson, who have said that they believe very strongly that the medium and long-term solution lies in adult and not embryonic stem cells. However, I recognise that that may not be the case yet and that there may be a demand for embryonic stem cells to be used as a reference point or test of the usefulness of adult stem cells.</p>

<a name="80204-0006.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="08020422000243">Members of the House may have read a very interesting article in our distinguished journal <I>Science </I>on  21 December 2007. It is becoming increasingly clear that there is a growing consensus among many scientists that we are now looking at a much more promising road along which to advance&#151;that of retro-programming adult stem cells to the point where they become plenipotentiary than pursuing what may well be an expensive and, indeed, ethically objectionable route of embryonic stem cells. In that context, I again quote the spiky words of Professor Thomson:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"><a name="08020422000462">&#147;A decade from now this&#148;&#151;</p>

<ul><a name="08020422000498">&#147;will be seen as a funny historical footnote&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80204-0006.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="08020422000244">I draw the House&#146;s attention to a very significant fact. Today, controls over the use of animal testing are much stricter in this country than controls over the use of embryonic stem cells, as distinct from adult stem cells, as a tool for research. The animal research, which has been largely relied on by the scientific establishment over recent years, is governed by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Under that Act, the Home Office determines whether research on animals is allowed and the test is very straightforward: it is whether any alternative procedure would be equally or more successful than the use of animals. Over the years under this Act, the Home Office has rejected a number of, although not many, research proposals. Last year, about 3.5 per cent of research proposals involving animal testing were rejected by the Home Office on the grounds that there were alternatives which would be more than adequate for the purpose. In the case of embryonic stem cells, only on one occasion has the HFEA rejected a proposal for research, and subsequently that proposal was slightly amended and then accepted. That is the record of the HFEA: it does not appear to be too ready to reject proposals for research on the grounds that there are alternatives to embryonic stem cell research.</p>

<a name="80204-0006.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="08020422000245">I made it clear that in my view the likelihood is that adult stem cell research will increasingly overtake embryonic stem cell research, partly because it is not as expensive and partly because the genetically similar cells created by the use of stem cells from the same adult who is being treated completely removes the danger of an immune reaction. Invariably, that is not true of embryonic stem cell research. I outline once again that far more therapies have been created as a result of the burgeoning field of adult stem cell  


<notus-date day="4" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_872"><b>4 Feb 2008 : Column 872</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>research than have been created from the not very burgeoning field of embryonic stem cell research. With the latter, arguably there have been about two therapies where there truly has been hope for the future, whereas with adult stem cells there have been many such therapies, including a recent breakthrough in the use of neural cells to treat, among other things, Alzheimer&#146;s disease.</p>

<a name="80204-0006.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="08020422000246">I emphasise that much of the rest of the scientific world is now moving ahead clearly and strongly in the field of adult stem cell research. When it discussed this matter earlier, the House did not have before it the astonishing commitment now being made by the Government and research councils of Japan. Not only have they now decided to set up a major research centre at the University of Kyoto where Professor Yamanaka works but, more staggering still, the Government of Japan and their medical research establishments have committed themselves to spending $10 billion on the advance of adult stem cell research. In other words, they now believe that this is clearly the best way forward. I fear that our attitude of on the whole giving preference over the years to embryonic stem cell research as the way forward could mean that in the United Kingdom we are not sufficiently responsive to and aware of the huge potential of adult stem cell research. We consequently concentrate on a field that we are used to but a field that recent breakthroughs suggest will not move anything like as fast as will the use of adult stem cells.</p>

<a name="80204-0006.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="08020422000247">We are proposing in this amendment as close a match as one can get to the pledge made to the House in 2001 by one of the most respected Ministers in this House, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath. Let me remind the House of what he said in the debate on the HFEA:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"><a name="08020422000463">&#147;The 1990 Act already provides the answer to the question of what happens if and when research into adult cells overtakes research using embryos: embryonic research would have to stop because the use of embryos would no longer be necessary for that research&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 22/1/01; col. 120.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020422000401">He also said that the HFEA,</p>
<ul><a name="08020422000499">&#147;&#147;must satisfy itself that there is no other way of doing the research, avoiding embryo use&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 19/12/00; col. 214.]</ul>
<p><a name="08020422000402">The noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries of Pentregarth, said that in his view the HFEA already largely abides by that consideration and does not choose embryonic stem cell research if adult stem cell research would be at least as efficacious or more so. Putting this in the Bill would a be great reassurance to the many in our society who are concerned and troubled about the use of embryonic stem cell research and the many more who are waiting for fertility treatment because there are no human eggs available. If the United Kingdom wishes to be in the vanguard of this movement, making it clear that where it is feasible&#151;or better&#151;to use adult stem cells, the HFEA is committed to doing so, far from being a blockage to advanced research, would actually encourage it. That would do so because it would show that the United Kingdom was moving with the times, and the times are extremely exciting for adult stem cell research and should be built upon. Having this in the

The noble Baroness is reading into the amendment an extremely precise statement of it being related to a particular piece of research. It is not. When peer group and scientific studies show that a particular form of research is generally useful in the field in which it is being put forward, it would not fail on the basis of the proposed new subsection. It would simply require that more than assumptions are made about the prospects for adult stem cell research in that particular area. There is now such a rapid build-up of research material available that I do not believe that the objections of the noble Baroness stand.</p>

She made a comparison between the number of applications turned down by the Home Office from researchers wanting to do research on animals, abiding by the Animal (Scientific Procedures) Bill, with the small number of applications turned down by the HFEA. It is important to bear in mind the fact that hundreds if not thousands of applications are made to the Home Office for work using animals.

<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="08020422000260">There are two extra points going for us today. First, in an earlier amendment, the principle that some things are good to have in the Bill was recognised. The big argument underlying this amendment is to get it in the Bill to reassure the public how seriously we take the development of science and the care we in this House are giving to it.</p>

<a name="80204-0006.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="08020422000261">Secondly, the Minister referred to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, as being a benign influence on the Bill and a figure who has been watching its progress carefully. We now have an amendment that has been recommended by him. We have brought it back with the deletion of the animal bit, which I mentioned earlier. Many of the words in Amendment No. 21 come from previous legislation. Proposed new subsection (6) would go into the licensing provisions in Schedule 2. Paragraph (a) says,</p>
<ul><a name="08020422000500">&#147;any proposed use of embryos or human admixed embryos is necessary for the purposes of the research&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="08020422000405">As I said on a previous occasion, this will have echoes of the Patents Act about an employee making an invention. No answer was ever made to that. It seemed a good point&#151;one often thinks one&#146;s own points are good&#151;that you could recognise an invention made by an employee and award it to him rather than the employer if the circumstances were such that the invention might reasonably be expected to result in the carrying out of his&#151;the employee&#146;s&#151;duties. Finally, heading (ii) says,</p>
<ul><a name="08020422000502">&#147;it is not reasonably practicable to achieve the specified purposes of the research without using human embryos or human admixed embryos&#148;.</ul>

I have admired her speeches for many years, from when she was in the House of Commons. Yet I am little surprised at the speech she has just made on this issue because there are a number of areas which are frankly misleading. Scientists will read her speech in <I>Hansard</I> open-mouthed with surprise at what she has said.</p>

<a name="80204-0006.htm_para21">
<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="08020422000266">First, let me make it clear that it is far easier in the United Kingdom to do animal research rather than human embryo research. It is simply not true that it is more difficult. As has already been mentioned, a huge number of applications may be considered and go through local ethics committees in all sorts of embryo research, but they do not get to the HFEA first. With animal research, one applies directly to the Home Office for an animal licence to do the research, and it is quite a different kind of system. It takes much longer to get an application through, as I know to my own cost as somebody who has both a licence to do embryonic stem cell research and a licence to do animal research. They are both difficult to do, but the comparison she makes is unfair.</p>

<a name="80204-0006.htm_para22">
<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="08020422000267">Secondly, the noble Baroness mentioned cloning. Cloning has nothing to do with this issue. Human in vitro fertilisation produces a number of fertilised eggs which cannot be used for the treatment of patients. That means that these eggs will be discarded or thrown down the sink. To many of us on this side of the argument, the moral imperative is that such material could be used to protect, maintain and improve research into human health and human diseases. That is what it is really about. Of course there is a shortage of eggs, but eggs do not apply in this situation. Nobody is suggesting that we necessarily clone for embryonic stem cells; that is an entirely different and completely separate issue.</p>

<a name="80204-0006.htm_para23">
<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="08020422000268">As has already been said, original research in this situation would be impossible. One had to do original research based on the ideas that one has. We have

They have different properties. That is a major puzzle, and why we still need to look at embryonic stem cells. You cannot replicate with adult stem cells first what you might see in the embryonic stem cell because of that difference. For example, there is their potential to grow into other tissue types.</p>

<a name="80204-0006.htm_para24">
<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="08020422000269">I have to say that I think that the noble Baroness rather misquoted Professor Jaenisch and, to some extent, Martin Evans. I know that the quotation is of itself correct, but the wrong inferences are drawn. If we look at the letter from the scientists published last week in the <I>Times</I>, we can see that there is tremendous support for the research to continue. It is not fair to say that a wide body of scientific opinion believes that we should abandon embryonic stem cell research, or even downgrade it. That is simply not true. Most biologists believe that it is still a very important area of research.</p>

<a name="80204-0006.htm_para25">
<p><a name="stpa_112"><a name="08020422000270">I say that with utter truth. I have no wish to do something that people might find disreputable, but there is broad consensus among people with very strong ethics that this is the appropriate thing to be doing. It is nothing whatever to do with keeping the UK in the vanguard. If something is wrong, as a scientist, I would not want to keep the UK in the vanguard. This is a question of doing research that we fundamentally believe will open doors to important biological questions that we hope may ultimately help people. We must not confuse research on a cell to understand its properties with the issue of therapy, which is completely separate. Translational research is entirely different from basic research. We are here discussing not translational research but basic research.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"><a name="08020422000271">To my mind, it would be catastrophic if we abandoned those embryos, which would be lost after in vitro fertilisation. The only solution would be to destroy them against the wishes of the patients who, in my experience, give them extremely freely and with the great belief that we might find something to help other people in future.</p>

She cogently and persuasively argued its merits. They are merits that we have discussed at earlier stages and, mindful of the injunction placed on us earlier, I will not be repetitive, but one or two new points need to be addressed.</p>

<a name="80204-0007.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_114"><a name="08020422000273">The first is that the amendment clearly does not ban any of the things to which the noble Lord, Lord Winston, referred a moment ago. I think that he would accept that nothing in the amendment would prevent him or any other scientist laying an application before the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority to undertake research. It is simply that the noble Baroness has laid out the criteria that would be required before that research application is met.</p>

<a name="80204-0007.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_115"><a name="08020422000274">Indeed, that is precisely what happens under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. I have

The Home Office has turned down 3.5 per cent of all applications. When the Minister comes to reply, I would be grateful if she could confirm that the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has only ever once turned down an application. When that application came back before the HFEA, it was subsequently approved. Therefore, the argument that the noble Baroness placed before your Lordships' House absolutely stands.</p>

<a name="80204-0007.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_116"><a name="08020422000275">The fact is that 2.2 million human embryos have been destroyed&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Winston, said, mainly through IVF cycles&#151;or experimented on since 1990. It is not unreasonable to ask how many more will be needed before we see any therapies provided, even if one thought that it was licit to use them in the first place, which I do not. I accept that the amendment is an attempt to uphold the special respect and status adumbrated in the report of the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, back in 1986, and which was incorporated in the 1990 legislation.</p>

<a name="80204-0007.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="08020422000276">My other point is about public confidence&#151;an issue to which the noble Baroness referred. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority itself conducted a survey last summer run by ICM. It found that 48 per cent of UK residents disagreed with scientists creating an embryo that contains mostly human with a small amount of animal genetic material purely for research, compared with only  34 per cent who agreed. Many people, therefore, do not concur with some of the provision in this Bill. Overall, 47 per cent&#151;nearly half&#151;agreed that creating embryos for research with mostly human, and a small amount of animal genetic material, concerned them. They said that it was meddling with nature. Nearly half&#151;49 per cent&#151;agreed that creating embryos for research with mostly human and a small amount of animal genetic material, concerned them because of what scientists might want to do next in research. Just over two-fifths&#151;some 41 per cent&#151;agreed that creating embryos for research with mostly human and a small amount of animal genetic material concerned them because they thought that it might be put into a woman or an animal, even though that was against the law.</p>

My noble friend Lady Hollis has already mentioned the difficulty of requiring published, peer-reviewed scientific data when one starts research for the first time.

<a name="80204-0007.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="08020422000290">In 1990, Parliament introduced a control on human embryo research and the treatments that use human embryos. It made it absolutely clear that after the primitive streak develops at 14 days, the embryo should not be used for research at all. I should have thought that there is a good deal to be said for specifying that that is the point at which there is a potential for human life. Until that point the embryo has a potential, right enough, but not necessarily a potential to develop into a human being. In the period before the primitive streak develops, Parliament thought that it was important to recognise that the embryo has special qualities which require special treatment. One of those treatments, of course, is that research using embryos should, first, be licensed by the HFEA. Secondly, as has been pointed out, the research must necessarily involve the human embryo; and, thirdly, the whole procedure should be as laid down by Parliament.</p>

<a name="80204-0007.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="08020422000291">In looking at this matter again, it is perfectly reasonable that the same general framework should apply. I certainly do not take proposed new paragraph (b)(i) as meaning that you cannot do new research. That is not at all the meaning of the phrase. It means that the evidence accumulated so far suggests that it is likely to be useful research. It may not produce the answer the researcher wants, and indeed it may result in an answer the researcher does not want, but that is equally important in the development of the subject matter. So I support the amendment because it is useful from the point of view of recognising the public concern, which undoubtedly there is, surrounding embryonic research. It shows that Parliament regards that as a very important and special area of research which requires careful and thorough safeguards.</p>

However, were the amendment to be accepted, it may be necessary to look at the precise phraseology. I was a chemist in a previous incarnation and as I moved from being an undergraduate chemist to a research chemist, I can remember entering a completely different world where the experiments did not work out. As the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, has said, in research you often do not know what is going to happen because it is a very uncertain procedure. Given that, you cannot be certain that a particular piece of research is likely to achieve its specified purpose, so the phraseology may need to be honed. However, the broad principle of the amendment is to enshrine in the Bill a note of caution.</p>

That is the natural instinct of those engaged in the research, but against that has to be put the issues so clearly set out for us by the noble and learned Lord. It is right that there is a note of caution written into the Bill so that we do not get drawn into thinking that research on embryos is a normal, natural way of proceeding. It should be done by exception. If the amendment is accepted, it may need to be tidied up in another place, but fundamentally it seems to me to be morally right.</p>

He acknowledged that the amendment is infelicitously worded for the good reason explained by the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, which is that you cannot know in advance whether research is likely to achieve its specified purposes. Given that, surely the right approach is to say, &#147;We like the principle, but clearly the wording is wrong. The amendment needs to be taken back and looked at again&#148;. When you add to that the point made, but not wholly answered, by the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, that if it must include published, peer-reviewed scientific data that would make it almost impossible to have any new research, I find those arguments quite strong. It would be perverse to then pass the amendment into law at this stage and hope that someone else will amend it later in another place. That does not seem a sensible way to proceed. Nevertheless it is an important debate and it is right and to the advantage of the community as a whole that it is being held.</p>

<a name="80204-0007.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_131"><a name="08020422000295">I was struck by the leading article in the <I>Times</I> last Saturday on the use of tissue banks&#151;we have still to come to an amendment on this issue&#151;which stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"><a name="08020422000466">&#147;Stem cell researchers sit uncomfortably on the boundary between invaluable scientific endeavour and inviolable human ethics&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020422000407">That is exactly right. But when one comes to the end of the article it states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"><a name="08020422000467">&#147;Stem-cell researchers need to do little more than move a muscle to spark off a round of agonised soul-searching&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020422000408">That is a perfectly proper reaction, if I may say so. The article continues:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"><a name="08020422000505">&#147;Difficult questions will continue to arise and must be scrutinised case to case. With equal measures of determination and sensitivity, policymakers must balance pragmatism and ethics. In some parts of the world, misplaced didacticism would take over and elevate scientific endeavour above personal or religious ethics. Elsewhere, ethics may gain primacy over science&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020422000409">It concludes:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"><a name="08020422000506">&#147;It is to the credit of Britain&#146;s democratic process that scientists and ethicists compete to be heard&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80204-0007.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="08020422000296">Those are very wise words but the article implies somehow that scientists are not ethical. That is not my experience. There may be a few mad scientists somewhere in laboratories who simply dismiss the whole ethical argument, but the overwhelming majority of scientists who are engaged in these sensitive areas are acutely conscious of the ethical argument. Indeed, when the Bill first appeared as a draft, it was called the human tissues and embryos Bill and there was an immediate reaction to say that we were simply putting tissues and embryos together as though they were of the same equality. We were not; we have always recognised, from the report of the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, to which reference has been made, onwards that the embryo plays a very special part and that therefore any research involving embryos has to have regard to the ethical arguments as well. I believe that, overwhelmingly, scientists do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"><a name="08020422000297">I sympathise with and understand the purposes of the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, but it would not be sensible to put it into the Bill when even those who support it recognise that it carries some flaws. Perhaps the message to the Government should be, &#147;Is there not something we could write in here?&#148;. I say this because the Joint Select Committee was critical of the fact that this Bill did not include, as the 1990 Bill did, an underlying ethical argument and purpose. It is something that this Bill lacks and it is not to the credit of this House that we have not yet found a way of rectifying that.</p>

<a name="80204-0007.htm_para21">
<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="08020422000298">I do not think that this is the way for the reasons explained by the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, and others. However, there is a purpose here which somehow needs to be reflected in the Bill. I hope that the House will not pass the amendment. Perhaps the noble Baroness may be prepared to withdraw it on an undertaking from the Government&#151;I do not know whether they are prepared to do this&#151;that they will continue to look at this argument and see whether it is not possible to write into the Bill an underpinning ethical argument. The Joint Committee felt that that was lacking and it is something we ought to put in.</p>

<a name="08020422000299"><b><a name="80204-0007.htm_spnew5"><a name="08020422000945">Lord Walton of Detchant:</b> My Lords, my comments will be extremely brief because I fully appreciate the intentions underlying the amendment and the ethical considerations that have led many noble Lords to support it. I am concerned about one matter only: the suggestion that cogent evidence must include published and peer-reviewed scientific data would effectively prevent researchers in the United Kingdom taking ahead cutting-edge research at the frontiers of science. It would mean that they could be engaged only in research on human embryos and human admixed embryos, following up work that had been done and published elsewhere. That alone makes the amendment quite unacceptable and, despite the excellent speeches we have heard, it is for that reason that I cannot support it.</p>

<p><a name="st_144">
<a name="08020422000300"><b><a name="80204-0007.htm_spnew6"><a name="08020422000946">Baroness Royall of Blaisdon:</b> My Lords, this has been an important debate and I am glad we have had it. Amendment No. 21 seeks to limit the HFEA&#146;s ability to license embryo research by extending the criteria the HFEA must consider before granting a licence. That would require published and peer-reviewed evidence demonstrating both that the research is likely to achieve its specified purpose and that it is not possible to achieve the same end result without the use of embryos.</p>

<a name="80204-0007.htm_para22">
<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="08020422000301">The Government have carefully considered this issue in the light of the safeguards that already exist in the legislation, and which have been applied in practice since 1990 by the HFEA. We believe strongly that the existing controls are clear and sufficient. The HFEA undertakes a peer review process for each research licence application. However, making it a requirement that published evidence is available could be said to go against the fundamental principles of research, which are designed to test theory and produce facts. Those cannot be known before the relevant research has been undertaken.</p>

<a name="80204-0007.htm_para23">
<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="08020422000302">Many noble Lords have referred to the statement from my noble friend Lord Darzi, who spoke of the importance of peer review, but he was referring to  


<notus-date day="4" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_883"><b>4 Feb 2008 : Column 883</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>peer review of the licence application. The amendment in question refers to peer review data that are published demonstrating that such a research project would succeed. As other noble Lords have said, those two things are very different.</p>

<a name="80204-0007.htm_para24">
<p><a name="stpa_137"><a name="08020422000303">Under the provisions of the 1990 Act, the HFEA may grant research licences only where it deems the research necessary or desirable for one of the statutory purposes set out in the Act. The embryo does indeed have special status and it will continue to do so. The HFEA must be satisfied that the creation of embryos specifically is necessary for that project of research to be undertaken. Again, that is already in the Act. Each project is scrutinised on its merits to ensure that those criteria are met.</p>

<a name="80204-0007.htm_para25">
<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="08020422000304">The noble Baroness, Lady Williams, and others have spoken of the number of applications rejected. It may be helpful if I clarify that a project for which a research licence is sought will have to have received approval from a research ethics committee before a licence can be granted. Where a project would in principle be suitable to be licensed but insufficient information has been submitted to the licence committee, or the committee is of the view that an aspect of the project needs to be reconsidered, it is usual practice for the committee not to reject the application but to ask the applicant to submit further information or undertake changes to the specifications of the project for reconsideration at a later date. Hence there are no, or very few, rejections.</p>

<a name="80204-0007.htm_para26">
<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="08020422000305">The noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain, asked what research this amendment would stop. It is difficult to say. The amendment would make it difficult for the HFEA to license research generally unless there was evidence in the first instance that the research was likely to work. As the noble Lord, Lord Walton, said, it would prevent novel and cutting-edge research.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"><a name="08020422000306">The Government believe that we should not proscribe or unnecessarily curtail any avenue of research, as we cannot know in advance where breakthroughs may occur. For nearly two decades the HFEA has licensed embryo research with the flexibility to form its own tests on whether the use of embryos is necessary for each project of research. That system has worked well and I do not believe there is any need for change. As such, I urge the noble Baroness not to press her amendment.</p>

I shall not keep the House long but I want quickly to make a couple of points about the conclusions we are approaching.</p>

<a name="80204-0008.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="08020422000308">First, the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, said&#151;and he is absolutely right&#151;that there is a distinction in people&#146;s minds between embryonic stem cell research and other kinds of research. In that context, I quote Professor Thomson, who was the first person to produce the human embryonic stem cell. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"><a name="08020422000468">&#147;If human embryonic stem cell research does not make you feel at least a little bit uncomfortable, you have not thought about it enough&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="08020422000410">Those are the words of one of the premier scientists in the field. Although the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, does not support my amendment, he indicated that there was a distinction that should be underlined about the nature of research into embryos and the fact that embryos are not the same as other kinds of genetic material. That is an important distinction to make and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, quite rightly indicated that there is considerable public concern about maintaining that distinction.</p>

<a name="80204-0008.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_142"><a name="08020422000309">The noble Lord, Lord Winston, for whom I too have the greatest respect, seemed to say that the amendment would make it very difficult to pursue embryonic stem cell research. That is not the case. In proposed heading (b)(ii) in Amendment No. 21, the requirement reads that,</p>
<ul><a name="08020422000507">&#147;it is not reasonably practicable to achieve the specified purposes of the research without using human embryos or human admixed embryos&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08020422000411">In other words, where it is clear that that is required, it is not forbidden by the amendment. It simply asks that there should be careful consideration of what alternatives exist.</p>

<a name="80204-0008.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="08020422000310">A number of noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, and in particular the noble Lord, Lord Walton, indicated that they have difficulties with,</p>
<ul><a name="08020422000508">&#147;published, peer-reviewed scientific data&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08020422000412">As the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, made clear, if the problem arises from &#147;published&#148;, those of us in favour of the amendment would be willing to reconsider that. The Bill has yet to go through another place so there is lots of time to reconsider &#147;published&#148;.</p>

<a name="80204-0008.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_144"><a name="08020422000413">&#147;Peer-reviewed scientific data&#148; fall into a different category. My knowledge and recollection are that when research councils consider proposals for research they ask for peer-reviewed scientific data in most cases to establish that the research has a real possibility of being, in effect, worth the money invested. I find it strange that people should object to those words. I repeat that I can see there is a problem with &#147;published&#148;. Indeed, the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, raised that point. I apologise that I was not able to reply to her. If it raises great difficulties, we can consider it again.</p>

<a name="80204-0008.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_145"><a name="08020422000311">I repeat that the amendment does not rule out embryonic stem cell research. It allows it in cases where it is clearly the one way forward. I think that meets the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Winston. Concerning his objection to my providing some indications that in some cases animal research had been ruled out by the Home Office, and that there did not appear to be a case of the HFEA having ruled out in the end any of the research put before it, I deliberately chose to give proportions and not numbers for the reasons that the noble Lord, Lord Winston, gave. I recognise that there are thousands of applications for animal research and very few for embryonic stem cell research. That is why I gave proportions and never mentioned numbers, which I thought would be misleading. The proportions stand whatever the actual numbers may be.</p>

<a name="80204-0008.htm_para6">

I wish she had felt able to do that because I believe that there is sufficient support in the House for the amendment for it to be taken seriously. Some noble Lords who have spoken to it are people whose views, not least on the real state of public opinion, should be taken seriously. So far, the Government have rejected virtually every amendment on these lines. Therefore, I must ask to test the opinion of the House.</p>

Its purpose is to allow existing holdings of anonymised cells and cell lines to be used in embryo research in circumstances where it is not possible to obtain specific consent. The principle of consent underpins this Bill. Consent must be obtained wherever it is reasonably possible to obtain it. The Bill, as drafted, rightly introduces a new legal requirement that consent must be obtained from donors of tissues and cells before such material is used in research involving somatic cell nuclear transfer, in which embryos, or human admixed embryos, are created to generate embryonic stem cells.</p>

Many of these collections are very scientifically valuable and cannot be reproduced readily, either in a reasonable timescale, or at a reasonable cost. Indeed, they may not be reproducible at all, particularly where they relate to very rare diseases or are accompanied by a wealth of historic associated data, collected over long periods.</p>

In the future, of course, researchers will have to take into account the requirement to obtain specific consent in designing and building tissue collections that may be used in embryo research but, retrospectively, this is impossible. This amendment therefore provides a limited, but very important, transitional exception to the requirement for specific consent introduced by Schedule 3. The exception applies only in relation to existing holdings where it is not reasonably possible to go back to donors to obtain specific consent, where the cells or cell lines have been anonymised, and where it is not possible to use other materials for which specific consent has been obtained. The amendment also provides that the material must have been lawfully obtained in the first place and that there must be no indication of any objection from the donor.</p>

But of course they could be used for research, they would be created and they would exist for 14 days before we destroyed them.

Almost certainly I am the only Member of your Lordships&#146; House who has regularly approached patients, asking for consent to use their embryos for the purposes of generating stem cells. The consent procedure is different from that in any other form of medical research with which I have been involved for many years. I hope that noble Lords will understand that I am speaking with complete probity. When we deal with any embryo research, we make sure that we give not just the routine information you might give somebody about other forms of research&#151;patients attend seminars and talks about the value of stem cell biology and there is a great deal of information given to them that is well beyond what you might give about other tissues that might be taken, for example, during an operation.</p>

In practice, we make absolutely clear to patients that we hope to generate embryonic stem cells in order to produce stem cell lines for whatever purpose may be appropriate. It is very open-ended. In effect, the consent covers pretty well every procedure. It is true that some of our patients will not have heard of admixed embryos but that is perhaps the one exception. That apart, the patients to whom I have spoken and those to whom my colleagues have spoken give their embryos entirely freely for whatever stem cell research might be appropriate.

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="08020422000346">I do not think it is quite fair to say that it is like the post in Arundel, as the noble Baroness suggested. It is a little different because the one concern that these patients have is that some of their genetic material might become public. That has always been a slight problem. In practice, all these research projects are anonymised for that very reason. Therefore, if a stem cell line is produced, there will be no way of knowing later whether it relates to a specific patient. When the stem cell line goes to the Stem Cell Bank, which is run by the Medical Research Council and my colleagues, it is not known which patient has given those cells. The anonymity is maintained to ensure that there is no risk of the genetic material becoming public, and that is why the patient cannot be traced&#151;not for any other reason in the process.</p>

We all admire the noble Lord, Lord Winston, for the work that he has done in this area but I wonder whether the patients with whom he deals in his clinic are not a self-selecting group who will naturally be open to this sort of research in the first place. I would at least want to question whether it is fair to extrapolate that.</p>

In any democracy you have to balance the rights of the majority with those of the minority. Clearly, in our society the majority favour the continuation of embryo research. I should think that that was almost certainly the case, although earlier today we heard of significant minorities&#151;perhaps they are majorities but I tend to think that they are minorities&#151;who have varying degrees of resistance to this concept. They include some who think that it is a barrier that must not be crossed under any circumstances&#151;particularly, but not only, in relation to human admixed embryos. We recently enshrined in law provisions for significant minorities in our society.</p>

I think that we owe a duty to that minority who have gone before us because in our democracy not only do we have to deal with living minorities but we have to have a sense of the democracy of the dead as well. I take particular account of the rights and views that we can reasonably presume would have been held by previous generations. Therefore, I think that, as the noble Lord, Lord Walton, said, the principle of consent is at the heart of the Bill.</p>

I wholeheartedly wish for a cure, but I also understand the views of the minority of people, living and dead, for whom this type of research is a bridge too far&#151;something to which they fundamentally object. I understand those views, despite the pressure that we naturally feel to allow the sort of research that would be permitted here. I have more sympathy for Amendment No. 26 but I am talking specifically about Amendment  No. 25. To advert to what the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, said, we cannot be too thoughtful about this; we have to think about the rights of minorities and the rights of those who gave their tissue.</p>

However, I think that we owe it to the minorities&#151;who, if they were able to make their voices heard, would be adamantly opposed to what we are describing&#151;not to make a general consent for the use of tissue gained 20 or 30 years ago or whatever.</p>

I appreciated the seven-page letter which the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, wrote to most people who spoke on this subject on Report and which outlined the pros and cons of this type of amendment&#151;in particular, the balance that has to be struck between, on the one hand, the rights of an individual who may be long dead and who gave cells for research and, on the other, the future generations that may benefit from the use of those cells. The letter carefully outlines the thorough safeguards that would have to be introduced before that could occur.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="08020422000353">I want to point to one particular element in the letter and to probe a little further. In paragraph 23, the noble Lord talks about the need for external scrutiny in the process by which permission is granted for the use of stem cells. That might well provide this whole issue with an important area of safety. I mentioned this briefly on Report, suggesting the use of the Patient Information Advisory Group&#151;PIAG&#151;which is used in the Human Tissue Act. That body seems to have worked reasonably well in allowing for research purposes the use of tissue from patients who are no longer available and in seeking further consent. Perhaps that sort of model would be applicable here.</p>

I listened with great interest to the noble Baroness, Lady Knight of Collingtree, as I always do. We very rarely agree on these matters but I always like to listen to the points that she makes because they are important. In her analysis of the amendment, she did not reach proposed new sub-paragraph (6), which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58"><a name="08020422000489">&#147;Condition E is that there are reasonable grounds for believing that research of comparable effectiveness cannot be carried out if the project of research for which the human cells, embryos or human admixed embryos are stored or used has to be confined to, or relate only to, persons who have capacity to consent to it&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="08020422000428">This is principally about research into childhood diseases which are so severe that the children never make it to adulthood. That is why this is such an important amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Walton, has spoken to us on previous occasions, giving examples. I want to make that point because I think that this afternoon we are in danger of giving the impression that only those on one side of the argument are approaching this matter with a concern for children in particular. That is not so; this is a set of circumstances where one would wish to take what I believe are now the main tenets of the Mental Capacity Act and apply them to this form of research.</p>

Some consent is implied. There is no question of this happening completely without the consent of the donor. I said before and I remain of the view that the term &#147;research&#148; includes research as it may develop. As we heard in connection with the previous amendment, you cannot tell when you start research where it may lead, although if you wish to get money for it you had better be able produce some good reason why you want to do it. New sub-paragraph (7) is intended to deal with that situation. At the moment it is restricted to the researcher. As my noble friend has said, the researcher is keen to get on with the research so he will not be looking very hard for reasons why he should not be able to get on with it. It may be that new sub-paragraph (7) needs to be opened out a bit to say that there does not appear to be any reason to suppose that the donor would object to the use or storage of the material for this particular purpose. What the right reverend Prelate referred to might well come under that. If you were to find out a little bit about the donor&#146;s background, you might conclude that they are in the minority that he speaks of who would not wish this research to be carried out. It may require some more elaborate provision than is here at the moment but I think that is the purpose of new sub-paragraph (7).</p>

This amendment relates to consent by parents and guardians on behalf of children lacking capacity and seeks to ensure that research involving the tissue and cells of such children to create embryos and human admixed embryos can be undertaken in important but limited circumstances, subject to strict safeguards. The Bill does not currently make any provision for parents or guardians to consent on behalf of their children. This has the regrettable side effect that it will in future be impossible to carry out embryo research using cells from sufferers of serious or life-threatening diseases that exclusively affect and usually kill children, such as muscular dystrophy, Batten disease and many more. This removes a vital route to increasing our understanding of the development and causes of these terrible diseases. This amendment makes provision for those with parental responsibility to give consent for their children where they lack capacity to consent, provided each of the conditions set out in the amendment are met. The conditions include that it is not possible to undertake the research using tissue or cells from donors with capacity and that the tissue or cells were lawfully collected, deriving, for example, from blood, muscle or tumour tissue removed with parental consent for treatment or diagnostic purposes. There must also be no knowledge that the donor indicated any objection. This research would, of course, be subject to the scrutiny of the HFEA and an NHS research ethics committee to the requirements of the common law concerning the removal of the tissue and to the regulatory requirements of the Human Tissue Act.</p>

<a name="80204-0009.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="08020422000357">This is a vital amendment. I gave an example in Committee. Much of my earlier research involved muscular dystrophy. The most severe form of muscular dystrophy is called the Duchenne type and occurs in young boys. It begins to cause difficulty in walking early in life. By the age of nine or 10 those boys are confined to a wheelchair and many do not survive beyond the age of 20 or thereabouts. It is now known that it is possible to diagnose that condition in the newborn infant by taking a blood sample and a small sample of muscle by needle biopsy. If a therapeutic opportunity arises, if a new treatment becomes available, it is clearly important that the treatment should begin immediately after birth in order to prevent the breakdown of the muscle which is so significant a feature of that disease. There are now five trials of treatment continuing in the UK and in other parts of the world using various forms of treatment for muscular dystrophy.</p>

<a name="80204-0009.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="08020422000358">On Report the Minister suggested that, because an infant or child below the age of consent was incapable of giving valid consent, this would not be a possible form of research. If that argument were pursued to its logical conclusion, it would make the practice of paediatric medicine virtually impossible because, for diagnostic procedures and treatment to be given to young infants and children, parental approval is necessary. The General Medical Council and the BMA in its handbook, <I>Medical Ethics Today, </I>have made clear the carefully defined circumstances in which research involving children with explicit parental consent is feasible. For that reason it is crucial that this amendment or something very like it should go in the Bill to enable such diagnostic work on infants to be carried out. In the case of the muscular dystrophy patient, if you can diagnose the condition at birth, it would not be impossible to take a tiny sample of skin to create an admixed embryo and a stem cell development of muscle cells to treat the condition. This kind of research is at the cutting edge and must be pursued.</p>

Consent, as noble Lords have said, is one of the cornerstones of the 1990 Act and only with the strongest of justifications would we be able to consider exceptions to this important rule. This is particularly true because of the human rights considerations. It is important to have regard to someone&#146;s personal autonomy when their cells would be unknowingly used for embryo and human admixed embryo research. It has been made very clear that there is concern that without any exceptions there could be a serious adverse impact on scientific research. The research affected could be important research aiming to better understand and treat serious medical conditions. On Report we gave a clear commitment to take away this issue for further consideration. We are grateful for the very helpful discussions on this issue that we have had with noble Lords. My noble friend Lord Darzi wrote a lengthy letter to set out the legal issues and to reiterate our intention to consider this issue further with a view to resolving it in another place.

We have outlined in writing to noble Lords that the Government take the view that it will be possible to make an exception to the requirement for express consent, provided that sufficiently stringent safeguards are in place. The details of those safeguards will require significant further consideration and discussion to ensure that research takes place only where to require consent would impose a substantial burden on scientific research, with such research being in the public interest. We will also need to develop a framework through which the safeguards will be introduced. My noble friend Lord Turnberg mentioned the importance of external scrutiny and I am sure that we will be looking at examples such as the patient advisory group that he mentioned.</p>

We are currently examining this issue carefully and we have agreed to take it away for further consideration in the other place. There are good reasons for further consideration of this issue. In particular more detailed consideration is needed to address children who are not competent to consent, on grounds of both age and mental capacity. Further concerns are then raised about all persons, including adults incapacitated throughout their entire life. The changes to the consent system regarding these concerns will require considerable thought to ensure that not only children but all those who require exemption are provided for. Consideration will also need to be given to other pieces of legislation, such as the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and the common law governing children and consent.</p>

It is interesting that the science may have been debated on the Floor of this House, about which there have been some marginal differences, but the social science has been disagreed with seriously. All I ask is that it should be understood from the start that the review should be looked at in a social science framework, so that at the end some objective assessment can be made, rather than a whole load of opinion about what children and families require to develop appropriately, and what adults need in terms of understanding their genetic inheritance to ensure their health.</p>

Sitting on the pre-scrutiny committee, I found this one of the hardest issues. There were conflicting pulls and it was hard to know where the balance should lie. This was not about faith, beliefs or scientific background. It was a set of clashing considerations over, for example, whether the birth certificate should reflect the biological&#151;that is, genetic&#151;parentage or, as many same-sex couples might wish, the social parentage of a child.</p>

<a name="80204-0010.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="08020422000379">Secondly, where do the child&#146;s wishes come into play as against, possibly, the social parents&#146; wishes? That child may wish the certificate to reflect his or her social parents. That child may prefer, for whatever reason, the birth certificate to reflect his or her genetic parents. In some societies, where you need a full birth certificate for entry, there could be possible areas of discrimination or stigma that the child might find difficult to handle.</p>

<a name="80204-0010.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="08020422000380">Thirdly, there is the issue of privacy. We all hope that parents will follow best practice and ensure that their children are aware of their origins, how much they have been wanted and so on. Yet some parents will not. I registered my own child at 10 days or whatever, but there was no subsequent evidence to back that up. The registrar took my word for it that I was the mother and that the person I said was the father was the father. That went on the birth certificate. How are you going to police it if a person should, wrongfully, seek to conceal the genetic origins? There is, effectively, a compulsory reporting system but, as far as I am aware, no way of monitoring the information put on that birth certificate&#151;nor perhaps should there be.</p>

<a name="80204-0010.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="08020422000381">Given all of these problems&#151;I do not know what I think about most of them&#151;I would welcome some sense that we can revisit this issue. Where the consensus lies on any of these issues may change over the next few years, as greater openness, frankness, transparency, scientific information and understanding of the ethical issues come to the fore. As a result, we may find that we can come to a view collectively, as a society and as a Parliament, which reflects a consensus that does not currently exist. If for that reason alone, I hope that if my noble friend cannot accept this amendment today, something similar will be introduced in the other place.</p>

It is true that sometimes birth certificates do not tell the truth. As the noble Lord said earlier, the concern of the Joint Committee&#151;as I understand from reading its report&#151;was the difference between an individual concealing truth and the state &#147;colluding in a deception&#148;, to use the committee&#146;s phrase. The noble Baroness is right; there is a series of complex questions here, some of which we have been unable to resolve during our proceedings. They are questions we should return to.

We might also look at producing another document within whatever social arrangements obtain for bringing up a child. A social document can record other questions&#151;perhaps the parents or those bringing up that child want to appear on that document. A social document alongside the birth certificate might be one way forward. I believe that we should not tamper with birth certificates and that they should be a true record of genealogy and lineage. Everyone is entitled to the best possible proof of their origins.</p>

That is a biological thing. If a mother has a son who is not the son of the father, does that not cause a hitch? For the certificate to say that the son is the father&#146;s son because that is the social wish of the parents is wrong. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Alton, that, if necessary, you would have to have two certificates, one creating and recording the biological facts and one creating and recording the social facts.

Yet we have moved no further forward than was the case in 1990, when the great brains of people like the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, tried to find an answer to this question. We simply have not done so. While many people will welcome the amendment as a force behind the department which will make it consider the issue, it is important to remember that for some others it is something to fear, something they will not want to see.</p>

We are funding the &#147;Telling and Talking&#148; project, which supports parents who have donor-conceived children to tell them about their conception. We are also funding a second project, which will be working with prospective parents hoping to conceive using donor gametes. The House earlier accepted an amendment that will require a licence condition to be placed on clinics to ensure that people being treated with donor gametes or embryos are provided with information about the importance of telling their child from an early age that they were donor conceived.</p>

It is clear that many noble Lords have given a lot of thought to the needs of donor-conceived people, the importance of knowledge about their genetic history, and the implications of annotating birth certificates in some way. We need to keep in mind the options and consider how people&#146;s views on those options may change. Assessing the impact of the Donor Conception Network&#146;s projects to educate patients and parents about the need to tell will play a part in that.</p>

For instance, as the Bill already has a 2050 target, any regulations amending it are not strictly necessary for the Bill&#146;s operation. This amendment would prevent the 2050 target being amended. For example, new trading schemes, as enabled by Part 3, are also not strictly necessary for its operation. Therefore, this amendment would also prevent the Government introducing any trading schemes to reduce UK emissions and help us meet our targets. I understand that the amendment is probing at a wider concern, so I will not labour that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="08020432000040">Amendment No. 188 would commence Part 2 on the day that the Act is passed. It would mean that the Committee on Climate Change becomes a statutory body on that date. I understand that noble Lords want to see the committee operational as soon as possible. However, there are practical reasons why the Government have included the provision to set the date in the Bill. As your Lordships will be aware, we do not often know in advance the exact date on which a Bill will be granted Royal Assent. That means that the establishment of such an important body could come, relatively speaking, as a surprise. We would not want that to happen.</p>

<a name="80204-0011.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="08020432000041">There are very real considerations which require us to be able to plan this, so that it happens not only quickly but in an orderly and well managed way. For example, the committee&#146;s staff will be its backbone and it is important that we make it convenient for both staff and the body alike to have advance notice of when the body will be legally established. That will help provide greater certainty as to, for example, the terms of their employment. As noble Lords will also understand, it is more administratively convenient if a body comes into existence on a known date&#151;ideally, at the start of a new quarter, but, at the very least, the first of the month.</p>

The date will be decided following consultation with the committee&#146;s chair-designate.</p>

I was terribly impressed by all that until the Minister said three months. I accept entirely the shortcomings of my own amendments in terms of the day of Royal Assent, which we may not be able to tie up exactly. However, I would have thought that the first day of the month, or within the month, was what we should expect at the very least. The reassurance is excellent, but I find three months excessive.</p>

I hope that the Minister will listen carefully to what the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, has said. It seems remarkable. We know that so much has got to be done by the climate change committee so early, because we are vesting all sorts of responsibilities in it. The debates in Committee have given a strong argument for it being empowered to advise on setting targets and even, as we have proposed, setting targets itself. It is a mistake to have a delay before its authority is fully vested, and I hope that the contributions made in this short debate will be taken into account when the letter is penned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"><a name="08020432000046">I do not wholly take the Minister&#146;s argument that accepting our amendments would mean that the orders changing the 2050 target could not be implemented. After all, the purpose of the Bill is to reduce climate change. Setting targets is an instrument for achieving that objective, but the purpose of the Bill is made quite clear in Clause 1. There is therefore no contradiction. I have not examined this from a legal point of view, but my feeling is that there cannot be a contradiction. Having said all that, I was very reassured by what the Minister said about how our debates in Committee have impressed on her, on the Government and on the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, that it is necessary at least to try to reconcile the need to empower the Secretary of State to issue orders with the need to ensure that the powers and authority of Parliament are also recognised.

I was led to table it when I read Schedule 1, which of course I read before I got to the end of the Bill because it comes up much earlier and must be read in context.

<ul>

<a name="80204-0011.htm_para27">
<p><a name="stpa_235"><a name="08020432000052">Anyway, we need to discuss a little the meaning of the &#147;national authorities&#148;. This appears only in Schedule 1 and in Clause 67, which gives the meaning of &#147;national authority&#148; in definitions. Clause 67(1) states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68"><a name="08020432000246">&#147;In this Act &#145;national authority&#146; means&#148;&#151;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69"><a name="08020432000247">&#147;Functions conferred or imposed by this Act on &#145;the national authorities&#146; are to be exercised by all of them jointly&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020432000224">That, too, is simple enough, and I am glad that it works, except that the relationship is quite complicated. There is in this appointing body one Secretary of State but 12 Scottish Ministers and 11 Welsh Ministers. Indeed, I am not quite sure how many people there are if you include one &#147;relevant Northern Ireland department&#148;&#151;let us assume that it is one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"><a name="08020432000054">The real question is how this works. We know that it has worked for the chairman, but the subsection says that the functions will,</p>

<p><a name="08020432000225">I think that the people who wrote that into the Bill simply had not thought about the wording, because you will never get all those people together to work jointly.

<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="08020432000055">Finally, what happens if someone disagrees? Is there a mechanism for determining whether one Secretary of State in the United Kingdom Government equals 12 Scottish Ministers who might disagree with him?

The amendment that I moved at that point was criticised because it implied that Westminster was wielding a big stick against the devolved Administrations in a field where it no longer had any right to do so. I support the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith because it is a much milder take on the thing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="08020432000057">The co-ordination of the national authorities on all aspects of the Bill, which my noble friend described, will be difficult but essential to the Bill&#146;s success. The Minister has mentioned several times in Committee that devolved authorities have issued statements about their intent to comply with the Bill, but he himself flagged up very early on the fact that one of the dangers in considering the Bill at the moment is that there is currently huge general enthusiasm for the concept. So far as I remember, only once, in a major intervention in our discussions, was the point made about how people will view the measures when they are causing disadvantage or deprivation. Science may progress; the accepted wisdom may change; individuals, regions or national authorities may disagree.</p>

<a name="80204-0011.htm_para32">
<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="08020432000058">As the Bill is really only a skeleton, and as so much is left to secondary legislation that is yet to come, it is important that national authorities agree on the action that they will be involved in implementing. Having a provision that requires their agreement is the only way in which they can exercise their functions jointly, as it says in the Bill. Thus, in order to ensure that all national authorities will be able to implement the various complicated measures contained in the Bill, I strongly support the amendment of my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith.</p>

It will be important to ensure that its application to the devolved Administrations is set out very clearly and to ensure a joined-up approach between Administrations as far as possible, as the noble Duke and the noble Lord have already highlighted. We will be agreeing a concordat with the devolved Administrations about how we will work together on implementing the detailed elements of the Bill. The Bill describes the UK Government and the devolved Ministers together as &#147;national authorities&#148;, as the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, has already pointed out, for the purposes of some clauses.</p>

The agreement will be with the Administration concerned rather than with political parties. The important point to note is that the formal agreement of the Administrations will be sought, and equally it is important that the concordat is practical and realistic. We have said at earlier stages in Committee that we have experienced positive working relationships. I appreciate the concerns of the noble Duke about the future because this is a very long-term Bill, and I will come on to what might happen if there is a disagreement.</p>

<a name="80204-0011.htm_para33">
<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="08020432000062">The Bill describes the UK Government and the devolved Ministers together as the &#147;national authorities&#148; for the purposes of some clauses. Clause 67, as the noble Lord pointed out, defines the term &#147;national authority&#148; to mean the Secretary of State, the Scottish Ministers, the Welsh Ministers and the relevant Northern Irish Ministers. Further, to make it clear, we would expect the Scottish Ministers to decide among themselves who should be the relevant Minister. The clause provides that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70"><a name="08020432000248">&#147;Functions conferred ... on &#145;the national authorities&#146; are to be exercised by all of them jointly&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020432000227">This means that they must agree on the way the functions should be exercised and then act together. &#147;Acting jointly&#148; is a well used and well understood legal term which means bodies acting together to do the same thing. In order to act jointly, all must agree on what it is they are doing, so &#147;acting in agreement&#148;, as proposed in Amendment No. 187A, would not add any further safeguards to the clause because the devolved Administrations will need to be in agreement in order to act jointly.</p>

<a name="80204-0011.htm_para34">
<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="08020432000063">I want to stress what would happen if there were a disagreement between the different legislatures. As I have said, the concordat is being developed by the UK Government and the devolved Administrations. It will set out the procedure for resolving any differences. However, it is worth reiterating that UK government departments and officials already have a constructive relationship with their counterparts in each of the devolved Administrations in drawing up the Bill, which is truly UK-wide in scope. We expect this good working relationship to continue as proposals for trading schemes emerge and that this kind of disagreement is most unlikely. There are probably several options available to us if the situation did arise, but it would be wrong to speculate on the detail at this stage when there are no obvious risks of that happening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="08020432000064">However, I know that the noble Lord will push me further, so I shall make it clear. In the unlikely event that a procedure laid out in the concordat does not succeed in resolving an issue, a number of things could happen. First, the proposal would simply not

If we could not agree, we could not proceed with it. Secondly, if we could not agree on a proposal, its scope might be revised so that it could be introduced by one or more national authorities acting alone. This is provided for in Part 1 of Schedule 3. Finally, if the proposal was very important, as I am sure noble Lords can imagine something might be, it would be possible to consider bringing forward primary legislation to introduce whatever the scheme was. As my noble friend Lord Davies of Oldham stressed when we had a debate along similar lines, this is a UK Bill. With that further information on the record, I hope that the noble Lord will consider withdrawing his amendment.</p>

She then went on to say that she thought the Scottish Ministers might agree on an &#147;appropriate Minister&#148;. That would put the Scottish practice outwith the wording of the Bill as I read it. We need to think about this because I am concerned about the way the Bill has been drafted. I accept entirely that we can amend practice, and we can amend the Bill.

That agreement was good for Europe and good for Britain. The own resources decision contains the detail of the revenue element of that financial perspective agreement.

The current arrangements for VAT-based contributions will be amended by reducing the maximum call-up rate to 0.3 per cent, increasing member states&#146; residual contributions based on GNI. This is to be welcomed and further develops the trend towards fair and transparent contributions.</p>

However, after a phasing-in period between 2009 and 2011, the UK will participate fully in the financing of the costs of enlargement by disapplying all non-agricultural expenditure&#151;that is, money in support of economic development&#151;in  the new member states from the abatement.

So the rebate is preserved and will rise in value. Along with the fact that the ceilings on budget expenditure are retained and that budget expenditure will fall to less than 1 per cent of EU GNI during this budget period, that makes this a good deal for the taxpayer. At the same time, we will, along with the other net contributors to the EC budget, pay our fair share of the costs of enlargement. The UK supports enlargement, which we know will be good for Britain, creating new trading opportunities and new jobs. So the December 2005 agreement is right for the taxpayer and for Britain&#146;s economic interests. It is good for Britain and Europe. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

In plain language, the Bill puts the stamp of legality on a major betrayal of this country&#146;s interests. It seeks to legitimise the act of Tony Blair in surrendering a part of our rebate, which was protected by our veto and which no one could touch without our agreement, for precisely nothing. We have a duty to put on record what happened and to explain in simple terms what led up to Mr Blair&#146;s abject surrender before history is rewritten.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"><a name="08020432000087">It all started honourably enough with Mr Blair championing the expansion of the EU into eastern Europe and his acknowledging that the new members would need help as they shed socialism. The money could only come from the farm budget and that would lose the French money. But, thought Mr Blair, the French would be persuaded to agree to the reform of the common agricultural policy and to a drastic decline in farm payments if Britain sacrificed at least part of its rebate. It is not, as you will see, quite what Mr Blair told the British people, but it is clear when one pieces together his utterances that that is what he had in mind.</p>

That is what he did, and no amount of ministerial waffle can disguise that fact. What, of course, he should have done was to take the rebate off the table, pack his bags and return home. But he surrendered.</p>

<a name="80204-0012.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="08020432000090">The tale now is that all this was necessary to secure enlargement and we could not &#147;will&#148; enlargement without being prepared to pay for it, but that really is rewriting history. Mr Blair told the Commons:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71"><a name="08020432000249">&#147;The UK rebate will remain and we will not negotiate it away. Period&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 8/6/05; col. 1234.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020432000228">When the then Chancellor of the Exchequer was asked in an interview whether the rebate was non-negotiable, he answered in one word&#151;&#147;yes&#148;. Mark you, this was all said in 2005 when enlargement was already a fait accompli. With enlargement a done deal, Mr Blair was still saying the rebate is non-negotiable. He knew enlargement was going to cost money, but some of the money would have to come, he thought, from reform of the EU finances and reform of the CAP; as to the rest, everyone would have to chip in under the then existing system, which involved of course the continuance of Britain&#146;s rebate. That is what he was, in effect, telling the British people.</p>

<a name="80204-0012.htm_para20">
<p><a name="stpa_264"><a name="08020432000091">That was the plan, that was the promise, but it is certainly not what he finished up with. If the rebate had remained, Britain would have paid over the next seven years an extra &#163;12 billion. Because of Blair&#146;s surrender we stand to pay an extra &#163;19 billion over the period, with things set to get worse after 2013 because the limit on the cost to Britain of the reduction in the rebate ends in that year&#151;and, of course, there is no meaningful reform of the EU&#146;s finances, let alone any reform of the common agricultural policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"><a name="08020432000092">Now we come to perhaps the most dismal part of the story. Where has the extra money gone? Scandalously, it is not, in the main, going to the main entrants. Unbelievably, Ireland, whose per capita income is 30 per cent higher than the EU average, is to get more per head than Lithuania, Slovakia or Poland. Furthermore, France, while becoming a net contributor, will remain the EU&#146;s biggest recipient and the UK will remain the smallest.</p>

It is always said that we had to surrender; failure to do so would have precipitated a crisis and, even worse, shown our lack of commitment to the EU. We have heard that so many times. French critics of the French Government do not call it anti-EU when the French Government fight to protect the interests of their own taxpayers and citizens, and the British people are entitled to expect the British Government to fight for the interests of Britain in the same way as

One of the then Chancellor&#146;s aides went even further and said that the sell-out&#151;that was his word&#151;would inevitably lead to public spending cuts. The Prime Minister knows well enough what he could have done with the &#163;7 billion that Mr Blair threw away; he could have built 28 new general hospitals every year, employed an extra 220,000 nurses, cut the basic rate of income tax by 2p or cut council tax by nearly 35 per cent. He would not even have had to break faith with the police. But when he could, on first coming into office, have refused to accept the deal and demanded a renegotiation, instead he lamely accepted the deal. He has proved as supine and neglectful of the national interest as his predecessor and now must share with him the responsibility for a shameful as well as a costly business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="08020432000098">I wondered how I could find out what this is literally costing us as a net contribution to the European Community budget. It seemed a reasonable thing to ask. I got a copy of the April 1997 spending review. This should be simple, I thought; it will tell us immediately what the cost is. In table 6.2 on page 72 we are told that the net expenditure transfer to the EC in 2005-06 was &#163;4.435 billion&#151;the figures were not yet in trillions. Even that is not clear, because that is billions in accrued public spending. Then we are told that the estimated outturn for 2006-07 will be an accrued &#163;4.652 billion. The plans for the following year&#151;that is, the year we are now in&#151;were for &#163;5.01 billion. Now we know.</p>

<a name="80204-0012.htm_para27">
<p><a name="stpa_271"><a name="08020432000099">Actually, we do not know, because there is much more in the public expenditure review. In table C.1 on page 189, we are told that the gross GNI contribution&#151;everyone knows what GNI is, of course&#151;is &#163;8.685 billion, this time not in accrued money but still in billions. We are told that there is a UK abatement of &#163;3.675 billion, so we get to the same figure for 2007-08 of &#163;5.01 billion. That, then, is the net contribution. But is it? We are told in the notes on the same page that some of the money is in one particular kind of expenditure and some in another. I declare an interest: I have used all the terms in those notes in my time in preparing budgets, presumably even a European Union budget figure. We are told that there is even one possibility that some of the money is in real cash terms, but then we are told that the TME effect of EU membership is given by GNI-based contributions, less the UK&#146;s abatement&#151;less an amount in respect of the cost of collecting TORs. Of course, we all know what that is&#151;I see the noble Baroness does. It means total managed expenditure, and then by the traditional own resources.

Our politicians, bureaucrats and most of our political media seem to believe that our trade with the EU, and the three million or so jobs that depend on it, would be lost if we left the political construct of the Treaties of Rome and continued in free trade and friendly collaboration with our neighbours in Europe.

The first hard fact is that the EU&#146;s average external tariff, supported by the World Trade Organisation, has now fallen to below 1 per cent. That makes the single market somewhat redundant anyway. Then there is the fact that our EU partners sell us more than we sell them, so they need our trade more than we need theirs. We are in fact their largest customer, taking some 18 per cent of all EU exports. The United States of America comes second, with 16 per cent. Therefore, whatever happens politically, that trade would not be lost and nor would the jobs that depend on it. The jobs depend on the trade, not on our EU membership.</p>

That fact alone surely confirms that EU membership is irrelevant to a healthy trading relationship with the single market. It is no good the Minister and your Europhile Lordships replying that Switzerland is smaller than us and therefore what goes for Switzerland would not go for us. I am afraid that is nonsense and that the reverse is obviously true. The Swiss economy is similar to ours in many ways, but we are roughly 10 times its size and, as I have said, we are the EU&#146;s largest client, so we could easily agree at least as good a free trade deal as that enjoyed by Switzerland.</p>

A similar study here would no doubt come up with the same sort of picture and reveal the many billions that our EU membership costs us more than a simple free trade agreement with the single market.</p>

It is negotiating free trade agreements with a further 42 countries. Why not us? Why is it that none of these countries, nor most of the other countries in the world, feels the need to join the EU? The answer is that membership is cripplingly expensive and wasteful and removes the right of  its members to govern themselves.

If the Minister is going to produce those figures again this evening, will he pause and consider the &#8364;660 billion which the EU competition commissioner, Verheugen, estimates is wasted on EU overregulation and red tape? Does that not make the EU economies some &#8364;435 billion worse off, even on the Eurocrats&#146; own figures, or around 4 per cent of GDP? I look forward to the Minister&#146;s comments.</p>

In the absence of such an exercise, the several private academic studies which have been carried out put the cost of our membership, including our cash contributions, at anything between 4 and 10 per cent of GDP. The reason for the Government&#146;s refusal to commission an analysis can be only that they know that the result would make the British people very angry indeed. Our membership of the European Union costs millions of jobs.</p>

They say that we can deal with international drug-trafficking and terrorism, and generally promote peace and goodwill in our time.

So we lowered the rebate, and the French have refused any reform of the CAP, which is one of the most destructive policies on the planet, until 2013 and probably until 2020. That is EU negotiation for you: honourable, great fun, and well worth it.

The figure cited by my noble friend Lord Waddington only built the hospital; my figure builds it, equips it and staffs it indefinitely. We should look at the gross, not the net, figures, after Brussels has been graciously pleased to give back some of our money to spend on projects designed to improve its own wretched image.</p>

It employed its first qualified chief accountant in 2002, in the shape of Mrs Marta Andreasen, after the scandal-ridden Commission had been forced to resign. It then sacked her when she refused to sign the first set of unaccountable accounts which were put in front of her. The EU&#146;s Civil Service tribunal naturally found against her in November, parroting the Commission&#146;s case. She is a brave and thoroughly decent woman, and she will now appeal to the EU&#146;s Court of First Instance. I trust that we all wish her luck and justice. For years, nobody would employ her because they did not want to offend the beast in Brussels, but I am proud to say that she has recently agreed to become the UK Independence Party&#146;s treasurer.

It is an interesting settlement, but worse than the one that we could have achieved if the then Prime Minister had held to his beliefs. Unfortunately, he did not, so we are paying more than we otherwise would have done. We should also be grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, who has obviously done a great deal of work on this and has shown how difficult it is to arrive at a correct figure. A bewildering array of statistics has to be gone into. One wonders whether there is a deliberate plan to obscure exactly what the British taxpayers are paying.</p>

<a name="80204-0013.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_290"><a name="08020432000122">As far as I can see, the gross contribution per annum is some &#163;14 billion. After the rebate, that comes down to, at present, &#163;5.5 billion per annum. That sum will rise, by 2011, to &#163;6.5 billion net per annum. As the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, pointed out, it is the &#163;14 billion figure that is important, because that is what taxpayers pay. The money coming back does not come back to the taxpayer. It comes back to individuals, such as individual farmers&#151;people like the Duke of Westminster&#151;to agricultural businesses, and so on. Make no mistake: the taxpayer is in for a big sum, which is much larger than the net figure so often quoted. Money goes to local authorities but again, as has been pointed out, not to projects that would get first priority from local government itself; it goes to projects that are forced on them, in many cases by the European Commission.</p>

<a name="80204-0013.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="08020432000123">It goes even further. There are other projects that are not included&#151;at least, as I understand it&#151;in these figures but that place an extra burden on taxpayers. I do not think that the Galileo programme, for example, is included in this gross figure; it is additional. We also pay one-third of our aid budget to the EU, which then inefficiently administers it and sends it to irrelevant places. It does not go where the British people would like it to go&#151;to Africa, in particular. We are paying out a lot of money as taxpayers.</p>

The Ministers there kept saying that this annual tribute is worth while because 57 per cent of our trade is with Europe. At least, the Minister opening the debate said 57 per cent, but by the time the Minister closing the debate spoke the figure had been reduced to 55 per cent. In either event, whether 55 or 57 per cent of our trade is with Europe, we trade with Europe in permanent deficit. Indeed, the latest annual figure is a deficit of &#163;38 billion, which is the great majority of our total overseas deficit with the countries of the world. Since 1973, the accumulated deficit on trade amounts to some &#163;350 billion. Incidentally, our gross contribution since joining is &#163;213,000 billion.

We do not have to pay a tribute to India, so why must we do so in order to trade with the European Union? Our Prime Minister, Mr Brown, has just visited China to promote trade. When he came back, he claimed that his visit heralded a new &#147;strategic partnership&#148; with China. We did not have to pay any tribute to China to get additional trade with that country, so why on earth do we have to shovel billions of pounds into EU coffers every year?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="08020432000126">The future lies with countries such as China and India, not with the EU. Indeed, restrictive practices and overregulation by the EU make it more difficult to trade with third countries than it needs to be. The European Union is increasingly interested in the nooks and crannies of British life. For example, the European Parliament now wants to ban patio heaters, as if that is anything to do with this great European Union. I point out that it has been said that these patio heaters contribute less to global warming than the European Parliament does in moving backwards and forwards from Brussels to Strasbourg every so often. Why do we have to have this interference from the institutions of the European Union?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="08020432000127">I also noticed in the Commons debate that some MPs seem happy for British taxpayers&#146; billions to be used to subsidise other countries. However, I guess that the majority of British people believe that charity begins at home and that the annual tribute paid to the European Union, much of which is badly directed or fraudulently converted, would be better spent in the United Kingdom on things such as those referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Waddington. I could add to that list reducing child poverty, increasing the state pension, putting more police on the streets and carrying out many other projects to improve social well-being and the decrepit infrastructure that we now enjoy&#151;or, rather, suffer from&#151;in this country.</p>

However, that is a matter for big debate later, when this House comes to scrutinise the Lisbon treaty. In the mean time, unfortunately, we have to pass this awful Bill.</p>

Perhaps he will agree with me that it also shows that all budget calculations and examinations have their complexities, disutilities and complications&#151;not just the European Union. There is a special additional element in the blending of the national cultures of each member state.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="08020432000131">Although the debates in the other place gave rise to the usual semi-hysteria from certain Members&#151;only a small number&#151;about these wicked EU treaties constantly sapping the very life-blood from the heroic but embattled Britannia, they also brought out the need to exercise proper scrutiny of complicated new measures, which by their very nature are hard to follow even for the cognoscenti. This Parliament rightly prides itself on a robust and proper system of scrutiny of all EU legislative instruments. We sometimes in this House make a little too much fuss regarding communications which are, after all, not legislation, but policy assertions. In this case there was an understandable anxiety in the Commons that there was not enough time for a review of these new spending modalities and the budget implications for the UK of the new treaty arrangements and the EU budget, as it would be.</p>

<a name="80204-0013.htm_para24">
<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="08020432000132">However, broadly the Government were right to remind the other place that the consequences of not agreeing to ratify this legislation would be to throw open the whole system and go back to the previous formula. Furthermore, scrutiny does not and should never mean scrutiny to oppose a measure. It is also vital to inform and explain to Members of Parliament in both Houses and the public and sometimes to improve legislation as it goes through each member state. I always contrast in both Houses the extreme speed with which most other major treaties on our membership of other international organisations are understandably passed on the nod in this Parliament, basically because everyone automatically agrees that they are a good thing. People feel that there is no need for a lengthy debate.</p>

I agreed with much of what the noble Lords, Lord Stoddart and Lord Pearson, said about some of the budget and trade figures, but the noble Lords confirmed yet again their wish for us to leave the Union. But there are probably 50 to 100 good reasons for our membership, and the budget calculation is only one aspect. That is the reality that the British public, in so far as they follow this complicated matter, would probably agree with. Only Europe gets the fierce and unusual scrutiny that we see every day, especially&#151;and again, quite rightly&#151;with our vividly accurate reports from the EU Select Committee and various sub-committees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"><a name="08020432000134">Secondly, these treaty Bills are often the result of extended and painful negotiations by our sovereign Government with all the other sovereign Governments&#151;sovereignty writ large in the European Union&#151;to reach a sometimes complicated compromise.

However, reaching a decision on behalf of the British people is precisely what our elected Government are there for&#151;the exercise of governmental sovereignty on behalf of the electors of this country. That is the essence of parliamentary democracy. The anti-Europeans cannot have it both ways, moaning about a so-called loss of sovereignty which applies as much to our elected Government as to the Parliament where they secure their regular majority. For all its faults, warts and blemishes, that is the system.</p>

<a name="80204-0013.htm_para27">
<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="08020432000135">It is also worth remembering that the EU budget system, unlike that of many sovereign member states, apparently now including Britain, is constantly virtuous, since the mechanism ensures that, broadly speaking, the outgoings always equal the receipts, at least over a significant period of time. This is naturally so as it is an allocation system, like the money allocated to local authorities. On the subject of local authorities in Britain, the number of staff directly employed by the Commission in Brussels&#151;even allowing for enlargement to a much greater union, and including overseas missions&#151;is still smaller than that of an average county council in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="08020432000136">We all know the four sources of the resources in this mechanism. I will not go into detail, save to refer, as the Minister did, to the reduction in the VAT call-up rate&#151;compensated for by increasing the GNI-based contributions of all but two member states. This has produced a much better adjusted system that allows for the latest economic differences between member states. Paragraph 9 of the Explanatory Notes explains the complicated adjustment arising from the UK surrendering a small part of its rebate. I would not read it out even if I had time, but it is a very telling paragraph. When this unique concession was secured by the Tory Government in the mid-1980s, I do not recall that it was intended to last for ever. Perhaps British Governments hoped that it would, but that was not the agreement in the European Union. It has already lasted 20 years, with the latest, very modest adjustment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="08020432000137">The principle of gross contributions by member states was always that of an automatic formula mechanism, not the strident <I>Sun</I> newspaper concept of &#147;Give us back our money&#148;. As far as the net contributions applied, ours quickly got out of line in relation to our GDP and output measurements. However, this was not the fault of the other member states&#151;it was because our total farm output was less, pro rata, than that of others, and because we imported far more from third countries, particularly from the old Commonwealth countries. The situation was relatively difficult.</p>

Was it not the case that Mrs. Thatcher was able to negotiate the rebate because the structure of the UK economy in those days was markedly out of line with the structure of the economies of France in particular, and of Germany? Those structural differences&#151;the differing proportions of GDP raised

<p><a name="08020432000237">That is how people should now regard this matter. A comparison can also be made with Germany, which has always contributed the biggest amount to the EU, usually with no complaints in the German press and perhaps with only rare complaints from a small number of Members in the Bundestag. It is a given datum and accepted as part of Germany&#146;s contribution, being the biggest economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"><a name="08020432000139">Today, we also need to note carefully paragraph 16 on page 3 of the Explanatory Notes concerning the 12 new member states. That sets out the essence of the adjustment in this scheme. Our contribution will now be limited to &#163;10.5 billion at 2004 prices over 2007-13, as the Minister himself stated. This is now roughly equal to France&#146;s contribution but much less than that of Germany. It was a classic response from the opportunistic Mr Tony Blair, trembling as usual lest he displease Mr Rupert Murdoch and the &#147;Daily Wail&#148;, when he claimed that the other countries&#151;as usual, to secure peace and quiet with the recalcitrant British, as sadly they regularly perceive us to be&#151;had promised a thorough review of the EU budget and the common agricultural policy from 2013.</p>

We shall see how it turns out. While farmers everywhere have to expect a long-term erosion of the subsidy system, production subventions have already virtually ceased to exist in their old form. However, in reality, no member state can allow farmers to starve, and therefore even in the future compromises will be needed. Some kind of support system, even a residual one, will have to continue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"><a name="08020432000141">France has been mentioned, and I declare an interest in that I also live there. No one can say that France has not adjusted to the decline in farming with a fall in the population involved now down to below 3 per cent, which was the traditional British figure 10 to 15 years ago. The Third Reading in the other place brought out a number of other important matters. As I emphasised earlier, the budget adjustment was literally unavoidable to support very useful non-farm support budgets in the eastern European member states. I assume all noble Lords here will agree that that was a very worthy objective. Secondly, there was the sense that the amendment to new Clause 1 in the Commons was somewhat mischievous to say the least. However, I think it had the come-uppance that it deserved.</p>

For that, we get enormous benefits from our membership of the European Union, especially in the creation of a huge number of jobs and two-way trade. As the noble Lords, Lord Stoddart, Lord Pearson and Lord Waddington, said, as a country we have traditionally had a disturbingly high deficit compared with other advanced countries in the world. The United States may be an exception at the moment because the US trade deficit, as well as the budget deficit, is enormous and out of control.</p>

I predict that, if it intends to remain deeply and fundamentally hostile to virtually all aspects of our membership, as was shown in the Commons debates in Committee and at Third Reading, that will be another, possibly vital, factor in explaining why an election victory will not be in the bag, as some Conservative Members in the other place tend to believe because of their lead in the polls. If that is so, I trust that Mr Gordon Brown or his successor will continue the recent, brand new trend, after Mr Blair&#146;s contortions and changes of mind, including on the referendum for the European Union reform treaty, of showing more enthusiasm for our 34-year membership. Mr Brown has begun to do that. &#147;Britain for a new Europe&#148; was mentioned when he addressed a recent conference.

No word of criticism about the European Union has ever been known to come from the noble Lord, Lord Dykes. What did surprise me was that when he reviewed the Third Reading of this Bill in another place, he selected the only Back-Bench Member to speak in favour of the Government, who happened to be a Labour Back-Bencher. He did not reflect what his own colleagues in another place actually said or did because his own colleagues voted with the Conservatives against the Third Reading of this dreadful Bill. It gives me no pleasure whatever to take part in this Second Reading debate. The Government should be ashamed that they are asking Parliament to ratify one of the worst financial deals in Europe that any Government have ever done. That is saying something because an awful lot of bad financial deals have been done in Europe over the years and your Lordships&#146; House should be ashamed to be part of the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"><a name="08020432000145">We have had some excellent speeches this evening, laying bare the dreadful truth of this Bill. My noble friend Lord Waddington gave an excellent historical account of the betrayal of the UK&#146;s interests. I shall be repeating some of that and make no apology because it is important to understand the scale of what has happened. The noble Lord, Lord Barnett, dazzled or perhaps confused us with his mastery of

His conclusion was that we should not have a referendum, which I found surprising. I would only say to him that that question is a very simple one and I look forward to debating it with him when the other Bill comes here. We also had my noble friend&#151;I still call him my noble friend&#151;Lord Pearson and the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, who ranged more widely, as they do, into cost-benefit analysis. I shall not be tempted down those lines today, however tempting they are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"><a name="08020432000146">In 1984, the UK&#146;s interests were the keen concern of the Prime Minister at the time, my noble friend Lady Thatcher. She tenaciously and skilfully fought for our country. To do that she had to alter the financial settlement with which a previous Labour Government had saddled us. She had to persuade all of the other countries in the EU. She did it and obtained the rebate mechanism which has delivered a total of &#163;54 billion to the UK economy by the end of last year. It was a triumph.</p>

<a name="80204-0014.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_313"><a name="08020432000147">The Government&#146;s hand in going into the last own resources discussion could not have been stronger. Changing the rebate requires unanimity. As my noble friend Lord Waddington has already pointed out, Mr Blair portrayed himself as the defender of the UK. He said,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_79"><a name="08020432000258">&#147;The UK rebate will remain and we will not negotiate it away. Period&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 8/6/05; col. 1234.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020432000238">And of course Mr Brown agreed with the statement that the rebate was &#147;justified and not-negotiable&#148;. As ever, the public cannot believe a word that this Government say. We could not believe them when they said in their manifesto that they would give the people of Britain a referendum on the EU constitution and we should have known not to believe them when they said that they would protect our rebate. The details of the rebate calculations are not important. The essence of the rebate is that it reduces the UK&#146;s contribution to Europe to a more reasonable level. If the rebate had remained untouched by the Government&#146;s ham-fisted negotiations in 2005, the UK would be paying  &#8364;10.5 billion less, or &#163;7.8 billion at current exchange rates. In fact, this is expressed at 2004 prices, which is how the Government have chosen to continue to present the EU budget figures, including in the Explanatory Notes.. The only thing that we know for certain is that the final outturn cost to the UK will be higher.</p>

<a name="80204-0014.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_314"><a name="08020432000148">I do not need to spell out for the House the financial position of the Government, which is getting tighter by the day. Last week, the Institute for Fiscal Studies calculated in its green budget that the Chancellor would need &#163;8 billion of tax rises in order to keep within the Government&#146;s fiscal rules. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research came up with &#163;9 billion. Does anyone seriously doubt that we can afford the voluntary handout to the EU of nearly &#163;8 billion, which is the consequence  of this Bill?</p>

<a name="80204-0014.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_315"><a name="08020432000149">Other noble Lords have referred to what the rebate could be spent on, but the issue is really whether we could save by making cuts in expenditure or in tax rises in the UK. The Government claim that the rebate is going up in absolute terms in the next financing period. Of course, it is going up because the totality of  


<notus-date day="4" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_929"><b>4 Feb 2008 : Column 929</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>EU expenditure is going up at an alarming rate, which is where the real problem lies. Enlargement has increased the size of the EU budget. We accept that some overall budgetary increase is a necessary part of enlargement&#151;a policy we support&#151;but we do not accept that the level of the EU budget itself is correct, and I shall return to that later. We should have used our rebate leverage to work on that, but we did not.</p>

<a name="80204-0014.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="08020432000150">I know that the Government like to present the Bill as the inevitable consequence of enlargement but that is a long way from the truth. The Bill does not affect the decision on total spending; it is just about the rebate. If Tony Blair had not abandoned his country&#146;s interests in late 2005 our rebate would be roughly 25 per cent higher going forward. As it is we now have the double-whammy of a reduced rebate and higher underlying spending. Our average net contribution to the EU over the period 2000-06 was around &#163;3.3 billion. Over the period to 2013, still at 2004 prices, it will be on average &#163;2.3 billion higher, which is a rise of more than 40 per cent. I agree with other noble Lords that we should look at the figures before the EU gives us back some of our own money. The figures are quite bad enough when considered at a net level.</p>

<a name="80204-0014.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_317"><a name="08020432000151">The structure of the rebate giveaway is about as bad as it could be for the UK. It ratchets up over the period so that the rebate as a proportion is much greater at the end than at the beginning. When we go into the next negotiation round, when the rebate reduction will cease to be capped, our rebate will be on a strong downward trend. The annual contribution paid net by the UK to Europe at the end of the next financing period is &#8364;6.4 billion at 2004 prices, and when inflation is added this will double our past rate of spending. That is likely to damage our prospects for a sensible negotiation in the next round since we will be arguing from such a low rebate base.</p>

<a name="80204-0014.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="08020432000152">I turn to the underlying spending settlement. If the EU spent less, our rebate would normally be lower in monetary terms, but at least the net cash transfer to the EU would also go down. We believe that the EU should spend less. I remind noble Lords of the conclusion of the report <I>Funding the European Union</I>, to which the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, referred. That report&#151;the 12th report of the 2006-07 session&#151;states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_80"><a name="08020432000259">&#147;If real reform of the expenditure side were secured the scale of, and possibly the need for, the UK abatement would be reduced. The pressing need for reforms is on the expenditure side: reform of the revenue side, as addressed in this report, is desirable but less important&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020432000239">We thought that the Government shared those sentiments.</p>

<a name="80204-0014.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="08020432000153">The worst example of spending, which is inefficient and unfair, is the common agricultural policy. It accounts for nearly 47 per cent of the overall allocated expenditure in the EU. The amount spent on it is set to rise over the period to 2013.</p>

<a name="80204-0014.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="08020432000154">When Mr Blair began his retreat from his stance on the rebate&#151;it was that,</p>

<p><a name="08020432000240">he replaced it with some tough sounding words on CAP reform. But he blew it. He ended up giving away the rebate without any reform whatever. When he tried to explain his sell-out on the rebate to Parliament, he said,</p>
<ul><a name="08020432000267">&#147;we also agreed on a fundamental review of all aspects of the EU budget, including the common agricultural policy ... it is then possible for changes to be made to this budget structure in the course of this financing period&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 19/12/05; col. 1564.]</ul>
<p><a name="08020432000155">I wonder whether Mr Blair was just fooling himself or deliberately misrepresenting the likely outcome.</p>

<a name="80204-0014.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="08020432000156">When the Commission&#146;s discussion document on the budget review finally appeared, it clearly indicated that there would be no changes in the financing period up to 2013. Worse, it concentrated on the revenue rather than the expenditure side of the budget. The French Agriculture Minister announced to the French nation immediately after the budget was agreed that there would be no review of CAP. The then President Chirac followed that up by publicly declaring that the current CAP was safe until at least 2020, and current President Sarkozy has declared that CAP reform must feature more protection for French farmers&#151;that means more money for French farmers. Similar sentiments have been muttered in the Club Med countries, Ireland and Germany.</p>

<a name="80204-0014.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="08020432000157">CAP is not the only necessary target for reform. Regional funds remain unreformed. The wasteful Commission will see its spending rise by 28 per cent in real terms when it is plain for all to see that this is wholly the wrong direction to travel, especially since, as referred to earlier today, for the 13th year in a row the Court of Auditors have declined to give the EU&#146;s accounts a clean bill of health. When do the Government realistically expect any meaningful budget reform to take place? Do they still expect some reform in this financing period? What do they think is the honest timetable to achieve reform of the CAP?</p>

<a name="80204-0014.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_323"><a name="08020432000158">This Bill does not deliver a fair result to the British taxpayer. It will deliver an annual bill of around &#163;30 to every UK citizen. We will pay 20 per cent more than France even though our economy is only 6 per cent bigger. Ireland, the second richest country in the EU, will still be a net recipient from the EU. The highest spending per capita is in Luxembourg, which is ludicrous. Any system of funding that produces these results is not fair and ought not to be allowed to continue.</p>

<a name="80204-0014.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="08020432000159">This Government had a veto back in December 2005. They not only failed to use it, but also set the UK up for further rounds of financial pain at the hands of our European neighbours. They have not even apologised. The Government have let the people of the UK down. We are invited to conspire with them by approving this Bill. It is a money Bill, so, as we were reminded by the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, it is outside the powers of your Lordships&#146; House to do more than nod it through. From those on these Benches, it will not get so much as a nod to see it on its way.</p>

The fact we are restricted solely to Second Reading concentrates the mind wonderfully, and that is why such forceful speeches were made on the issues raised by the Bill. I emphasise that the Bill represents a settlement and a future for Europe which is promising, fulfils the requirements of the United Kingdom and asks noble Lords themselves some serious questions, as well as the ones they have addressed to me.</p>

<a name="80204-0014.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="08020432000161">First, there was a great deal of emphasis on the problems of the CAP&#151;started by the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, who made his usual forthright contribution. He of course knows that the Government are as one with him on the need for far-reaching reform of the CAP. That remains an important priority for the Government. Nor do we fail to recognise the challenge this represents, a challenge faced up to by previous Conservative Administrations, who found themselves unable to cope as adequately as we have done with these issues.</p>

<a name="80204-0014.htm_para20">
<p><a name="stpa_326"><a name="08020432000162">Let me make the point. The CAP budget is declining. In line with the Brussels ceilings agreed in 2002, the budget commitments for agriculture are on a downwards trajectory. They will be 7 per cent smaller in real terms in 2013 compared with 2007. In the current financial perspective, the CAP accounts for 43 per cent of the EU budget, compared to 56 per cent in the budgetary framework agreed in 1994.</p>

<a name="80204-0014.htm_para21">
<p><a name="stpa_327"><a name="08020432000163">From the force expressed in the speeches from the other side&#151;not just by the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, although he made an excellent start, but reinforced by the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, and again by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, to say nothing of the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart&#151;anyone would think that the CAP monster was maintaining itself with the same force that it had done in the 1980s and 1990s and that there was no change at all. The problem with the analysis of all the positions on the opposition Benches is that it is an analysis of a static position, when Europe, European economies and the British economy are very much in a dynamic relationship.</p>

<a name="80204-0014.htm_para22">
<p><a name="stpa_328"><a name="08020432000164">I want noble Lords opposite to recognise that there are real developments in the present position. The noble Lord, Lord Waddington, suggested that we were surrendering our rebate for nothing&#151;that nothing was being gained from that at all&#151;and that the British negotiating position had been a complete failure, a position reinforced in fairly trenchant terms by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes. How is it, therefore, that UK and French net contributions will be in rough parity over the next period, with France&#146;s net contributions rising twice as fast as those of the UK? Does that suggest that the British Government are being rolled over while others exploit the so-called weaknesses that we displayed? Far from it. That was the achievement of a real recognition of what should be fairness within Europe.</p>

<a name="80204-0014.htm_para23">
<p><a name="stpa_329"><a name="08020432000165">Of course, we have not gone far enough. We all recognise that aspects of the budget are quite unacceptable. My noble friend Lord Barnett made a plea for clarity and for the Government to make things easily understandable for Parliament and for  


<notus-date day="4" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_932"><b>4 Feb 2008 : Column 932</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the general public. I entirely sympathise with that. The strive towards transparency, towards making sure that the accounts are clear and that the British contribution is clearly analysed, is a determination of Ministers each time the issue arises. We all recognise that the failure of the European Court of Auditors to clear anything except a percentage of the budget is quite unacceptable. Let me say that the percentage of the budget that is being cleared by the Court of Auditors is rising significantly at present, but it is a rightful criticism that it is unacceptable that resources on that scale should be expended without clear analysis of the budget.</p>

<a name="80204-0014.htm_para24">
<p><a name="stpa_330"><a name="08020432000166">Of course we have reforms and a reform agenda to pursue in Europe. However, the position opposite seems to be not so much about reform but about how we can withdraw. When the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, talks about his noble friends, he is talking about his noble friends in three parties: his own, that of the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, and that of the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, who is in a slightly more significant party than him.</p>

What I can identify is that the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, was concerned to mention his noble friends across the parties and he included the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, in that. He was fully confident that a great deal of that which she would express would find favour with him and reinforce his arguments&#151;not, as she says, in the final conclusion that his party represents, which is why the noble Lord is a shining example of integrity, having recently withdrawn to it, although it took a little while. He was firmly within the embrace of the party of which the noble Baroness is such a distinguished Member for many years. However, she will appreciate that a large number of the arguments advanced by the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, take&#151;as do those of the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart&#151;their logical conclusion as withdrawal from Europe. The Conservative Party is able to contain, within its ranks, a fair number of people who subscribe to that view. However, its official position is a good deal more conditioned&#151;I accept that from the noble Baroness, who expressed that accurately in her contribution. That does not alter the fact that we know where these arguments come from and where they draw great support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"><a name="08020432000169">In fact, at one stage, the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, was effectively saying, &#147;I defer to some of the facts that the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, put forward&#148;. Well, of course he did. They came from a similar source. They are facts that I was able to recognise as having been the product of a single document and body of thought about Europe. I merely say that that degree of understanding on the issues put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, is not an alien position within sections of the Conservative Party, but is shared by many.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"><a name="08020432000171">On the issue advanced by the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, I know he said that we could follow the example of Switzerland. Why does he not cite those countries that have joined the European Community over the past 20 to 30 years?

However, the Government have always been explicit about that. They never doubted that enlargement of the European Community would give rise to budgetary costs, but knew that they would lead to very significant advances within the Community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="08020432000173">The noble Lords, Lord Pearson and Lord Stoddart, are not right in expressing the view that the growth of the European Community does not produce jobs or increase trade&#151;it does. There are very significant increases. Exports to Poland alone rose in the past three years by 89 per cent, compared with the rise of just 11 per cent before it joined the European Community. Is that coincidental or causal? The noble Lord, Lord Pearson, expresses that as coincidence. It is a pity he did not construct his speech around these remarkable coincidences in the way in which the European Community benefits the British economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="08020432000174">The Government are concerned to demonstrate&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, expressed in his contribution&#151;that the British people are bearing their fair costs within the European Community, which are remarkably similar to those that the French will bear over the next six years. These are two of the richest countries in the European Community. Of course enlargement carries costs, but in the past it has also meant great opportunities for Britain and the other countries of the European Community, and it will bear that fruit again.</p>

That passion has shown no sign of abating in the past three decades or so of British politics, and I imagine that it is destined to be expressed in our debates on the issues to be confronted in the next decades. However, what are we left with? We are left with the Bill being presented to the House against a background in which the Government must negotiate tough terms, as they have always had to, within the framework of Europe and against a background in which great opportunities will present themselves. Those opportunities will be realised, which is why I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

On his first point, however, is he seriously suggesting that the relationship between Britain and Europe after it had withdrawn from Europe would be roughly the same as the relationship between Switzerland and Europe? I hear what he says about the economies. Anyone would think that he had never been anywhere near political relationships or set foot in a political assembly and would not recognise the issues to which actions of that kind give rise.

The making of these instruments will fulfil a commitment Ministers gave before last year&#146;s Scottish elections; namely, a commitment to introduce identical procedures for the collection and checking of absent vote identifiers, as were introduced last year for England and Wales.</p>

<a name="80204-0015.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="08020432000183">The decision to delay their introduction was taken after receiving advice that this additional duty on electoral administrators was not achievable given the introduction of the single transferable vote system and electronic counting for the May Scottish parliamentary elections. That was the right decision. I say that as we have had no evidence of electoral fraud in Scotland in recent years. The Scottish elections in May last year received a higher level of scrutiny than any previous elections, and still no cases of electoral fraud have been brought forward for prosecution. But one must avoid complacency, and the number of people wanting to take advantage of voting by post or by proxy is increasing. Some 11.2 per cent of the Scottish electorate voted by post in 2007, compared with 3.8 per cent in 2003. It is important that only those eligible to vote and who have registered to vote by post or by proxy are able to do so. We fully recognise the need for safeguards against any attempt to vote fraudulently. That is why we are now introducing for Scotland those measures that have been successful in tackling fraud south of the border. There has been a reduction in the number of allegations of fraud in England and Wales since the introduction of these measures, which is a positive indicator that, in conjunction with other fraud action, they are effective.</p>

<a name="80204-0015.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_342"><a name="08020432000184">It may be helpful to continue with a brief explanation of what the two instruments do. I should start by saying that there is little difference between the provisions in the draft regulations and the draft order. The regulations apply to UK parliamentary elections in Scotland, and the order applies to Scottish parliamentary elections. The main difference on transitional arrangements I will come on to shortly. The instruments set out the process by which personal identifiers of a signature and a date of birth are to be collected and how they are to be used to check the validity of returned postal votes. Applications for postal and proxy votes are required to include a signature and date of birth. An exemption can be provided for voters who suffer a disability or the inability to read or write. When dealing with applications, electoral registration officers have the power to check certain signatures or dates of birth previously provided by the applicant to the local authority. Electoral registration officers are required to maintain a record of absent voters&#146; identifiers and to obtain a fresh signature every five years. This takes account of any change in a person&#146;s signature over the period.</p>

<a name="80204-0015.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_343"><a name="08020432000185">The instruments also set out how identifiers are used to check the validity of a returned postal vote. At an election, not less than 20 per cent of postal votes returned will be set aside for checking by the returning officer. All returned postal voting statements must have a date of birth and signature to be duly completed and valid unless the signature  


<notus-date day="4" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_936"><b>4 Feb 2008 : Column 936</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>requirement has been waived. I know that it is the view of the Electoral Commission that we should have mandated 100 per cent checking for our Scottish regulations, but that would be to extend the measure beyond what is in place for England and Wales, and that in a region of the UK where electoral fraud has not proved to be a significant problem. While we accept the argument that 100 per cent checking is desirable, it is right that for the time being we leave the decision on whether it is necessary to those best able to make that call. In fact, many English authorities determined that 100 per cent checking was appropriate at elections for their local government wards last year. The provisions for the checking of identifiers at an election will not have effect in relation to an election on or before 7 August 2008. This allows electoral administrators sufficient time to collect identifiers from both existing and new absent voters before they are required to be used in an election.</p>

<a name="80204-0015.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_344"><a name="08020432000186">Perhaps I may turn to the transitional provisions, and I hope not to weary the House unduly. The Scottish Parliament (Elections etc.) (Amendment) Order 2008 sets out transitional provisions whereby electoral registration officers will write to existing postal and proxy voters asking for their personal identifiers. Each registration officer must by 7 April 2008 write to all persons who have an entry on the absent voting records requiring them to provide personal identifiers within six weeks of the date of the notice. If within three weeks no response has been received, a copy of the notice is to be sent as a reminder. If no identifiers are received from absent voters within the six-week period, they are to be removed from the absent voters&#146; records. Voters will be informed of this and provided with the location of the polling station to which they have been allotted.</p>

<a name="80204-0015.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_345"><a name="08020432000187">The equivalent transitional provisions that apply to the UK parliamentary elections are set out in a negative instrument, the Absent Voting (Transitional Provisions) Regulations 2008. The reason for the different approach is that the parent legislation for each instrument says something different about the parliamentary process for introducing such regulations. I draw your Lordships&#146; attention to the fact that provisions will be in place to cover existing absent voters for UK parliamentary elections.</p>

<a name="80204-0015.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="08020432000188">I should also draw attention to the provision that allows identifiers collected for UK parliamentary elections to be used for checking purposes at Scottish Parliament elections. This will allow a single set of identifiers to be collected and retained for both UK and Scottish parliamentary elections.</p>

We have also consulted with a reference group of experienced electoral administrators. Their comments and those of the commission have been helpful. I commend the instruments to the House.</p>

The Minister will expect me to congratulate the Government on their wisdom in not trying to introduce these measures in time for the last Scottish election, when one can only imagine that one more element of chaos might have been introduced into the difficult administration that took place at that election.</p>

<a name="80204-0015.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_349"><a name="08020432000192">I think the Minister was trying to tell the House that they had not been able to identify any spoilt postal ballots. However, the situation was such that there were so many spoilt ballots all round that they would have been difficult to pick out. It struck me that there appeared to be very few MSPs who were of a mind to challenge the count when the elements were so largely out of balance.</p>

<a name="80204-0015.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_350"><a name="08020432000193">Both the order and the regulations deal with similar items. Is there any rationale for having a five-year term rather than a four-year term for a review of the registration? It would appear from the wording that the registration officer could, or probably would, wait until 31 January before sending out a demand for re-registration to all those who have been registered for five years or over. This means that some who registered in January or February may well have five years and 11 months between registrations. Will the registration officers be able to consider sending out a notice on the fifth anniversary of a registration if they decide that is appropriate?</p>

<a name="80204-0015.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_351"><a name="08020432000194">The fact that these registrations will now contain a signature and a date of birth is certainly a good protection against something that occurs only in unruly countries where votes are cast on behalf of the dead. One hopes that this will be a guard against people trying to carry out what I think is known as &#147;personation&#148; in elections.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_352"><a name="08020432000195">I can see, in some ways very properly, that if someone does not return the demand sent by the registration officer they are struck off, but should there not be some provision for an appeal?

They appear to stem from discussions that were held in your Lordships&#146; House during the passage of the Electoral Administration Bill in 2006, when provisions were inserted to require absent voters to provide personal identifiers to electoral registration officers. I have no quarrel at all with the timing of these instruments and I agree with what the Minister said about the sense of bringing them before us now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"><a name="08020432000198">The order sets out the process by which personal identifiers are to be collected and how they will be used to check the validity of returned postal votes. It is surely right&#151;we have always taken this view&#151;that we should make it easier for electors with a disability or the inability to read and write and that they should be exempt from providing personal identifiers. The transitional arrangements, which the Minister described in detail, seem entirely sensible. The regulations implement a change removing the standing fee of &#163;5 and having the fee calculated on the basis of the price of copied returns at the rate of 20p for each side of each page. That is a perfectly defensible proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"><a name="08020432000199">During the passage of the Electoral Administration Bill, my noble friends and my honourable friends in another place supported what is being implemented tonight. It is right to encourage new methods of voting, including more postal votes and internet voting, since the participation of the electorate in voting is crucial to the health of our democracy. It has been noted that all-postal ballots in local and European elections helped to increase voter turnout. There are certainly dangers of electoral fraud. It is good to hear from the Minister that so far those dangers are not running ahead unchecked, but it is right to be prudent in seeking to avoid them. Problems of personation, multiple voting and intimidation may, as the noble Duke suggested, be observed in wild countries. I hazard the suggestion that within the British Isles such practices are not historically unknown, though they may have happened in slightly less ruly parts of the country than noble Lords are familiar with today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_356"><a name="08020432000200">Having said that and having strongly welcomed these prudent measures, I think that it is right to encourage voting in person, as that is an act of civic participation that gives a higher profile to the importance of the ballot in our democracy. Therefore, while I am happy to endorse the changes that ensure that people who are unable to vote in person because they are ill or away from home are able to vote by post, I hope that we may look at measures that will make it easier for people to vote in person, including certain changes in the days on which people vote. The date&#151;weekend voting and all that&#151;is probably of greater significance than the matters that we are considering tonight. However, it is right to ensure that our elections are secure and to combat electoral fraud, and these instruments seek to do that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_358"><a name="08020432000203">I believe that both statutory instruments are likely to make fraud even more difficult and I welcome that. However, I am not content about the parliamentary process for the Scottish Parliament (Elections etc.) (Amendment) Order. It is terrible that these instruments do not go to the Scottish Parliament to scrutinise them as a third Chamber&#151;let alone to do so exclusively, as I believe they should be.</p>

<a name="80204-0015.htm_para22">
<p><a name="stpa_359"><a name="08020432000204">Will the Minister confirm that the Scottish Constitutional Commission, which was recently developed and is, I believe, a state-funded body, will be allowed to make recommendations about the devolution of the Scottish parliamentary election process? I certainly believe it should. Devolution implies that the national community of Scotland should start to throw off dependency and not in a particularly lengthy process, as a child becomes an adult. At a risk of mixing the metaphors, Scotland is the 35 year-old who needs to leave home. Therefore, I sincerely hope that this is the last time that this type of order for the Scottish parliamentary elections comes exclusively to these two Houses of Parliament.</p>

I know that we had a tame doctor in our own constituency party who did exactly that. Furthermore, the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, is wrong if he thinks that personation takes place only in other countries, as the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, said. Personation in the British electoral system has always been small but has always existed. Perhaps I should not say this, but my mother almost used to boast about how she used to vote for dead people in elections in the 1930s.

The advantages of that are enormous. I agree that it would mean that one would have to have identity cards. If they were compulsory, people would be able to vote in a variety of places, and not just in ballot boxes, and eventually in their own home, on their own computers or even via their own television sets. Such a system would also expand the ability of people to vote. With identity cards, it would become very much safer and more secure. There would therefore be less opportunity for

The rationale for the five years is simply for providing fresh signatures. The five-year term is consistent with what applies in England and Wales. An attempt to obtain some kind of uniformity throughout the United Kingdom is being made. Over the course of time, signatures will be refreshed.

</ul>
<a name="80204-gc0001.htm_para2">
<p><a name="08020431000010">The noble Baroness said: The amendment in my name and that of my noble friends is about the ACAS role in the negotiation of procedural agreements. Emphasis has been placed in discussion of this Bill on the desirability of negotiating settlements of disputes actually at the workplace. No one would disagree with this as a desirable objective, provided that the arrangements are fair and seen to be so by those participating.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0001.htm_para3">
<p><a name="08020431000011">As a former trade union official, I believe that such arrangements can only be effective when they are the result of negotiations between the employer and an independent trade union. However, not every employer is able to come to such agreements without outside help. This is where ACAS has an important&#151;indeed, essential&#151;role. It is surely a function of ACAS to endeavour to help those who need this assistance.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0001.htm_para4">
<p><a name="08020431000012">The Government may well say that this sort of function is readily understood and already accepted. However, it is important that it should be written into legislation as a function that ACAS simply must perform. It is not sufficient for it to be said that this is something to which ACAS must have regard, as indicated in previous legislation; it is a basic requirement. Much of this Employment Bill is about how workplace disputes are handled. This is therefore a key requirement, and should be in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0001.htm_para5">
<p><a name="08020431000013">Our wording acknowledges the role of independent trade unions in ensuring that procedural arrangements are in place and handled appropriately, and that cover is given to the members represented by them. This is an important requirement. I hope that the Government will be prepared to accept it. I beg to move.</p>

At this point, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Bach, for finally getting a letter to us dealing with some of the questions raised at Second Reading; it would be useful to mention this on the first amendment. I note that the noble Lord kindly sent his letter to my noble friend Lady Wilcox on 31 January; I received my copy this morning. Sadly, my noble friend has not yet received her copy, but that does not matter because she has seen mine. No doubt the noble Lord will want to chase that up in due course.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0001.htm_para6">
<p><a name="08020431000015">Again, we will be dealing with this when we get to the code. The noble Lord, Lord Bach, said that he would do his utmost to make the draft ACAS code available to the Committee. I was intrigued that he used those words because, having said that he would do his utmost, he then attached it to the end of the letter. It might have been easier if he actually said in the letter that he had included it, because I thought that it was still not there.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0001.htm_para7">
<p><a name="08020431000016">I am interested in what the noble Baroness says about her amendment. It seems to expand the role of ACAS somewhat unnecessarily. I do not see why we cannot leave things as they are; leaving it to the employers and employees to negotiate what they wish in terms of providing the appropriate procedures for the resolution of disputes at work.</p>

<p><a name="08020431000017"><b><a name="80204-gc0001.htm_spnew2"><a name="08020431000428">Lord Wedderburn of Charlton:</b> I am sure that I can associate everyone on these Benches with my thanks to my noble friend Lord Bach for providing the draft of the ACAS disciplinary and grievance code. As regards this amendment, at Second Reading, the Minister said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08020431000400">&#147;around 75 per cent of claims made to an employment tribunal are resolved before reaching a hearing&#151;a substantial portion with the involvement of ACAS&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 7/1/08;  col. 637.]</ul>
<p><a name="08020431000327">I take it to be common ground on this Bill that disputes at work are best solved by procedures at the point of work, informally and very often with the help of ACAS. It seems quite natural therefore to put up the status of that procedure to a central function of ACAS rather than a minor one which the legislation at the moment suggests. I therefore support the amendment.</p>

This is not the sort of thing that I feel I have to oppose, but I do not really support it. I do not think that it is necessary. I do not see why we cannot leave things as they are, because ACAS is doing a splendid job. It knows what to do and I do not think that it needs any help from us. I rather like the way in which my noble friend Lord Henley put it. I would not always support him because he happened to say something, but I do on this occasion think that he got it right.</p>

I, too, should like to thank my noble friend Lord Bach for providing the information. Like others, I got it this morning and I shall go through it in more detail when we are proceeding. I am very pleased to see the Minister with us, taking time off from his admirable job. Nearly every time I pick up a newspaper, I read where he is selling things for us.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0001.htm_para8">
<p><a name="08020431000020">In this amendment, we are trying to ensure that there is no degrading of the role of ACAS and that what it does is central. Members say that they are looking at what we are doing, not that they are opposed to it. So I hope that what has been put forward will be pretty unanimous. We are not trying to change anything, but want to ensure that ACAS still has a central role to play in any negotiation that takes place. It is in the interests of all of us, whichever side we are looking from, to get a better Bill and a better understanding. The role of ACAS is not in any way diminished. I am very pleased to say that I am here to support the amendment standing in my name, along with my colleagues.</p>

I thought that the remark by the noble Lord, Lord Hoyle, that he did not want to see ACAS degraded was very interesting because there was no suggestion of that&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, clearly spoke about making ACAS stronger. Therefore, I would like clarification on that point: what do the Government think that this amendment would do?</p>

<a name="80204-gc0001.htm_para9">
<p><a name="08020431000022">The noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, said that many cases are now settled, which is quite true. The new pilot scheme that has been in action, where the employment judge has been mediating in cases, has been very effective. Indeed, those who have acted in that role have been impressed by the success of the scheme. Would this amendment in any way cut across that, because this is a good system that is working at the moment?</p>

<a name="80204-gc0001.htm_para10">
<p><a name="08020431000024">It will come as no surprise to hear that I oppose the amendment. I assure the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, in direct response to her question, that the amendment would serve to oblige ACAS to promote agreements between an independent trade union and an employer even where it would not be appropriate so to do. It would also restrict the ability of ACAS to conclude voluntary union recognition agreements.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0001.htm_para12">
<p><a name="08020431000026">As well as providing that general advice, ACAS offers to chair joint working parties of management and employee representatives to draw up procedures and guidance, and offers to undertake joint training of management and employee representatives in the fair and effective operation of such procedures. In my former life as director-general of the CBI, I was involved in the work of ACAS in many ways and I share what I think those on all sides of the Committee feel, which is that we should say &#147;well done&#148; for the good work that is done. I saw it at first hand and it was excellent.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0001.htm_para13">
<p><a name="08020431000027">ACAS stresses to both parties its experience. Without such involvement of employees and their representatives, procedures are likely to be regarded with suspicion by those employees and therefore in danger of not operating effectively to prevent or resolve disputes at work. I agree with my noble friends when they say that the best way to resolve a dispute is at the workplace on the day or very shortly thereafter. There will of course be circumstances in which promoting negotiations between an employer and an independent trade union will not be appropriate. Those could include, for example, when no employee belongs to a union or where some other organisation is trusted by staff and employers to carry out such discussions. Requiring ACAS to promote negotiations between an employer and an independent trade union, which this amendment would do, would reduce ACAS&#146;s flexibility to offer help based on the particular characteristics of an individual dispute in an individual workplace. It would take the individualism and therefore the application out of ACAS&#146;s present remit.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0001.htm_para14">
<p><a name="08020431000028">In addition, where an employer does not recognise the trade union, the negotiation of agreements such as those proposed in the amendment could be viewed as a limited form of recognition of the trade union by the employer. That would be in direct conflict with the factual happening on the ground. For ACAS to have a specific duty to promote such agreements could put it in the position of being seen to encourage the recognition of trade unions in organisations where they currently do not exist. That is not the role of ACAS, nor would ACAS want that role. We believe that this might make it even more difficult for ACAS to help both parties in dispute to conclude a voluntary recognition agreement. It would be unhelpful for ACAS to be seen as partisan in such discussions. I remind noble Lords that in 2006-07, ACAS conciliated in 147 such disputes and provided in-depth advice in a further 22. I hope that in the light of what I have said the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08020431000032">The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 2, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 5. It might have been better if they had been coalesced into one amendment, but circumstances into which I shall not bother to go prevented that. These amendments are concerned with the essential framework of employment tribunals. Since a Member of the Committee said to me that he did not see why I was moving such amendments here, I shall explain at what they are directed. Noble Lords will see that Amendment No. 2 aims to preserve the role and functions of lay members of employment tribunals, with the exception of a matter that arises from the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Acts 2007, to which we will come in Amendment No. 16. Amendment No. 5 states that nothing in that Act or the Bill shall affect the relationship between the legal chairman and the lay members, and especially their equal status in the work of the tribunal. I emphasise the equal status of the three members of an employment tribunal.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0001.htm_para17">
<p><a name="08020431000033">Employment tribunals date from the 1960s. In 1967, they had one major jurisdiction: redundancies and redundancy pay. Now, if noble Lords look at page 3 of the Bill, they will see a vast list of jurisdictions in which the tribunals work. We must realise that age discrimination cases have yet to spill over in their many floods to the tribunals&#151;we will see that in the next year when we see what the European Court of Justice makes of the real meaning of age discrimination&#151;and the logjam of equal pay cases that has built up so high will also perhaps come to the tribunals. It is said that the work of the tribunals has become more complex and some would say it has become more legalistic, whether in a good or bad sense. That is not the fault of the tribunals, but of Parliament which requires them to cope with this new list of jurisdictions. They were and are, with the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the final arbiters on employees&#146; rights and a central part of employment law and practice. The Ministry of Labour&#146;s far-sighted evidence to the Donovan Commission in 1967 suggested what was then thought to be rather a radical thought&#151;that the tribunals, then known as industrial tribunals, would  


<notus-date day="4" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC442"><b>4 Feb 2008 : Column GC442</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be a potential nucleus of labour courts in Great Britain for individual disputes between employer and employees. And so it has turned out. The Donovan Commission&#146;s Royal Commission report in 1968 suggested that they should be given such a function with a tripartite status, which gives them a very special character. The Donovan Commission report said that they should be easy of access and less formal than ordinary courts and close to the realities of employment and its relationships.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0001.htm_para18">
<p><a name="08020431000034">Employers, especially large ones with modernised systems of disputes procedures that they have negotiated at work, have accepted the place of tribunals over 40 years or more, even though some others&#151;mainly small employers&#151;have always disliked their existence, as far as one can see. This is common ground: if one can solve a dispute at the place of work without going to a tribunal, that is of course much better. The ACAS code, for which we are all grateful to see a draft, points in that direction.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0001.htm_para19">
<p><a name="08020431000035">I declare an interest, as in a formal and practical sense I have practised before tribunals&#151;the Employment Appeals Tribunal&#151;and appellate courts from them. I have also come close to much of the research exercise that has preceded the many statutory refinements and amendments to their work.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0001.htm_para20">
<p><a name="08020431000036">There is a widespread concern that the essential character and framework of the tribunals is coming under pressure to change. Clause 4 is a small illustration of the change but, if it were alone, one would not have a great deal of concern about it. The clause contains the fast-track procedure in which the chairman sits alone; we have amendments to its wording and certain concerns about its meaning, but Clause 4 of this Bill is not the only matter that causes concern. Much of the problem comes from a different department, which does not inherit the characteristics that the Department for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform inherits from previous ministries in dealing with employment tribunals. The other arm of the pincer, as it were, comes in the form of pressures from the Ministry of Justice, which is inhibited in the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007&#151;an Act that is famous for its legal thicket of 23 schedules of mass prose. It comes, too, from the Ministry of Justice&#146;s 2008 paper entitled <I>Transforming Tribunals</I>.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0001.htm_para21">
<p><a name="08020431000037">To the Ministry of Justice, any tribunal can be discussed under the same heading. Its documents show that it is prepared to discuss mental health tribunals, taxation tribunals, land tribunals, asylum and immigration tribunals, employment tribunals&#151;and anything else that happens to have the right semantic title. Of course, all tribunals should be open, impartial and fair; that far, one can talk for all tribunals. But the social and legal functions that the various tribunals fulfil are very different.</p>

<p><a name="08020431000038">Concerns at the time of the passing of the 2007 Act were thought to be relaxed after the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton&#151;the then Lord Chancellor&#151;said, in introducing the Bill on 29 November 2006, that the Bill,</p>
<ul><a name="08020431000402">&#147;will bring tribunals dealing with, for instance, social security, tax, mental health and special educational needs into this new structure&#148;.</ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="08020431000353">&#147;The Asylum and Immigration Tribunal, the Employment Tribunals Service and the Employment Appeal Tribunal will retain their existing legal frameworks, acting as separate pillars of the new structure&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 29/11/06; col. 261.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020431000330">That was understood by many people to mean that the Ministry of Justice did not intend to legislate concerning the internal functions of a tribunal, especially its tripartite character. My noble friend Lady Gibson of Market Rasen, who most unfortunately cannot be with us for the passage of this Bill, expressed exactly those concerns at Second Reading of the 2007 Bill. The basic framework of employment tribunals is, and should remain, tripartite and within a framework of the three members who compose tribunals: the chairman, with adequate legal experience, and two members from two panels, one a representative of the employer and the other a representative of the employee.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0001.htm_para23">
<p><a name="08020431000039">That has been the case for so many decades now that it may be thought somewhat odd that the question should even arise. It arises because the Ministry of Justice&#146;s paper, <I>Transforming Tribunals</I>, which has still to be consulted about, makes it quite clear in chapter 9 and schedule D of its text that a review and a radical reform of the composition of all tribunals is to be undertaken largely against the test of whether they are value for money and against the test of how much they cost.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0001.htm_para24">
<p><a name="08020431000040">In none of the Ministry of Justice&#146;s papers are the separate functions of immigration and asylum tribunals, and indeed the employment tribunals, maintained with clarity. In fact, things have already begun to happen by administrative means under the 2007 Act. The legally qualified chairman is now called a judge; the lay members of the tribunals are now called non-legal members. That is a reason that concern has mounted. So that the Committee does not think that I have made all this up, I am bound to quote a document from the Council of Employment Tribunal Members&#146; Associations, which fears that the tendency is to remove the status of the lay members&#151;sometimes called the wing persons; one employer and one employee&#151;compared with the legally qualified chairman who is now called a judge. Perhaps I may read the 2008 document to put it on the record:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08020431000354">&#147;When industrial tribunals were first introduced their purpose was quite clear: to allow employer/employee disputes to be heard and decided in a forum where there was ease of access, less formality than in the court system and the knowledge that the dispute was being heard by a panel of three who would be sufficiently experienced in industrial matters, and the law, to understand what was happening. The specialist knowledge was key to the credibility of the tribunal. The tripartite nature of what are now Employment Tribunals was, and remains, crucial to the system. A legally qualified chairman together with members representing both sides of industry was intended to ensure fairness and an informed understanding of the problem in question. All have equal status and play an equal part in the process of decision making. Legally qualified Chairmen do not generally have direct or practical experience of industry and the workplace, and the other members complement this deficiency. Although members are selected from both sides of industry, in the tribunal they are not there to put forward a particular point of view but to play an impartial role in deciding the case&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="08020431000041">I am sorry to subject the Committee to that long quotation, but it stands part of an even longer page or two on the problem and it is the point of view of persons who have spent in some cases many decades as wing-persons on employment tribunals. It is not a question of whether too many cases do or do not go to tribunals; that is quite a different issue&#151;and I quoted the Minister at Second Reading, who went on to say that he thought that more cases could be settled before they got to tribunals, which is a more controversial issue. I am addressing the problem of the composition and framework of employment tribunals. There is a need for a reassurance from the Government that these fears are not well founded and that employment tribunals are not just another set of administrative tribunals but are there for the purpose stated in the Donovan Commission report and a vast number of other documents over time. That was not a party issue. The need for employment tribunals of this kind became a feature underpinning our employment relationships.</p>

<p><a name="08020431000042">Whether those persons who served for so long on employment tribunals and represented many hundreds of lay members, as I prefer to call them, are right or wrong, their fears are such that a reassurance would be welcome. These amendments are proposed to this Bill because there is no other place to discuss the problem in Parliament these days and it would be very welcome if the Government took up the opportunity to do so. I beg to move.</p>

We are wandering in a jungle, talking about constitution and framework for tribunals, what one department is proposing to do and documents in another department. If one looks quietly at what we are concerned with in these amendments, one will see that it is the function of lay members and the equality of them&#151;and nobody has challenged that. It is how it has worked for many years and there is no palpable threat of change to that situation. I have listened with great attention to what the noble Lord has said, but I do not understand any intention of the Government&#151;which is what it would have to be&#151;to change that position. Without an intention of the Government, this is not a Bill in which to give effect to the ideas of the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, because there is no other place for them. That is not the purpose of this Bill. Therefore, I would very much object to the amendments as being otiose.</p>

I do not wish to go into the details of the amendments or their implications, which is for the Minister, but it is obvious that lay members in employment tribunals play a very valuable and worthwhile role. They have an important role to play particularly in cases involving dismissal, where issues of reasonableness

Many years ago, when I was doing my bar exams, I sat at the feet of a number of eminent lawyers, but none as eminent in the employment field as the noble Lord. I listened very carefully to the explanation that he put forward for his amendments but, like my noble friend Lord Campbell&#151;who, despite what he said on the previous amendment,</p>

<a name="80204-gc0002.htm_para3">
<p><a name="08020431000048">I appreciate that the noble Lord went on to give his explanation, and he was right to quote at some length from, I think, the 2008 document of the Council of Employment Tribunal Members&#146; Associations. It is worried that the equal status of the three members of the tribunal might be being undermined. He might just be seeking government reassurance on this matter; I hope that he is not seeking to amend the Bill, because I am not sure that it is necessary&#151;I might be a bear of little brain on this&#151;to add this to the Bill. Doing so might complicate things in other ways, and if we emphasise that, other things might be by implication not emphasised. Perhaps the noble Lord can deal with that when he responds after the Government have responded to his amendment.</p>

A number of speakers have made the point that there does not seem to be any point in raising this matter in the context of this Bill. I know quite well a number of people who serve as wing persons or lay members on arbitration tribunals, and they are very concerned about what the future holds for them. Of course, there is a government consultation paper, which gives them some concern, and I am not surprised because, according to that paper, all tribunals are being considered. There seems to be a view that all tribunals are the same and that their members are somehow interchangeable.</p>




<notus-date day="4" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC446"><b>4 Feb 2008 : Column GC446</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="08020431000050">Moreover, there is a quote in the consultation paper from the recent Gibbons review of tribunals to the effect that retired members sitting on tribunals might not always have up-to-date, current work experience; and on the other hand individuals who are currently in employment might have difficulty getting time off to do tribunal work. One way or another, either retired people or people at work who are lay members are apparently not to be considered as suitable to sit on tribunals. That, of course, has made people very concerned.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0002.htm_para5">
<p><a name="08020431000051">Another thing that is causing them concern is the apparent reduction in the number of cases heard by full tribunals in favour of tribunal cases heard by a judge sitting alone. That again gives them the feeling that perhaps they are being phased out. The trade unions certainly do not want that to happen, because they have always supported the tripartite setup. The unions believe that the lay people who serve on tribunals offer necessary support, and they give the impression to those who appear before them that they are making their case to members who know what they are talking about. That is not always the case with purely legally qualified people&#151;often they do not have that kind of knowledge. I make an exception in the case of my noble friend because I know that he has both a legal and business background. But that is not generally the case by any means, which is why the lay people are so necessary and important.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0002.htm_para6">
<p><a name="08020431000052">I therefore hope that the Government will give serious consideration to the proposal. It is a serious concern held by people who are doing good work. I support the amendment.</p>

I have not put my name on the Marshalled List and had not until this afternoon considered the question in the depth that it has been discussed. There is a great deal of substance in what my noble friend Lord Wedderburn has said about the value of the tripartite system and the concerns of those he mentioned that somewhere along the line there might be a threat to the system. Indeed, the Government are open about consultation nowadays. His substantive point was about the value of the tripartite system&#151;the lawyer chairman, and the two wing men comprising an employer and a trade union member or worker. I avoid using the word &#147;representative&#148; because, as mentioned, they do not represent anyone. However, they have experience that is relevant and different.</p>

<p><a name="08020431000054">I would add to what my noble friend has said by pointing out that the idea goes back much further than Donovan and employment or industrial tribunals, whatever they are called. It goes back to the days of Lloyd George, when he first introduced forms of national insurance. It was thought that the best way to have them determined was by tribunals of this sort. At least, eventually it got around to that and in the post-World War 2 national insurance and social security legislation of 1946 and 1947, the system of a lawyer chairman with two wing men was introduced. It has been tremendously successful not only in the area of employment but in other related areas. It would distress me considerably if that were readily

Indeed, I have listened to him many times over many years of legislation on this subject. I agree with him about the importance of the equal status of members. I sat on the employers&#146; side of a tribunal for more than 20 years from 1974. On the whole, everyone took an open view and considered themselves to be equal. However, when it came to a legal point, we always deferred to the chairman, because he was expert in the letter of the law.</p>

<p><a name="08020431000056">I am sure that it applied on both sides, but I clearly remember a particular case in which, before we had started, the man on the trade union side asked, &#147;How can they do this? This man has been employed for 40 years by this company&#148;. We were all a bit sympathetic, but after we had heard the case, even the trade union man asked, &#147;How could anyone have stuck this man for 40 years?&#148;. They had moved him from job to job within the enterprise in the hope of pacifying him, but nothing would satisfy him. He was really pretty useless in his job. Not all of us automatically had an open mind at the beginning, but after one listened to the evidence, one considered the case very fairly and we were much more open-minded at that point.</p>

I do not think that we should close our minds entirely to cases being heard by a chairman on his own; there should perhaps be an assessment procedure by a three-member panel for cases that would be suitable to be heard by a chairman on his own.

I think I heard that right but I would like that confirmed. He went on to say that chapter 9 schedule D mentioned review and reform of all tribunals and whether they are value for money. The phrase &#147;value for money&#148; concerns me greatly because I was very involved in the Leasehold Reform Act, which was to help ordinary people to bring their problems without leasehold, and by accident, as much as anything, in the Committee stage, I asked what costs people would have to meet and the reply was, &#147;Everything including the milk for the office cat&#148;. That set the Committee on the alert and we were all very concerned, and a limitation was brought in for people if they had to pay charges to take a case to a tribunal&#151;I am talking about a leasehold tribunal; there was a maximum charge of &#163;500. Without that restriction, if we had been feeding the office cat, the costs would have been enormous and would have ruled out many people.</p>

<p><a name="08020431000062">We must realise that changes will gradually have to occur. As I said there is the possibility of looking at a situation where perhaps a panel of three would decide whether a case was suitable for a chairman only. When the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, spoke of a judge sitting alone, I would not want to confuse that with the new mediation role. At Woburn Place&#151;it is now in Kingsway&#151;I sat in London Central and I understand that that is working very well. It is a case of placing the applicant and the defendant in separate rooms and the judge either meeting them separately or together, hearing their case and deciding whether they can reach an agreement. A large proportion of cases heard in that way reach settlement. I do not know where the ACAS role comes in&#151;before then or at that stage&#151;and I cannot give details on that, but I would not want those cases to be described as for a judge sitting alone because the mediation process is quite a different process.

I want to make this point as clearly as I can: all members of the tribunal enjoy equal status, save in the rare instance that a tribunal is composed of two members, in which case the chairman has a second or casting vote.

Members of the Committee may know that my noble friends Lord McCarthy and Lady Turner of Camden and I opposed the content of those statutory procedures at the time because we thought them unfair to workers and unduly complex and would cause more trouble than they were worth. It has taken a few years, but the Government have come round to our point of view. They are repealing the procedures totally&#151;and we are very pleased to see that that is happening. However, to repeal the content of the procedures is merely to leave a void. What is to happen in the legislation about procedures in the place of work with regard to employment disputes?</p>

<a name="80204-gc0003.htm_para0">
<p><a name="08020431000082">The Government were right in their choice of a mechanism in Section 30 of the 2002 Act of making something a floor of rights for procedures to operate, unless something more satisfactory was negotiated. That seemed to us a sensible approach to the matter, unless legislation is to play no part.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0003.htm_para1">
<p><a name="08020431000083">It is perfectly normal for legislation to play this role in regard to employment relations. Indeed, if I may say so, I was the author of the phrase that one sees in books, if one bothers to read them&#151;not academic books, but all sorts of other books and articles&#151;&#147;a floor of rights&#148;. Employment legislation tends to establish a floor of rights, whereby employers and employees satisfy reasonably civilised standards in the employment relationship. One can think of sex discrimination and all the 22 jurisdictions on page 3 of the Bill, which Members of the Committee might like to read if they have not done so. It is always open to an employer and employee representatives to negotiate something rather more satisfactory for the workplace and that is therefore better.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0003.htm_para2">
<p><a name="08020431000084">Section 30 of the 2002 Act recognises that that is the case. Subsection (2) provides that the procedures are to be the basis of the relationship but that anything</p>
<ul><a name="08020431000405">&#147;additional to, and not inconsistent with&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="08020431000334">those procedures is not to be affected. That seemed to us a rather good basis for the House of Lords to take: that this is the platform from which we proceed towards more detail at particular places of work.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0003.htm_para3">
<p><a name="08020431000085">However, the Bill as currently drafted leaves a void&#151;it merely repeals, quite rightly, the content of the procedures. The amendment proposes that the floor be the ACAS code of procedure on disciplinary and grievance procedures. Until yesterday, when I received my copy, I could not be absolutely sure that we would not want to make some footnote exception to that. Now that I have seen the draft, which is what I hope we will be left with as the ACAS code, we are encouraged that our amendment got it right. The ACAS code should be what one begins with at the place of work, and after that it is up to the parties to get on with it if they think something better should be negotiated.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0003.htm_para4">
<p><a name="08020431000086">It may be that some minor amendment will be made to our amendment&#151;I do not suggest that our drafting is 100 per cent right&#151;but the concept behind it is intended to help. That is what the law should do in this area: it should help at the place of work and make such procedures an implied term of contracts of employment. Unless something better is negotiated, it was rather a good idea in the 2002 Act, and I would be surprised if the Government now believe that it was not. They did not bring it into force, of course, because they came to the view that the content of the procedures they were proposing was horrifying. It was unfair, too complex and counterproductive.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0003.htm_para5">
<p><a name="08020431000087">I therefore suggest that there is a case on the Government&#146;s own structure of the 2002 Act at least to look favourably on the concepts behind our amendment. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08020431000089"><b><a name="80204-gc0003.htm_spnew1"><a name="08020431000446">Lord Wedderburn of Charlton:</b> I take that to be a question while I was in a semi-recumbent position. This is a suggestion that what ACAS puts forward as a sensible procedural basis for employment relations is the floor from which the law begins. There is no question of any order being made; the amendment keeps Section 30, with certain amendments. It may be that more amendments are needed, but the concept behind it is not concerned with the problem the noble Lord raised.</p>

We are supposed to be the revising Chamber and therefore, when the Government put legislation before us, we hope that they, if not make it easy for us, at least do not try to make it impossible or deliberately obscure. I understand that in moving Amendment No. 3 the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, was saying, &#147;Don&#146;t repeal Section 30&#148;, and then inserting the new  clause.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0003.htm_para6">
<p><a name="08020431000091">As I understand it from what he said, Section 30 has never been brought into force by the Government, although it is still in the 2002 Act. The current Criminal Justice Bill in which the noble Lord, Lord Bach, and I are both involved, repeals parts of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 that have never been brought into force. It is an extraordinary way to legislate if Governments first consult; then bring in legislation; then fail to bring it into force when it is on the statute book; then after further consultation repeal it; and then bring in something new instead. Can I ask for some assurance from the Government that they will talk among themselves and between departments? The noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, earlier referred to some confusion between the Ministry of Justice and the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and to the slightly different tones of their consultations on tribunals. One would like to be sure that they talk to each other about matters that relate to tribunals&#151;so there is a Ministry of Justice interest&#151;and talk among themselves about whether the right way to go about things is to pass Acts, fail to bring parts of them into effect and then repeal them in two or three years.</p>

The point I was making is that the Government have never brought in Section 30, six years after passing the 2002 Act. Much the same is happening in the Criminal Justice Bill. It is an extraordinary way of cluttering up the statute book with various new clauses that are not brought into effect and which the Government set about repealing a few years later.</p>

<p><a name="08020431000095">Amendment No. 3 repeals Section 34 of the Employment Act 2002. In addition, this amendment and the new clause inserted by Amendment No. 4 together retain an amended version of Section 30 of the Employment Act 2002, such that the procedures in any ACAS code of practice relating to the resolution of disputes shall be implied terms of all contracts of employment. I shall deal with these two issues in turn.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0003.htm_para8">
<p><a name="08020431000096">I assure my noble friend Lord Wedderburn that, as I am sure he fully understands, the Bill does not provide for the repeal of Section 34 of the 2002 Act, for the following reason. Section 34 provides, first, for the introduction of a new Section 98A into the Employment Rights Act 1996. Repeal of Section 98A is specifically provided for in Clause 2 of the Bill; the other provisions related to Section 98A introduced by Section 34 will be repealed as an automatic consequence of that action. Section 34 also introduced other changes to the Employment Rights Act 1996 that we do not intend to repeal. These allow for an additional award of four weeks&#146; pay in the separate context of retirement dismissals, a provision which was introduced by the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006. I presume that the proposers of the amendment do not intend to remove those unconnected measures.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0003.htm_para9">
<p><a name="08020431000097">On the second proposal contained in these amendments and the retention of Section 30 of the 2002 Act in an amended form, the section provides for the 2004 statutory dispute procedures to be implied terms in all contracts of employment and has never been brought into force. It relates to procedures, in so far as it makes statutory procedures up to now implied conditions of all contracts. We see no reason to retain the section as amended, for the reasons that I have just given, and we are providing alternative measures to replace the statutory procedures: an ACAS code to be taken into account by tribunals, an enhanced helpline and more conciliation. Employees are properly protected by having good information and advice about their options for seeking redress if they have a grievance at work, including early conciliation from ACAS to resolve matters at that stage, if at all possible. However&#151;and this is very important&#151;they will have unfettered access to an employment tribunal if that proves necessary. That is what is provided in the package of measures that we propose.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0003.htm_para10">
<p><a name="08020431000098">In addition, Section 3 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 was amended by the 2002 Act to require employers to provide details of their discipline and grievance procedures in the written statement of employment particulars. The failure to provide such a statement may give rise to a freestanding tribunal claim, though with no compensatory award, but it may also lead a tribunal to increase an award made under other jurisdictions.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0003.htm_para11">
<p><a name="08020431000099">The consultation document on draft statutory dispute procedures in 2003 pointed out that the main effect of the provision would be to allow one party to  


<notus-date day="4" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC455"><b>4 Feb 2008 : Column GC455</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>make a breach of contract claim against another in the civil courts&#151;or, in some circumstances, the employment tribunals&#151;if the other party failed to follow the procedures. That would be the case even if the failure could not in itself give rise to a valid claim to a tribunal. The Government proposed not to commence this provision until there had been a chance to see how the procedures would bed down. In responses to the consultation, 62 per cent agreed with deferring commencement and only 6 per cent thought that the section should never be commenced. The Government concluded that they should defer commencement until they had reviewed the impact of the procedures. In the event, we are now repealing the procedures and replacing them with a lighter-touch approach to resolving disputes in the workplace. In that context, the Government believe that there is even less reason to provide for freestanding claims against employers when there is no substantive grievance.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0003.htm_para12">
<p><a name="08020431000100">Proponents of the commencement of Section 30 in the 2003 consultation argued that it would increase the protection of employees, and draw their attention to the procedures of which they might otherwise be unaware. Our current package of proposals includes an enhanced ACAS advice service and helpline, all of which is designed to make employees aware of their rights and possible courses of action in the event of a disciplinary matter or grievance. That type of measure, not the encouragement of legal proceedings, is the sensible and proportionate way to ensure that employees are properly protected and aware of their rights. My noble friend Lady Turner was kind enough to say that in my previous two lives&#151;one as a lawyer and one in business&#151;I understood the practical implication of the subject of this afternoon&#146;s proceedings. Not to encourage legal proceedings might have upset me in my first calling, but in my second I would have thoroughly enjoyed it. It is in line with the whole thrust of our policy following the Gibbons review, which is to encourage early and informal resolution of disputes.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0003.htm_para13">
<p><a name="08020431000101">I hope that this clarifies our reasons for not repealing Section 34, and why we do not believe it would be appropriate to retain Section 30 in a modified form.</p>

First, I should not have included the repeal of Section 34; the objection to that is somewhat technical, and I do not propose to delay Members any further in Committee on that point. I am quite happy if that is left out. I am not happy if the good idea that the Government had in 2001 in Section 30, which they did not bring into force, as I understand it, because they began to understand the objections that we made to the content of the procedures that they were bringing in in the 2001 Bill, as it then was, is any reason at all for not using that device now. The fact that the Government had a good idea and then bad content to fill it up with suggests that they should use their good idea now and not propose&#151;because this is what is involved&#151;that the Bill should do nothing at all about this area of dispute procedures, which they simply leave as a void.</p>

<p><a name="08020431000103">The Minister said that there will be a better telephone helpline, and we are very pleased to hear that. He says that there will be more conciliation. Our support for ACAS in previous amendments should suggest that we are very pleased to hear that, although ACAS adapts its procedures with conciliation and with mediation, which is very different from conciliation, with arbitration, where that is helpful, and with a special scheme introduced in 2001 for alternative dispute resolution, although in fact that has not been a great success. We are very pleased to hear all that, but what we are asking is&#151;is there no contribution at all that the Bill can make to this area? Apparently not.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0003.htm_para15">
<p><a name="08020431000104">No floor of procedures is to be even suggested in the Bill, except in the normal case that the ACAS code of practice can be taken into account. We want an obligation that employers should accept the basis of the ACAS code, and that is why we thought it was rather a nice thing to congratulate the Government on their good idea and adapt it, with the ACAS code being the floor of rights from which everyone proceeds. I can see that the Government do not want this Bill to contribute to the law on the matter. We will consider this again before Report, because it seems to me at least that the matter should have rather wider discussion than is possible in this Grand Committee, where no decisions can be taken anyway.

<a name="80204-gc0003.htm_para21">
<p><a name="08020431000111">The reason for moving the amendment now is that there seems to be a development coming along through which employers and managers can acquire methods of monitoring workers at the place of work in the most extraordinary ways. There are two ways of looking at the employment relationship. One is what is sometimes called the work-wage bargain: that the employer buys a certain amount of labour or, if you wish, labour power, in return for the wage. The other way of looking at it&#151;which I understand, from the literature with which I am familiar, is rejected by all civilised countries&#151;is that the employer buys the worker. I take the notion that the worker retains some dignity and human rights at the place of work as common ground in this Committee. I make the case for some amendment of this kind on that basis.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0003.htm_para22">
<p><a name="08020431000112">I had better mention that my knowledge of this is through the reports of a new system brought out by Microsoft, for which they are applying for a patent. It has been described by a senior QC, Hugh Tomlinson, an expert on data protection, as a system which,</p>
<ul><a name="08020431000406">&#147;involves intrusion into every single aspect of the lives of the employees. It raises very serious privacy issues&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80204-gc0003.htm_para23">
<p><a name="08020431000113">The system operates in an electronic manner which I do not claim to understand. I rest the point upon the accounts of the system which appeared in the <I>Times</I>, the <I>Financial Times</I> and other places. It works by recording and analysing what words and numbers are used, or websites visited, by watching the user&#146;s heart rate, breathing, body temperature, facial expressions and blood pressure. It allows for the automatic recording of frustrations and stress in the user via psychological and environmental sensors, and offers the results automatically. The most important thing in a practical sense is that, as the report says, every person will be analysed in real time to allow the computer to decide what steps and actions should be taken. From this data, the report goes on, statistics relevant to all sorts of problems can be provided to users and employed in gauging their efficiency.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0003.htm_para24">
<p><a name="08020431000114">One scenario given in the patent is of &#147;Joe&#148;, who is spending more time on an activity than was originally allocated, and measuring his performance. One has an automatic system which will record the performance of the worker, even down to facial expressions, in way which has never been known before. That is what Microsoft claims, and I have no grounds for thinking that it is not true.</p>

<p><a name="08020431000115">I will not detain the Committee with further details of the report of the system, which are very long. However, it is apparent that a system at the place of work that is able automatically to monitor a working person&#146;s activity, facial expression, breathing, heart rate and everything else comes close to the line between buying a certain amount of work and buying the whole human person. That is why the amendment refers to the human rights considerations which appear in the Human Rights Act and in the European Convention on Human Rights, relating to the dignity of workers.</p>

That may be in a few years&#146; time; it may be longer. However, one of the functions of legislation is to anticipate. It is not merely to deal with problems that have already arisen. The legislature ought to be sufficiently cognisant of what is likely to happen to make some move about it. This amendment provides that such matters should be the subject of procedures, and ACAS should be consulted in regard to the matter. Furthermore, a code of practice on the matter would be very relevant&#151;at any rate, a code that takes account of what is likely to happen, which can be adjusted to the practices at the place of work.</p>

Today we have heard a Statement in the Chamber about the Government or one of their agencies bugging one of their own MPs and Whips as he visited a constituent in prison. This is a serious matter. Obviously, a great deal of this is going on, and there is a great deal of abuse of the system. None of us had the chance to hear what was said in the Statement, but no doubt we will be able to discuss it at a later stage. As the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, made clear, there is already a great deal of perfectly legitimate surveillance of employees at work; whether it is an HGV driver recording details in the cab to ensure that he does not drive excessive hours, or whatever.</p>

<p><a name="08020431000119">However, this matter must be dealt with to ensure that it is at the right level. Whether ACAS is the right body to produce such a code of practice when the issue goes much wider, as evidenced by the Statement being made in another place, is another matter. I do not know whether we need to have a bigger debate, particularly in the light of that, looking at the articles referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn. We might want to come back to the subject on Report and have a fuller discussion. Alternatively, the Government, in the interests of joined-up government, might want to discuss the matter with the Ministry of Justice and the Home Office to consider whether they should be giving further assurances, not only in regard to disputes concerning the surveillance and monitoring of employees, but the wider question surrounding surveillance and monitoring in what many of us consider a <I>1984</I> type of society that has been created.</p>

In the mean time, some step could be taken by the Government&#151;a temporary step if they wished&#151;to shore things up until there is a Bill that deals with the matter.

<p><a name="08020431000126">The Government are very supportive of codes for ACAS. It is highly regarded by both employers and employees, and it certainly prevents many more cases coming before tribunals. But there has been no pressure on ACAS to produce the sort of code that is mentioned in the amendment, and ACAS is not aware that there is any need for such a code. We already have a comprehensive code that has been issued by the Information Commissioner. This is what people have to deal with every day; every employer has to have that and look at it. That deals with employee monitoring and includes electronic surveillance, so there is already something in place to deal with the exact point raised by my noble friend. The amendment is not necessary for a new code of practice, because ACAS already has the power to issue a code of practice whenever it thinks fit, which is in Section 199 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. If we need one, it can go and produce one in the morning, as it is for the purpose of promoting &#147;the improvement in industrial relations&#148;.</p>

If we go to some of those fabulous manufacturing facilities all over Britain that still make more things than people ever give credit for, we see that they do not associate with the word &#147;industry&#148; but with words such as &#147;manufacturing&#148;. The statute uses the word &#147;industrial&#148;. ACAS has a remit for the public sector as well, for good quality, hardworking people in the public sector who again&#151;I think&#151;do not associate with &#147;industrial&#148;. They might associate with &#147;labour relations&#148;, &#147;workplace relations&#148; or &#147;employer-employee relations&#148;.

The amendment is wider; it goes to human rights and dignity. The speech moving it went wider, to general human rights and so forth. This is a larger question than can be wholly related to the Bill. All I am asking&#151;although that is probably of no consequence&#151;is that the amendment should be rejected unless it is implemented by Parliament by some form of resolution. Basically, however, the major problem should be accepted by the Government. Apart from the document for ACAS, they are as perfectly capable of and justified in dealing with things as they were when that document was written.

He has not really dealt with the substance of the point raised in the amendment, but the procedure through which it might be dealt. Can he go back to the substance? I know he is advising us that this is not the place, but he referred to the code as already having provisions dealing with surveillance and monitoring. It might be of great assistance to the Committee if he could indicate his own judgment on that bit of the code that already exists, and whether it could be built on without all the bureaucratic and administrative problems that he outlined in his deregulatory approach. Is the code currently sufficient? Could it be improved in some way? If he told us, we could deal with this matter now rather than leaving it for another day.</p>

If it wants to it can, but we are satisfied that it has sufficient power today to respond to pressure from anywhere. As we speak, it has not received that pressure but after today it might. In our view, there is no need to add to the paperwork, to the regulation, to another pile of red tape which burdens business every day.</p>

<p><a name="08020431000139">However, as the noble Lord says, while I was concerned with the concept of the wider issue, I did not wish to demean it. It goes to the heart of what this nation is about and I can see the point. I am satisfied that with what ACAS currently has in the box of tools which it can bring to bear at any time, it can deal with the issues raised in the workplace; on whether it can deal with them outside the workplace, I suggest probably not, but this is not the place to discuss that.</p>

There are a number of objections to it. The first is, as some noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, have said, a lack of confidence in ACAS being able to do the job. ACAS has expressly asked to take account of certain matters and to consult certain persons, including the Information Commissioner in subsections (2) and (3) of the amendment.

If one looks through its codes of practice, one sees all sorts of things where it has taken account of views of experts in the matter. Human rights do not stop at the office door or the factory gate. Human rights is a concept that we have come to understand rather better than we did in years gone by. I am long enough in the tooth to remember talking about not being unfairly dismissed as a human right. No doubt, today the arguments would place that outside the Bill.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0004.htm_para8">
<p><a name="08020431000142">It will not do for the Government to say that this is not something to deal with now and that we should perhaps wait to consult all sorts of other people. No reassurance is given that they will consult anyone at all. I reject the view that the code issued by the Information Commissioner deals with the problem. That is a misreading of the amendment and it is completely out of date in terms of the kind of monitoring to which my noble friend Lady Turner of Camden referred. It is not good enough for the Government to take this relaxed view that nothing needs to be done. The Italian experience, of which I know something, shows that in 1970 it was absolutely justified to get in early on this problem and that has had an effect on industrial relations, despite all the other problems that everyone knows about in Italian industrial relations. It could have an effect here and would give a reassurance to workers that the matter has not been overlooked. I am very disappointed in the Government&#146;s response to something on which many noble Lords saw the point and which has received such support in Committee.

However, the amendment proposed would restrict the relevant statutory codes only to those issued by ACAS and nowhere else. I should say at this point, and I am sure that the Committee will agree, that ACAS plays an important and valued role in the resolution of workplace disputes.

Although that does not pose immediate difficulties, such a restriction could cause difficulties in the future. Although there is no current intention for the Secretary of State to issue a code of practice under this chapter, which includes provisions relating to resolution of disputes in the workplace, the power for him to do so exists and it would not make sense for tribunals not to be able to take the provisions of any such code into account when considering the fairness or otherwise of the procedure used or the adjustment of any award.</p>

I hope that all Members of the Committee will agree that the more that can be done to ensure that disputes are resolved before we get to a tribunal, the better.

On disciplinary and grievance procedures, there are two other statutory ACAS codes and three Secretary of State-issued codes that have nothing to do with ACAS. There is also an ACAS code of practice relating to disclosure of information to trade unions for collective bargaining purposes and an ACAS code of practice for time off for trade union duties and activities. There are also industrial action ballots and a notice to employers on picketing, access and unfair practices during recognition and derecognition ballots.

The longer the process, the less chance of trust and a good outcome.

As I said when discussing Clause 1, it is widely agreed that resolving disputes in the workplace as early as possible is desirable for all parties. However, it has become clear that while the principles behind the 2004 statutory dispute resolution procedures were sound, enshrining detailed procedures in legislation has had unforeseen and unwelcome results.

<p><a name="08020431000202">As I said when we discussed Clause 3, these measures include a revised ACAS code on disciplinary and grievance procedures. ACAS is revising its statutory code to be principles-based and concise, and it will be accompanied by fuller non-statutory guidance. The accompanying guidance will be designed to provide practical help to employers and employees, bearing in mind what would be appropriate for the size and resources of the employer and the nature and gravity of the complaint. In addition, we are proposing an incentive mechanism whereby a tribunal will have the discretion to increase or decrease an award by up to 25 per cent where a party has unreasonably failed to comply with the procedural provisions of the code.</p>

<p><a name="08020431000203">We believe that the introduction of a revised, concise, principles-based ACAS code of practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures supported by fuller non-statutory guidance and with an incentive mechanism in the Bill to follow the code is a sensible and balanced way of encouraging employees and employers to follow the principles of good practice in the early resolution of workplace disputes without encountering the problems that have arisen with the statutory dispute procedures. Our fear is that this amendment, if carried, would lead to the same problems as were experienced with the existing statutory dispute resolution procedures. Because the statutory code will allow tribunals to consider the appropriateness of parties&#146; behaviour in the circumstances of the case rather than assessing compliance with the set procedure, we believe that the comprehensive accompanying guidance will provide clarity for employers and employees about what is expected of them. We do not want to be as prescriptive as this amendment would require if it were carried.</p>

In theory, a risk assessment should be done on all risks that can potentially harm employees, so it should ensure a safe working environment. Here, we are talking about where an employee is unable to participate in a grievance or disciplinary procedure because he or she is incapacitated and it is apparent to the employer that the cause of the incapacity might be related to an occupational factor. The employer should conduct, as may be appropriate, a risk assessment to cover this issue. In theory, a risk assessment should be done on all risks, but we feel this particular area needs addressing.

In my tribunal experience, there were a number of cases where someone claimed to have an incapacity not during his time at work, but after he had left. Very often, the employer sent someone around to find that person in his home&#151;sometimes, happily, to see whether he could do anything to help him, and other times just to check whether the person really was incapacitated&#151;and the person could not be found, so the whole proceeding was delayed for a long time.

Any employee who becomes incapacitated when there is a reasonable suggestion that the incapacity might be related to the working environment requires investigation by the employer. I am not quite sure why we need a specific clause saying that if that happens during a grievance or disciplinary procedure, the employer should investigate. The onus is surely on the employer to investigate any time there is incapacity related to the environment.</p>

When an employment Bill comes forward, people take the opportunity to get into it items that are perhaps not otherwise covered. I accept the argument that these amendments do not necessarily logically fit into these provisions in the Bill. Nevertheless, we feel that these are important issues. This amendment is trying to get at the point that quite often when someone is at home because he is involved in a grievance or disciplinary procedure because he has not come to work, it is because some form of bullying in the workplace has made him stay at home. We have no pride of drafting in this amendment, but we think an obligation should be put on an employer that when an employee has stayed at home, and as a result may be involved in some form of disciplinary or grievance procedure, there should be an obligation on the employer to carry out a risk assessment. This is not necessarily the logical place to put this in the Bill, but when we are faced with the 28th piece of employment legislation since 1997, we want to seize the opportunity to add little bits when we think they might be useful.</p>

The approved code of practice has statutory force, so the legal basis for action is already there.

The peril that this amendment deals with is a situation that often occurs in the workplace where a person is unable to deal with a grievance or a disciplinary matter due to a health condition that has been brought on by the events that have led to the grievance or disciplinary procedure. This is an attempt to deal with that situation, which often occurs in harassment cases where the victim, as part of the grievance or disciplinary procedure, has to face the alleged harasser. That may cause psychological manifestations: anxiety, fear-based conditions or post-traumatic stress symptoms. This is an attempt to deal with a situation that often occurs in the workplace.

The noble Baroness, Lady Turner, might remember it. I was the hapless Minister taking it through. At the time, I knew a great deal about statutory sick pay and I think for a time I even understood it. But like the Schleswig-Holstein question, it has all disappeared from my mind. I always even then found statutory sick pay to be one of the more complicated benefits. I have a sneaking suspicion that the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, is probably right when he says that he is stretching the envelope somewhat in trying to include this in an employment Bill, but I admire his gall in trying to do so. I will also listen with interest to the Minister&#146;s response, and I hope that some of what I used to know about statutory sick pay, and possibly some of what the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, used to know about it, might return to us as we listen.</p>

While this may be to one extreme, I do not think that any harm will be done by having a short debate on this matter. It is also extremely helpful to the noble Lord, Lord Henley, as it will bring back happy memories of when he sat where I do now. I do not think that my noble friend Lady Turner needs any help with this, because she knows all about statutory sick pay and has done since the previous Bill went through.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0006.htm_para3">
<p><a name="08020431000221">Statutory sick pay is payable to employees for up to 28 weeks of incapacity for work. Employers have a statutory liability to pay statutory sick pay to qualifying employees who are incapable of work under their contract of service. The scheme is well established. Employers are fully responsible for the cost and operation of the scheme. The Department for Work and Pensions has policy responsibility, and it is policed by Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs. HMRC makes formal decisions to resolve disputes between employers and employees. It is also responsible for imposing penalties on non-compliant employers.</p>

<p><a name="08020431000222">The noble Lord is seeking to extend the payment of statutory sick pay beyond the conclusion of a contract for those employees whose contract is ended as a direct result of the resolution of a grievance or disciplinary procedure. In those cases, employers would be required to pay statutory sick pay for the full 28 weeks, despite the fact that there is no longer any employee/employer relationship.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0006.htm_para5">
<p><a name="08020431000223">We do not think that it would be appropriate to deviate from the fundamental principle that only employees are entitled to statutory sick pay. Entitlement is brought to an end with the conclusion of a contract. To do as is suggested would not only entail additional costs for an employer but would involve him in needing to determine an employee&#146;s incapacity under a contract that is no longer in

The noble Lord, Lord Razzall, may say, &#147;But what happens if this is being done deliberately by the employer to escape his responsibilities?&#148;. That is at the heart of the amendment. The Statutory Sick Pay (General) Regulations 1982&#151;I do not know whether the noble Lord, Lord Henley, dealt with those regulations&#151;specifically provide protection for employees whose contract of service has been brought to an end by an employer solely or mainly to avoid statutory sick pay liability. In those circumstances, the law provides that liability to pay statutory sick pay remains with the employer until that liability ends for some other reason. Similarly, should statutory sick pay come to an end but an employee&#146;s incapacity continues, that employee may have recourse to financial assistance through the benefit system.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0006.htm_para6">
<p><a name="08020431000224">The provision needs to strike a balance between fairness to employees and keeping burdens on employers&#151;in terms of cost and complexity&#151;to a minimum. If the amendment were accepted, it would tip the balance too far in favour of employees and against the needs of employers. Although I am grateful that the issue has been raised, existing law deals with the dangers that have been mentioned.</p>

However, it does not deal with the other situation in which someone is subject to a disciplinary or grievance procedure in relation to an event that has made them ill and in relation to which they are timed out on making an application to a tribunal. That is the practical difficulty that often arises in harassment cases. I will read with interest in <I>Hansard </I>what the Minister said, and I am glad that we had the opportunity to air the issue.

The employment judge can hear case management discussions, pre-hearing reviews and certain types of claim sitting alone.

I am grateful to the Minister for the very detailed assurances that he gave on the situation relative to lay members. We were very grateful for that, and I record that in this connection. But as far as the stand-alone process is concerned, it is frequently argued that this can only take place now with the consent of both parties. The problem with that is that we do not always know how the parties reach that consent. The idea of the amendments is to make sure that if an individual agrees to a stand-alone type case, he or she knows what it is about and his consent has been properly obtained, which is why we suggest that consent should be in writing. We also say that,</p>

I hope that the Government will be prepared to accept the amendment, because in drafting the amendment we have tried to come to terms with what we believe to be the desire of the Government&#151;to have more and more stand-alone cases where this can be reasonably, effectively and fairly administered and handled. On the other hand, we want to make sure that those people who opt for stand-alone cases know what it is about, give their consent and have access to independent advice before they enter into that process.

<p><a name="08020431000242">Our consultation on resolving disputes in the workplace sought views on the best approach for dealing swiftly and effectively with straightforward monetary disputes. The consultation responses produced strong support for developing further the good practice which already exists within tribunals. The Government intend to exercise their existing powers by which employment judges may determine proceedings without a hearing. The rationale behind this proposal is to enable claims in certain limited jurisdictions to be resolved more quickly, potentially saving time and costs for all parties and, incidentally, enabling those with more significant, complicated claims to have their cases heard sooner rather than waiting for the simple claims to be heard at the present rate.</p>

Voices have expressed a firm view that that part of Clause 4 adds nothing. The regulations will be consulted on.

The detail of how that system will be managed will be established through the tribunal rules, which are not before the Committee tonight. As such, it would be unwise and inconsistent with its objectives for this clause simply to limit the way in which tribunals may manage that process in future. The fast track will be an important and valuable mechanism for ensuring effective but expeditious determination of proceedings. To achieve that aim, we propose that, in a limited number of jurisdictions, an employment judge would write to the parties informing them of his or her view that their case would be suitable for determination on the basis of documents, but that they have a right to a hearing.</p>

Paragraph (b) would apply when there might be a right to request a hearing but there was deemed consent to having a judge alone.

The Ministry of Justice now insists that we call that person an employment judge, which is not an improvement. When that person notifies an employee that they have a right to request a hearing and nothing happens, the employee is deemed to consent to a jurisdiction which, before 2002, did not exist.

Now we see that the Bill will give the chairperson the right to send a letter to an employee to say that they have the right to request a hearing. Then nothing happens; perhaps the employee lost the letter or was persuaded by his in-laws not to reply to official letters. The Bill must really be amended, if that is what it means. If it means that each party to a procedure has the right to request a hearing but may make no use of that right, the Bill should say so. We cannot just leave it to chance that the regulations will say what my noble friend said that they will say. I am sure that he wants the regulations to say that but the Bill specifies, importantly, where judge-alone sittings of the tribunal will be allowed.

In magistrates&#146; courts, very often the first thing that a person knows is when they get a judgment through the post, and they never heard anything before that; and it could be the same in the tribunal. In the magistrates&#146; courts, you have the right to have a case reopened because it was judged on a deemed consent.

My shorthand is not good enough to take down what he said but, as I understand it, he spelt out, I think, five jurisdictions where the single-chairman hearings are supposed to operate. I am quite certain that two of those were breach of contract hearings and national minimum wage hearings.

Now we are told that when there is deemed consent, the worker cannot pop up at the hearing with the judge alone. He does not have his day in court, as my noble friend Lady Turner said on a previous occasion. If that really is the situation, I shall find it very difficult to lend my support to the Bill with that width of fast-track procedure.

Will he also consider whether it would be right for Parliament to say that you cannot have a proper employment tribunal but only a one-person decision if you have deemed consent to this matter? What is he going to say to the association of lay members of tribunals when it says&#151;as it has said&#151;that it is very concerned that the whole nature of employment tribunal justice is going to change?

<a name="80204-gc0008.htm_para1">
<p><a name="08020431000313">The amendment is technically deficient because the job of being a mediator has already been assigned to any member of the employment tribunal by paragraph 42 of Schedule 8 to the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. That paragraph inserts a new section in the Employment Rights Act 1996, Section 7B, &#147;Mediation&#148;. It states that any member of the tribunal can act as a mediator in disputes where the case is the subject of proceedings. If Members of the Committee consider where we have got to, a employee or worker brings a claim to the tribunal and, instead of the tribunal all acting in the required judicial capacity, one of them acts as a mediator, necessarily taking sides about what is, or is not, the superior argument and solution to the dispute.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0008.htm_para2">
<p><a name="08020431000314">Amendment No. 16 ought therefore to require an amendment of Section 7B of the Employment Rights Act 1996. Members of the Committee may ask how on earth that new section was placed in that Act. Simply, it was put there in your Lordships&#146; House, without argument or debate, promoted by the Ministry of Justice, which frankly has little knowledge of the realities of employment tribunals. It has made it a requirement that a member of the tribunal&#151;and it is spelt out that it could be the chairman or any other member&#151;should act as a mediator when judicial proceedings have been brought before the tribunal. The only qualification that makes any more sense of this mistaken proposal is that regulations on this point, and this point alone, must be made after consultation with ACAS. Suddenly, the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act brings in ACAS.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0008.htm_para3">
<p><a name="08020431000315">It was said to me when I was considering this deep problem, that that paragraph in the schedule is a follow up to Section 24 of the 2007 Act on mediation. That is quite true, but it makes a particular provision about employment tribunals:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08020431000398">&#147;Employment tribunal procedure regulations may include provision enabling practice directions to provide for members to act as mediators in relation to disputed matters in a case that is the subject of proceedings&#148;.</p>

<a name="80204-gc0008.htm_para4">
<p><a name="08020431000316">The final twist in the skein is made by Section 7B(3), which states that once a member has begun to act as a mediator in relation to a disputed matter in a case that is subject to proceedings, the member may decide matters in the case only with the consent of the parties. The difference between that and Amendment No. 16 is that we say that once a member who is there to carry out judicial functions has taken the role of mediator, he or she should not sit in the subsequent proceedings when the tribunal considers the matter. In view of what my noble friend has said, I notice that it is twenty-five minutes past the hour. I wish to move Amendment No. 16, with a footnote that if we come back to this on Report&#151;which we really should because here is a serious innovation to the role of members of employment tribunals&#151;it would have to be with proper drafting that changed the new Section 7B inserted by the 2007 Act. I beg to move.</p>

It seems to me that what the noble Lord is saying is eminently sensible. I fail to see how someone who has mediated in any dispute can later be part of a judicial process that arises from it. In fact, one of the first things that we were taught in the excellent course arranged by CEDR was to explain that anything that you heard at a mediation was entirely private, it would not be passed on or made use of in any way whatever and everything was, as they put it, entirely without prejudice.

No doubt we will give the Minister a little time to ponder these matters between now and the next stage. The noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, says that he will certainly bring this back on Report, and there might be other ways of discussing it again in Committee, since we are being curtailed in the amount of time that we can have on it this evening.

The Government believe that this amendment is unnecessary. The Tribunals Service is presently trialling judicial mediation of employment disputes that would otherwise become the subject of an employment tribunal hearing. That trial will be carefully evaluated before any decision is made on whether to continue this activity. In the trial, no judge who has been involved in mediation is then able to play any part in the determination of the case should mediation not succeed.</p>

I asked the noble Lord, Lord Henley, a question with due consideration. To act in a judicial capacity is totally different from acting as a mediator. Once you have acted as a mediator, you have taken positions on the arguments. It is incomprehensible to me to understand why the Government would resist, as I have suggested&#151;I would redraft, of course&#151;an amendment to the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.</p>

<p><a name="08020431000323">I said earlier today that that Act was put forward by the Ministry of Justice without adequate knowledge of employment tribunal matters. It now turns out that the department put it forward without understanding the most basic rule of justice: someone who is to act in a judicial capacity should not have acted in the case before, hearing, as the noble Lord said, matters in private and taking positions. The position is not even as a conciliator, it is as a mediator. The two are totally opposed in their conceptual categories.</p>

<p><a name="08020431000324">The consent of the parties is neither here nor there.

I would very much like the Committee to adjourn and consider the matter when we come back, if that is allowed. But if my noble friend opposes that, I shall have no alternative but to beg leave to withdraw the amendment. But I would ask the Government to think about this again. Would they throw aside what I believe has the broad support of the Committee? Would the Minister perhaps go as far as one single crumb of comfort and say, &#147;Yes, we will have another look at it, even though paragraph 42 of Schedule 8 to that curious statute of 2007 says that it should work in this way&#148;? I do not know whether my noble friend can give us any comfort on the matter or whether the Government will dig in their heels on the most fundamental issue of normal British justice; not just British justice, but I do not know of a writing anywhere in the world that would suggest that a judge could act as a mediator in private before proceedings begin. If my noble friend cannot offer any crumb at all, this obviously is something to which the House will have to come back on Report. It is the most extraordinary twist and turn in regard to employment tribunals that I have ever imagined. I had no idea earlier today that we would reach this point.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"><a name="08020413000019">Before these powers are introduced it is important that effective oversight arrangements are in place. On 26 July 2007, therefore, I announced the publication of a consultation document on matters related to the implementation of measures in the Police and Justice Act 2006 to extend the Independent Police Complaints Commission&#146;s jurisdiction to cover the Border and Immigration Agency&#146;s enforcement functions. I wish to inform the House that I am publishing today an analysis of responses; a government policy statement setting out the Government&#146;s consideration of issues raised by respondents; and regulations, subject to negative resolution, which will extend the Independent Police Complaints Commission&#146;s jurisdiction in this regard. Copies of these regulations and documents have been placed in the House Library.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"><a name="08020413000020">The IPCC will provide independent oversight of the most serious complaints, incidents and misconduct matters where police powers are used by immigration officers and officials. This oversight will be similar to that which the IPCC provides for the police and other law enforcement bodies such as Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs and the Serious Organised Crime Agency.</p>

<a name="80204-wms0001.htm_para3">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"><a name="08020413000021">The new chief inspector created by the UK Borders Act 2007 will monitor the efficiency and effectiveness of the agency&#146;s processes and practices as a whole. The IPCC will look at individual cases. The chief inspector will work closely with the IPCC to ensure comprehensive independent external scrutiny of our activities. The IPCC already oversees the work of HM Revenue and Customs colleagues, a number of whom will be joining the UK Border Agency.</p>

<a name="80204-wms0001.htm_para4">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"><a name="08020413000022">I welcome this new oversight and would like to inform the House that similar oversight provisions are currently being developed for Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="80204-wms0001.htm_para5">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"><a name="08020413000024">I am today announcing an independent review of the Civil Justice Council in line with Cabinet Office Guidance for Public Bodies. The Civil Justice Council was established in 1998 and has never been reviewed formally. The review is a timely opportunity to illustrate publicly the considerable achievements of the council and to help it develop further. The review will be conducted by Dr Jonathan Spencer CB and will seek the views of the members, those who work with the council and the end users of the civil justice system.</p>

<a name="80204-wms0001.htm_para6">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"><a name="08020413000025">The review will examine in particular:</p>
the council&#146;s strengths and weaknesses, the extent to which it has established itself as an authoritative influence in the civil justice world, the extent to which it has chosen important issues to address; and its success in doing so;the effectiveness of its chosen ways of working, including the council itself, its committees and the secretariat, and including the way in which it works and communicates with other organisations; andthe ways in which the council and its work should be adjusted, if at all, to maximise its effectiveness in the future.
<a name="80204-wms0001.htm_para7">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"><a name="08020413000026">The review is due to be complete in spring 2008.</p>

<a name="08020413000027"><b><a name="80204-wms0001.htm_spmin2"><a name="08020413000644">The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Department for Communities and Local Government (Hazel Blears) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80204-wms0001.htm_para8">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"><a name="08020413000028">Today I am publishing the Government&#146;s response to the Commission on Integration and Cohesion. Copies of the response have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

<a name="80204-wms0001.htm_para9">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"><a name="08020413000029">In August 2006 the Government asked Darra Singh, the chief executive of Ealing Council, to chair a commission examining the issues of integration and cohesion&#151;how, in the light of concerns about communities living &#147;parallel lives&#148;, of changing patterns of migration, and of new technologies transforming the way people interact with each other, the Government can help build strong communities where neighbours feel at ease, share a sense of belonging, and have the opportunity to work together to shape the future of the place where they live.</p>

<a name="80204-wms0001.htm_para10">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"><a name="08020413000030">In June 2007, the commission delivered a serious and ambitious report based on in-depth consultation. It set out practical proposals for building cohesion and integration at a local level and contained a number of specific recommendations for government.  


<notus-date day="4" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS65"><b>4 Feb 2008 : Column WS65</b><br /> <br /></columnNum></p>

<a name="80204-wms0001.htm_para11">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"><a name="08020413000031">The report has already influenced a range of policies, changing the debate about how best to bring people of different backgrounds together and empower them to influence the decisions which affect their lives.</p>

<a name="80204-wms0001.htm_para12">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"><a name="08020413000032">Today, I am pleased to set out in detail my response to all 57 of the commission&#146;s recommendations&#151;what we have already done, what we will do in the future and how we will further develop the commission's ideas.</p>

<a name="80204-wms0001.htm_para13">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"><a name="08020413000033">It sets out a new clarity on, and commitment to, delivering cohesive and integrated communities, backed by increased investment in cohesion of some &#163;50 million over the next three years, and a new public service agreement to drive practical action across government.</p>

<a name="80204-wms0001.htm_para14">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"><a name="08020413000034">At the heart of the Government&#146;s approach, like the commission&#146;s, is the principle that cohesion can only be understood and built locally. Central government&#146;s role is to set the national framework within which local authorities and their partners can deliver improvements to cohesion.</p>

<a name="80204-wms0001.htm_para15">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"><a name="08020413000035">Our response sets out how we will support this local delivery through six key principles:</p>
 1. a move away from a &#147;one size fits all&#148; approach; 2. mainstreaming of cohesion into wider policy areas; 3. a national framework for local support and guidance, including establishing specialist cohesion teams to provide support to local authorities facing cohesion challenges and giving local authorities a tool to assess the impact their planned activities will have on cohesion;4. integration of new migrants and existing communities, starting with new guidance for local authorities on developing information packs for migrants; 5. building positive relationships; to this end we are today also publishing a consultation on guidance for funders, which encourages local authorities to consider how funding can be better used to support greater interaction; and6. sharing lessons about what works.
<a name="80204-wms0001.htm_para16">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"><a name="08020413000036">I am grateful to Darra Singh and his commissioners for their hard work. With this response the Government are demonstrating their commitment to maintaining the momentum the report has created and helping build stronger communities where all individuals, no matter what their background, feel a sense of shared belonging, and can work with their neighbours to shape a better future for the place where they live.</p>

We announced last March that over 800 schools and over 150 colleges would be in the first consortia offering 14 to 19 diplomas from September 2008.</p>

We can now announce that two-thirds of all secondary schools and three-quarters of colleges in England have applied to offer these five new diplomas, plus the first five diplomas, as part of consortia from September 2009.</p>

<a name="80204-wms0001.htm_para20">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"><a name="08020413000041">These figures show that diplomas are proving a popular choice for schools and colleges. Diplomas will offer learners a new route into further and higher education as well as into skilled work. In December, the independent organisation UCAS announced that the points value of the advanced diploma will be the same as that awarded for three and a half A-levels.</p>

<a name="08020413000610"><b><a name="80204-wms0002.htm_spmin1"><a name="08020413000647">The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath):</b> The Justice and Home Affairs Informal Council was held on 25 and 26 January 2008 in Ljubljana. My right honourable and noble friend the Attorney-General (Baroness Scotland), my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Maria Eagle), and my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Meg Hillier), attended on behalf of the United Kingdom. Since it was an informal council, no formal decisions were taken. The following main issues were discussed:</p>

<a name="80204-wms0002.htm_para20">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_586"><a name="08020413000611">The first home affairs session opened with a report from the presidency on the work of the Future Group on EU Home Affairs   Those not on the group were invited to give their views.  All supported the work under way, stressing the need to prioritise data sharing, both within the EU and co-operation with third countries.  In relation to other subject areas, there were suggestions that work might look at the further harmonisation of rules to manage the Schengen area, tighter border controls, measures to bring terrorists to justice and the strengthening of action in the area of civil protection and disaster response. Several delegations also raised the need to ensure that the work of the Home Affairs Group and that of the Justice Future Group were linked more closely.  The new European Parliament&#146;s civil liberties, justice and home affairs (LIBE) president, G&#233;rard Deprez, gave a general introduction to the approach of LIBE, stressing its concern for privacy and individual rights.</p>

<a name="80204-wms0002.htm_para21">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_587"><a name="08020413000612">The presidency concluded that interoperability of databases and the needs of law enforcement should drive future EU policy on data sharing, coupled with thorough data protection. On migration, an integrated approach to management was needed based on Frontex (the EU&#146;s border agency), operating across land and sea borders. Links with external policy should be

In all these areas the EU should analyse what it already had, and then look at the next steps.  The presidency noted that a final report should be prepared under the incoming French presidency, with a view to contributing to the successor to the Hague JHA work programme.</p>

<a name="80204-wms0002.htm_para22">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_588"><a name="08020413000613">The second session discussed practical co-operation in the field of asylum, with the presidency stressing the need for joint practical projects and asking for views on a European Support Office (ESO) which would oversee all forms of co-operation between member states on the common European asylum system. The UK welcomed practical co-operation based on an assessment of why people moved. The Commission said that its proposals on the second stage of the common European asylum system were due in July and work on an ESO should start with a feasibility study.  All member states agreed that practical co-operation should be strengthened, and that there was a need for more uniform country-of-origin information.  All member states also supported the ESO, but views differed as to its role and staffing.  The presidency concluded that work to unify the interpretation of existing instruments, common training, and shared interpretation pool should continue. There was wide support for an ESO, but further work was needed on its tasks and financing. The presidency looked forward to the Commission&#146;s ESO study. The council would be invited to agree conclusions on this at a future session.</p>

<a name="80204-wms0002.htm_para23">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_589"><a name="08020413000614">The home affairs session closed the official programme with a working lunch, during which Ministers considered the timetable for the implementation of the second generation of the Schengen information system (SIS II).  The Commission and presidency argued that member states had to set and commit to a real timetable for SIS II. More time for testing was needed, but a formal decision had to be taken at the February JHA council. Ministers agreed with a presidency proposal to remodel the oversight of the SIS II project on similar grounds to that used for SISOne4All, setting up a ministerial-level steering group of various member states.</p>

<a name="80204-wms0002.htm_para24">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_590"><a name="08020413000615">Ministers also had an exchange of views on the Commission's proposal on the use of the passenger name records (PNR) for law enforcement purposes. The Commission stressed the need to prevent terrorism, but protect the privacy and rights of honest travellers. At the presidency&#146;s request, the Government presented the UK's experience of using PNR data, with concrete examples of their use, proportionality and success, with the conclusion that they should be used to detect all forms of crime.  While generally favouring the proposal, member states noted that it raised difficult technical and substantive issues, including concerns about data protection.  The presidency concluded that there was general support for the proposal, subject to further work on the scope and to ensure data protection. </p>

The UK has not opted in to either proposal. In response to a question from the presidency, a majority of Ministers agreed that the recently agreed text on the Hague convention and protocol on maintenance obligations should be signed and ratified as soon as possible, reflecting the UK's position. Further discussions took place on the desirability of eliminating obstacles to the recognition and enforcement of maintenance decisions from other member states. On Rome III, a consensus view emerged that spouses ought to be able to choose the competent jurisdiction and law applicable to their divorce.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_603"><a name="08020413000630">Alongside our reconsideration of the year 3 scheme, the Government have reconsidered the payments for years 1 and 2 of LABGI, which were made on the basis of a number of Valuation Office Agency rateable value &#147;change codes&#148;. We have taken the view that there are a number of Valuation Office Agency change codes that have not previously been used in LABGI calculations, which could contain elements of business growth. In light of this, and to avoid the additional delay and uncertainty caused by further legal challenge, the Government propose to reward authorities on the basis of a wider set of codes than has so far been the case for years 1 and 2. I will set out the details shortly.</p>
