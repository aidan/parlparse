<a name="50307-01_head0"></a><h3 align=center>EU Constitutional Treaty: Explanatory Documents</h3>

<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="50307-01_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Blackwell </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>How they will ensure that factual information on the European Union, distributed to the public from public funds in advance of the referendum on the European constitution, is unbiased.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="50307-01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, there are existing guidelines and procedures which civil servants must follow in communicating with the public which ensure that information provided is objective, explanatory and not biased. The same guidelines also apply to all work that external agencies undertake under contract with government departments. Civil servants will, of course, adhere to any future guidance that is produced in advance of the referendum on the EU Constitutional Treaty.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="50307-01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Blackwell: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for his response but confess that I am not fully satisfied. Does he accept that, even given the trust we have in our civil servants, this is an area where it is very difficult for people to produce a purely factual explanation of the European Constitution without portraying some of their views in the document? Given that, will the noble Lord consider that while the Government are entitled to publish White Papers, for public information&#151;for leaflets and pamphlets distributed at large&#151;it might be sensible to set up a committee of senior Cross-Bench Members to ensure that the content is fair and properly represents both sides of the argument?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="50307-01_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, knowing that this Question would be asked today, I reread the document, and the shorter document. Aside from my fear of dropping them on my foot, in general I think it would be hard to fault their factual quality. They provide solid background information and, I think on the most objective reading, could cause no one to take exception.
</p>

<a name="50307-01_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Lea of Crondall: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that an exercise such as this, relating to the <br>&nbsp;<br>

rules of any organisation, whether it is the MCC or the TUC, requires some reasons to be given for the exercise being carried out? That must be part of what any reasonable person would call factual information. If the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, does not see that as factual information, it means that he does not really want factual information. He would rather that the information was given only by the Rothermere press, the Murdoch press and the <i>Telegraph</i> group while the rest of the people were left in ignorance.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="50307-01_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, it is vital that the information provided is widely disseminated, objective and has solid reasoning behind it. Otherwise, why would we be engaged in this exercise at all? It is extremely important that nobody should feel, in trying to achieve balance, that they were being driven into silence. I hope that our broadcast media, let alone our print media, feel that.
</p>

<a name="50307-01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has gone to great lengths at all levels, with legal advisers to HM Treasury and the Cabinet Office, to meet the criteria that are set for the civil servants. I believe that they have done so.

<a name="50307-01_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, does the noble Lord recall Ministers saying the other day that not a penny would be spent on pro-constitution propaganda in this country by the European Commission? The European Commission is, of course, using taxpayers&#039; money&#151;that is where it eventually comes from&#151;yet it seems that it is continuing to spend money in this country, directly and indirectly. How will this be stopped? How will the Ministers&#039; undertaking be fulfilled? Will all the institutions that receive these very large sums have to pay them back?
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="50307-01_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, in advance of the referendum process, I have no doubt that all sorts of bodies will campaign for what they believe is right. Noble Lords on the opposition Benches are at the forefront of doing so. The Government have no wish to see any money spent inappropriately. The full list of legitimate expenditures during the course of the referendum campaign&#151;the purposes for which money can be spent during the campaign&#151;have been set out very clearly in the definition of referendum expenses. That will have to be the template with which the independent organisations that argue for a &quot;Yes&quot; or a &quot;No&quot; vote will have to proceed.

</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="50307-01_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Maclennan of Rogart: </b>   My Lords, will the noble Lord acknowledge that the facts of the European Union, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_473"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 473</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

like all facts, are, by definition, true, and that the defensive Question of the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, reveals fear of those truths? The big truths about the Union are that its members, whether new or long standing, enjoy prosperity and more security, and are more capable of exercising beneficent influence when they act together than when they stand alone.
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="50307-01_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I agree with the noble Lord. Not only have we managed to achieve those benefits but I believe we have achieved them while remaining independent nation states. The Government&#039;s position throughout the process will be to ensure that we are a successful nation state. That is our great strength in Europe, and the combination of European nation states is the great and additional strength that we enjoy.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="50307-01_spnew17"></a><b> Lord Hannay of Chiswick: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister not agree that all the evidence is that the people of this country are very far from having enough information yet to make an informed choice? Does he therefore agree that it is the duty of the Government to fill that gap? Will he reject the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, that civil servants are incapable of writing objective prose?
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="50307-01_spnew18"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I hope that I have said that I believe that the civil servants have written extremely objective documents. It is important that they should do so because it is plain from most of the polling evidence that people remain, unfortunately, without a lot of key information, and we have to fill that gap in information and knowledge. The brief guide to the European Union&#151;the smaller document&#151;produces a rather straightforward account of the European Union and of the benefits that we have received from membership, all of which I fully accept are key facts in people&#039;s decisions.

<a name="50307-01_spnew22"></a><b> Lord Barnett: </b>   My Lords, would my noble friend join with me in welcoming all unbiased reports on the European Union constitution in due course? Does he think it would be helpful if everyone issuing statements and reports should indicate that they have read all 511   pages of the treaty and 493 pages of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Explanatory Notes?
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="50307-01_spnew23"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, if anybody made such a declaration I would probably be the first to disbelieve them.

The Civil Service has done us proud in the work that it has done. Of course, after that there will be strongly held views: people will engage in the most <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>Why they have been unable to inform members of the public who have inquired the reason for the repeal of the Treason Act 1795 during the passage of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="50307-01_spmin1"></a><b>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </b>  My Lords, neither the records of the relevant debates in <i>Hansard</i> during the passage of the Crime and Disorder Bill nor Bill papers held in the Home Office explain fully why the 1795 Act was repealed in its entirety. It is, however, evident from the <i>Hansard </i>records that the repeal was considered to be a necessary consequence of the decision to repeal the death penalty for treason.
</p>

<a name="50307-01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>The substantive offences that were contained in the 1795 Act are covered by other parts of the criminal law including the Treason Act 1351 relating to conspiracy and incitement.

<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="50307-02_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Tebbit: </b>   My Lords, what on earth has been going on in the Home Office? Does the Minister recollect that on 16 November last, she told me in a Written Answer that the 1795 Act was still in force and subsequently had to correct that? Now her officials have written to members of the public saying that they have no idea why the 1795 Act was repealed. It seems that they are incapable of going to the Library, finding the <i>Official Report</i> for 19 March 1998 and reading in it the speeches made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, and Lord Williams of Mostyn, who seemed to have some idea why he was advocating the Act&#039;s repeal.
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="50307-02_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, of course, I apologise for the fact that the 1795 Act was incorrectly referred to. I remind noble Lords that it is not every day that the 1300 Act, the 1870 Act or those other Acts are looked at. There was a mistake. I humbly ask the House&#039;s pardon for this terrible mistake that was made by me through that dreadful, inaccurate Answer.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="50307-02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Maclennan of Rogart: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister recognise that the 1795 Act was the terrorism Act of its day? It took rather a long time to repeal something that was inspired by public hysteria about the threat of the French and introduced by a repressive Conservative administration under William Pitt the Younger.
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="50307-02_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, some might so describe it, but I could not possibly comment. However, the Treason Act 1795 was looked at again in <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="50307-02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Mackay of Clashfern: </b>   My Lords, was the 1351 Act one that applied to the United Kingdom? If not, I wonder why it should be an important part of the law of the United Kingdom today.
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="50307-02_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, we are grateful that that Act was followed by a number of other Acts that sought to bring it into force. To help your Lordships, there was the Treason Act 1351, the   Treason Act 1702, the Treason Act 1842 and the Treason and Felony Act 1848, which all amplified our splendid common law offence, so Scotland is safe.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="50307-02_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </b>   My Lords, I suppose that this could not possibly have anything to do with the fact that European Union Commissioners affirm an oath of allegiance to the European Union. If they do so, they swear allegiance to somebody other than Her Majesty the Queen, which I understand would in itself be treasonable.
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>

</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_2"></a>Whether the <i>New Vision for Adult Social Care</i> will include a commitment to increase access to low-level social care, such as help with shopping and simple household tasks.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="50307-02_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health  (Lord Warner): </b>  My Lords, my ministerial colleague, Stephen Ladyman, announced last August that we would be developing a Green Paper on the future of adult social care. I expect the Green Paper to be published shortly. The Government announced on 3 March an extra &#163;60 million for partnerships for older people projects. They will provide a range of schemes that maintain and enhance the independence of older people.
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="50307-02_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Greengross: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister very much for that reply and I look forward with interest to the Green Paper. I hope that it will cover all the various things that he mentioned. In particular, I would like to draw his attention to the importance of highlighting the need for people to have low-level social care. To retain independence it is often the small tasks&#151;shopping or, in health terms, nail cutting, tasks involving household gadgets or changing lightbulbs, which involve <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_476"></a>

safety&#151;that can make all the difference between someone remaining independent or having to go far too early into expensive long-term care.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="50307-02_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, we want to ensure that there is a proper balance between prevention and other activities in the area of intensive care support. What services a person needs to allow him or her to live happily and safely in their own home rather than end up in hospital or a care home are specific to each individual, as I think the noble Baroness is saying. I accept that tasks such as shopping and cleaning can enhance a person&#039;s well-being, improve their quality of life and avoid social exclusion. Through the Green Paper we want to try to encourage councils to give due balance to those issues.
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="50307-02_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </b>   My Lords, is it not a fact that local authorities have usually supplied these services for people and that that has worked well, and   that a great many voluntary bodies have been involved? By using volunteers, particularly older volunteers, one is giving them an occupation which in itself can be beneficial. Perhaps the most useful social service of all has been our freedom passes to get us around because that keeps people mobile longer than anything.
</p>




<p><a name="st_38"></a>
<a name="50307-02_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I am sure that everyone in the House pays tribute to the Mayor of London and his freedom passes, which I am sure have benefited a number of Members of this House. I also pay tribute to the work done by voluntary organisations. The private sector, as well as the public sector, has also provided some of the support services that are needed by older people.
</p>




<p><a name="st_39"></a>
<a name="50307-02_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </b>   My Lords, will the Green Paper include among those who might be eligible for reimbursement members of an individual&#039;s own family if they are able to provide lower-level social care? I hope that he can answer that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="50307-02_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I am afraid that the noble Baroness will have to wait for the Green Paper to be published. I am not at liberty to anticipate that. Eligibility criteria for adult social care are a matter to be determined by local councils.
</p>




<p><a name="st_41"></a>
<a name="50307-02_spmin1"></a><b>The Lord Bishop of Portsmouth:</b>  My Lords, the noble Baroness&#039;s Question would have been dear to the heart of the late Lord Sheppard, who was a former Member of these Benches. Do the Government agree that the <i>New Vision for</i> <i>Adult</i> <i>Social</i> <i>Care</i> should lead us to think in terms not just of that rather clich&#233;d expression &quot;person-centred care&quot; but of person, family and community-centred care? I return to the recent supplementary on the voluntary sector, which is under-resourced and having difficulty in recruiting. However, I would like to instance a successful example of the voluntary sector; namely, the church-sponsored initiative, the voluntary care group advisory service in Hampshire.
</p>




<p><a name="st_42"></a>
<a name="50307-02_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I am sure the whole House will want to pay tribute to the contribution that <br>&nbsp;<br>

I pay tribute to the service to which the right reverend Prelate drew attention. However, there are many other areas in which the Government have taken initiatives such as direct payments where elderly people themselves can make the decisions about the kind of support that they wish to acquire.

<a name="50307-02_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend referred to the importance of integration of services across various agencies and the voluntary sector.

Will he therefore ensure that the <i>New</i> <i>Vision for Adult Social Care</i> emphasises help with social engagement and encourages funding both for the statutory and voluntary sectors, as the right reverend Prelate has already mentioned, rather than what we have seen thus far, which emphasises help largely for those who are already very dependent?
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="50307-03_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, as I said in my initial reply, I am sure that the Green Paper will tackle the wide range of services that older people need to live fulfilling and independent lives.

However, one that stands out is the Asian Elders Project in Barnet which helps to support independent living, and a number of others which help   people to maintain their independence through physical exercise.

<a name="50307-03_spmin0"></a><b>The Countess of Mar:</b>  My Lords, is it not a sad reflection on society that we are having to depend on government and organisations to provide services such as shopping and replacing light bulbs which should be provided either by relatives or by good neighbours?

</p>




<p><a name="st_51"></a>
<a name="50307-03_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, that is a little unfair to the many people up and down the country in all kinds of families who give a huge amount of support to their families and older relatives. Carers are a good example of that. I pay tribute to the work that they do in looking after older people and providing support in that regard. The Government have given support through direct payments, the &#163;325 million for the Carers Grant and in other areas to support families as they look after members of an increasingly ageing population.

<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_3"></a>What response they have received to their representations to NATO allies on members&#039; contributions of personnel and material to allied forces in Afghanistan.

<p><a name="st_54"></a>
<a name="50307-03_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, following the informal   meeting of NATO defence Ministers on 9 and 10 February, NATO announced that the package of   resources needed for stage 2 of the planned expansion of the International Security Assistance Force in   Afghanistan has been completed. Italy, Spain, Lithuania and the US are providing the core resources.
</p>




<p><a name="st_55"></a>
<a name="50307-03_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Astor of Hever: </b>   My Lords, I welcome that reply although much remains to be done, not least providing security ahead of the parliamentary elections. Given the UN&#039;s declaration that Afghanistan is in danger of   becoming a narcotic state, should NATO, and specifically Britain, with responsibility to sort this out not now be more aggressive in the vital task of eliminating poppy crops?
</p>




<p><a name="st_56"></a>
<a name="50307-03_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, we are very aware of the danger of the development of a narco-state. NATO <br>&nbsp;<br>

is acting within ISAF&#039;s mandate to take very resolute action against the production and the trafficking of narcotics. The noble Lord, Lord Astor, asked what the UK specifically was doing. The UK is providing advice and funding to the Afghans on eradication. For instance, we have helped them set up a central planning cell which will decide what poppy fields to target, taking into account the density of the cultivation, the access to alternative livelihoods for farmers and the need to undermine local warlords who control cultivation in particular areas.
</p>




<p><a name="st_57"></a>
<a name="50307-03_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Tomlinson: </b>   My Lords, would my noble friend agree with me if I suggested that we are long since past the time when we should be worried about the development of a narco-economy? It is there; the report we received last week indicated that 50 per cent of the gross national product of Afghanistan is now coming from narcotic crops. Does she further agree that that is now a matter of great urgency for this country, because we are at the end of the supply route and much of that narcotic comes into this country illegally, and that we must now take urgent action in this area?
</p>




<p><a name="st_58"></a>
<a name="50307-03_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, I agree with my noble friend that urgent action is required. That is why the UK fully supports the 2005 Afghan counter-narcotics implementation plan. My noble friend will know that   that means building up institutions, having a   proper information campaign, assisting the development of alternative livelihoods&#151;it is no use talking about eradication unless we give people an alternative livelihood&#151;strengthening interdiction and law enforcement, supporting the criminal justice system and taking action on eradication.
</p>




<p><a name="st_59"></a>
<a name="50307-03_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Redesdale: </b>   My Lords, how do the Government plan to carry that out? What percentage of Afghanistan is controlled by ISAF and the central government and what percentage is patrolled and controlled not by them but by warlords who are pushing the production of opium?
</p>




<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="50307-03_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, as the noble Lord will know, ISAF&#039;s control was mainly in Kabul for the first year or so after the conflict. It has now spread to the   north and west of the country, which was stage 1. Stage 2, to which I referred in my Answer to the noble Lord, Lord Astor, involves our setting up the west as an ISAF area where forces under ISAF will be able to assist the provincial reconstruction teams, NGOs and non-military personnel that are trying to ensure that the country is reconstructed. Stage 3 will concern the far more worrying areas in the south and east.
</p>




<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="50307-03_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Marlesford: </b>   My Lords, do the Government recognise the case for decriminalising all drugs on the basis that the number of extra people who would die from drug abuse might well be smaller than the number of those who die from drug-related crime? It would also cut the cash flow of organised crime, and <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 480</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

much street crime&#151;probably by about 90 per cent at a stroke. It would also provide a legal basis for poppy growers in Afghanistan.
</p>




<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="50307-03_spnew14"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, that is wide of the Question about provincial reconstruction teams and military operations in Afghanistan. I am sure that, if he wishes, the noble Lord can table a Question on our domestic policy, which has been made clear many times from this Dispatch Box.
</p>




<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="50307-03_spmin1"></a><b>The Earl of Sandwich:</b>  My Lords, does the Minister remember that there was some ambiguity about the objectives of the provincial reconstruction teams and whether they were military or humanitarian forces? Can she confirm that this has been clarified and standardised under the NATO mandate?
</p>




<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="50307-03_spnew15"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, I remember those early discussions about whether provincial reconstruction teams were civilian or military. I particularly remember the discussions we had in this House about the relationship between the military within the reconstruction teams and NGOs. I hope that that has now been clarified. I understand that there is a good relationship between the UK-led teams and NGOs and construction teams.
</p>




<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="50307-03_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Garden: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister think that the UK should be doing more? Seven of our allies are providing bigger contributions to ISAF, including Belgium, Italy and Spain. Will she convey the thanks of the UK Government to France and Germany, which continue to provide more than a quarter of the total assets for ISAF?
</p>




<p><a name="st_66"></a>
<a name="50307-03_spnew17"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, we contribute a military force of more than 600 people to ISAF. We also have six GR7 Harrier aircraft based at Kandahar airport that assist ISAF and the coalition forces in Afghanistan. We are committed to helping the Afghan Government to provide their own security because building up Afghanistan&#039;s national army and police force is the most important part of security.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>Page 3, line 26, leave out &quot;on the balance of probabilities&quot; and insert &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>




<p><a name="st_76"></a>The noble Lord said: As the Minister will remember, this issue was debated last Thursday. However, as this   amendment is tabled for today, and a number of other amendments are grouped with it, I shall move the amendment and speak to it briefly, but I shall withdraw it at the appropriate stage.
</p>

<a name="50307-04_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>We are dealing with the power of the Secretary of State to make orders that derogate from the liberty of the individual. The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor has said that they are the gravest orders and that they involve, at least, house arrest.

</p>

<a name="50307-04_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>The Bill as it now stands allows the Secretary of State to make such an order, imposing an obligation that is incompatible with Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights, if he is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that an individual is or has been involved in terrorism-related activities. I believe, as I said on Thursday, that that standard of proof is too low. Where the Secretary of State is minded to make an order which, it is accepted, is intended to deprive the individual of his liberty in the circumstances we discussed, he should at least be required to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt&#151;namely, on the criminal standard of proof&#151;prior to making that order.
</p>

<a name="50307-04_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>As I say, there is no purpose in repeating everything that was said on the last occasion, but it is important to remind the Committee that we are dealing with the most serious orders which it is intended that the Secretary of State should be able to make. On that occasion I realised that the majority of those on both Front Benches, while accepting that there should be a clause which puts the burden of proof on the Home Secretary, nevertheless said that the standard of proof should be on the basis of the balance of probabilities. Therefore, it would be pointless to pursue an amendment which was bound to fail if that was the view of other Members of the Committee.
</p>

<a name="50307-04_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>At least two noble Lords on the government Benches begged me not to withdraw the amendment at that stage because they felt, like myself, that the criminal burden of proof is the appropriate burden of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_483"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 483</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

proof for such an order. All I need say at this moment is that we debated the matter last Thursday. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_77"></a>
<a name="50307-04_spmin0"></a><b>The Earl of Onslow:</b>  My name is also on the amendment. Before we came into the Chamber I was nobbled by a Whip who said to me, &quot;You are not to talk for too long&quot;. When I saw my name on the amendment I just thought to myself that you should not have to talk for too long in order to say that it is completely wrong to take away the liberty of a subject and lock him up on the balance of probabilities. I shall now sit down.
</p>




<p><a name="st_78"></a>
<a name="50307-04_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Lloyd of Berwick: </b>   I support as strongly as I can   the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle. The difficulty is that we are concerned with what are supposed to be civil proceedings. I do not think that that is how they will seem to the suspect who is made subject to these proceedings. The only analogy in the civil law that I can think of&#151;I have mentioned this already&#151;is the non-molestation order in domestic proceedings and the anti-social behaviour order. One only has to mention those orders to see how many million miles they are away from what is proposed under Clause 2.
</p>

<a name="50307-04_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>If those were in truth and in reality civil proceedings, of course the balance of probabilities would be the right burden of proof. But here the consequences, as is accepted, are the deprivation of liberty, which is a criminal and not a civil sanction. It follows to my mind that the correct burden of proof, whether it be applied to the Secretary of State or the judge, is the criminal burden of proof: he should be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt before he makes an order with these consequences. That is why I support the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_79"></a>
<a name="50307-04_spmin1"></a><b>The Lord Bishop of Chester:</b>  It is difficult for those of us who are not legally qualified sometimes to follow all the details of these matters, but the comparison between the civil and the criminal standard arose recently in the Church of England when a new clergy discipline measure went through the Synod and was approved by Parliament.

</p>

<a name="50307-04_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>Members on the Ecclesiastical Committee will know that there was much discussion about the Church moving from the criminal standard to the civil standard in the application of the discipline measure, particularly because for clergy their livelihood and the place where they live would be at stake. There was a strong mood, both in the Synod and to some extent on the Ecclesiastical Committee, to retain the criminal standard for that reason.
</p>

<a name="50307-04_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>The Synod was persuaded to move to the civil standard because it was told that when more serious offences were under consideration the civil standard had a certain flexibility in it so that it would be more difficult to apply the more drastic, as it were, the outcome. That was recognised in the report of the Ecclesiastical Committee when it declared that the measure was &quot;expedient&quot;. The Ecclesiastical Committee, as I recall, said that if a cleric&#039;s livelihood and home were at stake the civil standard approximates to the criminal standard.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_484"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 484</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50307-04_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>Is there flexibility in the application of the term &quot;balance of probabilities&quot;, to recognise the point which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, has just made that if someone&#039;s liberty is at stake, even if the standard is technically a civil standard, in practical purposes it needs at least to approximate to the &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot; standard?
</p>

<a name="50307-04_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>We all agree that it would be much better for these cases to be prosecuted in the criminal courts. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, has often and rightly made that point. But there is a danger of a temptation slipping in. If the standard of proof for a   derogating control order is significantly lower than the criminal standard, will there not be a danger over the years for the authorities to default to it too quickly?
</p>

<a name="50307-04_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>One also has to think&#151;this point was slightly raised at Second Reading, but perhaps not enough&#151;what the actual social impact will be of these orders. Somebody under house arrest will become a <i>cause c&#233;l&#232;bre </i>very easily. If that <i>cause c&#233;l&#232;bre</i> is seen to be under-girded by anything other than a fairly thorough standard of proof&#151;however we express it legally&#151;there is a real danger of that <i>cause c&#233;l&#232;bre</i> being socially disruptive in ways we have not anticipated. So, what does the term &quot;balance of probabilities&quot; mean to a layman like me in relation to the sense of natural justice which has just been referred to?

<p><a name="st_80"></a>
<a name="50307-05_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rees-Mogg: </b>   I should like to support the amendment on these grounds. I think that the Committee would be very anxious to avoid miscarriages of justice arising out of this Bill if it becomes an Act. We know that miscarriages of justice tend to arise when there is a fear of terrorism or in terrorist cases. Regrettably, there are many examples of that in our fairly recent history, even when the criminal standard of proof was being applied. It must logically be the case that there will be more miscarriages of justice if the standard of proof is probability rather than reasonable certainty. Reasonable certainty is therefore preferable. The consequences in terms of the confidence of any community which may be affected by this Bill will depend on miscarriages of justice, which will happen, being kept to a minimum.
</p>




<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="50307-05_spnew1"></a><b> Viscount Bledisloe: </b>   I have great sympathy with the amendment, which seems at first sight to be right. Perhaps the proponents of the group of amendments could explain to me how they resolve the following problem. As I understand it, the Government have resort to control orders only where they cannot bring a prosecution. They cannot bring a prosecution because they dare not reveal to the defendant the evidence that is before them because it is secret or will imperil their sources. If the defendant&#151;as I shall continue to call him&#151;cannot be told the evidence against him, how on earth can any court or any person ever be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as, by definition, they cannot hear what the explanation of the accused persons is because he cannot behold the evidence?
</p>

<a name="50307-05_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>So if you can make a control order only when you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, are you not in fact saying that you can never make a control order? <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_485"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 485</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

The defendant cannot be given the evidence against him. Therefore the court cannot know. There is a lingering doubt that it has the wrong bod and that if only he could be given all the information about him, he would be able to explain it away. I do not see the way out of that dilemma. Does not this apparently very sensible amendment defeat the whole purpose of the Bill?
</p>




<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="50307-05_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   This group of amendments essentially covers three issues. First, it covers the issue that has already been much debated about whether the burden of proof should be on a balance of probabilities or beyond reasonable doubt. Secondly, it covers the question of whether the appropriate test should be a judicial review test or a test on the merits, with the court looking at the Government&#039;s assertion that reasonable suspicion is justified. Thirdly, it covers the stage at which the Director of Public Prosecutions ought to intervene to give a view on whether a prosecution should be brought, perhaps making the control order procedure otiose.
</p>

<a name="50307-05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>I shall start with the last point, which we have already debated. It is crucial that every effort is made to ensure that the prospective subject of the control order can be prosecuted before the reluctant conclusion is reached that, despite the fact that prosecution is not possible, nevertheless the person must be subject to one or other of the restraints in Clause 1.
</p>

<a name="50307-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>We believe that it is crucial that the Director of Public Prosecutions is brought in at the beginning, and that only when the director certifies that a prosecution is not possible can the control order procedure kick in.

</p>

<a name="50307-05_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>There might be two reasons why the Director of Public Prosecutions reaches that conclusion. The first is when the alleged danger is not capable of falling within any definition of any crime on the statute book. The second is when, as the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, said, it would be counter-productive to the national interest to reveal to the prospective subject of the control order either the source of the   intelligence or the manner in which it had been garnered. In those circumstances, one must then reluctantly move to the control order procedure.

</p>

<a name="50307-05_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>I am always extremely nervous about disagreeing with my noble friend Lord Carlisle of Bucklow and, perhaps even more so, with the noble Earl, Lord Onslow. Nevertheless, on this occasion the Opposition reached the conclusion that the balance of probabilities test is more appropriate than the beyond reasonable doubt test.
</p>

<a name="50307-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>I can truncate my submissions by simply asking the Committee to recall the speech that has just been made by the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe. It is precisely for those reasons that it will be almost impossible to impose a control order if the judge is required to find that the case is established beyond reasonable doubt.
</p>

<a name="50307-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>As the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor said last Thursday, control orders are all about prevention. They prevent anticipated adverse action. In those circumstances the authorities are always in the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_486"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 486</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

business of trying to assess risk. The people involved will already have been under surveillance for a long time, and there will come a point when imminent danger is perceived. At that moment the state will intervene.
</p>

<a name="50307-05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>The balance of probabilities test is a much more appropriate way to assess risk than a test of beyond reasonable doubt. I thought long and hard before reaching that conclusion. I do not like that conclusion, but if it is impossible to prosecute somebody who is about to do something very dangerous, we have to accept that the balance of probabilities test is the more appropriate.
</p>

<a name="50307-05_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>I turn to the subject of my Amendment No. 52, which I shall not move in favour of the Liberal Democrat amendments which deal with the same matter. The Government do not have a case for asserting that non-derogating orders ought to be dealt with by judicial review, whereas derogating orders should be dealt with by a merits test. Both sets of orders ought to have the same test, and the judge should be entitled to go beyond the principles of judicial review, and look at the facts on which the Government base their allegation that somebody should be restrained.

</p>

<a name="50307-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>I have another reason for saying that. How can the authorities know at the time they first seek an order whether it will contravene Article 5 of the convention? There is a range of possibilities in Clause 1(3). We do not know what combination of those forms of restraint the Government will go for, and the Government do not know what conclusion the judge will reach about the relationship with Article 5. Therefore, it is common sense   that the procedure should be the same. To decide otherwise would not only be an inappropriate way of confronting the Article 5 issue, but would waste an enormous amount of everybody&#039;s time.

</p>

<a name="50307-05_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>The amendments have four purposes. The first, and perhaps the most important, is to ensure that all control orders are made by judges and not by the Home Secretary. The lead amendment on that is Amendment No. 56. That issue was originally raised in the debate on Thursday but not voted on then because we decided to concentrate votes today and tomorrow. If we succeed today, we shall have to sort out government Amendment No. 1 on Report. We had a full debate on the principle behind this issue on Thursday.
</p>

<a name="50307-05_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>The Bill imposes serious restrictions on liberty which may amount to the actual deprivation of liberty in some cases. It is an essential principle that the Government make the laws about the restriction or deprivation of liberty but it is the courts that apply those laws to individual cases, unless there is a crisis so extreme that the Civil Contingencies Act has to be invoked. The Government have accepted the principle that the decision should be taken in individual cases by judges, not the Home Secretary, for derogating control orders, but not for non-derogating control orders.
</p>

<a name="50307-05_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>We see no logical distinction between the two kinds of order for this purpose. The Government offer only judicial review for the non-derogating control orders. That is inadequate because the court is not making the   order; the court can quash the order only if the procedure is defective or if the Home Secretary&#039;s decision is unreasonable. Indeed, judicial review would probably not meet the test of a fair trial under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights which, we believe, will apply to control orders. That was a brief coverage, but in view of the full debate that we had on Thursday I propose to add nothing further.
<a name="time_6"></a>
<a name="50307-05_time0"></a><h5>3.30 p.m.</h5>

</p>

<a name="50307-05_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>The second purpose of the amendments is to have a single procedure for all control orders. The lead amendment on that is Amendment No. 81. The Government&#039;s new clause, introduced by Amendment No. 80, introduces a new procedure, which we regard as broadly satisfactory, that applies only to the making of derogating control orders. We want to extend the new clause to non-derogating control orders as well.

</p>

<a name="50307-05_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>Amendments Nos. 82 to 85 and 88 to 90 are consequential on that. They are not strictly consequential on the decision that all control orders should be made by a judge, because it would still be possible to have two different procedures, but pretty close to it. If all control orders are to be made by a judge, it is surely right that the same procedures should be followed for both derogating and non-derogating control orders. In particular, there must be an immediate preliminary hearing, as provided for by the new clause,   with a temporary order made by a judge, followed by a full hearing and confirmation, or modification, or revocation, of the temporary order as may be appropriate. That is an essential supplement to the decision that all orders should be made by judges.
</p>

<a name="50307-05_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>The third purpose of these amendments, and the one that I have found the most difficult of all, is to raise the   standard of proof to the balance of probabilities. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_488"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 488</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

The lead amendment on that is Amendment No. 58. I cannot see how anything less than the standard of   balance of probabilities could justify the making of a   control order. If someone, on the balance of probabilities, is involved in terrorist activities, it is reasonable to allow the courts to impose proportionate restrictions, falling short, at any rate, of deprivation of liberty.
</p>

<a name="50307-05_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>As used in the Bill, &quot;reasonable grounds for suspicion&quot; is a weaker test than that of balance of probabilities. It seems plain that we cannot impose a control order on someone who may possibly be involved in terrorist activities but more likely than not is not involved in such activities. That would result in restrictions on the liberty of innocent people, and that is surely the quickest way to alienate the communities from which those people come. We should therefore have the standard of balance of probabilities as the minimum requirement before any control order can be made, not just derogating control orders.
</p>

<a name="50307-05_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>We have very seriously considered the question whether there ought to be a higher standard, at any rate, for derogating control orders, and whether that standard should be basically equivalent to the criminal standard. If we had had more time to debate the matter, I would very much have wished to put it forward for debate; indeed, there is an amendment tabled in our name that would achieve that result. But one must look at where we are now. The Government have put us into a situation where we must move very   quickly indeed. We recognise that there are arguments&#151;those, for instance, put by the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe&#151;for saying that the balance of probabilities should apply throughout.
</p>

<a name="50307-05_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, has made it clear that the Conservative Front Bench does not support a proposal for a higher standard of proof on derogating orders or a standard of proof higher than that of the balance of probabilities. That being so&#151;and I regret that it is the case&#151;I believe that the appropriate course for us to take is not, on this occasion, to press for a higher standard than the balance of probabilities. I regret it, and I am sure that it will cause regret to many members of my own party, but the situation in which we have been placed by the Government&#151;the extreme shortage of time&#151;makes it inappropriate to press amendments on which it is unlikely that we will succeed. I hope that we will in due course have a further debate on a successor to this Bill, following a sunset clause, in which this issue can be redebated.
</p>

<a name="50307-05_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>The fourth and final purpose of our amendments is to make it a requirement on the face of the Bill that no control order can be made where there is a realistic prospect of a successful prosecution. The arguments on that point were put very firmly by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and I do not intend to add to them. It is plain that control orders should be orders of last resort and not of first resort. There are other very important issues in the Bill, which appear later in it and not in this group, such as due process, rule-making, and reviews and sunset clauses. Those will be reached in due course. All the issues in this group were debated to a significant extent on Thursday. I hope that we will <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_489"></a>

be able to speak and vote on those issues relatively quickly and move on to the other important issues later in the Bill.

However, I hope that the noble Lord will forgive me for saying that what he has just said could be interpreted&#151;it would be very ungenerous, I am sure&#151;as possible equivocation. Could he make it absolutely, categorically clear that, speaking from the Liberal Democrat Front Bench, he believes that &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot; would be the appropriate terminology, and that it is simply because of time pressures and expediency that he is settling for the alternative?

<a name="50307-06_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   As our amendments make clear, we believe that, in the circumstances that we now face, the balance of probabilities is the appropriate standard of proof for non-derogating control orders. We would have proposed and supported the higher standard of proof&#151;in effect, the criminal standard of proof&#151;for orders that amount, not to a restriction, but to a deprivation of liberty under Article 5. For the reasons that I have put forward, we do not intend to move such an amendment now, but my belief and that of my party is that that would be the appropriate standard of proof. If we get a chance to debate the Bill again, we will debate that issue separately and, no doubt, move to a separate vote.

<p><a name="st_87"></a>
<a name="50307-06_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   I support my noble friend and wish to make a single point. On the role of the court, under Amendment No. 56, which would replace that of the Home Secretary, I believe that the intensity of pressure on a Home Secretary in exercising the very wide powers under Clause 1, is almost unreasonable for him to have to bear unaided. I think that the public will take the view that the wider the powers given to the Home Secretary under Clause 1 the more he would be expected to exercise them in a way that relieved the public of risk from terrorist activities. That may be unfair but it is a reasonable supposition. Surely, that in turn will put the Home Secretary of the day under enormous strain to be cautious in exercising those powers&#151;cautious, that is, in exercising them rather than in refraining from exercising them. He or she will say, &quot;I have been given by Parliament these unprecedented, enormously wide powers, in the expectation that I will use them to prevent a terrorist attack&quot;. If, therefore, there was such an attack, he or she may well come under an unfair, yet very intense, public outrage that those powers had not been used.
</p>

<a name="50307-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>To give the judges the responsibility of exercising those powers under the non-derogating control orders is not only to give more objectivity to the process&#151;as, plainly, it will do&#151;but also to lend a degree of protection to the Home Secretary of the day in relation to this extraordinary measure. For that reason alone, there must be the best sense in having the court replace the Home Secretary in the exercise of non-derogating control orders.

I sympathise with those who express the view that there ought to be a provision that abandons, in all material particulars, the standard of proof which we require in criminal cases. I do so with some hesitation, but&#151;for the reasons already adduced&#151;we have no alternative to that conclusion.

As I have said, I can see no difference between derogatory orders&#151;I am sorry; I meant to say derogating orders&#151;and non-derogating orders. I cannot see where common sense implies a difference between the two.

I touched on this matter in an intervention last Thursday. I mention it again because the Committee is owed a fuller explanation of the objections to the point that I made.
</p>

<a name="50307-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>Looking at the list in Clause 1(3), I submit that it is impossible to say with anything like complete certainty which orders or combination of orders will be found by the courts to involve an infringement of Article 5. If it had been possible to make that distinction with any certainty, I suspect that Clause 1(3) would have been drafted in an entirely different manner. One would have found a list in Clause 1 of the powers which would involve derogating control orders, while the exercise of other powers would involve only non-derogating control orders. It is wholly unrealistic, and storing up trouble for the Government, to say that the judges should have one role in the case of derogating control orders, but an entirely different role in the case of non-derogating control orders.

<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>As we come to a whole series of votes on such important issues, I should like to remind the House of a quote from Martin Luther King which I am sure is familiar to many on these Benches. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;On some positions, cowardice asks the question &#039;Is it safe?&#039;. Expediency asks the question: &#039;Is it politic?&#039;. And Vanity asks the question: &#039;Is it popular?&#039;. But conscience asks the question &#039;Is it right?&#039;.

<a name="50307-06_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Elton: </b>   I rise to remind noble Lords that the principal amendment is Amendment No. 56, which substitutes a court for the Secretary of State. I also remind noble Lords that it is not just the current Secretary of State, but all the Secretaries of State down the perspective of years for the duration of the Bill, if we do not add a sunset clause. With closer and closer co-operation between the police and Government, the idea of a politician being able to put people that they do not like in prison reminds one of the motto of the National Lottery: &quot;It could be you&quot;.

I am not opposed to control orders, but they have to be made as compliant as possible with our human rights legislation and with common law ideas of natural justice. These amendments go some way towards achieving that.

</p>

<a name="50307-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>It is perfectly legitimate to restrict liberty for the sake of liberty, as the American philosopher John Rawls argued, or as Isaiah Berlin put it more poetically: freedom for the pike is death for the minnow. Sometimes we have to restrict liberty for the sake of liberty, but we should do so in a principled way that is consistent, so far as it possibly can be, with our existing human rights legislation.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_492"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 492</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50307-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>Given that, the decision being made by a judge on an application from the Home Secretary is the right way around. I also agree with the argument put by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, about the Director of Public Prosecutions. I am very pleased that the Home Secretary has committed himself to the view set out in his evidence to the Joint Committee on Human Rights that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;prosecution followed by conviction is far and away by a long way the best  . . . way of achieving what we want to do&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>However, once this Bill becomes an Act and is institutionalised, there is a danger of non-prosecution at a lower standard of proof becoming the default position. That would be a very bad thing. So I am in favour of the argument about the role of the DPP.
</p>

<a name="50307-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>On the burden of proof, as I explained to the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle of Bucklow, in the Cloakroom the other evening, I am as anxious about the standard of proof for derogation orders as for non-derogation ones because the test of &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; seems far too low. Moreover, the point made by the right reverend Prelate that a much lower standard of proof in the form of reasonable suspicion might actually encourage the default position is one that I had not thought of.
</p>

<a name="50307-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>For those reasons, I am keen on the idea of raising the standard of proof for non-derogating orders to the balance of probability and, as other noble Lords have pointed out, I see both types of order as similar in their effect on liberty. After all, my liberty is restricted when I am required to do what I would not otherwise do or required not to do what I otherwise would do. Non-derogating orders restrict my liberty in those respects in just the same way as derogating orders. So if the two kinds of orders are symmetrical, there ought to be the same standard of proof for both.

</p>

<a name="50307-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>Although I am not unsympathetic to the view that the standard should be higher than the criminal standard, I thought that the point made by the noble Viscount, Lord   Bledisloe, was very telling. Rather regretfully, therefore, I will support the idea of the balance of probabilities, but for both types of order.

<a name="50307-07_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   Since I was not able to be present for the Second Reading debate, I should like to make one or two brief points. First, I am no longer a member of the Joint Committee on Human Rights and therefore I am in a good position to say how pleased the House ought to be with the speed with which the committee has been able to produce not one, but two reports under great pressure of time. I am only sorry that that pressure of time has prevented the committee dealing with all the issues. It is plain that it had to concentrate on addressing only the most important, and I agree entirely with what has been reported.
</p>

<a name="50307-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>Secondly, on the standard of proof, the great advantage of a standard based on probability is that the courts have made it quite clear that that is a flexible standard and that the more serious the interference with basic rights and freedoms, the higher the standard will be within the spectrum of probability. Therefore the great advantage of the standard of probability, if it <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_493"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 493</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

is adopted by the House, is that it will give the courts the necessary flexibility so that, for example, where a fairly serious control order is sought, they will no doubt require a higher standard of probability than they would for an order seeking minimal interference.
</p>

<a name="50307-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>I continue to be puzzled by the Government&#039;s approach to judicial involvement. I cannot understand why, if a warrant is needed from a magistrate merely to search premises or papers&#151;that is often a ritual, but it is an important safeguard&#151;the Government have resisted the notion of a similar form of judicial control from the outset.

</p>

<a name="50307-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>Last but not least, I have enormous respect for Sir   John Stevens, the retiring Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, but I very much regret the headline in yesterday&#039;s <i>News of the World</i> over an article:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;Forget human rights  . . . kick out the fanatics&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>Indeed, one or two passages in the piece surprised me, given my respect for Sir John. He suggested, for example, that the Law Lords had instructed that the Belmarsh detainees should be released immediately. That is just wrong because it was not within their remit. More importantly, however, he suggested that there is a human rights lobby that is somehow acting against the interests of the people of this country. I am sure that that is not the view of the Government.

<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="50307-07_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </b>   I strongly support the substitution of &quot;court&quot; for &quot;Secretary of State&quot;. Earlier my noble and learned friend Lord Lloyd said that the only two equivalent <i>quia timet</i> preventative orders he had been able to find in civil proceedings were non-molestation orders and ASBOs. While I agree with him that they are many miles away from this, they are in fact a million miles away when we note that those two types of order are imposed by the courts. It is unique in civil proceedings for a Secretary of State to be able to proceed on his own and without hearing the views of the person to be subject to these control orders. All that is left to the person is the right to appeal. That is wholly unique.

</p>

<a name="50307-07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>I would add one cautionary word about using the courts to make the order. It ought to be a preliminary order, a temporary one subject always to the requirement to look at the merits of the case put by the person subject to it. By all means have a preliminary ruling without that requirement, but it must be followed almost immediately by a substantive investigation by the court.
</p>

<a name="50307-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>Lastly, as has just been pointed out, it is absolutely right that the civil burden of proof is immensely flexible. The greater the seriousness of the allegation, and of course of the possible consequences, the greater care the court will take before it is satisfied on the balance of probabilities. Other considerations will enter into the balance.

programme last Thursday night. I ask that because the   audience&#151;admittedly a BBC audience&#151;expressed pretty much universal astonishment at the provisions in this Bill. There is no time to go over all the arguments, but I wish to put one point to him in respect of the arguments that have now been put all around the House for treating derogating and non-derogating orders in the same way and subjecting them to the same tests and procedures.

</p>

<a name="50307-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>No doubt the Government will get their Bill in the end, but laws need to carry consent. Just listening to the arguments being put forward in this House by experienced and knowledgeable lawyers, or by former   Home Secretaries such as my noble friend Lord Waddington, or by noble Lords such as myself who cannot understand the distinction if you have a combination of non-derogating restrictions, how do we expect this to carry the consent of the country? If someone is told that they cannot go to their place of work, that they cannot go on holiday and that they cannot see their friends, and they are told, &quot;You do not have these rights that would apply if it were a denial of liberty because all these restrictions are not a denial of liberty&quot;, that flies in the face of common sense. It will not be understood, it will not carry consent and it will be used by the very people whom Ministers are trying to undermine to whip up support for their cause.
</p>

<a name="50307-07_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>So I say this to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor: think about this proposal in practical terms. Consider what Rory Bremner would make of the provisions set out in Clause 3(2) and the argument that this is not a restriction on liberty, and how that would be interpreted in the country.

<a name="50307-07_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Lloyd of Berwick: </b>   Perhaps I may add just one or two sentences, in the light of an observation made by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips. He took me a bit by surprise when he said that he was supporting Amendment No. 56 because it would mean that the judge would be there &quot;to protect&quot;, I think he said, the   Secretary of State. That was the ground on which he was going to support the amendment. Exactly the opposite is true. Judges are not there to protect Secretaries of State. They are there to stand between Secretaries of State and the individuals, in case individuals happen to be innocent. That is not a ground on which we should support the amendment.
</p>

<a name="50307-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>As Members of the Committee know, I am against control orders altogether. If there are to be control orders, whether made by judges or by Secretaries of State, I can see no answer to the argument that the same procedure ought to apply to both. On that I am entirely in agreement with the amendment, which is now supported on all sides.
</p>




<p><a name="st_98"></a>
<a name="50307-07_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   Perhaps I may briefly clarify my point in response to the noble and learned Lord. I was not seeking to protect the Home Secretary, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_495"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 495</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

but to relieve the Home Secretary of a burden that is much more objectively undertaken by a judge. Forgive my inappropriate use of &quot;protect&quot;.
</p>




<p><a name="st_99"></a>
<a name="50307-07_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Ackner: </b>   I would like to make it clear that I think that the House and the country have been rushed into a wholly unsatisfactory position. I appreciate that   compromise has become essential, but that compromise is the product of a wholly unnecessary, rushed approach to a significant piece of legislation. I would therefore like to voice my unhappiness. Undue emphasis on speed has brought about the obligation to compromise some of our most serious and lasting values.
</p>




<p><a name="st_100"></a>
<a name="50307-07_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Judd: </b>   I declare an interest as a member of the Joint Committee on Human Rights.
</p>

<a name="50307-07_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>In view of what has just been said, it would be proper to say that we have found ourselves in an immensely difficult situation. We, too, have felt that we are dealing with one of the most profound issues&#151;absolutely central to our responsibilities&#151;with which we have ever been asked to deal. We have found that the time constraints have made that task very difficult indeed. That is why we had no option in the end but to prioritise our discussion.
</p>

<a name="50307-07_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>I should like to make three points. First, we would all agree, whatever our position, that there is not a perfect solution. We are going for the best possible available solution. I respect the argument, and certainly the quarters from which it comes, that the judge should not be put in the position of taking over political responsibility. However, when I look at statements by the Government, not least by the Prime Minister and Home Secretary, I think that they are to be commended for their candour. Both, it seems, have been at pains to say that they would not want to be accused by the public of not having done everything possible to protect the public.
</p>

<a name="50307-07_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>That seems a very responsible political position, but that is precisely why they are not in the best position to judge what should be done with someone who has been apprehended and arrested. That is exactly why&#151;because they have that responsibility. Arguably, that responsibility undermines their objectivity in this situation.

</p>

<a name="50307-07_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>My second point is related to what the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, said. I do not live my life in legal circles. I have been involved in community work. I am accustomed to community dynamics. What has always seemed crucial to me in the credibility of the administration of the law in our country, is that we take seriously the issue not only of justice being done, but of it being seen to be done. The difficulty is that in the present security situation it is not possible for it to be transparent all the time. That is why we should do everything possible, push as far as we responsibly can, to demonstrate that the proper processes have been followed and that cases have been carefully and objectively considered.
</p>

<a name="50307-07_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>My last point is simply that I happen to believe that we are facing not only one of the greatest human rights issues with which we have ever been faced, but also one <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_496"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 496</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of the most dangerous situations we have ever faced. I believe that history will never forgive us, in the pressure and acute nature of the danger we face, for doing things that prove counter-productive, historically, in winning the battle for hearts and minds.
</p>

<a name="50307-07_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>We shall never be able to eliminate the possibility of terrorism. The best way, the only effective way, in which we shall be able to contain those dangers is to win the battle for hearts and minds. That is why objectivity, due legal processes and the rest are so important.

<p><a name="st_101"></a>
<a name="50307-08_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Desai: </b>   As a non-lawyer, I have been following this debate carefully. On Thursday I was persuaded that it was not good enough for a judge to replace the Secretary of State in giving orders. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, and many others said that judges were unhappy at being made to do the job of the Secretary of State. Then I thought that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, had proposed a third way. I am now lost about what happened to the third way. The third way was a good way.
</p>




<p><a name="st_102"></a>
<a name="50307-08_spmin0"></a><b>The Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor  (Lord Falconer of Thoroton): </b>  This is an incredibly important debate. It follows on from the debate that we had on Thursday. The starting point of the debate and the first issue is whether noble Lords believe that something beyond surveillance and short of the criminal process is required. It is the view of the security services that it is, it is the view of the police that it is, it is the view of the committee of the noble Lord, Lord Newton, that it is. We think it is necessary in the face of the new threat that terrorism poses to this country.
</p>

<a name="50307-08_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>I understand that the position of the Conservative Party and of the Liberal Democrat Party is that they too support the concept of something that is not a criminal process, some sort of court order that restricts the movement or activity of the subject and assists the fight against terrorism. We take the view strongly that that is required, but we do not take the view that that should be done by throwing civil liberties out the window. We think that it has to be done by balancing civil liberties against those requirements.
</p>

<a name="50307-08_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>That is the starting point. If you accept that starting point, as the three Front Benches do, as the law-enforcement agencies do, as the independent bodies that have looked at it do, then I believe that the task for this House and another place is to seek to craft a solution that balances civil liberties against the need to protect the nation in a way, to pick up the words of the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, that has common consent. That, I believe, is the work that we should be engaged upon.
</p>

<a name="50307-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>This group of amendments raises four issues. First, should the court be involved first, before an order becomes effective, in relation to a non-derogating order? That is an order that does not deprive somebody of his liberty.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_497"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 497</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50307-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>We say that is neither necessary nor appropriate for the following reasons. The judgment about whether security will be assisted by a non-derogating order is made by the Home Secretary in the first place; and then, in order to protect civil liberties, there must be proper judicial involvement. The Home Secretary will assess the risk to the nation and ask himself whether the intrusion on an individual&#039;s rights&#151;and this is not about deprivation of liberty but about the individual&#039;s rights, for example, to associate with someone else or to be in contact with other people&#151;is justified by that risk.
</p>

<a name="50307-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>The Home Secretary makes the order in the first place and the arrangements then involve the matter coming before the court as quickly as possible. We need to consider whether the Bill should be amended to ensure that the matter comes before the court as quickly as possible. In applying a judicial review test, the court considers, on the basis of the evidence put before it, whether the risk that the Home Secretary has identified is such that it justifies the intrusion on to that individual&#039;s rights. In effect, it is asking whether the intrusion is justified by the risk identified by the Home Secretary.
</p>

<a name="50307-08_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>That is a very sensible judicial way of looking at matters and is a perfectly possible task. It also makes absolutely clear the Home Secretary&#039;s role and the judge&#039;s role. There is clarity and protection. That is why we submit that, in relation to non-derogating orders, the Home Secretary should make the order in the first place and then, within a very short time indeed, the matter should come before the court. In relation to non-derogating orders, it should be clear that the Home Secretary makes the judgment, but subject to judicial control.
</p>




<p><a name="st_103"></a>
<a name="50307-08_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   The point has been made many times&#151;perhaps I am being thick&#151;but I do not understand, and the Lord Chancellor has not really explained, how it is, for example, that, as he said at an earlier stage in the debate on this legislation, a curfew restriction would not be a deprivation of liberty.

</p>

<a name="50307-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>If you are an ordinary mortal and not a lawyer, and you are told that you have to stay in a certain place and are not allowed to leave it, you think that is a deprivation of liberty. I understand that the Lord Chancellor is making a distinction between the provisions in the European convention, but ordinary mortals do not understand the distinction. It seems to be a deprivation of liberty if you are told that you cannot go to your place of work, that you cannot have certain people in your home and that you have to stay in your home at a certain time. People do not make a distinction between that and house arrest.
</p>

<a name="50307-08_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>Does the Lord Chancellor see the point? Can he help me to understand why he says there is clarity in respect of derogation and non-derogation orders? For me, it is as clear as mud.
</p>




<p><a name="st_104"></a>
<a name="50307-08_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   We draw the line between the two because the European Convention on Human <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_498"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 498</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Rights draws the line between the two. There needs to be a lawful basis&#151;one selected not by the Government but by an accepted body of jurisprudence&#151;as to why the distinction is drawn. It would not be enough for us to say, &quot;We draw the line here but not there&quot;. Let us draw the line based on the European Convention on Human Rights, to which this country has signed up.
</p>

<a name="50307-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>Of course it is possible to say that the connection between the lower end of the derogating order and the upper end of the non-derogating order might be close,   but in practice there will be a very significant difference.
</p>




<p><a name="st_105"></a>
<a name="50307-08_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hayman: </b>   I thank my noble and learned friend for giving way. Is it not true that it is really difficult to find that distinction when my noble and learned friend has accepted that a combination of non-derogating orders might, even within the technical framework of the European convention, amount together to a deprivation of liberty? I recognise what he says about needing a legal basis, but we are in the process of creating that legal basis in UK law.
</p>




<p><a name="st_106"></a>
<a name="50307-08_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   If you said, &quot;You cannot go out and see this person and you cannot go out and see that person; you have got to be in your house from   six in the evening until midday the next morning&quot;, any sensible person would say that constitutes a deprivation of liberty even though it is taken from the Clause 1(3)(c) list identified by the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth. There will not be a great deal of difficulty in identifying what is or is not a deprivation of liberty.
</p>

<a name="50307-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>The non-derogating orders intend to focus on matters such as reporting to the police a particular number of times a week and not seeing individual people. It is very important that we take an approach based in law rather than distinctions drawn simply for the purpose of the Bill.

<p><a name="st_107"></a>
<a name="50307-08_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </b>   To my mind, the Lord Chancellor has not answered the question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth. The noble and learned Lord said that we have to make a distinction because the distinction is clear in the convention itself. But Article 5 states that everyone has the right to liberty. On what basis is the Lord Chancellor saying that a curfew, or a refusal to allow someone to work somewhere or to go to different people&#039;s houses, is not a restriction of liberty?
</p>




<p><a name="st_108"></a>
<a name="50307-08_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton:  </b>  Under the jurisprudence of the European Convention on Human Rights it is not a deprivation of liberty. It might well constitute infringements of Articles 7 to 11 but, as I said during the debate on Thursday, that matter does not require a derogation and can be dealt with by the   courts. We see as fundamentally different the deprivation of liberty that derogating orders could involve.

exactly the same noises about Part 4, saying that it was not against the Human Rights Act. Almost as night follows day, someone will go to the court and prove the Lord Chancellor wrong. What will happen then? Everyone else will have an enormous amount of pleasure in saying, &quot;I told him so&quot;.
</p>




<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="50307-08_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   The Bill provides that you can make a derogating order only if you have derogated from the convention. We are not derogating at the moment. If any order constitutes a deprivation of liberty, it will be struck down by the courts. So we are providing judicial protection against any deprivation of liberty.
</p>

<a name="50307-08_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>I think the noble Lord, Lord Lester, should intervene first; then the noble Lord, Lord Brittan, and then my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis.

<p><a name="st_111"></a>
<a name="50307-09_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor. I hope he will   bear with me and my question because I do not understand the way in which he is reading the Bill on the key issue of judicial control.
</p>

<a name="50307-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>Clause 1(1) states that the Home Secretary&#151;not a judge&#151;will make the initial decision and that he will need to have reasonable grounds and consider it to be necessary. Under Clause 7, which deals with appeals, the role of the court is not in deciding whether the order was necessary but, under Clause 7(4), in whether the decision was flawed. Clause 7(7) states that, in doing so, the court has to apply the principles applied in a judicial review.
</p>

<a name="50307-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>My understanding&#151;I am interested to know whether the Lord Chancellor agrees with me&#151;is that if you apply judicial review proceedings, the decision is   not that of the court, as it would be with a &quot;Spycatcher&quot; injunction to restrain the distribution of government information in breach of a duty of loyalty by a disloyal agent, but of the Home Secretary. The power of what is called an &quot;appeal&quot; court is to be exercised, as I read it, only to see whether the Home Secretary&#039;s decision was flawed on the basis of legality, rationality and procedural propriety. That is not the same as the independent principle of proportionality, which the courts have not yet said is an independent principle.

</p>

<a name="50307-09_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>Therefore, when the Lord Chancellor says, as he has done today and previously, that the court will decide whether the order was necessary, with respect, that is not   right. The court will decide whether the Home Secretary&#039;s decision was flawed on the basis of judicial review principles. There is all the difference in the world between that and a police officer who believes there are reasonable grounds for suspicion and applies for a search warrant, or a government who, through the Attorney-General, apply for a &quot;Spycatcher&quot; injunction. In such cases, they will have reasonable grounds and go to a judge, and the judge will decide whether it is necessary. Am I right or wrong about that?

</p>




<p><a name="st_112"></a>
<a name="50307-09_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   I understand the question. The noble Lord is absolutely right that I said on Thursday in considering the &quot;judicial review&quot; basis that we propose in the Bill that it is our intention that the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_500"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 500</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

court should be able to ask and answer whether there is a legitimate aim under the convention pursuant to which the non-derogating order is made and whether the obligations in the order are proportionate. I believe that we have got there already, but if we have not we will make amendments to achieve that end.
</p>




<p><a name="st_113"></a>
<a name="50307-09_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Brittan of Spennithorne: </b>   I hope that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor will accept that there is no greater supporter of the European convention than I; nor any greater admirer of the jurisprudence deriving from it. I hope that he will also accept that underlying my noble friend Lord Forsyth&#039;s argument is the belief that it is fundamentally misconceived to found a distinction on   the question of compliance or otherwise with the convention between cases where we have to go under the more onerous&#151;if we may call it that&#151;procedure and cases where we go under the simpler procedure subject to judicial review.
</p>

<a name="50307-09_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>If we are to have the public&#039;s consent, what matters between one procedure and the other is the gravity of the matter and not whether it is a breach of the convention. In the cases where the derogating orders apply we are talking about the deprivation of liberty; but on any view the kind of orders that can be made under the non-derogating category involve so substantial a curtailment of liberty that to the ordinary public there seems to be little difference between one and the other.
</p>

<a name="50307-09_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>If that is the case, there is no reason why there should be a difference in procedure in applying the two orders and why what seems in ordinary legal principles&#151;nothing to do with the convention&#151;the more normal procedure of going to a court, presenting the evidence to the extent that it is possible to present it and asking for a view should not apply both to the deprivation of liberty and the substantial curtailment of liberty.
</p>




<p><a name="st_114"></a>
<a name="50307-09_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   I entirely accept that there is no warmer admirer of the jurisprudence of the ECHR than the noble Lord, Lord Brittan. I also agree entirely with what he says about the need for an understandable basis for which one can draw a distinction that can be popularly understood.

</p>

<a name="50307-09_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>Any Article 5 infringing order will deprive someone of his liberty. It will mean that he is in practice restricted to   his house for 24 hours or something akin to that. I believe that the public would be able to identify that the mainstream order&#151;a non-derogating order&#151;involves, for example, reporting to the police and not communicating with particular named individuals but does not involve deprivation of a person&#039;s liberty.
</p>

<a name="50307-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>The noble Lord gave the example of a curfew. If he will think back to his days in the magistrates&#039; court&#151;which I am sure were a long time ago&#151;he will remember that bail was often obtained by agreeing to a curfew. Did the subject of such an order think that he was being deprived of his liberty? I think that he was regarded as not being placed inside.

In ordinary parlance the ordinary man would say that he had been deprived of his liberty substantially: he cannot carry out his work and he is really a captive.
</p>

<a name="50307-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>What is the point in running the risk of starting that&#151;as we would&#151;by a procedure where the Minister makes an order instead of saying that all orders should be made by a judge? We would thereby eliminate the risk of making orders that turn out to be derogating orders. It does not make any sense.

There are people who come to this country legitimately who are legitimately prevented from working. I wonder whether they would regard themselves&#151;as the noble Lord says they would in common parlance&#151;as deprived of their liberty. I do not think that they would. Other rights under Articles 7 to 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights would be infringed, but under our proposals the court is able to weigh up the risk that they pose against intrusion in relation to their rights.

<a name="50307-09_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Maclennan of Rogart: </b>   Before the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor sits down, does he understand the difficulty that some of us face in following the distinction he makes between derogating and non-derogating orders? Although some of the proposed orders may not appear to affect freedoms guaranteed under Article 5 they appear to affect other freedoms protected by the convention: Article 10 on freedom of speech and Article 11 on freedom of association and the property freedoms, which would be interfered with most severely. How can that distinction seriously be drawn?

</p>

<a name="50307-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>On a wider question on the whole approach, how will it be possible for the courts to be provided with the means to make the judgment that the noble and learned Lord proposes that they should be permitted to make? As the courts are to be deprived of the evidence that might be advanced by those against whom the orders are directed&#151;if they themselves know the substance of the evidence that they have to rebut&#151;is it not more likely that they will be faced with the task of rubber stamping?
</p>




<p><a name="st_124"></a>
<a name="50307-10_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   No, the courts would have access to all the evidence. The issue in such cases is not whether the court has access to the evidence, but whether the citizen who makes the application sees all the material. That is the reason for the special advocate procedure. So the court would have sufficient material to judge whether there was a legitimate aim against which the order had been made, whether the steps were proportionate and what was the level of risk.

<a name="50307-10_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Ludford: </b>   I was not present at Second Reading as I was fulfilling other duties. However, have I understood correctly that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor is to table another amendment to institute what he said about the scope of appeal and bringing in proportionality? As I understand it, there is only the judicial review standard on the face of the Bill. Secondly, the importance of what is happening here this week will echo around Europe. We are talking about the European Convention on Human Rights and what we enact into UK law will be watched very closely in the rest of Europe.
</p>




<p><a name="st_128"></a>
<a name="50307-10_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   I believe that that is entirely right. On the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, I believe that that is already in the Bill. However, I want to make it clear that, in relation to a non-derogating order, the court can consider that proportionality is a legitimate aim in relation to the convention, as I said on Thursday. If that is not in the Bill, the Bill will be amended to achieve that aim.

</p>

<a name="50307-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>I turn to the involvement of the DPP, which we discussed on Thursday. The position of the Government is that a control order should be sought only where a prosecution is not possible. We submit that it is not appropriate to put the DPP on the face of the Bill, as proposed, but we give a clear undertaking that, before any application is sought, the Home Secretary will have satisfied himself that prosecution is not a possible alternative.
</p>




<p><a name="st_129"></a>
<a name="50307-10_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Elton: </b>   The noble and learned Lord can take that position only for the present Government. I return to my earlier point: we are legislating for the future, unless we have a sunset clause.
</p>




<p><a name="st_130"></a>
<a name="50307-10_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   I respectfully submit that that position is one that any sensible government would take in relation to these orders. When considering whether a matter is proportionate, the court would be able to say that it would not be proportionate if prosecution were possible. So in practice the court would have to see material and ask, &quot;Why don&#039;t you prosecute?&quot;, and if there were no satisfactory answer, it would not be a proportionate order.
</p>

<a name="50307-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>I turn to the most important issue, which is burden   of proof. Control orders, as the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said, are preventive orders. They are designed to prevent atrocities happening in future. They are not designed to punish a person for past <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_504"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 504</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

events. They require an assessment of the overall security situation, of the risks posed by particular individuals and of what measures, from a potentially wide range, are necessary and appropriate to meet those risks. The assessment must be carried out on the basis of a wide range of complex intelligence material and would involve inferences and evaluations being made in relation to matters affecting national security.
</p>

<a name="50307-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>For those reasons it is not an area where the Secretary of State or the court will deal with proof of issues of fact. Essentially it is an exercise in risk assessment and evaluation of intelligence material.
</p>




<p><a name="st_131"></a>
<a name="50307-10_spmin0"></a><b>The Earl of Onslow:</b>  If the Home Secretary thinks that Mohammed al-Smith wants to do, or is planning to do, something, and he has talked to others about doing something nasty, can the noble and learned Lord explain why that is not conspiracy? If it is only one man dreaming, the Home Secretary cannot possibly get inside his mind. If there is evidence that someone wants to do something very nasty, I do not understand how he has not, by the very nature of the situation, committed a criminal offence or a common law offence of conspiracy.
</p>




<p><a name="st_132"></a>
<a name="50307-10_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   There are two problems with that. On the previous occasion I gave the following example: if a foreign intelligence organisation has arrested someone, interrogated him and acquired information, that information will almost certainly not be available to an English court, but it might be regarded by sensible people as reliable. Secondly, there may be information that does not constitute the high standard of proof that is required in a criminal court, but, quite legitimately, it may give rise to a particular risk. Thirdly, someone could be preparing for a terrorist act which does not constitute a criminal offence at the moment but, legitimately, it gives rise to a possible risk. Those are three areas where control orders could provide practical assistance but where prosecution would not be possible.
</p>

<a name="50307-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>On the burden of proof, I shall deal first with non-derogating orders as opposed to derogating orders. In relation to non-derogating orders, having reasonable grounds to suspect that an individual is or has been involved in terrorism-related activities is just one part of the overall assessment of the risk posed by the individual and the measures necessary to meet that risk. That is the first part of a two-pronged test in relation to a non-derogating order.
</p>

<a name="50307-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>The courts have recognised in very similar contexts that that is an appropriate test to apply. In the case of Rehman, which concerned a deportation order on the ground that it would be conducive to the public good in the interests of national security, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;the whole concept of a standard of proof is not particularly helpful in a case such as the present. In a criminal or civil trial in which the issue is whether a given event happened, it is sensible to say that one is sure that it did, or that one thinks it more likely than not that it did. But the question in the present case is not whether a given event happened but the extent of future risk. This depends upon an evaluation of the evidence of the appellant&#039;s conduct against a broad range of facts with which they may interact. The question of whether the risk to national security is sufficient to <br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_505"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 505</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>justify the appellant&#039;s deportation cannot be answered by taking each allegation seriatim and deciding whether it has been established to some standard of proof. It is a question of evaluation and judgment, in which it is necessary to take account of probability of prejudice to national security but also the importance of the security interests at stake and the serious consequences of deportation for the deportee&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, is saying that conventional burdens of proof issues are not appropriate in considering this matter. The reasonable suspicion test is the appropriate one.
</p>

<a name="50307-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>I shall give way to the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, in two minutes, but perhaps I can complete my line of argument.

</p>

<a name="50307-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>In effect, Lord Justice Laws, in a subsequent case in the Court of Appeal, thoroughly endorsed the Rehman approach and said what, in effect, I am saying, which is that this is about evaluating risk and identifying preventive orders that are consistent with people&#039;s human rights, but provide appropriate protection for the rest of the public in relation to it. In both those cases, the judges said, rejecting arguments made by counsel, that there should be some conventional standard of proof, and that reasonable suspicion was an appropriate level of proof. We accept that reasoning in relation to non-derogating orders. However, because a derogating order deprives someone of their liberty, we impose a higher standard&#151;namely, balance of probabilities&#151;which we recognise would make the granting of orders in those circumstances very difficult indeed. As people are deprived of their liberty by derogating orders, we take a different stance on them.
</p>

<a name="50307-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>Finally, I shall quote what Lord Justice Laws said about the argument that a burden of proof like balance of probabilities should be inserted. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;Accordingly a requirement of proof will frustrate the policy and objects of the Act  . . . the target of the Act&#039;s policy includes those who belong to loose, amorphous, unorganised groups . . .  the choice is apt to strike the target. Proof would not be&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>That is the distinction that has been drawn.
</p>

<a name="50307-10_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>Noble Lords have a choice as to whether, in the light of what Lord Justice Laws has said, and having heard all the arguments, that balance of probabilities is the right course. If your Lordships conclude that it is, as Lord Justice Laws said, you will go a long way to frustrating the purpose of the control orders. We come back to where we started from. Do noble Lords think that we need something apart from the criminal process and surveillance? We believe&#151;and we are told as much by the security services and the police&#151;that we do.

<a name="50307-11_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   I intervene because I am now hopelessly bewildered by what I have just heard. I thought the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor said a little while ago that the court would effectively be in the same position as the Strasbourg court; that is, it would look at the necessity and proportionality of a restriction on a fundamental right or freedom. That is what I thought he said, and he nods.

<a name="50307-11_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>If that is so, will he agree with me that, because the order has an impact on a fundamental convention civil right, the burden is upon the state to justify the interference? That is standard. We know from Strasbourg that the exception must be strictly construed. The burden of proof is therefore on the Home Secretary, and the standard of proof&#151;whether one calls it &quot;probability&quot; or otherwise&#151;must provide sufficient cogent and convincing evidence to justify the interference. Quoting Sir John Laws on other matters is not central to the point here, which is that the burden is upon the Home Secretary to justify according to proportionality, and he must do so by cogent and convincing rebuttal evidence.
</p>




<p><a name="st_134"></a>
<a name="50307-11_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   No, that is completely wrong. The test is, &quot;What is the risk?&quot;. We are talking about&#151;convention rights are engaged here&#151;the level of risk for the future, which cannot be proved by conventional burdens. If the degree of risk is sufficient, the steps that can be taken can be justified. There is no difficulty in asking oneself, &quot;Is the risk shown by the Secretary of State&quot;&#151;and he has to show that risk&#151;&quot;such that the steps he has taken are proportionate and justified?&quot;.

<a name="50307-11_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Brittan of Spennithorne: </b>   The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor has cited judicial authorities and general arguments in favour of the proposition that, when risk is being considered, the burden of proof is an irrelevant and improper consideration. If that is so, on what grounds of principle&#151;as opposed to political expediency, which may be convenient for us&#151;does he then introduce the concept of the balance of probabilities in the most serious cases, where he wishes to take the most draconian measures?
</p>




<p><a name="st_136"></a>
<a name="50307-11_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   Because they are the most serious cases, and because depriving someone of their liberty, which requires a derogation from the European convention&#151;of which the noble Lord has said that he is second to none in his admiration&#151;requires a special step to be taken. That is the view we take, which is why we have introduced this additional measure.
</p>




<p><a name="st_137"></a>
<a name="50307-11_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Brittan of Spennithorne: </b>   It is not just a question of a &quot;special step&quot;. A moment ago, the noble and learned Lord was arguing that the whole question of risk was completely divorced from the question of the balance of probabilities. Whether or not it is a special consideration, it is an illogical step to be producing, even though it may be politically convenient. Surely the right step is to accept the argument of the balance of probabilities for both types of order.

He has just told us that it will be &quot;very difficult&quot; to get an order on the balance of probabilities. To a lay person like myself, that balance could be 51 per cent one way and 49 per cent the other, which sounds different from being &quot;very difficult&quot;.
</p>

<a name="50307-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, picked up on something I said in my earlier contribution, saying that the civil courts were used to a flexible application of the balance of probabilities, so that if you intend to make a control order to deprive someone of their liberty, you am not that far from the criminal standard&#151;bearing in mind the technical difficulties with that, as we heard earlier. Can my noble and learned friend confirm to us that his understanding is the same as that of the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill?
</p>




<p><a name="st_140"></a>
<a name="50307-11_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   Regarding the balance of probabilities, the test is defined as whether it is more likely than not that the suspect is or has been a terrorist. The courts have said in other contexts that the more serious the allegation you make against someone, the more you have to prove it is more likely than not that they are a terrorist. A very serious allegation is being made, and it is for the court to determine how they would construe it. The flexibility means that the standard of proof can go not down but, rather, goes up. If the right reverend Prelate was wondering whether, in these circumstances, the balance of probabilities is closer to &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot; than it would be in other cases, I cannot say so for certain, but that would be the trend.

<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>I do not want to repeat that point, but if the test is not to be balance of probabilities, and if that balance means that it is more likely than not, surely that cannot mean that the Home Secretary, faced with a situation where he was not certain that it was more likely than not&#151;perhaps it was more unlikely than likely&#151;would still be able to proceed with these serious restrictions on people&#039;s movements and ability to do their job.

<a name="50307-11_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </b>   When I rose to my feet an hour and forty minutes ago to move a modest amendment of a few words, changing the burden of proof in one area of the Bill, I did not realise it was going to lead to such a wide-ranging debate. Much of that debate has not even referred to the burden of proof on which my amendment was based, but has gone on instead to the whole issue of whether those orders that require derogation and those that do not should nevertheless be dealt with in the same way. I had thought that that would be the effect of the first amendment in the next group, which I tabled, but as we have obviously had the debate on both of them, I will merely say on that issue that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor&#039;s explanations are wholly unimpressive.
</p>

<a name="50307-11_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>My noble friend Lord Forsyth is right. The idea that the man in the street will look upon an order that prevents him working, or that requires a curfew to be imposed on him, as in some way not being an interference with his liberty that justifies derogation, is nonsense. The overwhelming argument has been that we should deal with all these matters in the same way judicially.
</p>

<a name="50307-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>I have accepted, as I have done every time I have spoken during these debates, that there is a group of terrorist cases where one knows that people are a danger to this country but it is impossible for them to have a fair trial as the evidence and its sources cannot be disclosed without damage to the state as a whole. I was delighted to hear my noble friend Lord Kingsland say that the Opposition were proposing to stand by the principle that before any of these orders come into force, there should be some system by which the director or some other body should be satisfied, having looked at the case, that no normal trial can take place. All I was saying in the amendment was, that having been done, if the Secretary of State is satisfied that a person is or has been involved in terrorism, that is a matter on which he should have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt rather than on the balance of probabilities. With great respect, I do not accept the argument of the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, and those who have said that merely because you cannot provide a defendant with the sources of the case against him or, indeed, give him the evidence against him, it does not prevent you being able to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt whether he is or is not involved in terrorist activity.

<p><a name="st_155"></a>
<a name="50307-13_spmin1"></a><b>The Earl of Onslow</b>  moved Amendment No. 63:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>Page 4, line 36, leave out subsections (1) to (5) and insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_2"></a><br>
&quot;(   )   The High Court will set the limit of all non-derogating control orders.&quot;


<p><a name="st_156"></a>The noble Earl said: The only point that I make about this amendment is a very simple one; namely, that when the Home Secretary thinks that someone has done something wrong&#151;the mythical Mahommed al-Smith&#151;the judge has to say how long he will stay inside or how long the order not to visit his friends will apply. In other words, a term is set upon his punishment. Noble Lords will probably say that it is not punishment, but to him it will be punishment. It surely must go against all principles of justice, freedom and reason that someone can simply be locked up or deprived of or restricted of his liberty for   an indefinite period. To me that is completely unsatisfactory. I beg to move.

</p>




<p><a name="st_157"></a>
<a name="50307-13_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   I should like to say very briefly in support of my noble friend Lord Onslow that, listed with Amendment No. 63, is Amendment No. 93, which goes even further than Amendment No. 63. It would require the High Court to set the limit on all derogating control orders. When we come to Amendment No. 93, if the Committee is inclined to vote, it seems to me that that amendment of my noble friend Lord Onslow is perhaps preferable to the one that the noble Lord has just moved.
</p>




<p><a name="st_158"></a>
<a name="50307-13_spmin2"></a><b>The Earl of Onslow:</b>  I am totally at the convenience of the Committee. I do not know whether the Committee would like to discuss Amendments Nos. 63 and 93 together as a principle. I accept that Amendment No. 93 goes further than Amendment No. 63 but the principle is in effect the same, which is that the amount of time that an order applies to someone should be set by a judge and for a defined period. I do not know whether the Committee would like to discuss Amendment No. 93 now or when we reach it. I am completely at the disposal of the Committee.
<a name="time_13"></a>
<a name="50307-13_time0"></a><h5>5.15 p.m.</h5>
</p>




<p><a name="st_159"></a>
<a name="50307-13_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   Amendments Nos. 63 and 93 are grouped. Therefore, I respectfully suggest that it makes sense for me to respond to the amendment moved by the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, bearing in mind that no other Member of the Committee has risen in that regard.
</p>




<p><a name="st_160"></a>
<a name="50307-13_spnew4"></a><b> Noble Lords: </b>   Oh!
</p>




<p><a name="st_161"></a>
<a name="50307-13_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   How could I have not noticed the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland? I humbly beg his pardon. I meant no other Member of the Committee than a Front Bench Member. I tend to be dismissive of both our Front Benches as not really being the true contributors to a debate until a Member of the Back Benches rises.
</p>

<a name="50307-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>The time frame which was given for both these orders accepts the reality that it is likely that they would have to be in being for some time. Bearing in mind the nature of the behaviour which is contemplated, it would be reasonable to suppose that a period of six months or 12   months would not be an unreasonable period, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_514"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 514</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

particularly bearing in mind that it would be open to the person against whom such an order was made to make application on the basis of any change in circumstance. We accepted that if these control orders were made, they should not be open-ended. The time limits that we have set out of six months and 12 months would appear to be the most reasonable in all the circumstances.
</p>




<p><a name="st_162"></a>
<a name="50307-13_spmin3"></a><b>The Earl of Onslow:</b>  But still it is open to the Minister to allow the person to whom the control order is applied not to know the overall length of how long he is being either deprived of or having his liberty limited. That cannot be right. It is what double jeopardy was put into place to stop&#151;allowing people to go on playing what I believe used to be called &quot;cat and mouse&quot; orders in Ireland; that is, locking people up, then releasing them, then locking them up again, then releasing them and then locking them up. It is quite unsatisfactory. However, there is so much which is unsatisfactory about this Bill that I suppose it is asking too much to try to get one small part put right. I note that not many other Members of the Committee wanted to speak to this amendment. However, I see that someone now wishes to do so and therefore I shall sit down.
</p>




<p><a name="st_163"></a>
<a name="50307-13_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Tebbit: </b>   I am grateful to my noble friend. I have   every sympathy with what he is aiming at but I wonder about the practicalities of the matter. What circumstances would change to make it safe&#151;if it had been unsafe&#151;to let such an individual who had an order made against him out on to the streets again? For example, according to the Irish justice Minister, who is a significant figure, Mr Adams and Mr McGuinness are members of the Army Council of the IRA. I should have thought that would give rise to reasonable grounds for suspicion that they were associated with terrorist activities. If the Irish Minister is right, that has been the case for many years. Presumably, one would not want just to take them in for a few months and then let them back out on to the streets again, where, according to the Irish justice Minister&#151;we do not know about these things&#151;they might be involved in plotting anything from a murder to a bank robbery. Therefore, my noble friend might wonder whether he is absolutely right on this occasion.
</p>

</p>

<a name="50307-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>This amendment is similar to the one just moved by my noble friend Lord Onslow but seeks to ensure that a non-derogating control order has effect for a maximum period of 12 months.
</p>

<a name="50307-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>The Explanatory Notes accompanying the Bill make it clear that the intention is that the control orders will be tailored to the particular risk posed by the individual concerned. The risk in some cases will be greater than in others and presumably last for different periods of time. To ensure that the orders are proportionate, the Law Society of Scotland suggests that consideration should be given to the length of time it is considered necessary to have an order in existence to meet the risk posed by the individual. It may not be necessary to have all orders lasting for the full period of 12 months. This amendment allows for this degree of flexibility.

</p>

<a name="50307-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>Amendment No. 96 probes the relationship between Clause 4(2) and Clause 4(1)(c) of the Bill. These concern the duration of derogating control orders. Clause 4(1)(c) states that a derogating control order cannot be renewed. However, Clause 4(2) then provides that the Secretary of State can make a new control order to the same effect for a further period of six months on the basis of the same information upon which the original order was founded. This would appear to have the same effect as a renewal order. This amendment therefore probes the relationship between these two provisions. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_166"></a>
<a name="50307-14_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   In relation to these amendments I would like to reiterate the comments I made in relation to the previous group of amendments and add to them. The Secretary of State can revoke, or apply to the court to revoke, a control order at any time if it ceases to be necessary, or he may modify, or seek modification of, any of the obligations imposed. It is open to the subject of the order to apply at any time to the Secretary of State, or to court, as the case may be, for a revocation of the order or for conditions to be varied, if he believes that circumstances have changed. Given the ongoing, active monitoring that will be involved in control orders, we do not believe that a modification to the drafting in the way suggested by the amendment is necessary. Furthermore, it would be likely to hinder optimal operational effectiveness.
</p>

<a name="50307-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>I understand that Amendment No. 96 is a probing amendment. It prevents the making of a new derogating control order after the period specified for the first order expires. It also prevents the Home Secretary making a new derogating control order once the period of the first order has expired. In my earlier remarks, I made clear that we think that it is important for each control order to be for an identifiable, limited period, notwithstanding the fact that we will be reviewing the situation on a continuous basis. It would significantly undermine the effectiveness of the control order scheme if it were not possible for derogating control orders to continue, in appropriate cases, after the initial periods for which they are imposed.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_516"></a>

</p>

<a name="50307-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>By definition, the derogating control orders would be imposed on those thought to pose the gravest threats to public safety. It is right that such severe measures should be kept under close review and the need for them should be reassessed carefully every six months. It is possible&#151;as has been the case with some of the current detainees&#151;that the risk an individual poses can diminish over time. In that event, when looking at an order for which derogation has been needed, it might be appropriate to contemplate restrictions falling short of a deprivation of liberty. If nothing had changed over a six month period and yet the risk posed by the individual was the same as when the Home Secretary, or, as the case may now be, the court, had deemed it appropriate to impose such stringent controls, it would be irresponsible not to have the means to continue to assure the public that it was still safe.
</p>

<a name="50307-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>This is about ensuring certainty of time span, making sure that orders are reviewed properly and giving the relevant parties an opportunity to raise additional matters for revocation in relation to those orders. The two fit together.
</p>




<p><a name="st_167"></a>
<a name="50307-14_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </b>   In a situation where evidence emerges well before the six-month review that throws doubt on the evidence on which the control order was made, do the Government have in mind any provision that would enable a rapid review of that case to take place? Clearly, there could be indications that the original evidence was unsound.
</p>




<p><a name="st_168"></a>
<a name="50307-14_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   That is why I said that there would be a review of the situation and that the Home Secretary could revoke the order before it expired, or application could be made to the court, now that we have passed Amendment No. 56, indicating that there had been a change of circumstances that merited such a revocation or the amendment of certain of the conditions. It may be that conditions change and indicate that some of the limitations, or restrictions imposed by way of conditions, are no longer merited. The idea is to have the certainty of an initial period of six or 12 months and then allowing flexibility for revocation because of change of circumstances.
</p>




<p><a name="st_169"></a>
<a name="50307-14_spmin0"></a><b>The Duke of Montrose:</b>  I thank the Minister for that explanation. As I understand it, the provision in Clause   4(1)(c)&#151;that the derogating control order may not be renewed&#151;means that the order may not be rolled forward, but that a new order must be brought in. In the light of that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="amdtpar_10"></a>(b)   without his having had notice of the application for the order; and

<a name="amdtpar_11"></a>(c)   without his having been given an opportunity (if he was aware of the application) of making any representations to the court;

<a name="amdtpar_13"></a>(3)   At the preliminary hearing, the court may make a control order against the individual in question if it appears to the court&#151;

<br>

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_24"></a>(b)   revoke the order;

<a name="amdtpar_27"></a>(a)   may modify the obligations imposed by the order; and

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_28"></a>(b)   where a modification made by the court removes an obligation, may (if it thinks fit) direct that this Act is to have effect as if the removed obligation had been quashed.

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_29"></a>(7)   At the full hearing, the court may confirm the control order (with or without modifications) only if&#151;

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_30"></a>(a)   it is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the controlled person is an individual who is or has been involved in terrorism-related activity;

<br>

   &quot;ARREST AND DETENTION PENDING DEROGATING CONTROL ORDER

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_46"></a>(1)   A constable may arrest and detain an individual if&#151;

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_47"></a>(a)   the Secretary of State has made an application to the court for a derogating control order to be made against that individual; and

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_48"></a>(b)   the constable considers that the individual&#039;s arrest and detention is necessary to ensure that he is available to be given notice of the order if it is made.

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_49"></a>(2)   A constable who has arrested an individual under this section must take him to the designated place that the constable considers most appropriate as soon as practicable after the arrest.

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_50"></a>(3)   An individual taken to a designated place under this section may be detained there until the end of 48 hours from the time of his arrest.

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_51"></a>(4)   If the court considers that it is necessary to do so to ensure that the individual in question is available to be given notice of any derogating control order that is made against him, it may, during the 48 hours following his arrest, extend the period for which the individual may be detained under this section by a period of no more than 48 hours.

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_52"></a>(5)   An individual may not be detained under this section at any time after&#151;

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_53"></a>(a)   he has become bound by a derogating control order made against him on the Secretary of State&#039;s application; or

<br>

<p class="tabletext"><br>
(b)   the omission of paragraph 8(2), (5) and (5A) (which relates to the postponement of a person&#039;s rights in England and Wales or Northern Ireland); and

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_64"></a>(c)   the omission of paragraphs 16(9) and 17(4) and (4A) (which make similar provision for Scotland).

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_65"></a>(9)   The power to detain an individual under this section includes power to detain him in a manner that is incompatible with his right to liberty under Article 5 of the Human Rights Convention if, and only if&#151;

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_66"></a>(a)   there is a designated derogation in respect of the detention of individuals under this section in connection with the making of applications for derogating control orders; and

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_67"></a>(b)   that derogation and the designated derogation relating to the power to make the orders applied for are designated in respect of the same public emergency.

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_68"></a>(10)   In this section &quot;designated place&quot; means any place which the Secretary of State has designated under paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 8 to the Terrorism Act 2000 (c. 11) as a place at which persons may be detained under section 41 of that Act.&quot;

<p><a name="st_185"></a>The noble Baroness said: The preliminary hearing of a derogating control order will take place within a few days, if not hours, of the application by the Secretary of State. Because of this&#151;and because the initial hearing will be on an <i>ex parte</i> basis&#151;there will normally be no need for any additional provision.
</p>

<a name="50307-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>However, in some cases it may be believed that an individual who is the subject of the control order application may disappear before such time as the order, if made, can be served on him. In derogating control order cases we need to be satisfied that the imposition of the most stringent condition is necessary to protect the public. An inability to act to prevent such an occurrence would leave a significant gap in the derogating control order system.
</p>

<a name="50307-15_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>We have therefore provided that there should be a new power of police arrest and detention pending the preliminary hearing before the court for the necessary order. The new clause provides that the period of detention should be for a maximum of 48 hours in the first instance and the power arises only after the Secretary of State has made the application and provided that it is necessary to ensure that the suspect is available for service of the order if made. This may be extended under subsection (4) for a further 48 hours by the judge considering the <i>ex parte</i> application.
</p>

<a name="50307-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>The remaining provisions relate to the status of the individual while detained under this provision, including applying many of the powers as safeguards provided in respect of Section 41 of the Terrorism Act detention provisions such as access to lawyers, the ability to notify someone of his arrest and similar matters. Such powers of arrest will in themselves require a derogation for Article 5 of the ECHR. Subsection (5) therefore provides for this.
</p>

<a name="50307-15_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>Amendments Nos. 148 and 154 may also be included in this group. I shall therefore speak to those.

</p>

<a name="50307-15_para9"></a>

<a name="50307-16_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lloyd of Berwick: </b>   I oppose the amendment. It is a very good example of how liberties can be eroded without anybody noticing. It is a basic rule of English law that when a man is arrested he is entitled to be told what he has wrong&#151;that is, the offence that he has committed. That has always been the English law. It was put in statutory form in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. Not surprisingly, it is also law under the European convention as enshrined in the Human Rights Act.
</p>

<a name="50307-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>When the constable arrests a person who is suspected by the Home Secretary, what offence will he be told he has committed? Unless he can be told that he has committed an offence, he has been wrongfully arrested. The constable cannot tell him that he has been arrested and will be taken in however short a time before a court because he is involved in terrorism-related activities or something similar. That is not an offence in English law and it is not proposed to be in effect under the Bill. Until there is an offence of that kind, the arrest cannot be lawful.
</p>




<p><a name="st_187"></a>
<a name="50307-16_spmin0"></a><b>The Duke of Montrose:</b>  This clause on arrest and detention pending a derogating control order has caused some worries north of the Border. The clause appears to allow a constable to arrest and detain an individual if the Secretary of State has made an application to the court for a derogating control order in respect of that individual and the constable considers that the arrest and detention is necessary to ensure that he or she is available to be given notice of the order if it is made. They will have to wait until a letter is delivered or until something similar occurs.

</p>

<a name="50307-16_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>I appreciate that the Government may wish to make provision to ensure that those suspected of involvement in terrorism-related activity are held in custody pending determination of the derogating order, but is the mechanism set out in the Bill the appropriate way to achieve this? I would also welcome clarification of how this will interact with Scottish criminal procedure.
</p>

<a name="50307-16_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>There is in Scots law a clear distinction between detention and arrest. The intention behind the traditional concept of detention is to allow time for further enquiry by the police where there is reasonable cause to suspect the involvement of an individual in the commission of a crime punishable by imprisonment but where there is insufficient evidence to press charges.
</p>

<a name="50307-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>The purpose of detention is to assist in the investigation of the matter. As soon as it is clear that sufficient evidence exists to arrest a suspect, detention should be terminated and at that point the person may be arrested.

</p>

<a name="50307-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>A person may be arrested when there is sufficient evidence to point to the involvement of that individual in the commission of a crime. The crime must be one which is capable of being punished by imprisonment. In this <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_523"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 523</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

subsection, there is no clear reference to the constable suspecting that the individual has been involved in a crime. The basis of the arrest appears to focus on the fact that an application has been made and the ability to serve notice of the derogating control order on the controlled person. It might be more appropriate for the subsection to refer to a belief on the constable&#039;s part that the individual is or has been involved in terrorism-related activities and therefore that detention&#151;rather than arrest&#151;is appropriate while further enquiry is going on. If there is sufficient evidence to proceed to arrest, why are criminal proceedings not raised and pre-trial detention considered?
</p>

<a name="50307-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>Alternatively, if the purpose of the provision is to ensure that the individual&#039;s movements are restricted pending determination of the derogating order, rather than introducing an artificial concept of arrest, a combination of conditions could be imposed on the individual in terms of a non-derogating order which would allow for supervision or monitoring over the period concerned.
</p>

<a name="50307-16_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>I question whether the clause currently takes full account of the devolution settlement. Will the Secretary of State consult Scottish Ministers before police officers in Scotland become involved in the process? If there is sufficient evidence on which to arrest an individual, will the Lord Advocate become involved in the direction of the investigation?

</p>

<a name="50307-16_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>Clarification would therefore be welcomed on the terminology which is used in relation to detention and arrest, especially in the Scottish context; the appropriate basis for detention or arrest&#151;that is, based on suspicion of criminal activity; and, the role of Scottish Ministers and in particular the Lord Advocate in this process. Subsection (4) refers to the power of the courts to extend the custodial period of 48 hours by a further period of 48   hours. It is unclear whether the court will make this assessment <i>ex proprio motu </i>or on the application of the police officer involved.

<p><a name="st_188"></a>
<a name="50307-16_spnew1"></a><b> Viscount Bledisloe: </b>   Will the Minister explain how the amendment relates to Amendment No. 80? Under Amendment No. 80 when the Secretary of State applies to the court there is an immediate hearing. If the court thinks fit, it can make an immediate control order. So, if the person is thought to be likely to blow up the Houses of Parliament that evening, the court can make a control order to put him under house arrest. That will detain him and render him available to have the notice served on him.
</p>

<a name="50307-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>In what circumstances do you not obtain an immediate control order but you none the less need to arrest the person so that he is available to be given notice? That is my first question. Secondly, as it has now been decided that the court will make control orders of a non-derogating nature, is it intended to extend this new clause in Amendment No. 91 to include non-derogating orders?

<a name="50307-16_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>The analysis of the noble and learned Lord, Lord   Lloyd, is absolutely right about what has to prevail on all the circumstances that we normally know about. These are unusual circumstances. There is a hole to be filled. There is a need to ensure that a person for whom the Home Secretary wishes to issue an order must be available when that order is made. Therefore, as a matter of common sense, the amendment should be carried.

<a name="50307-16_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </b>   I find myself slightly concerned with the amendment. I understand entirely and agree with what the noble and learned Lord, Lord   Morris, said. Clearly, there must be a power to arrest someone where in the end there will be no ability to try him. I realise therefore that he cannot be told on his arrest the evidence on which he has been arrested or the sources from which that evidence comes.
</p>

<a name="50307-16_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>If I correctly understood the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, he was saying that the person will not even be told that he is arrested on the basis that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting he is involved in terrorist-related activity. Is that really so? What is the objection to saying to a person, &quot;You have been arrested. The basis for your arrest is that we believe you to be involved in terrorist-related activity&quot;? The man may say, &quot;Tell me what&quot;. The constable may say, &quot;I am sorry, I am not prepared to do so&quot;, but at least he has been told the general basis on which he is arrested.
</p>

<a name="50307-16_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>The noble and learned Lord was saying that the reason this cannot be done is because there is no suitable offence of being involved in a terrorist offence. If so, is not the answer to make an offence which covers the point, so that he can be arrested in pursuance of that offence, rather than to leave it with him saying, &quot;What have you picked me up for&#151;urinating in the street, being a nuisance at a football match, or what? Or am I said to be a terrorist?&quot;. He must surely have the limited right to know that.

What does the constable say to the person whom he has been told to arrest? After all, if a constable came to me and said, &quot;I am sorry, Lord Tebbit, you are under arrest&quot;, naturally I would say, &quot;What for?&quot;. What does he then say&#151;&quot;I&#039;m afraid I cannot tell you&quot;? What exactly does he say? What are the appropriate words? It would be very interesting to know. I have to assure the Committee, and particularly those Members who are both noble and learned, that the average man in the street thinks that under these circumstances the constable would say to him, &quot;I&#039;m arresting you on suspicion of being involved in a conspiracy to cause explosions&quot;, or something of that kind, and take him down to the station.

What would happen? I shall be fascinated if the noble Baroness will tell us what words the constable would use; why is the approach which the man in the street would expect to be used impossible; or is it that it is a very naughty approach and so we would not like to own up to it ever having been done?

<p><a name="st_193"></a>
<a name="50307-17_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I shall deal with the mischief first. It is likely that in the majority of cases an application would be made before the court and the court would make an order in relation to a person who has been identified as subject to a control order.
</p>

<a name="50307-17_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>That deals with the situation where information may have reached the security or other services that someone is, for example, about to get on an aeroplane. The fear may be that the person has a bomb or other device. Before it is possible to go before the court it is necessary to stop him getting on the plane. Therefore, in those circumstances that person would have to be stopped and detained in some way.

</p>

<a name="50307-17_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>It is anticipated that that person would be notified that they are being arrested and detained pursuant to&#151;if it were to become&#151;the new section of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which permits the Home Secretary to apply to make orders and to detain people where there is a reasonable suspicion and/or&#151;whatever the amendment now says&#151;whether the Secretary or the judge is satisfied on the balance of probabilities about the person. It is perfectly possible to tell the person under which section he is being detained.

</p>

<a name="50307-17_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>We are dealing with the practical situation, as my noble and learned friend Lord Morris points out. It may not be possible to go before the 24-hour duty judge. A <br>&nbsp;<br>

The chap is going up the steps of the aeroplane and you believe that he has a bomb that will blow up the aeroplane, so why on earth not arrest him on suspicion of being about to blow up an aeroplane? That surely is an offence for which someone could be arrested. I imagine that it is. There must be something somewhere in the law. Having arrested him, you could then investigate him for a while. Surely it does not need this Bill to arrest somebody who is on the way up the steps of an aeroplane with a bomb in his pocket.
</p>




<p><a name="st_195"></a>
<a name="50307-17_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   That may not be the best example, but there are all sorts of other examples, such as people having information. The important point that I wished to make is that it may be necessary to stop and/or detain that person to enable due process to take place and come before the court. We are contemplating the situation of the new procedure when the Home Secretary will not of his own motion be able to so confine or restrain a person, but it will be incumbent on him to apply to a judge so to do. Therefore, certain logistical realities may arise in those circumstances, and it is for that lacuna that we seek to provide.
</p>

<a name="50307-17_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>In relation to the issue raised by the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, I shall say what I said earlier in relation to this type of activity. It is not a devolved matter. It is a free-standing power to arrest and detain, which would arise in the context of a reserved matter, such as terrorism. It is not related to a criminal investigation and it is analogous to the powers of arrest and detention in the context of immigration law, which is another reserved matter. Therefore, it is not a case when the devolution issue comes into play.
</p>

<a name="50307-17_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>I can reassure the noble Duke that we have already been in consultation with our colleagues north of the Border.

<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>Let us suppose that the person is flying to somewhere within the jurisdiction with his bomb to blow up the plane. He is not being stopped so that he will be available to be given notice; he is being stopped to prevent the crime. That is what ought to be in the Bill.

</p>




<p><a name="st_197"></a>
<a name="50307-17_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I am bound at this stage by the expression of the Committee&#039; view. The Government do not propose to so extend the power, but we shall have to reflect on the consequences of the vote this afternoon and consider the position further. But we do not at the moment propose to so extend the provisions.
</p>

<a name="50307-17_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>The provisions were limited to deal with the derogating orders only. However, I have to accept that the Committee has decided to conflate the two procedures into one. That is not a view with which the Government agreed&#151;as evidenced by the vote&#151;or may not continue to disagree. We now have to consider that matter.
</p>

<a name="50307-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>Perhaps my example was not the best, as we could use Section 41 provisions if the person actually had a bomb. Let us suppose that a person who was identified as being involved in terrorist activity was about to disappear. It would be important to detain him if the court thought it appropriate. He would become subject to a control order so that we could better control his activity, thereby keeping our citizens safe. It would be nonsensical to have no method by which that person could be so contained, permitting him to disappear and thereby enhance the nature, quality and extent of the threat that he may pose.
</p>

<a name="50307-17_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>Of course, the period is limited to 48 hours. It is reasonably anticipated that within that time the matter could be swiftly brought before a judge who would be able to consider whether such detention by way of a control order is appropriate, to consider the extent to any condition that may apply and either to release or   deal with the individual in a way that was proportionate and in accordance with the outline of the powers herein contained.

</p>

<a name="50307-17_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>That is the practical situation facing us. We think that it would be better to enable the person to be so detained and the matter thereafter speedily dealt with&#151;evidenced by the 48 hours&#151;by the court which would be seized of the matter as soon as reasonably practicable.
</p>

<a name="50307-17_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>The Committee should remember that before derogation the Home Secretary would have to have done a number of things. First, an order has to be laid, which identifies the group or persons against whom the derogation is needed or merited. Secondly, the nature of the conditions that amount to a derogation must be outlined in the order. The Secretary of State then has 40   days in which to bring the matter back to your Lordships&#039; House and the other place. Immediately, and only after he has so laid that order can the Secretary of State apply for an order before the court. Logistically it may take more than a couple of hours to do that. In that time, the person involved may have disappeared. The whole purpose of the provisions is to ensure that that does not happen.

She should have no fear that I differ with her on the need for a provision to ensure that a terrorist or suspected terrorist does not disappear. Of course we all agree with that. But it is a mark of the confusion, the rush and the haste with which this legislation is being brought forward not only that this amendment could have been tabled at this late stage&#151;after all, it should have been discussed in the Commons last week&#151;but also that the noble Baroness, who is normally so absolutely in command of her brief, should have brought forward such an absurdly inappropriate example as that of the man going up the aeroplane steps with a bomb. We all know about him, and about what has happened in the past.

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>Fifty years ago, when I was a young second officer on an aeroplane, I was instructed by the captain to go back and sort out a passenger who appeared to be a threat to the safety of the aeroplane. I took the fire axe with me, I demonstrated to him that it was available, and his behaviour then seemed not to constitute an offence any longer. So I am certainly with the Government in how they approach some of these matters, but it is being done in an unpardonable rush, and 50 years on I might have second thoughts about whether my behaviour was perhaps over the top.

<p><a name="st_201"></a>
<a name="50307-18_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I cannot imagine that anyone would ever suggest that the noble Lord could in any circumstance go over the top. That would be outwith his character, I am sure.
</p>

<a name="50307-18_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>The powers are analogous to the powers of arrest and detention in immigration law, which is another reserved matter. They arise in a very similar way. It is not a criminal matter. My noble friend Lady Gibson is absolutely right in how she describes it; she has not misunderstood. As I have tried to make plain, detainees would be told that Section 91A of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_529"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 529</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Prevention of Terrorism Act was being used, and that my right honourable friend the Home Secretary had made an application for an order in their respect, so they would know precisely why they were being detained. It is right that they would not know all the evidence, but there would be no difficulty in their understanding fully that they were not being detained for their health.
</p>




<p><a name="st_202"></a>
<a name="50307-18_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   I wonder whether the noble Baroness is right in saying that. The definition of &quot;terrorism-related activity&quot; in Clause 1(8) covers somebody who is acting without any intention to encourage terrorism. I do not think that someone whose conduct gives encouragement but who does so unintentionally would have any such knowledge.
</p>




<p><a name="st_203"></a>
<a name="50307-18_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   They would be told, &quot;You are being detained because the Home Secretary is at this very moment applying for an order in relation to the control orders pursuant to the Prevention of Terrorism Act&quot;. People so detained would know that they had been arrested under those terms. As I said earlier, in all these cases the usual provisions regarding facilities for lawyers and such matters will be made, and obviously there will be an opportunity for them to make representations when the matter comes before the court in due course.
</p>

<a name="50307-18_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>To take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord   Tebbit, the whole point of this provision is that we listened very seriously to the comments of Members on our Benches in the other place, and others, who wanted a judge element to be introduced in the case of derogating orders. Having taken that practical issue into account, it became apparent that there would be a possibility of a time lag between the time in which the court could make the order and the time in which the person might disappear. For that reason, having accepted the rationale that a judge-made order will take a little more time&#151;a judge will act more slowly than the Home Secretary could act&#151;it was necessary to insert this provision for the odd case where it may not be possible to get an order from the court first.
</p>




<p><a name="st_204"></a>
<a name="50307-18_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Elton: </b>   Does that continuous availability of the Home Secretary mean that in practice there will be some administrative means by which permission will be given in his name by somebody else? If not, why is he more readily available than members of the judiciary on a rota?
</p>




<p><a name="st_205"></a>
<a name="50307-18_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   There are two factors. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary remains responsible for those issues throughout the whole period in which he remains in that role. As noble Lords would expect, and a number of noble Lords who have been in this position will know, the Home Secretary will get regular briefings on the state of security matters as they pertain to our country. Therefore, it is likely that he will be in a better position to take immediate action, the security services and the <br>&nbsp;<br>

police having identified a particular activity. He will be able to act quickly to ensure that that is brought under control.
</p>

<a name="50307-18_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>It will then be necessary for the Home Secretary to put before the court the evidence upon which he seeks to rely to verify and justify the act that he has so taken, and the court will be able to carry out merit-based scrutiny of derogating orders and decide whether the judgment exercised by the Home Secretary was correct. I will talk about derogating orders, as they are the parts on which we are all agreed, notwithstanding the vote that has just taken place.
</p>




<p><a name="st_206"></a>
<a name="50307-18_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Elton: </b>   Does that mean that the order can be signed only by the Secretary of State in person?
</p>




<p><a name="st_207"></a>
<a name="50307-18_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   It will work in the ordinary way. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary will make the decision, and that decision will be communicated. If the noble Lord is asking whether that can be done only in writing, all of us know of situations where we are contacted over the telephone and decisions are made that are subsequently reduced into writing. But it will be the decision of my right honourable friend the Home Secretary. The Bill provides that, if the Home Secretary should be indisposed for some reason which would make it physically impossible for him so to do, the Secretary of State can act on his behalf.
</p>




<p><a name="st_208"></a>
<a name="50307-18_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Tebbit: </b>   I recollect an occasion while I was, I think, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, when I signed an order under the Prevention of Terrorism Act in relation to Northern Ireland, on the basis of the evidence that was presented to me, because the Secretary of State was not available. I understood that that was the normal rule, and that in this sense &quot;the Home Secretary&quot; means the Secretary of State, and that any Secretary of State may exercise those powers. Is that correct?

<p><a name="st_230"></a>The noble Lord said: I advance this amendment with a degree of trepidation. I shall probably find that, by the time I am half way through the second sentence, I shall be informed by a noble Lord that it is also attached to a subsection which has disappeared from the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50307-19_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>I readily accept, that in the light of our earlier vote, the other amendment to which I shall be speaking in this group, Amendment No. 199, now makes no sense because it places obligations on the Secretary of State in circumstances in which he is no longer in a position to act. The provisions set out in Amendment No. 117 are therefore relevant not to anything done by the Secretary of State, because he is no longer going to make the control order, but to what is done by the court.
</p>

<a name="50307-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>However, the principle is just as important with respect to the court as it is to the Secretary of State. When the control order is issued, the reasons for the making of the order, its renewal or its modification, must be plain to the person who is subject to the order. I do not need to go as far as the European Convention on Human Rights to derive authority for that proposition. I need simply to look at the first chapter of a novel by Mr Kafka, <i>The Trial</i>, for noble Lords to understand exactly why my amendment should be in the statute.
</p>

<a name="50307-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>It goes wholly against all the principles to which we subscribe, as a society based on the rule of law that, if someone is to be restrained in any way, they are not given the reasons. In the context of control orders, for example, if someone is about to be imprisoned as a consequence of surveillance, we may not be in a position to say that that surveillance was conducted by Mr Smith employed by MI5 or MI6 or it may not be appropriate to say that the equipment used in the surveillance was of a certain type produced by a well known telecommunications company.


</p>

<a name="50307-19_para8"></a>

There must be limits on laying those employed to conduct surveillance open to exposure to the wrong people and we must protect the advanced techniques that play a part in our surveillance systems. Within those constraints, however, I suspect that it is the controls that we in your Lordships&#039; House impose by amendment on the rules of the court that will ensure that we reflect the fundamental traditions of our society.

Since it is a subject to which we will be returning when we come to the schedule, as he said&#151;it is all a question of due process&#151;I do not propose to say anything further at this stage.
</p>

<a name="50307-19_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>I will just draw the attention of Members of the Committee to Amendment No. 118, in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Goodhart, which ensures that if a control order, or its renewal or modification, is served upon an individual it should be in a language that he understands, whether it be Welsh or Urdu.   Certainly it should be in a language that he understands, so that he can obey the control order. The importance of this is that the breach of the order is a criminal offence, punishable with up to five years&#039; imprisonment. He must know why he is going to prison&#151;for breaking the order&#151;as well as knowing the contents of the order itself.
</p>




<p><a name="st_232"></a>
<a name="50307-19_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   First, these orders would not differ from ordinary orders in as much as, if there is to be breach, the order would have to state clearly what those acts and/or omissions that the individual would have breached were.
</p>

<a name="50307-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>My second point is about the notice containing a statement explaining why the control order was being imposed, renewed or modified. One of the difficulties in such cases is that the reason for the modification or the control order might be within the ambit of information that cannot be given precisely to the individual. We have already spoken about the procedures and the matters that may be closed information or open. For these reasons, we say that Amendments Nos. 117 and 119 are flawed, because they do not seek to acknowledge closed information, which may be the basis on which the modification is made and, therefore, which may not be able to be disclosed to the individual.
</p>

<a name="50307-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>On Amendment No. 119, which requires the Secretary of State to serve a summary of the case upon which he has relied to the controlled person, there is the same issue as for Amendment No. 118. It will be of the utmost importance for there to be a great degree of clarity on the precise nature of the restrictions and the conditions. That individual should know precisely what he is or is not permitted to do by way of the <br>&nbsp;<br>

control order and the consequences of breach. Those matters could easily be provided in a way that would provide clarity.
</p>

<a name="50307-19_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, talked of notes &quot;intelligible to him&quot;. Those words would apply to each and every order that is made to these or other proceedings. We would say, with the greatest respect, that they are unnecessary.
</p>

<a name="50307-19_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>We accept that, as I think I said in proposing the amendment, that there would be many occasions upon which it would be inappropriate to name the source of the information and the techniques that were used to garner that information. That does not prevent telling the proposed controllee that the reason for the order being issued is because he has been seen to be doing X at a certain place. It seems to be perfectly consistent with protecting our sources to say that.

</p>

<a name="50307-19_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>These are matters that we will be returning to in more detail when we consider Schedule 4, but a lot of our problems on these Benches in relation to all the evidential issues to which control orders give rise would be solved if the Government were prepared to accept that the rules of court would be made by the Lord Chief Justice, on consultation with the Lord Chancellor. This is the reverse of a familiar refrain that we have been listening to during the course of the Constitutional Reform Bill, where it has been the Lord Chancellor making rules after consulting the Lord Chief Justice. The best possible protection that one can give to due process in this Bill is to reverse that situation. It should be the Lord Chief Justice who determines the rules, after consulting the Lord Chancellor, who has this twin role of sitting in the Cabinet, representing both the views of the judiciary to the Cabinet and the views of our political masters to the judiciary. That is an amendment that will come later. If we succeed in getting it, it will wrap up a lot of these issues in an elegant way, and in a way that best protects our fundamental freedoms.

   &quot;CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS AFTER MAKING OF CONTROL ORDER

<br>

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_70"></a>(a)   that the involvement in terrorism-related activity of which that individual is suspected may have involved the commission of an offence relating to terrorism; and

<a name="amdtpar_71"></a>(b)   that the commission of that offence would fall to be investigated by a police force.

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_72"></a>(2)   The Secretary of State must inform the chief officer of the police force that the control order has been made and that this section applies.

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_73"></a>(3)   It shall then be the duty of the chief officer to secure that the investigation of the individual&#039;s conduct with a view to his prosecution for an offence relating to terrorism is kept under review throughout the period during which the control order has effect.

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_74"></a>(4)   Where he considers it appropriate to do so in performing his duty under subsection (3), the chief officer must consult the relevant prosecuting authority.

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_92"></a>(a)   the National Crime Squad were a police force; and

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_93"></a>(b)   references, in relation to that Squad, to its chief officer were references to its Director General.

<a name="amdtpar_94"></a>(7)   In subsection (5)&#151;

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_95"></a>(a)   &quot;the Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency&quot; means the organisation known by that name and established under section 36(1)(a)(ii) of the Police (Scotland) Act 1967 (c. 77); and

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_96"></a>(b)   &quot;the Director&quot; of that Agency means the person engaged on central service (as defined by section 38(5) of that Act) and for the time being appointed by the Scottish Ministers to exercise control in relation to the activities carried out in the exercise of the Agency&#039;s functions.&quot;

<p><a name="st_243"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment relates to criminal investigations after the making of a control order. Earlier today we had a shortened debate on the appropriate involvement of the DPP. We accept that that provision has been passed, although I should make it plain that we do not necessarily accept that that is the best or proper way forward.
</p>

<a name="50307-20_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>The amendment deals with what happens after the making of a control order. As the Government have repeatedly made clear, our preferred option will remain always to prosecute suspected terrorists wherever possible. However, for the reasons that we explained earlier, it is often difficult to mount a case in court in such circumstances because of the sensitivity and inadmissibility of the evidence.
</p>

<a name="50307-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>The Government recognise that after an order is made there will still be a need to review the situation. Amendment No. 126 seeks to allay the concerns that have been expressed that the issue of prosecution will still be reviewed even after a control order has been made. The amendment places a duty on the relevant chief officer to keep under review the investigation of individuals who are subject to control orders during the duration of the order, with a view to their possible <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_538"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 538</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

prosecution for any terrorist-related offence. The chief officer must consult the relevant prosecution authorities where appropriate.
</p>

<a name="50307-20_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>These provisions will ensure that there continues to be active review of the scope for prosecuting an individual throughout the life of any control order. The amendment reflects existing practice. There is already a regular assessment of whether there is any prospect of prosecution. This assessment is carried out by the law enforcement agencies in consultation with the prosecution authorities as appropriate. I should emphasise that decisions on prosecution are for the relevant prosecution authorities.

</p>

<a name="50307-20_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>Anticipating questions that may be raised by the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, in relation to Scotland, I should make it plain that we have consulted the Scottish authorities. For Scotland, the relevant prosecution authority is currently defined as the Lord Advocate. However, we have been advised by the authorities in Scotland that the correct person is the procurator fiscal who has operational responsibility for investigating and prosecuting crimes occurring in his or her jurisdiction.
</p>

<a name="50307-20_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>The relationship between the police and the prosecutor in Scotland is well established. It is an appropriate and common practice for the police to consult the relevant procurator fiscal in such cases, and particularly in cases of serious crime. Thus the operational position in Scotland is more accurately and appropriately reflected in legislation by a reference to the procurator fiscal.
</p>

<a name="50307-20_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>I hope that I have pre-empted the question that the noble Duke might have asked. I beg to move.

<a name="50307-21_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   I am most grateful to the noble Baroness for introducing the amendment. As she rightly says, we have, as a result of an earlier vote, given the Director of Public Prosecutions a responsibility which precedes rather than follows the imposition of the control order. Therefore, we believe that Amendment No. 126 should be placed on the face of the Bill but be slightly redrawn to make it consistent with the wording of our successful amendment.
</p>

<a name="50307-21_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>We believe, in particular, that if the DPP informs the court at the outset that a prosecution is not possible, nevertheless, following the imposition of the control order, the possibility of prosecution should remain under review. I sense that that is fundamentally what Amendment No. 126 is intended to achieve.

</p>

<a name="50307-21_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>I would prefer to see the responsibility in Amendment No. 126 to continue to be that of the DPP. I am uneasy about any deciding responsibility being on the shoulders of the chief officer of the particular policing area in which the alleged threats to security took place. But I accept, of course, that the police may well play an important role in furnishing the DPP with the additional evidence that he may need to change his mind.
</p>

<a name="50307-21_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>While not opposing the amendment today, I should like to think that, between now and the Report stage, the Government will look at the Committee&#039;s earlier amendment and seek to re-craft Amendment No. 126 so that it conforms with the intention that has already been expressed by the Committee.

<a name="50307-21_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   The role of the DPP is one of making decisions whether to prosecute; he is not responsible for preventative orders. We feel very strongly indeed that it will be important for the DPP to maintain his independence from the Home Secretary. That was our view before the vote. Of course we shall consider the issue but I need to make it clear that, by virtue of the vote today, the Government do not assent to the change in that division of responsibility.
</p>




<p><a name="st_246"></a>
<a name="50307-21_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   We are entirely in agreement on the matter of principle which the noble Baroness has just expressed. We do not want to see anything on the face of the Bill that compromises the independence of the DPP. But, with great respect to the noble Baroness, that is not the intention that we on these Benches seek. The DPP looks at the evidence and, independently of the Secretary of State, decides in the first instance to advise the court whether or not a prosecution is possible.
</p>

<a name="50307-21_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>We wish the DPP to go on making these investigations after the control order has been imposed, entirely independently of the Secretary of State, to see whether a prosecution might be initiated in two, three or four weeks, or in two, three or four months, after the control order has been imposed.
</p>

<a name="50307-21_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>This has absolutely nothing to do with the Secretary of State. It is something that the DPP does entirely independently of the Secretary of State. Indeed, those are the only circumstances in which we would be prepared to accept the control order system. Once incarcerated or restrained in any way, the primary right of every British citizen is to be able to fight his or her case out in the criminal courts. Just because a control order has been made, that does not in any way entitle the DPP, under the Bill, to resile from his obligations to go on looking for an opportunity to bring the person under the control order to trial in the normal way.
</p>




<p><a name="st_247"></a>
<a name="50307-21_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   I agree with everything my noble friend Lord Kingsland said.

The control order should be the last resort.
</p>

<a name="50307-21_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>I wish to pursue the questions that I put to the Lord Chancellor last week in respect of Scotland. I am still not clear about this and perhaps the Minister can tell me the result of the consultations that have obviously gone on since then within Scotland.

</p>

<a name="50307-21_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>I notice that my noble friend Lord Lang, who was also Secretary of State for Scotland, is here. My recollection is that in the good old days before devolution&#151;before we had a Scottish Parliament&#151;when we had administrative devolution, if a procedure of this nature was being carried out in Scotland the Secretary of State for Scotland would be involved.
</p>

<a name="50307-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>Looking at the amendment as drafted there does not seem to be any involvement by any of the people who are democratically accountable in Scotland. The Minister <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_540"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 540</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

said that the law officers would not be involved and that it would be a matter for the procurators fiscal. I find it extraordinary that where draconian powers are being taken we have a proposal&#151;from a Government who say that they want decisions affecting Scotland to be made in Scotland&#151;that marginalises the law officers of Scotland and the First Minister and the Ministers in the Scottish Parliament, who do not seem to be at all involved in the process.
</p>

<a name="50307-21_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>Am I misunderstanding the situation? Will the Minister make it clear whether the proposal has been discussed with the First Minister and the law officers in Scotland and whether they have given their agreement to the procedure? If they have, it is extremely odd.
</p>




<p><a name="st_248"></a>
<a name="50307-21_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I should make it absolutely clear that terrorism is not a devolved matter and it never has been. Terrorism remains with Westminster. As a result there will be consultations on how orders will be implemented but they do not need the consent of the devolved administration in Scotland, because these matters have not been devolved but are reserved.
</p>

<a name="50307-21_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>I have already made it plain that the Secretary of State who acts on these matters in the normal way on behalf of the United Kingdom will be the Home Secretary. Of course it is possible for any Secretary of State to be substituted for the Home Secretary if the need arises. I can reassure the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, that colleagues have been consulted about the measures and there is no dissent from Scotland.
</p>




<p><a name="st_249"></a>
<a name="50307-21_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   I am sure that there is no dissent&#151;this Government brook no dissent&#151;and what the Minister says about terrorism not being a devolved matter is correct. My point was that prior to devolution if such an action was being taken the Secretary of State for Scotland would have been consulted and involved. I am simply asking the Minister to confirm that the position now is that no Scottish Minister or law officer will be involved in any way; and that those Ministers have been consulted and have given their agreement to the procedure.

</p>

<a name="50307-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>The Minister is looking irritated but this is an important matter. We have a separate legal system in Scotland and separate Scottish law. The Government chose to change the rules by bringing in the Scottish Parliament. Up to now the operation of these security measures has involved the Secretary of State for Scotland and officials in what was then called the Scottish Office; that appears to have disappeared completely. We need to know that because it is important that people understand where accountability lies.

responsible for prosecution of offences in Scotland. If there is to be some analogy he is the responsible person for the whole of prosecutions in Scotland; just as the Director of Public Prosecutions is in England and the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland is for Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="50307-21_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>Perhaps the Government might like to reconsider this point because I regard as inappropriate the idea of the Home Secretary referring to some office in Scotland where there was a procurator fiscal with responsibilities directly related to the prosecution of a serious offence that would normally be prosecuted by the Lord Advocate through his Crown counsel.

I was deeply worried to see in various parts of the Bill reference to the appropriate procurator fiscal or the procurator fiscal in relation to Scotland by comparison with the Director of Public Prosecutions in other parts of Great Britain and Northern Ireland where different jurisdictions are involved.

<a name="50307-21_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Lang of Monkton: </b>   Before the noble Baroness replies, I would like to endorse the remarks of my noble friend Lord Forsyth and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cameron of Lochbroom, the former Lord   Advocate. It is surprising that at the same time as bringing in devolution in Scotland the Government have now brought in some form of reverse upward devolution; whereas extensive consultation and involvement did take place in that respect, even though those matters are not now devolved.
</p>

<a name="50307-21_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>It is all the more surprising since the present Lord Chancellor is the third Scottish holder of that post.

I am grateful for the clarifications brought out by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cameron. I was interested that in a reply to an earlier question the Minister seemed a little unsure about approaching the procurator fiscal, but she tried to make a rather more robust argument than in this reply.
</p>

<a name="50307-22_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>In following up the questions raised by my noble friend Lord Forsyth, it interests me as a curiosity that we have nominally a Secretary of State for Scotland in the Government. I do not know what role he would have. While looking at the provision earlier when our impression was that the Home Secretary might be trying to give directions to a chief constable, the Law Society of Scotland raised with me that at the same time he would have given information to the Lord   Advocate. We are now saying in a stronger way that the Lord Advocate is the more senior law officer and that is perhaps where the process should begin.
</p>




<p><a name="st_253"></a>
<a name="50307-22_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   First I will clear up the   concern over consultation of the noble Lord, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_542"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 542</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Lord   Forsyth. We accept and rejoice at the fact that devolution has taken place and that Scotland has so nobly discharged her responsibilities in that regard. The reality means that those matters that are properly devolved have been devolved. The Secretary of State for Scotland remains a full member of Her Majesty&#039;s Cabinet. The decisions as to the full nature of the legislation are government decisions, which would include the Secretary of State for Scotland in consideration as a full member of that Cabinet.
</p>

<a name="50307-22_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>Secondly, your Lordships will see that the first draft of these provisions included the Lord Advocate. That was at the instigation of our Scottish colleagues following consultation. We were subsequently told by them that the Lord Advocate was not the appropriate person and in his stead should be substituted procurators fiscal for the following reasons. The chief officer of the relevant force&#151;not the Secretary of State&#151;will consult the procurators fiscal in each area. Of course, the duty is placed on the relevant authorities to keep the matter of prosecution under review. That link between the chief officer and the individual procurators fiscal, who will be responsible for the prosecution, means that it is structured in that way.
</p>

<a name="50307-22_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>How such matters should best be expressed to meet the Scottish construct has been considered in full consultation with our Scottish colleagues, so that the provisions best reflect what they believe is most appropriate for Scotland. I can certainly say to the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, that these consultations continue, as is proper, but perhaps Scotland is enhanced in her ability to act in a way that she deems appropriate on those matters that are devolved. In no way do they undermine the nature of consultation that takes place before we put in place UK-wide provisions.

</p>




<p><a name="st_255"></a>
<a name="50307-22_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   No, the Secretary of State will not contact procurators fiscal. It would be quite improper for him to do so. The chief officer, whose proper duty it is to consider such matters, will be the person responsible for contacting the procurators fiscal.   One may fundamentally misunderstand the necessary separation but it has to take place for the democratic situation that we now have to continue, with independent separation of prosecution away from the Secretary of State.

That means that the First Minister of Scotland, who is democratically accountable for the Justice Department and for the police service in Scotland, is not involved in the process at all and will know nothing about it, whereas in the past the Secretary of State for Scotland was involved.
</p>

<a name="50307-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>The Minister is raising her eyes as though this is a minor matter. These are very important considerations. In the past the Secretary of State for Scotland had responsibility for police forces in Scotland. There are great sensitivities about this matter. It seems to me that these provisions bring in a very novel procedure, which effectively leaves out of the equation the law officers, who, as has been pointed out, are the prosecuting authority. These days the title &quot;Secretary of State for Scotland&quot; seems to be more a ceremonial title than anything else; it is as relevant as &quot;Keeper of the Great Seal&quot; was as part of the previous title of the Secretary of State for Scotland. The Secretary of State has no interaction with the Justice Department or the police because those are devolved matters.
</p>

<a name="50307-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>Here we have all the ingredients for mistakes to be made and for offence to be created within Scotland by pursuing these procedures, which appear to be a great departure from what we have had in the past, when we have had some local, democratic control of those kinds of activities which, by their nature, are not perhaps always in the public domain.
</p>




<p><a name="st_257"></a>
<a name="50307-22_spmin1"></a><b>The Earl of Onslow:</b>  Perhaps I may introduce a totally different issue. By this amendment the prosecuting authorities are to continue to look for evidence. That is perhaps how it can be best pr&#233;cised. If they come up with evidence to show that a man has had nothing to do with a situation, and he is not really called Abdul al-Smith, but he is actually an elder of the kirk in Ullapool or somewhere, I hope that evidence will be reported back as soon as possible, the chap released as soon as possible and the mistake admitted. The evidence has to be evidence of either conviction or innocence. Both are equally important matters of evidence.
</p>

<a name="50307-22_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>It is not the slightest bit surprising that Scottish devolution is returning to haunt Ministers by such little matters coming out of the woodwork and making the whole situation look odd and difficult. If I am allowed to mix metaphors, that particular egg in the cuckoo&#039;s nest was waiting to hatch.

<a name="50307-23_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   Of course, I understand that Amendments Nos. 129 and 139 provide the Secretary of State with the right to appeal against the court if it decides not to modify the control orders. Amendment No. 129 refers to non-derogating control orders and I believe it is based on the assumption that   all control orders will be made by the court. Amendment No. 139 refers to derogating control orders. I do not believe I need to repeat the arguments in favour of the Secretary of State making the non-derogating control orders because we have to bear in mind the effect of the matters that have already been dealt with. In the ordinary way, we would be suggesting on behalf of the Government that these amendments should be rejected because they are outwith the construct that we have.

<a name="50307-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>We say that Amendment No. 139 could also be rejected because it seeks to give the right of appeal from the first-instance court decision&#151;for example, to the Court of Appeal in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and the Inner House of the Court of Sessions in Scotland&#151;but we say that that is unnecessary as, in any event, there would be a right of appeal to the Court of <br>&nbsp;<br>

It amends that reference in the light of government Amendment No. 55, which preserves the same test as currently in the Bill, but in the proposed amended structure.

&quot;(   )   The Secretary of State shall compensate a controlled person for any loss or damage unreasonably caused by an order or its renewal which is quashed, or by an obligation which is quashed.&quot;

<p><a name="st_264"></a>The noble Lord said: I will say something about this, because it is dealt with in both Clause 7 and Clause 8. Since we are now moving towards a single procedure, the principle that lies behind the amendment is important, and I want to speak to it briefly.

</p>

<a name="50307-23_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>The amendment is aimed at a set of circumstances in which a control order is issued and then subsequently quashed, and, while it is in place, damage is unreasonably caused as a consequence of its imposition. Many of the consequences of the restraints that are sought to be imposed in Clause 1(3) will imply serious financial costs for the person who is the target of the control order. If that person incurs those costs unreasonably, it seems only right to us that he or she ought to be appropriately compensated. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_265"></a>
<a name="50307-23_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   I wholly support this amendment, although the whole of Clause 7 will fall shortly. It is important that compensation should be paid, when one of the controls suggested for a control order is a prohibition on a person carrying out his business or trade. It is not compensation for the loss of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_546"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 546</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

liberty but for actual financial loss, which should be recompensed to the person who has suffered it. I hope the Government will accept the amendment when it comes in the next clause.
</p>




<p><a name="st_266"></a>
<a name="50307-23_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   This is an important point. We will, however, not accept the amendments. The High Court already has power to award costs in court proceedings, and the rules relating to costs will apply in future to parties to control order proceedings. However, this is a more profound issue than simply costs. I do not think costs are a difficulty.

</p>

<a name="50307-23_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>The High Court also has the power to award damages, either under the Human Rights Act 1998 with regard to breaches of convention rights, or at common law&#151;for example, with the remedy for trespass to land or to the person, or false imprisonment. The circumstances in which they could award that would depend upon the circumstances of the application for the order and the   making of that order. We do not think it would be right in those circumstances to establish a statutory right   to compensation for loss or damage resulting from the imposition of control orders. If such an order is unlawfully made and subsequently quashed, that individual may, depending on the facts, bring a separate action for damages for any breaches of his convention rights, and so on. In those circumstances, we do not think it is either right or necessary to make provision in the Bill.

I wonder whether there are any considerations to which the noble and learned Lord would like to refer that might make it difficult to investigate the unreasonableness of the initial order? We are not talking about whether loss   has been suffered. That is demonstrated by my example of a man being ordered not to work. He proves his loss. The issue, I think, is whether that loss was unreasonably caused by the seeking of the order in the first place, which may take us into the heartland of extreme sensitivity. Does he have any observations to make about that?

<a name="50307-23_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   Of course, it might take us into the heartland of extreme sensitivity.

I am saying, in effect, &quot;Don&#039;t create a special statutory regime. Leave the common law of the Human Rights Act to deal with it&quot;. I say that that would be sufficient.

</p>

<a name="50307-24_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>However, I recognise that the noble Lord is looking for more assurance. As he knows, I am obliged to consult the Lord Chief Justice about the rules.

If there is any disagreement between myself and the Lord Chief Justice&#151;although I would have to consult with the noble and learned Lord about this&#151;the best way to reassure the noble Lord might be for that disagreement to be made public, but I cannot give that assurance until I have spoken to the Lord Chief Justice.
</p>




<p><a name="st_277"></a>
<a name="50307-24_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   I was going to ask whether I could probe these matters further, but I think the noble and learned Lord has given me the answer to what would have been my question in the second half of his last sentence.
</p>

<a name="50307-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>The noble and learned Lord has plainly not yet consulted the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice about the rules. We are now moving towards the middle of Monday evening; this Bill is due to leave your Lordships&#039; House by about the same time tomorrow. It is absolutely crucial that we know much more about what is likely to appear in that first set of rules. I urge the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor to make an early telephone call to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice to try and throw some clearer light on many dark corners that have emerged as a result of the contents of the schedule.

<p><a name="st_278"></a>
<a name="50307-24_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord   Kingsland, will know that the rules for SIAC address a very similar area, so he will know the broad shape of the rules. But I am as keen as I possibly could be to give the noble Lord the assurance he seeks.
</p>




<p><a name="st_279"></a>
<a name="50307-24_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   Unlike the operation of SIAC, Article 6 applies to the control order system. Well, the noble and learned Lord says that only Article 6(1) applies, but, with great respect, I believe that he is wrong.

</p>

<a name="50307-24_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>It is clear that the SIAC rules will not do. The European Court of Human Rights has decided that Article 6 does not apply at all to immigration tribunals and the law that is based on immigration tribunals. The reason for that is that no civil rights in those proceedings are in issue. But civil rights are in issue here and, what is more, we cannot escape the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights that says if a criminal penalty is dressed up as a civil penalty, nevertheless those proceedings are criminal and bring with them all the protections that Article 6 contains.
</p>

<a name="50307-24_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>The rules that the noble and learned Lord will agree with the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice will have to respect the principles set out in Article 6. That is quite a different situation from SIAC.

<p><a name="st_280"></a>
<a name="50307-24_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   At the heart of the noble Lord&#039;s point is the question, &quot;Can we see a copy of the rules?&quot;. We are working as hard as we can on this. I can give no assurances about when they will be produced, but they are in a moderately advanced state of preparation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_281"></a>
<a name="50307-24_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   I hope that Article 6 principles are applied to the rules.

It is not just a question of civil obligations when you are depriving people of their liberty, whether to a large or a small degree.
</p>

<a name="50307-24_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>This debate is going further and further away from the amendment, which I should like to focus on again. The noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, made a very important point about the way in which the court will be looking at possibly secret material. In fact, in the new clause that we passed in Amendment No. 80, if it revokes an order, the court may,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a>&quot;direct that the Act is to have effect as if the order had been quashed&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="50307-24_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>It seems only sensible that where compensation is to be paid, it should be paid within the system. A person who succeeds in quashing a control order should have his claim for compensation determined at the same time so that if there is material that cannot be disclosed to him, the same procedures are applied. The noble and learned Lord suggested that instead of doing that, the person who has the order quashed should start fresh proceedings in the High Court. That would be a complete waste of time and would give rise to all the problems to which the noble Lord, Lord Neill, pointed.

He is of course right&#151;indeed, I can go further on that issue. Rules and procedure of the Court of Session are a devolved matter. I could not make the rules for the Court of Session. It has been agreed, and it is reflected in the Bill, that the Lord President of the Court of Session should make the rules. Unlike the position of the Lord Chief Justice and the Lord Chief Justice in Northern Ireland, the normal ways of making the rules would not permit the rules to be ready in time. The Lord President will make the rules in Scotland because this is a devolved matter, unlike&#151;and I hardly dare stray back into this area&#151;terrorism, which is not a devolved matter.

<a name="50307-25_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   The problem that we have is with timing. We need these rules extraordinarily quickly. The first set of rules, which the Lord Chancellor will make in England and the Lord President will make in Scotland, can be made within the time by applying the usual processes in Scotland, but not in England. As I indicated in answer to questions asked by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, the rules are in a moderately advanced state of preparation. I will try to make them available as quickly as I possibly can.

five O-levels&#151;which is all I have&#151;and no university training, that shows what a serious muddle the Government are in. This provision would have the Chief Justice of Scotland and the Chief Justice of Northern Ireland making the rules judicially. In England, they would be made politically. That is a muddle. If the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor cannot see that perhaps he did not deserve to pass his O-levels let alone go to university. This is exactly what I mean by a muddle.
</p>




<p><a name="st_290"></a>
<a name="50307-25_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   The noble Earl puts his point with extreme clarity as ever. Surely, the fact that we have not reserved terrorism but have reserved the rules of the Court of Session is what the devolution settlement is. In dealing with the Bill before us, we must respect the devolution settlement. That is what we are doing.
</p>

<a name="50307-25_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor. I am endeavouring to be helpful. This may be a false point and, as he knows, I am not a lawyer. I understand that this is a devolved measure. Indeed, that was my question. But as I understand it, in respect of all devolved functions by the Scottish Parliament, it must act in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights. How can it provide for a set of rules of procedure unless the rules are totally consistent with the European convention? That is what is making my brain hurt.
</p>




<p><a name="st_292"></a>

<p><a name="st_293"></a>
<a name="50307-25_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   Since the rules are going to be extremely important and will depart from traditional practices in a number of important ways, is it not important that Parliament should have some control over them? I quite understand the importance of getting them very quickly indeed, but would this not be an appropriate occasion on which it would be proper to use the procedure which is used from time to time in which the rules could come into effect immediately but would cease to have effect unless they were approved by both Houses within 40 days?
</p>




<p><a name="st_294"></a>
<a name="50307-25_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   May I give that proposal some thought? Our problem with it would be getting them in force in time. If there is a means by which they can be properly looked at, we will certainly consider it, so I will certainly take that suggestion away.

</p>

<a name="50307-25_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>I will return to the human rights issue, because although the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, is not a lawyer, behind him is the former Lord Advocate, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, who was looking quizzical about the point that I made. I was asserting that the rules of court would have to be, in Scotland, in England and Wales and also in Northern Ireland, consistent with convention rights. I suspect that the noble and learned Lord&#039;s concern was that that was an unusual procedure. How could it be consistent with <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_552"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 552</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the ECHR, particularly when the position would be that some of the material would not have been made available to the person who was the subject of the control order?
</p>

<a name="50307-25_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>The noble and learned Lord will know that, in the Chahal case in 1997, the ECHR stated that, when we were dealing with deportation&#151;as in that case&#151;and certain stuff might harm national security, using the special advocate procedure would make it consistent with the human rights convention subject to other factors. On two occasions, the courts in this country have looked at the SIAC procedure with reference to Article 6. On two separate occasions the courts have said that it is consistent with the convention in essence. What they are saying is that, as long as the procedure allows the court to look at it, and there is a special advocate on behalf of the suspect, it is okay.
</p>




<p><a name="st_295"></a>
<a name="50307-25_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Lloyd of Berwick: </b>   Is the Lord Chancellor is referring to the Rehman case, which is the leading case on the subject and was a deportation case? There is an essential difference between such a case and other cases. So far as I know, no court has yet decided that the SIAC procedure would be good under the European convention if applied by a court.
</p>




<p><a name="st_296"></a>
<a name="50307-25_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   I will read from the case of &quot;A&quot; in the Court of Appeal which then went to the House of Lords on the other point but not on this particular point. The following quotation is from paragraph 57 of the judgment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf. I appreciate that people should look at the whole case rather than reading only a paragraph. I will not give the citation but people can look it up. The noble and learned Lord stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a>&quot;As to this, I agree with the commission that the proceedings are not criminal&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-25_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>It should be remembered that these are proceedings that lead to someone being put in prison. He continued:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47"></a>&quot;I would, however, accept the fact that proceedings are civil proceedings within Article 6&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-25_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>so Article 6 applies. He went on to say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a>&quot;However, having regard to the issues to be inquired into, the proceedings are as fair as could reasonably be achieved. It is true that the detainees and their lawyers do not have the opportunity of cross-examining the closed material. However, the use of separate counsel to act on their behalf in relation to the closed evidence provides a substantial degree of protection. In addition, in deciding upon whether there has been compliance with Article 6, it is necessary to look at the proceedings as a whole including the appeal before this court. When this is done and the exception in relation to national security referred to in Article 6 is given due weight, I am satisfied there is no contravention&quot;.</p>

<a name="50307-25_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor must know that that the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords reserved the position in relation to Article 6. The committee found it unnecessary to come to any conclusion on it and reserves the position entirely.

</p>




<p><a name="st_300"></a>

The first is in relation to the question asked by my noble friend Lord Forsyth. In my submission to the noble and learned Lord, there are at least two distinctions between the Scottish situation and our own. The first is that the rules in Scotland will be decided judicially and here they will derive from the noble and learned Lord&#151;he might say quasi-judicially, but certainly not wholly judicially. Secondly, in Scotland, if those rules do not conform with Article 6, they will be struck down by the courts. In this country, the courts can only go as far as making a declaration of incompatibility.

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo050307/text/50307-26.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_305"></a>
<a name="50307-26_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   Whichever way the noble and learned Lord looks at it, a court in this country will not strike down a procedure that is held to be contrary to Article 6. The furthest that it can go is to make a declaration of incompatibility.
</p>

<a name="50307-26_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>On the long line of jurisprudence that the noble and learned Lord cited about Article 6 one thing is clear. In so far as the SIAC procedure has dealt with the deportation of aliens, or the incarceration of aliens because to deport them would breach Article 3 of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_554"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 554</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

European Convention on Human Rights, it is clear that Article 6 rights do not apply to them because under the court system, civil rights are not in issue. In my submission, if our own courts looked at the application of Article 6 rights to British citizens&#151;whatever else you can do with British citizens, you cannot deport them&#151;I believe the answer would be wholly different.
</p>




<p><a name="st_306"></a>
<a name="50307-26_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </b>   Is not my noble friend Lord Kingsland absolutely right about this? As I am sure the noble and learned Lord will recollect, when the Scotland Act 1998 was brought into force, one of the provisions in that statute was that the European Convention on Human Rights should be brought into force with immediate effect. The fact of the matter was that it was brought into effect in Scotland a year before it was brought into effect in the rest of the United Kingdom. In such circumstances, if my noble and learned friend Lord Cullen was dumb enough to introduce rules into the Court of Session which were in some respects not compliant with the European convention, other members of that court would strike them down. That must be the case. It is not a matter, as my noble friend Lord Kingsland says, that it might be compliant, or there could be some judgment of non-compliance; it has to comply under the law.
</p>

<a name="50307-26_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>What I am struggling to understand is the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor saying, &quot;We can sort of do it in England and we shall try to ensure that it complies with the European convention&quot;. What we in Scotland are trying to be clear about concerns the absolute requirement in law that what is introduced in Scotland is compliant with the European Convention. There can be no doubt or grey area about that which the courts might sort out sooner or later.
</p>

<a name="50307-26_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>I am surprised that the noble and learned Lord did not listen to what the noble and learned Lord, Lord   Cullen, said in a most interesting intervention during the Constitutional Reform Bill when he pointed out, absolutely correctly, that there is no such thing as a decision of the House of Lords in its judicial capacity; there is a decision of the House of Lords in a Scottish case, or a decision of the House of Lords in an English or some other case. Lawyers are not that dumb. If there is a decision by the court in England in an English appeal by the House of Lords, it is to be expected, if they are going to be consistent, that they will come to much the same or exactly the same conclusion in Scotland. Nevertheless, there are two separate sets of appeals.
</p>

<a name="50307-26_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>What is fascinating about this debate is that it underlines and highlights for the first time that we have a statute passed by this Parliament in 1998 which said, &quot;You must secure compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights in Scotland&quot;. However, it does not say the same thing for England and the rest of the United Kingdom. That is what we are trying to tease from the noble and learned Lord, to understand exactly what the situation is.

<p><a name="st_307"></a>

entirely that rules promulgated by the Lord President must comply with the European convention and, if they do not, they can be struck down by the Court of Session or, indeed, by any other court that looked at them. Secondly, the rules promulgated by the Lord Chancellor, having consulted with the Lord Chief Justice, also have to comply with the European Convention because they are not primary legislation. It is not a question of whether or not a declaration of incompatibility is given. Short of primary legislation, a public authority in England and Wales cannot act incompatibly with the European convention.
</p>

<a name="50307-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>I am sorry that I did not make it clear before&#151;this is entirely my fault&#151;that I agreed entirely with proposition number one and proposition number two. The third proposition that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, made was that I should have listened to what the Lord President, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cullen, said about there being no such thing as a decision of the House of Lords sitting in a judicial capacity. I say with great humility that I did listen to what the noble and learned Lord, Lord   Cullen, said, and I agreed with him an amendment to the Constitutional Reform Bill that I then put before this House. This House agreed with it because it also listened to what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cullen, said. I always listen to what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cullen, says.

<a name="50307-26_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   Has not the Committee slightly lost the track of this debate? Surely we should be talking about the merits of the rules that are ultimately put forward. All sorts of rules could be compliant with the European convention without commending themselves to this House or to any other House. I must confess that non-lawyers listening to this debate must wonder where we are getting to. Surely merit is what we are talking about, not the European convention.

I promise that this will be the last time that I rise to my feet in the course of discussing this amendment. Will the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor guarantee that out of all this we will find a set of rules which are the same in England, in Scotland and in Northern Ireland? It would be quite intolerable if the rights given to, or obligations imposed on, potential controllees differed from one part of the United Kingdom to another. Quite apart from whatever these rules are going to be, can I have the noble and learned Lord&#039;s assurance that they will all say the same thing?

<a name="50307-26_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions  (Baroness Hollis of Heigham) </b>  rose to move, That the draft order laid   before the House on 1 February be approved [<i>8th Report from the Joint Committee</i>].
</p>




<p><a name="st_314"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I beg to move that the draft Social Security Benefits Up-rating Order 2005 and the draft Guaranteed Minimum Pensions Increase Order 2005, which were laid before this House on 1 February, be approved. I am satisfied that both these instruments are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.
</p>

<a name="50307-26_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>As your Lordships are aware, these draft orders are a routine annual event but nevertheless they are an important part of DWP business. The uprating order will, as usual, increase most benefits from April in line with the retail prices index for national insurance benefits and the Rossi index for income-related benefits.
</p>

<a name="50307-26_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>For the 12 months ending in September the retail prices index rose by 3.1 per cent and, in the same period, the Rossi index rose by 1 per cent. The Guaranteed Minimum Pensions Increase Order sets out the amount by which contracted-out occupational pension schemes must increase members&#039; guaranteed minimum pensions which accrued between 1988 and 1997.
</p>

<a name="50307-26_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>Where the annual increase in the retail prices index exceeds 3 per cent, the guaranteed minimum pensions indexation requirement is capped at that level under the primary legislation. This year&#039;s order therefore <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_557"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 557</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

provides for an increase of 3 per cent. The estimated cost of uprating benefits for 2005&#150;06 is &#163;2.92 billion. Of that, &#163;2.1 billion goes to pensioners. Some &#163;440 million is for disabled people and their carers, around &#163;300 million is for working age people and &#163;80 million is for children, of which &#163;60 million is above inflation.
</p>

<a name="50307-26_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>I shall first spend a moment on the subject of pensions. We continue to show our commitment to tackling pensioner poverty. In this order, we are again doing more for older people. We have kept to our guarantee to uprate the basic state pension by the higher of 2.5 per cent or the increase in RPI. Uprating this year is in line with the RPI at 3.1 per cent. This will give an increase of &#163;2.45 to &#163;82.05 per week for a single pensioner, and of &#163;3.95 to &#163;131.20 per week for a pensioner couple. Pensioners have seen a 7 per cent real terms increase in their state pensions as a result of previous above-inflation increases.
</p>

<a name="50307-26_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>We continue to target our resources toward the poorest and the guarantee element of pension credit will increase by 3.8 per cent, in line with earnings. In April, the guarantee will rise from &#163;105.45 to &#163;109.45 a week for a single person, and will increase to &#163;167.05 for a couple. This approach means that by 2008 there will be half a million fewer pensioners in poverty than there would have been if the guarantee had been uprated in line with prices.

</p>

<a name="50307-26_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>The pension credit savings element threshold will increase in line with the basic state pension to &#163;82.05 for a single person and &#163;131.20 for a couple. This savings element ensures that people aged 65 and over who have been able to make modest provision for their income in retirement are rewarded. From April 2005, single people with an income up to &#163;151, and      couples with an income of up to &#163;221, may qualify. There are now 2.65 million households&#151;some 3.22 million individuals&#151;receiving pension credit. Over 1.99 million pensioner households are receiving more money as a result of pension credit, gaining on average &#163;17.46 a week. Pension credit is helping over 2.14 million older women, who form around two thirds of the total beneficiaries.
</p>

<a name="50307-26_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>To help older pensioners with living expenses, including council tax bills, there will be an age-related payment of &#163;50 made with winter fuel payments for 2005&#150;06 to households with someone aged 70 or over. Between 1996&#150;97 and 2002&#150;03, the poorest pensioners have seen their incomes grow at similar rates to the richest pensioners. The incomes of the poorest fifth of pensioner couples have grown by 14 per cent, while the richest fifth saw their incomes grow by 11 per cent.
</p>

<a name="50307-26_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>We will be spending &#163;10 billion extra on pensioners in 2005&#150;06 compared to the 1997 system. Around half of this&#151;&#163;5 billion&#151;will go to the poorest third of pensioners. In 2005&#150;06, pensioner households will be an average of &#163;1,350 per year&#151;about &#163;26 a week&#151;better off as a result of our tax and benefit policies than they would have been under the old 1997 system.

<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>Let me now turn to children and families. To support parents, standard rate statutory maternity pay and maternity allowance will increase from &#163;102.80 to &#163;106.00. By 2007, the maximum maternity pay and child benefits for mothers at home with their first baby will have risen by &#163;5,000 in real terms since 1997. Non-dependant deductions in income-related benefits have again been frozen. This illustrates our constructive response to criticism that they were too high, and will benefit around 190,000 claimants.

<a name="50307-26_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>Our fight against child poverty continues. Families receiving income support and jobseeker&#039;s allowance will continue to benefit from the increased generosity in child tax credits. The child element of the child tax credit will increase to &#163;1,690 a year in April 2005. This is an increase of &#163;245 since its introduction in 2003, and is &#163;65 above this year&#039;s rate. It will benefit over 7   million children in almost 4 million families.
</p>

<a name="50307-26_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>Child allowance will increase from &#163;42.27 to &#163;43.88 and the disabled child premium, which is in addition, will also increase from &#163;42.49 to &#163;43.89. The enhanced disability premium for a child will increase from &#163;17.08 to &#163;17.71.
</p>

<a name="50307-26_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>By 2005&#150;06, total spending on financial support for children will have gone up by over &#163;10 billion in real terms since 1997. Families with children will be, on average, &#163;1,300 a year better off as a result of Government reforms in the tax and benefit systems since 1997. The poorest fifth will be &#163;3,000 a year better off. I am sure that noble Lords will agree that that is significant progress.
</p>

<a name="50307-26_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>In speaking to this uprating order, I have concentrated on the financial situations of pensioners and children.

<p><a name="st_315"></a>
<a name="50307-27_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   My Lords, the pattern of debates in this House in the past few days has become fairly consistent. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor discuss crucial matters of terrorism, life and death, imprisonment without trial, the Human Rights Act and so on but every so often there is a break&#151;at lunchtime or dinnertime&#151;when the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, and I come into our own. Indeed, on occasion it has been rather useful because they have managed to work out what on earth is happening about the other Bill. I find the way in which the Government are proceeding in that matter, and the shambles that the procedure has become from time to time, to be of the gravest concern.
</p>

<a name="50307-27_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>Having said that, one must recognise that the orders that we are debating this evening will have an immediate effect on millions of people, whereas the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_559"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 559</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

other measure, about which I express grave concern, deals with a comparatively small number of people. Clearly, they are both of great importance but one needs to keep what we are debating tonight in perspective, though I regard the implications of the other matter as fundamental to our way of life.
</p>

<a name="50307-27_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>As the Minister has pointed out, this is an annual festival. It is normal for this matter to debated in a wide context, although this evening the Minister has constrained herself within the narrow limits of the orders. Traditionally, the debate has been very broad.
</p>

<a name="50307-27_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>I thought I ought to look up what the Minister said when I first engaged in these annual debates. I think this is the seventh or eighth debate we have had on this matter. But, inadvertently, I found the debate when the Minister was still in opposition. Interestingly, she said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a>&quot;As a way of capping budget, the Government have tried to target benefit on those financially most in need. And because the Minister and his department did not get their heads around the problem, the Government targeted that budget in the simple minded way of extending means testing at the expense of insurance-based budget benefits&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 20/2/1997; col. 848.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-27_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>Well, I suppose one can change one&#039;s mind. Certainly, events since then have not been out of line with the approach that that government were taking.
</p>

<a name="50307-27_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>Given that this is a broad-ranging debate, the Minister rather surprisingly did not refer to the Turner report. One of the many interesting comments made by Turner is:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a>&quot;The UK pension system appeared in the past to work well because one of the least generous state pension systems in the developed world was complemented by the most developed system of voluntary private funded pensions&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-27_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>But, tragically, that balance has been wrecked. I think that that is the right way of putting it. In significant measure, that was done by the action taken by pension funds following the Chancellor&#039;s action on ACT, in conjunction with the concerns that finance directors then had with regard to FRS17. The result is that membership of final salary schemes has halved since 2000. That balance has been wrecked.
</p>

<a name="50307-27_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>Alongside that, we have had the take-over of matters by the Chancellor and the Treasury, who are obsessed with tax credits, although, as we well know, the take-up of tax credits has been very disappointing. This has taken place against a background of three Secretaries of State who might reasonably be regarded as compliant. I therefore take heart from the fact that the present Secretary of State seems to be adopting a rather more independent line on those matters. One might almost say that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Treasury are heretical in these matters. A collection should be made of the various statements made by Mr Alan Johnson in the pensions debate on 13 October.
</p>

<a name="50307-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>The noble Baroness held forth about the virtues of pension credit. But on 13 October the present Secretary of State said that there were no such plans to continue it indefinitely. At the ABI conference he said that he would be crazy to say pensions credit does not act as some disincentive to savings to some people. On <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_560"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 560</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

13 October he also said that we should not be talking in euphemisms&#151;it is a means test. The hallmark of the Government&#039;s policy has been to move more and more towards means testing.
</p>

<a name="50307-27_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>The noble Baroness quoted some figures for pensions credit. They may be more up to date than the ones I had but no doubt she can correct me if I am out of date. Some 3.75 million people are entitled to pensions credit and 2.65 million appear to have taken it up. So it looks as though 1.63 million of those entitled to it have not taken it up. That is a pretty appalling level of take-up for what is intended to be a comprehensive measure.
</p>

<a name="50307-27_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>The noble Baroness has rightly pointed out that uprating is in line with prices and not earnings. This year we have not had an increase of 75p on the pension as a result of the uprating as we had on a previous occasion. I suspect that that is still in the back of pensioners&#039; minds. The extent of the increase seems to have depended considerably on whether an election was thought to be in the offing or not.
</p>

<a name="50307-27_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>I would like to raise one point on the specific notification to individuals. The notification that is going out to pensioners does not say what the increase is&#151;either as a percentage or a quantity. That is rather strange in a pre-election period.
</p>

<a name="50307-27_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>I have in front of me one such notification which has come my way. It does not say that there is an increase of so much or that this will mean your benefits will increase by so much. Clearly the Government have missed out on an electoral opportunity in doing this. It would be helpful in future if people were told what their benefit is currently and what it will be in the future&#151;assuming that the department computer can cope with this which, given our experience of it, may not be the case.
</p>

<a name="50307-27_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>It would be hard for pensioners to work out whether the statements that are being put through their letterboxes are right or not. For example, at the end of a long list of items it suddenly states, &quot;age addition nil&quot;. Most pensioners&#151;particularly elderly ones over 70&#151;would find that hard. The noble Baroness will be able to say that that is the same form which came out under the previous Conservative government and probably the Labour government before that. I was struck by this matter the other day.
</p>

<a name="50307-27_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>I am going on much longer than I intended. The noble Baroness said nothing at all about GMP uprating.
</p>




<p><a name="st_316"></a>
<a name="50307-27_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I gave the noble Lord four sentences on this matter. But I agree that was a modest amount.
</p>




<p><a name="st_317"></a>
<a name="50307-27_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   We appreciate the four sentences.
</p>

<a name="50307-27_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>I am puzzled about GMP. It only affects accrued rights up to 1997 and not thereafter. Is anybody affected by this GMP uprating? Ahead of 1997, I suspect that most firms who were giving pensions did not give the GMP at that time, they were probably giving significantly above it. Can the noble Baroness tell us whether anyone is affected by this order? Were <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_561"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 561</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the ones pre-1997 all uprated more than GMP and since 1997&#151;when we do not have a GMP&#151;a number of companies have totally failed to make a guaranteed minimum pension because they have gone bust. It is proposed that we should go towards a more scheme-related system of solvency assessment. But this order may have no impact on anyone in the real world.
</p>

<a name="50307-27_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>I am conscious of the time so I will make only one other point. The Government are sending out letters about the financial assistance scheme. To my surprise, they are still saying that they will provide &#163;400 million with the possibility of further contributions from industry. That &#163;400 million is over 20 years. We discussed the issue of contributions from industry when we debated the Pensions Bill. Can the noble Baroness tell us whether any part of industry has decided to make any further contributions? I suspect that they have not.
</p>

<a name="50307-27_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>The letter which is sent out gives hope to people who anticipate getting some of their pension made up by the financial assistance scheme in cases where their company has gone bust. I have received a number of letters pointing that out. A pensioner who was with the Albert Fisher Group says that the situation constantly blows hot and cold. They hope they are going to get something but it will not be for a long while. There is &#163;400 million available but they have no idea if they are eligible&#151;and what does that figure mean given the large number of people who are expected to be covered by what we have always said is clearly an inadequate amount? I hope that the noble Baroness will give us up to date news on the financial assistance scheme.
</p>

<a name="50307-27_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>Instead of putting forward specific proposals on reform, the Government are waiting for the Turner report. Interestingly, it has always been clear that the second report of the Turner commission&#151;which would recommend what might be done&#151;is not going to happen until after the election. 


</p>

<a name="50307-27_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>So the Government appear to have no strategic view. Yet, with the exception of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, a clear consensus is emerging that it is important to raise the basic state pension and reduce the number of people on means-tested benefits. We propose to do that. We think it is the right way to tackle the problem. There is an almost universal view outside this House that that should happen, but it is not implemented by the proposals before us this evening.

<p><a name="st_318"></a>
<a name="50307-28_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   My Lords, I feel at some disadvantage in the debate compared with the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, who has received his pension up-rating, very properly looked at it and seen what he has seen. I do not yet receive a pension, but I am sympathetic to the point. It irritates me greatly when I get my car or house insurance renewal and it does not give the previous year&#039;s figure and one has to look in one&#039;s records. So, in principle, that sounds like a good idea and a good request.
</p>

<a name="50307-28_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>I have two or three separate points and questions tonight. I shall deal first with indexation and the points which we discussed in Grand Committee a few days <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_562"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 562</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

ago on the indexation of FAS and the PPF. The noble Baroness was kind enough to respond to the questions I raised and in particular to my surprise at the Secretary of State&#039;s remark that many financial assistance schemes are not index linked. I am bound to say that the reply confirms my surprise at his original remark. It shows that 77 per cent of active members in DB schemes in 1995 were accruing rights with some pre-1997 indexation.
</p>

<a name="50307-28_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a>I shall summarise the reply and hope that the noble Baroness will confirm that I am right. Effectively, it says that it would cost too much to look in and check up on indexation rights accrued since 1997 and pay them. That is not at all the same. I hope that the Minister will accept that and correct the Secretary of State&#039;s statement that any scheme would not have been index-linked at all.
</p>

<a name="50307-28_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a>On the FAS specifically, does the Minister agree with the assessment by that doughty campaigner for the dispossessed, Dr Ros Altmann, that the effect of this permanent non-indexation of pensions to be paid under the FAS would for some mean a cut of up to half of the total money they receive over their retirement?
</p>

<a name="50307-28_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a>I turn now to the question of the citizen&#039;s pension, a matter which the noble Lord has already raised. I am struck by the growing consensus regarding the words used by Dr Lynne Jones in the Commons debate on these orders. She said that she had just been to a Pensions Policy Institute meeting and would prefer it if we had a citizen&#039;s pension entitlement for all pensioners at &#163;105 per week, which obviously would now be &#163;109.45 per week. It seems to me that this is an idea whose time has come. There is a rapidly growing tide of support for it in the pensions and the political world, but that means nothing until it actually sweeps away the bolted and barred doors of the Treasury.
</p>

<a name="50307-28_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, and Members on his Benches that in principle we welcome the move towards support of this scheme. Again, it really does not mean very much if pension credit is going to be linked to earnings under the proposal and if the basic state pension at more or less this level is going to be linked to earnings as well. That means that it will be a very long time before the effect of the rises enables pensioners to be taken off pension credit. While we support the principle, we hope the money will be found to move forward faster on that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_319"></a>
<a name="50307-28_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lord. On his proposal for a citizen&#039;s pension, would that effectively mean the end of the contribution principle? If so, does he think that after the change those who have contributed should get more than those who have not?
</p>




<p><a name="st_320"></a>
<a name="50307-28_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   My Lords, I am happy quickly to clarify that. Yes, it does mean the end of the contribution principle. However, people will all receive the same regardless of whether they have contributed.
</p>

<a name="50307-28_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a>I shall summarise the other issue, on which I shall end. Putting the matter in a slightly wider context, I should like to remind the House and indeed the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_563"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 563</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Government of the power of pensioners today. They are the fastest growing and keenest voting age group. As recently as 1992, a quarter of votes were cast by pensioners. Their turnout was similar to that of other groups.

</p>

<a name="50307-28_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>Last time 35 per cent of votes were cast by pensioners because 70 per cent of them voted compared with 55 per cent for the rest of the population. If you add in the over-55 year-olds&#151;the pension generation, if you like&#151;half the votes in the coming election will be cast by pensioners. Women, who will be in the majority, will be effectively moved in giving their verdict by the muddle and mess of the Government&#039;s pensions policy.
</p>

<a name="50307-28_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a>To end on a positive note, as I look at the Box and the Front Bench, it is refreshing to see the entire government and official position represented by women.

<p><a name="st_321"></a>
<a name="50307-28_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   My Lords, that was an unexpectedly generous tribute from the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, which was very nice indeed.
</p>

<a name="50307-28_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a>Your Lordships have been brief, so I shall try to be, too. I shall take the points as they were raised. The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, asked about waiting for Turner and he gave his usual critique on the failure of   the Government, given ACT&#151;of course, it had nothing to do with ACT&#151;and what he would regard as the &#163;5 million, which actually cost us &#163;3.5 billion, withdrawal of dividend tax credit from pension schemes as responsible, along with FRS 17, for the collapse of DB schemes. The noble Lord knows that that is nonsense.
</p>

<a name="50307-28_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>I do not doubt that pension companies would be financially better off were they to continue to have that &#163;3.5 billion, which represents that they got double payments on top of reclaims on tax paid. The reason why DB schemes failed to continue as expected was to do with the stock market collapse. As a result, the yawning deficits that opened up were compounded by the fact that even as late as 2001&#150;02 many companies were still continuing to take contribution holidays. That is the core of it&#151;that, and the failure of actuaries properly to predict what we now know are more robust longevity figures.
</p>

<a name="50307-28_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>The combination of under-funding, stock market collapse and underestimated longevity produced a structural problem for DB schemes that will take time to remedy, but which may, as the stock market recovers, help to float some of those companies into a better situation. Certainly, the latest figures suggest that there is no longer the flight from DB schemes, but that is not to say that many of them will not continue to struggle until, if, or when the stock market possibly floats them off.
</p>

<a name="50307-28_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>To blame it on a government policy that sought to rectify a tax distortion, while at the same time reduce corporation tax to about the lowest in Europe&#151;about 30p in the pound&#151;is a political point that does not gain in relevance or acuteness the more it is repeated. It is simply daft. We know what collapsed DB schemes, and that was not a significant element.

<a name="column_564"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 564</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50307-28_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a>On the more substantive points, the first being basically a debating point, such as pension credit, means testing, and so on, the noble Lord was right to press me about the number of people claiming. As suspected, his figures are a little out of date but not by much. The latest figures I have are that 3.2 million pensioners are claiming pension credit. We cannot be absolutely sure how many people are entitled but not   claiming, but our best estimate is that possibly 1.7   million may be in that position. Many of those 1.7   million will be failing to claim very small sums of money. They were part of the wave of people who were brought in when pension credit was made more generous, and are at that end of the wave on the beach.

</p>

<a name="50307-28_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a>The significant point is that 3.2 million people are claiming, and it has transformed their living standards. As for the dig about what has been happening to means testing, I am sure that the noble Lord would like to know that in 1994&#150;95, 38 per cent of pensioner households were on income-related benefits, and in 2002&#150;03, the latest figure is 32 per cent. Under this Administration the percentage of pensioner households on income-related benefits, including pension credit, has fallen, even though we have made pension credit more generous, thus bringing in more people. That should be acknowledged.
</p>

<a name="50307-28_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a>Some of the earlier claims of pensioners to income-related benefits were in terms of their dire poverty, but we are now seeing that with pension credit&#151;in particular, the pension-savings credit&#151;there is an increase in comfort. People no longer see a pound for pound withdrawal of their savings because they are no better off than were they on income support.
</p>

<a name="50307-28_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a>On the point about forms, I shall review that matter. The noble Lord is right that it does not say that. The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, also confirmed that. It is a fair point and I shall see whether there is anything that we can or should do about that, so that people know what the old figure was. People who kept last year&#039;s paper will know, but I agree with the noble Lord.

It ensures that companies that produced contracted-out schemes before 1997 could contract out only if a portion of that scheme&#151;we will call it GMP&#151;matched the level of benefit that someone would have got in SERPS.

</p>

<a name="50307-29_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, is right that FAS involves &#163;400 million over 20 years. As he suspected, there have been no contributions from industry. I hope that that will change, but my understanding is that so far it has not.
</p>

<a name="50307-29_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a>As for giving false hopes, we are already, through a Statement to the House&#151;I did my best to ensure that the noble Lords, Lord Higgins and Lord Oakeshott, had a copy&#151;beginning to establish the contours of FAS, such as <i>de minimus</i>, a cap and so on. We have made clear that, as a result, we expect to be able to protect pensioners and those within three years of their scheme retirement age with a figure from FAS that will ensure that their pensions are 80 per cent of the full amount. Obviously it is less generous than under the PPF but it is none the less a substantial form of protection assistance given that the Government have no legal obligation&#151;but, in my view, possibly a moral obligation&#151;to help. We expect in three years&#039; time to review the appropriateness and adequacy of funding and the reach of FAS.
</p>




<p><a name="st_326"></a>
<a name="50307-29_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   My Lords, a lot of concern is expressed by people affected by something that the noble Baroness has not mentioned: the fact that the amount is to be capped, even for those in the period immediately up to retirement.
</p>




<p><a name="st_327"></a>
<a name="50307-29_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   My Lords, money is tight. It seems not unreasonable that FAS is capped at &#163;12,500, which represents a 50 per cent pension before things such as entitlement to S2P, SERPS or the basic state pension are included. That represents a 50 per cent replacement income on average earnings. If money is tight, as it is, it does not seem necessarily appropriate, as the Secretary of State put it, that we should increase the money for those much better off&#151;first, for those who are possibly in a position to make savings for themselves, and, secondly, for the particularly well off, who frankly may have contributed to the failure of their scheme. If money is tight, as it clearly is under FAS, it is reasonable, first, not to have indexation, because if you index you reduce the amount of money available now, and secondly, to cap it at what would be effectively a replacement income of around 50 per cent of average earnings and 80 per cent of what your pension would have been at that point.
</p>

<a name="50307-29_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a>On top of that there is the basic state pension and in some cases SERPS or S2P moneys. That should produce on average, up to average or possibly slightly above that, replacement rates of 60 per cent or so&#151;50   to 60 per cent when you take into account the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_566"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 566</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

80   per cent cap. I do not think that that is ungenerous. I wish that it could be more but we are dealing with a situation of tight finances.

</p>

<a name="50307-29_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a>We have two considerations on indexation. First, some schemes that we are covering have indexation and others do not, and there is a question about whether we should treat schemes even-handedly. Secondly, there is a cost constraint. The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, picked up the point from Dr Ros Altmann about inflation cutting the value of pensions in half over members&#039; lifetime. That depends on what you assume the level of inflation to be. It is certainly true that, during the previous administration under the Tories, had inflation been running at something like 15 per cent, then it would have halved the value of that pension in nine years. If inflation was running at about 10 per cent, it would have halved the value of that pension within about 14 years. If inflation was running at about 2 to 3 per cent, it would have halved in value over about 29 to 30 years.
</p>

<a name="50307-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a>There are obviously implications for the reduction in its real value if it is not indexed. Yet, as I am sure the noble Lord is well aware, what happens in DC schemes&#151;when people take annuities, up to age 75&#151;is that not only do three-quarters of them go for single life, nearly all of them go for flat rate. They do so, understandably, because they prefer the money up front.<i> </i>In that sense, FAS is making that same decision. Had we gone for indexation, there would have been less up front in order to have produced an inflation-proofed increase later on. FAS is thus operating in exactly the same culture and climate as nearly all of those who have to turn their DC money pots into an annuity. They choose a level scheme.
</p>




<p><a name="st_328"></a>
<a name="50307-29_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   My Lords, I agree with the noble Baroness that the principle of capping benefits is right, in a situation where money is clearly tight. However, there was no need to make a cheap political point, at the Conservatives&#039; expense, as to what she might think the rates of inflation would be. The noble Baroness and I will both remember well that under a Labour government, in the 1970s, inflation actually reached nearly 30 per cent. It would be better not to be political with such a long-term thing.
</p>

<a name="50307-29_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a>If someone is on a modest pension&#151;of &#163;6,000, or &#163;8,000, or &#163;10,000&#151;being paid by the FAS, over 20 or 30 years it is a serious cut in that pension. The argument for not indexing at all is not nearly as strong as the argument for a cap.
</p>




<p><a name="st_329"></a>
<a name="50307-29_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   My Lords, I accept the point and I have not tried to challenge in any way the   contention that if you fail to index, depending on the rate of inflation, the value over time will diminish in real terms. While I do not want to make a cheap point about open purses, the point is that if you were to index within the same financial envelope at around 2.5 per cent instead of going for 80 per cent, you would almost certainly have to opt for a substantially lower figure. I cannot do the sums in my head, but it could be as low as 60 per cent. I do not know, but it would be of that order.

<a name="50307-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a>When people who are annuitising their money purchase pots make the decision, they choose to go for level rather than an inflation increase. All I am saying is that they make such choices and it is the choice the Government have made. It is not wrong. Basically, you are taking a punt on both inflation and longevity. It means that if we had produced a lower level of FAS in order to provide indexation protection, those who do not enjoy relative longevity and die before they reach the age of 80 would be much worse off. I suspect that the crossover point would not be reached until the age of about 85. As I have said, this is not the choice that other people make.
</p>

<a name="50307-29_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a>We are dealing with a financial envelope and, given the financial constraints, this seems to be the right decision. As a result the poorest in our society with the shortest life expectancy receive more money than they would have done if they had taken a punt on longevity and therefore the need to protect against it through inflation proofing. We may disagree about it and I can see the arguments on both sides. It is an honourable dilemma. On balance, however, I think that the Government have it right.
</p>

<a name="50307-29_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, went on to talk about the citizen&#039;s pension of &#163;109. He was absolutely right to criticise the Tory policy of having an earnings-linked basic state pension while pension credit would be largely linked to RPI. It would mean that the poorest among us, mostly women, would see their standard of living fall back relative to earnings while men qualifying for the full basic state pension would see their incomes increase. I cannot think that such a whammy on women is something that the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, in his more contemplative moments, would wish to support. Perhaps I may say that I think it is a profound mistake on the part of the Conservative Front Benches.
</p>

<a name="50307-29_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a>The problem with the proposition set out by the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, for a citizen&#039;s pension of &#163;109 per week is that in order to keep it within reasonable cost constraints, it presumes the rolling into the basic state pension of S2P. That would be the only way you could afford to fund a basic state pension of &#163;109 per week across the board.
</p>




<p><a name="st_330"></a>
<a name="50307-29_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   My Lords, that is not the position. We have made it quite clear that we would finance the citizen&#039;s pension by making savings in government expenditure elsewhere. We would not find the money from the state second pension.
</p>




<p><a name="st_331"></a>
<a name="50307-29_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   My Lords, I shall not develop the argument any further, but while I am sure that the noble Lord is no party to it, I think that this is Alice in Wonderland finance. Certainly, outside of this House, the usual suggestion made by organisations considering the financing of the &#163;109 basic citizen&#039;s pension is to roll S2P into it. The result of that would be the effective end of contracting out for DB schemes, which in turn would destabilise them. So there are real problems about how to pay for such a pension without ending S2P, offsetting that with the end of contracting out for DB schemes and thus further destabilising final salary pensions.

<a name="50307-29_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a>The noble Lord has reminded us, as if anyone needed reminding of it, that the pensioner vote is 35   per cent, of which around 70 per cent are women. That is right, but that did not lie behind government policies. Over the past few years this Government have introduced pension credit, of whom three-quarters of the recipients are women; they have introduced stakeholders, a very considerable number of whom are women; and have introduced the state second pension which ensures that even if you earn only &#163;5,000 or &#163;6,000 a year, you receive a state second pension as though you were earning &#163;11,600 a year. Again, the bulk of those beneficiaries are women.

</p>

<a name="50307-29_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a>Throughout our policies we have sought to address the problems of poverty among women pensioners today. I hope that we can achieve consensus on trying to ensure that the poverty currently faced by so many women pensioners is now being successfully overcome for the first time. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said that if two people are considered at random, one of whom is a pensioner and the other not, the pensioner is no more likely to be poor than the other person. We have made huge strides, but we have to ensure that the problems of poverty faced by women pensioners over the past 10, 20, 30 and 40 years will not recur in the future. Part of that is ensuring that women can enter the labour market and build up a pension. Another part is to encourage the building up of a good second pension. A further part is to ensure that the basic pension is reviewed to ensure that it works fairly for women as well. I hope that, with those remarks, noble Lords will feel able to accept the orders before us.

earlier in the day, the order has to be made by the judge in the first instance, but there is still a test to be satisfied when it comes back on appeal. There are issues about whether you want to amend that, but without Clause   7 there are no principles to be applied.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_13"></a><br>
   &quot;REVIEW OF ACT

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_103"></a>(1)   The Secretary of State shall appoint a committee to conduct a review of the operation of this Act.

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_104"></a>(2)   A person may be a member of the committee only if he is a member of the Privy Council.<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_574"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 574</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


<p class="tabletext"><br>
(3)   There shall be five members of the Committee of whom one each will be nominated by&#151;

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_105"></a>(a)   the Prime Minister;

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_106"></a>(b)   the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons;

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_107"></a>(c)   the Leader of the Liberal Democrats in the House of Commons;

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_108"></a>(d)   the Convenor of the Crossbench peers in the House of Lords;

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_109"></a>(e)   the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales.

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_110"></a>(4)   The Secretary of State may not refuse any nomination made under subsection (3).

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_111"></a>(5)   The committee shall complete a review and send a report to the Secretary of State&#151;

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_112"></a>(a)   not later than the end of four months beginning with the day on which this Act is passed; and

<a name="amdtpar_113"></a>(b)   not later than the end of eight months beginning with the day on which this Act is passed.

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_114"></a>(6)   The Secretary of State shall lay a copy of the report before Parliament as soon as is reasonably practicable.

<br>
<a name="amdtpar_115"></a>(7)   The Secretary of State may make payments to persons appointed as members of the committee.&quot;


<p><a name="st_376"></a>The noble Lord said: We on the Opposition Benches consider this to be an extremely important amendment. It proposes the establishment of a committee by the Secretary of State to review the operation of the Act after a certain period of time has elapsed. Quite properly for a matter dealing with national security, the members of   the   review committee should comprise only Privy Counsellors. We suggest that the ideal number would be five: one nominated by the Prime Minister, one by the Leader of the Opposition, one by the Leader of the Liberal Democrats, one by the Convenor of the Cross-Benchers in the House of Lords and one by the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales.
</p>

<a name="50307-31_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a>In our submission, the Secretary of State should be prohibited from refusing any nomination made by those designated nominators. The committee should complete its review swiftly and send a report to the Secretary of State within a matter of a few months. A copy of the report should be laid before Parliament as soon as is reasonably practicable.
</p>

<a name="50307-31_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a>Two aspects of the Bill give us particular cause for   concern. First, the speed with which it has been making its way through Parliament has meant that full and proper consideration has not been given to it. Secondly, it affects the most fundamental rights of our citizens. For the first time in our history, it questions the right of an individual, having been detained, to be tried by his peers. For those two reasons, it seems to us wholly appropriate that a mechanism of the nature we suggest should be established. It is a necessary security for the support and protection of fundamental liberties in the country. I beg to move.

<a name="50307-32_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   We support the concept of a review. It is the drafting to which we on these Benches take exception, because, with an arrogance not unknown on the Benches near to us, the Government have assumed in subsection (3) that neither the Prime Minister nor the Leader of the Opposition will be the leader of the Liberal Democrats. It is our entire purpose to ensure that, in the coming general election which everyone <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_575"></a>

seems to be talking about, the right honourable Charles Kennedy will occupy position (a) on that list. In those circumstances, we do not particularly care who is in position (b).
</p>

<a name="50307-32_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a>With a bit of drafting, I have no doubt that we will be able to come to an agreement with the Opposition.

</p>

<a name="50307-32_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, has spoken of the speed with which this part of the Bill is being considered. I entirely agree with the notion of a review, but I am not convinced by subsection (3), which is also misconceived. For that reason, this sunset clause should be taken away and reconsidered.
</p>




<p><a name="st_379"></a>
<a name="50307-32_spmin0"></a><b>The Earl of Onslow:</b>  The point made by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, is perfectly reasonable. He would be more likely to achieve his object if the leader of the Liberal Democrats had bothered to vote on this Bill in the Commons. As we are going round making little party political jokes, I could not resist that one.
</p>

<a name="50307-32_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a>We must have a review. I suggest that, especially with a sunset clause, a review of the Act should be put in as well. Then, when this Bill dies and goes to the crematorium, as I hope it will, a body of intelligent opinion will have seen some of the details and difficulties faced by the security authorities, and the Government&#151;whoever they may be after 5 May&#151;will be in a better position to produce a proper, well thought-out Bill to deal with the problems we appear to face.
</p>




<p><a name="st_380"></a>
<a name="50307-32_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   I wrongly referred to the provision as a &quot;sunset clause&quot;. I apologise for that.
</p>

<a name="50307-32_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a>The Government have to think again about this. It is quite impossible that the provisions that have suddenly been thought of should appear in the Bill. For that reason, we ought to think again about the situation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_381"></a>
<a name="50307-32_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Lloyd of Berwick: </b>   As the last reviewer of terrorist legislation, appointed by the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, I entirely support the suggestion of a new review to replace mine of 10 years ago.

</p>

<a name="50307-32_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a>Clearly, the Bill should, and could, have been subject to pre-legislative scrutiny. As it was not, it should certainly be subject to post-legislative review. I support the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_382"></a>
<a name="50307-32_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Crickhowell: </b>   So far, I have not taken part in any of the debates on this Bill. I am prompted to do so because I believe this is of extreme importance.
</p>

<a name="50307-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a>I sat through a large part of our debate last Thursday. I hope the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor will not take it amiss if I say he put up a brilliant batting performance on an extremely sticky wicket. Today, however, he was faced with the problem that his colleagues in another place had decided that there should be no more concessions, and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_576"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 576</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

he had to defend a position that became increasingly indefensible as the debate wore on. He found himself with no allies, and indeed some surprising opponents behind him, on his own Benches. He was forced to repeat the argument again and again in an increasingly uncomfortable position. We all know this is something that happens to government spokesmen in this House from time to time, when they are forced to defend the indefensible and have not got the scope to make the necessary adaptations that might convince the House.
</p>

<a name="50307-32_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a>Then the Government faced a massive defeat on the critical vote; a great chunk of the Bill was suddenly altered and the Government had to respond in a very short time to a fundamentally changed Bill. It seems extremely probable, given that situation, that we will end up with a flawed Bill. One lesson we have surely learnt on numerous occasions in recent years is that rushed legislation produces bad legislation and unexpected results. If ever there was a case of a rushed Bill, this is it.
</p>

<a name="50307-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a>Indeed, we have another example of a debate that revealed flaws. It was certainly fun to listen to, although whether it was quite so much fun for the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, I am not sure. The debate introduced by my noble friends on the Scottish question again revealed a number of extraordinary inconsistencies in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50307-32_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a>It seems to me that there is an overwhelming case for a provision of this kind. To comfort the Liberal Democrat Benches, some consideration may need to be given to the wording of the new clause before we reach the next clause. I am not sure that I die on the particular representation on the committee to be appointed. That there needs to be a committee, I feel absolutely certain about; that there needs to be a time limit under which the Bill is effective, I am equally certain. Parliament must be given the opportunity to look again at the whole question in proper time so that we can have legislation that is likely to endure.

</p>

<a name="50307-32_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a>There was a notable speech from the Cross Benches on Thursday about the impossibility of withdrawing legislation once it was in force if only because of giving the wrong signal to terrorists. The example was given of withdrawing ships in the South Atlantic and the Falklands War. As one who was in the Cabinet at the time, I remember all too vividly that particular example.
</p>

<a name="50307-32_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_420"></a>There is a real problem here. We need the opportunity of thinking how we get permanent or semi-permanent legislation on to the statute book which will not cause huge problems and a huge attack on our civil liberties. Therefore, I strongly support my noble friend in this amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_383"></a>
<a name="50307-32_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   I, too, support my noble friend Lord Kingsland in this amendment. I am sorry that the Liberal Democrats took offence at the drafting; I read it assuming that the Prime Minister might be in this House rather than the other place. Given that the other place has gone home for the evening and we are still here, considering legislation which it has not had a chance to see because of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_577"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 577</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

amendments, this place seems to be taking on a role that is rather more advanced than that of the other place.

</p>

<a name="50307-32_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a>More seriously, I have one concern about the drafting. I think it is an excellent idea that the legislation should be subject to review and that that should be done by a committee of Privy Counsellors in the way that the amendment suggests. However, it is not clear to me what happens when the report is laid before Parliament by the committee. Our experience of the previous legislation was that the Joint Committee of my noble friend Lord Newton made excellent recommendations which the Government chose to ignore. Will my noble friend think about at least ensuring that there is a proper debate and a requirement to have some response from the Government? All too often people produce very learned advice which is subsequently ignored.
</p>




<p><a name="st_384"></a>
<a name="50307-32_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </b>   I am expecting to find that the Government have allowed this debate to develop as it has so that they may show their open-mindedness and flexibility by conceding the point. In what the prayer book calls the sure and certain hope of that, I shall address your Lordships for only a very short time.
</p>

<a name="50307-32_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a>A constant theme of these debates has been to point out the folly of approaching these delicate matters in unseemly haste. One would not wish the Government to add arrogance to obstinacy and folly by resisting the amendment, which calls for a review in a timely period. I confidently hope that the noble and learned Lord, who has shown such flexibility and good humour today, will fulfil my expectations.

<p><a name="st_385"></a>
<a name="50307-32_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </b>   I apologise for arriving a few minutes after the beginning of this debate but, as some noble Lords will know, I am somewhat hampered in moving rapidly around the Chamber at the moment. I wanted to make a very brief contribution because, although I fully support, as indeed our Benches do, Amendment No. 169, there should be added to it an understanding accepted by all sides of the House.
</p>

<a name="50307-32_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a>The proposal is that there should be a review and that that review should be undertaken by a group of Privy Counsellors appointed by the leaders of the respective parties and by the Prime Minister. My concern is not so much with the idea of a review, which I accept to be a good one; it is whether the Government would feel committed to taking that review very seriously. We are well aware that there has already been a review of Part 4 of the anti-terrorism Act 2001. That review, which I have read very carefully and regard as one of the most outstanding reports ever put before Parliament in recent years, was of course the report of the committee chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Newton of Braintree. It consisted of a group of distinguished Privy Counsellors, among whom, if I may pick out just one name, our noble colleague Lady   Hayman, was a prominent contributor.

</p>

<a name="50307-32_para14"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 578</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

proposals that were carefully thought through. It covered a range of issues including different kinds of trial that could be conducted in camera or with a security-cleared judge and alternatives, which the committee clearly indicated would be regarded as second-best. Nevertheless, the report consistently and with a great sense of duty covered the whole of the area that it was asked to do.
</p>

<a name="50307-32_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a>The report made two striking observations. The first was that the picking out of foreign nationals was a great weakness in the anti-terrorism Act 2001. In other words, the committee showed the prescience to recognise that that would become a major bone of contention. Secondly, the report made a clear indication that there would be possible alternatives that would not require derogation from the European convention. It indicated that no other country in Europe had required that to deal with the threat of terrorism.
</p>

<a name="50307-32_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a>The tragedy is that that a carefully thought-through and very thoughtful report was dismissed in the course of a brief remark by the then Home Secretary Mr   David Blunkett. He said in terms that he saw no necessity to consider any proposals to replace Part 4. He dismissed the issue of foreign nationals by saying that he had decided that these were the main targets that were required to deal with terrorism. He did not even consider the question of discrimination between British and foreign nationals which was at the heart of the Law Lords&#039; decision of December 2004.
</p>

<a name="50307-32_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a>If one then looks at the debate that took place in the House of Commons on 25 February last year, what one sees over and again is the simple dismissal of repeated pleas by Members of Parliament from all   parties&#151;Conservative, Liberal Democrat and almost certainly Labour&#151;to ask that much greater consideration be given to the issues that have not been properly dealt with. One of the most striking of those contributions came from Mr Alan Beith, the deputy leader of my own party in another place, when he specifically said that the issues of terrorism that now confronted us were so serious that we needed the time, meditation and care to consider thoroughly built and constructed legislation that would enable us to deal with the terrorist threat without sacrificing our own liberties.
</p>

<a name="50307-32_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_428"></a>In briefly addressing this amendment, I simply want to say that I sympathise fully with the position of its movers, the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, and indeed believe that it is important that such a review should to take place. However, the Committee requires, were it to pass this amendment, a commitment from the Government Front Bench that such a review would not be treated with the disdain and virtual contempt with which the Newton report was treated despite the first-rate quality and excellence of its recommendations which were supported by Members of all parties who served on that committee.
</p>

<a name="50307-32_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a>I shall not delay the Committee by referring to an amendment that we shall discuss shortly which constitutes, if I may say so, the one guarantee&#151;that is to say, it is the sunset amendment&#151;that if there were <br>&nbsp;<br>

to be a review it would have to be taken seriously. The House would not agree to continue with legislation if the carefully thought out recommendations of its Members were treated with the kind of disrespect with which the Newton committee was treated totally without any justification.

I have not spoken so far in this Committee stage but I support as strongly as I can the case for a review at a very early stage so that the country can see how this Bill, when it becomes an Act, works out in practice. Privy counsellors are obviously the right people to undertake this kind of task. I am agnostic about how they should be found or selected but the principle is an essential one.

I, of course, acknowledge the strictures contained in the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, but I should say to her&#151;I appreciate that she may not have been present during our earlier discussions&#151;that we have already acknowledged that the Newton committee highlighted a number of these issues. I do not agree that that report was treated with disdain but I have accepted that some of the recommendations therein contained certainly merit careful scrutiny. I have also indicated that we are minded to bring forward legislation as soon as reasonably practicable which would take up a number of the Newton committee&#039;s suggestions. I have given due credit to the extremely high-quality work which was thereby undertaken.

<a name="50307-33_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_430"></a>I remind the Committee that the Newton committee recommended that we should look very carefully at the   other offences that might be possible. I remind the Committee in particular of the recommendation made by Newton at paragraph 251 which dealt with the propriety of making less intrusive orders than Part 4. Paragraph 251 states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68"></a>&quot;It would be less damaging to an individual&#039;s civil liberties to impose restrictions on</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69"></a>a. the suspect&#039;s freedom of movement (e.g., curfews, tagging, daily reporting to a police station);</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70"></a>b. the suspect&#039;s ability to use financial services, communicate or associate freely (e.g., requiring them to use only certain specified phones or bank or internet accounts, which might be monitored);</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71"></a>subject to the proviso that if the terms of the order were broken, custodial detention would follow&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-33_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_431"></a>I remind the Committee that that is a scheme which the Newton committee advocated. It is one to which we have listened in seeking to put the provisions of this Bill together, as, indeed, we listened to the comments made by your Lordships&#039; Judicial Committee when it used as an example the constrictions placed on the individual rights of the appellant G. I remind the Committee that we are precisely where the Newton committee advocated that we should be. I, of course, acknowledge that many would say that we should have got there a little sooner.
</p>




<p><a name="st_388"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 580</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

was found by the Judicial Committee of your Lordships&#039; House that Part 4 was against the Human Rights Act. To be asked to believe that this would have been done without outside pressure is stretching my broad imagination too far.
</p>




<p><a name="st_389"></a>
<a name="50307-33_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I hear what the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, says in that regard and I appreciate that he may have limited imagination. However, I would not possibly suggest that that is the case. Having seen the noble Earl&#039;s performances in this House, I would say that the contrary is true.

</p>

<a name="50307-33_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_432"></a>The reason that I remind the Committee that that is our position is simply to bring us back to the realities of the situation with which we are dealing and to remind the Committee that these were seen as proportion and appropriate responses to the difficulties in which we now find ourselves. That is also the reason why, bearing in mind the experience that your Lordships&#039; House has in scrutinising these issues, I take with due caution your Lordships&#039; comments on our bringing forward another Bill on acts preparatory to. I do not for one moment say that your Lordships will be to blame.

</p>

<a name="50307-33_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_433"></a>Let us look at the review provisions in the Bill. The amendments proposed by the noble Lord, Lord   Kingsland, are interdependent and relate to Amendment No. 171, which requires the legislation to cease to have effect at the end of November 2005. That is a very narrow compass. The amendments provide for review and reporting mechanisms during the operation of the legislation in the period up to that date. We are now in March so the period to November is very short indeed. The timing of proposed new clauses on reviewing and reporting on the operation of the Act is based on the assumption that there will be that sunset clause.
</p>

<a name="50307-33_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_434"></a>We believe, however, that the principle of the provisions is unnecessary. I shall explain why. The Bill provides that the Secretary of State must report to Parliament at quarterly intervals on the exercise of the control order powers. The Bill also provides for the Secretary of State to appoint a person to carry out reviews annually on the operation of the old Sections 1 to 6&#151;on the making, operation and duration of the control orders. The Secretary of State would be obliged to lay the reports produced by those reviews before Parliament as soon as reasonably practicable.
</p>

<a name="50307-33_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_435"></a>In response to the request made by the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, for a proper debate and response, if the report is laid before Parliament as we propose, then there a good opportunity for the debate advocated by the noble Lord to take place.
</p>




<p><a name="st_390"></a>
<a name="50307-33_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   Is that an undertaking that the Government will definitely provide time for such a debate?
</p>




<p><a name="st_391"></a>
<a name="50307-33_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   If only it were so. Noble Lords will know that time for debate is not within the Government&#039;s gift. They will also know that the usual channels, in their inimitable style, have the ability to find time for debates that appear to be supported and merited. If all three parties wished there to be a debate, I cannot conceive that the usual <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_581"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 581</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

channels would not provide us with an opportunity. However, I do not seek to usurp their function from the Dispatch Box or to suggest that the Government can command the timetable in this place. I have learnt, to my great joy, that that is an impossibility.
</p>

<a name="50307-33_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_436"></a>I turn to the issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord   Crickhowell. I, too, endorse the assessment of my noble and learned friend&#039;s performance&#151;it was brilliant batting. However, I remind the noble Lord that this wicket has not yet gone.

</p>

<a name="50307-33_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_437"></a>These issues are difficult. However, I agree with my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis. As currently drafted&#151;and not simply because they reflect the current position   of the Liberal Democrats&#151;the proposals are misconceived and unnecessary. The noble Lord, Lord   Crickhowell, will also know that the Government have indicated that the actions and arguments of this place always need to be considered further. On each occasion when my noble and learned friend and I have responded, we have made it clear that the Government&#039;s consideration of these matters continues.

All she has indicated so far is that we might have a debate at some unspecified time on reports laid by the Home Secretary. That is wholly inadequate. It has to be tied to a timetable which means that Parliament will have the opportunity to consider the legislation completely afresh. Anything less will not do.
</p>




<p><a name="st_393"></a>
<a name="50307-33_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I hear what the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, says on that matter, but the amendments before us this evening do not have that effect. Even if, as is not admitted, there was a need for an annual review, these provisions would not thereby provide it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_394"></a>
<a name="50307-33_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   I am most grateful to the noble Baroness for her reply.

</p>

<a name="50307-33_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_438"></a>Both my noble friend Lord Forsyth and the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, rightly criticised Amendment No. 169 for lacking teeth. The noble Baroness, Lady Williams, adduced evidence to this effect with the sorry story of the fate of the Newton report. In responding to them both, I emphasise that I accept that without Amendment No.171, Amendment No. 169 would get us only a short distance down the road.
</p>

<a name="50307-33_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_439"></a>The amendments are interdependent. Without Amendment No. 171, a future report made under Amendment No. 169 would be likely to suffer the same fate as the Newton report. Equally, without Amendment No. 169, Amendment No. 171&#151;and we come to the moment when the sunset clause bites&#151;we would lack an in-depth, informed and authoritative report about where we should go from there. Although these are separate amendments and are grouped separately, they must be looked at together.

<a name="50307-34_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_443"></a>The speed with which this legislation is going through your Lordships&#039; House&#151;and has already gone through another place&#151;is evidence enough that we need Amendment No. 171 on the face of the Bill. The amendments that we succeed in passing tomorrow night will only reflect a portion of the deep disquiet we feel about this legislation. The fact that the Bill seeks to suspend habeas corpus&#151;the hallmark of our constitutional life throughout the ages&#151;surely justifies the inclusion of the amendment. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_397"></a>
<a name="50307-34_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   I think that the amendment has been moved in haste. Although I agree in principle with the noble Lord, I believe that the provision affecting limitation is misconceived as drafted.
</p>

<a name="50307-34_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_444"></a>The noble Lord is right to say that some notice should be taken of Amendment No. 169. Whether we have an undertaking from the Government to consider it or whether it is included in the Bill I do not really care, but that the Act should cease to have effect on 30 November is misconceived.
</p>

<a name="50307-34_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_445"></a>After all, we are likely to have a general election on 5   May and Parliament will not sit for two or three weeks afterwards. Then we are likely to have a Recess lasting a little more than two months in August until October. So, effectively, Parliament will not be sitting for about four months during that period.
</p>

<a name="50307-34_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_446"></a>At the same time we should review how the Act has been operating. For that reason, I believe that we should consider the whole thing at once. It is very unsatisfactory to consider it in bits and pieces. I urge my colleagues to accept that there must be a review. We should be patient; I am not talking about more than a year. But I think that it is incumbent upon us as Members of Parliament to consider how the Act is operating. If we do not do that, we are not really coming to a sensible conclusion.

<a name="50307-34_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hayman: </b>   My noble friend, Lord Clinton-Davis, urges patience. I normally consider myself to be a patient woman. I have brought up four sons. That probably explains it.
</p>

<a name="50307-34_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_447"></a>On this occasion, however, I am afraid that I have lost patience. A year ago I voted for the renewal of Part 4, even though the committee of which I was a <br>&nbsp;<br>

member, and which the noble Lord, Lord Newton, chaired, recommended that that should be replaced as a matter of urgency. I voted for renewal for a year because I believed that that was an appropriate and responsible thing to do in order to allow adequate time for the proper replacement provisions to be put in place. We have gone through the history many times. But that has not happened. What has happened is that we have ended up where we are in the Chamber this evening, legislating in haste.
</p>

<a name="50307-34_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_448"></a>I believe that we are not that far from agreement. I do not believe that there are many people who are absolutist in their dismissal of control orders.

</p>

<a name="50307-34_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_449"></a>My noble friend was absolutely right to say that the Newton committee&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Newton, nods&#151;recognised and envisaged the possibility of needing something between surveillance and criminal prosecution to deal with a small but important category of terrorist specialists. I believe that there is, not universal but majority, support for that proposition and for finding the right balance in introducing those measures with the protection of civil liberties and the challenge of not contravening the European Convention on Human Rights. I also believe that with a little more time, and outside the frenetic atmosphere before a general election, we could do this task.
</p>

<a name="50307-34_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_450"></a>On the issue of looking as if you are going soft by withdrawing such legislation, we will have a legislative vehicle because we have been promised such a vehicle in terms of the new offence of acts preparatory to terrorism early in the new Session. I am sure that my friends on the Front Bench would not have put it quite as crudely as that, but that is the import of all that we have understood.
</p>

<a name="50307-34_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_451"></a>That seems to give us the opportunity do what the Newton committee asked for; it said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_73"></a>&quot;The idea of a durable body of properly considered, principled counter-terrorist legislation&#151;which is distinct from mainstream criminal law, addresses this particular threat to society and includes adequate safeguards of the rights of the individual&#151;remains compelling&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-34_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_452"></a>I support that conclusion, as I did when we published the report. We may be wrong by about a month or two about the duration, but I feel as strongly on the issue of a sunset clause as I did on the issue earlier this evening that sent me into the Lobby with unaccustomed company. Delightful as many of those individuals are, I seriously do not wish to be in that situation again. I hope very much that the Government will see their way to accepting if not this amendment, one that is close to it.

<p><a name="st_399"></a>
<a name="50307-34_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   My Lords, I understand that the Government are up against tight deadlines, but that is to a large extent their own fault. If we look back a few months, it was perhaps not wholly predictable that the Appellate Committee of your Lordships&#039; House would come to the conclusion that it did on the Belmarsh detainees, but it was certainly foreseeable as a distinct possibility.

</p>

<a name="50307-34_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_453"></a>Apparently the Government had no plans on how to deal with that contingency. They had no legislation in draft to put before the House. If they had been able to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_584"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 584</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

do so immediately after we returned from the Christmas Recess, at least we would have had a fair amount of time. But it was not until the third week in February that the Government introduced the Bill. It went through the House of Commons in two days, which was wholly   inadequate. It had its Second Reading in your Lordships&#039; House on Tuesday of last week. On Wednesday morning, at about half past nine, very important and substantial government amendments were published. We had to table our amendments for discussion in Committee by five o&#039;clock that afternoon.
</p>

<a name="50307-34_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_454"></a>We then had to debate the first day of the Committee stage starting at 11.30 the following morning. The groupings were published at two minutes past eleven, and turned out to be wholly unsatisfactory, resulting in a delay of half an hour before starting the debate. The gap between the end of Committee and the beginning of Report will be about 16 hours. Report will be followed by Third Reading after a gap of only four hours. This is a wholly unprecedented timetable. By comparison, the debate on the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act   2001 moved at a positively glacial pace, with some nine days being allocated to Committee.
</p>

<a name="50307-34_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_455"></a>We have had a wholly inadequate time for considering the Bill, which is totally inconsistent with the role of your Lordships&#039; House as a revising Chamber. We have been unable to do the work that we should do. There are all sorts of important issues, not perhaps the top four or five, but issues that still have considerable importance, which should have been discussed at length, but which have not been debated.

</p>

<a name="50307-34_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_456"></a>In those circumstances it seems absolutely essential that the Bill should be re-debated from scratch. That requires, not a review, which the Government can dismiss, but an irremovable sunset clause, which means that we will have to get down and give this Bill the proper consideration that it needs. This is a Bill of great practical importance and perhaps of even greater constitutional importance. We must have proper time to consider it.

I think that that can be dealt with in a matter of a few months. I do not think that it would be appropriate to wait for, let us say, the three years that might be necessary before one sees how the Bill has panned out in practice.

I think back to the words of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Worcester last Tuesday, which I read in <i>Hansard</i>, and those of my kinsman the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester, earlier today. I believe both this amendment and the previous ones to express a humility about this legislation and to be commensurate with the undue haste with which we have to deal with it. I am very uncomfortable about the atmosphere of your Lordships&#039; House at this present time.
</p>




<p><a name="st_404"></a>
<a name="50307-35_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Desai: </b>   At the end of Second Reading, being the last speaker, I said that I intended to oppose any sunset clause. The problem is very simple: if we accept this clause, we will go through another hasty piece of legislation. As my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis said, think of the timetable: if you lose two and a half months between May and November there will not be enough time to legislate properly. It would be preferable if my noble and learned friend could give us an assurance from the Front Bench&#151;as I think has already been given&#151;that, as soon we can after the election, whichever party is in power should initiate legislation on the crime of acts of terrorism, or whatever it is called. We should, as I have said before, have a Joint Committee of both Houses to consider that immediately.
</p>

<a name="50307-35_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_458"></a>Given that we made haste with earlier legislation, which was judged to be discriminatory, and that this legislation has had to be introduced in a hurry, we <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_586"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 586</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

should give ourselves lots of time. By the first anniversary of the passing of this Bill, we should be ready with something better. That is not a three-year gap&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, thought that my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis was asking for that&#151;but one year is a decent gap, after which I am sure we can have better legislation. In the meantime, if we get to November and have nothing else ready, there will be another almighty panic and another rush to get something through, so that the Government can have some legislation to deal with emergencies.
</p>

<a name="50307-35_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_459"></a>I hope that noble Lords see what I am saying. If they want a sunset clause, make it a bit later; but neither the amendment on the review nor this amendment addresses the real problem. That is: how do we have better legislation in place? We should concentrate on that rather than on a sunset clause.
</p>




<p><a name="st_405"></a>
<a name="50307-35_spmin1"></a><b>The Earl of Onslow:</b>  Surely the sunset clause will make it a certainty that what the noble Lord, Lord Desai, has just asked for will happen. In other words, it will be looked at&#151;because if nothing is done, the Act will fall. I am not necessarily tied to the date of 30 November. However, I hope I will get an undertaking&#151;from my Front Bench and the Liberal Democrat Front Bench&#151;that if we pass the sunset clause and the Government chuck it back at us from the Commons, with their majority there, then we insist on that clause. Then, if the Government still insist on chucking it out, they will not get their Bill at all. I sincerely hope that such an undertaking can be given by my noble friend Lord Kingsland and by the Liberal Democrat Front Bench. Otherwise, we will, in effect, have been posturing.
</p>

<a name="50307-35_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_460"></a>This Bill is so important&#151;just as our liberties are, being so much part of everything around us in this building, which was built because of our liberties. We sit here talking and, as Sir Arthur Bryant said in his history of the Napoleonic Wars, the continental dictatorships could not understand that England made war by gentlemen making speeches at each other in the House of Commons. These liberties are so important&#151;and the Bill goes against the grain of them all. With gritted teeth I am prepared to accept it for six months; with more tightly gritted teeth, for nine months&#151;but not for a moment longer.
</p>

<a name="50307-35_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_461"></a>I would rather get no Bill at all, but if we are to have one then we must have a solid undertaking from both my noble friends on the Liberal Democrat Benches&#151;I am using the term advisedly&#151;and my special noble friends on the Conservative Benches.
</p>




<p><a name="st_406"></a>
<a name="50307-35_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   At no time have I ever suggested that we should wait for three years. It is grotesque that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, should suggest that I have. I agree entirely with the view that we ought to consider this clause in a balanced way. It should not be for longer than one year.


</p>




<p><a name="st_407"></a>
<a name="50307-35_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Brennan: </b>   This is an exceptionally important point that embraces two principles, one of democracy and one concerned with the campaign against terrorism. In my view, a Bill of this nature should always have a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_587"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 587</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

review clause and a sunset clause. Parliament should always review constraints on liberty as grave as this Bill introduces.
</p>

<a name="50307-35_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_462"></a>In doing so, two considerations arise, the first of which is democracy. The Bill went through the House of Commons in circumstances in which the other place had no opportunity fully to consider its ambit. It has come to this House and obviously will be the subject of major change. If it goes back to the Commons later this week, and if as I suspect there is a guillotine, the fact is that in our democracy a Bill as grave as this will go on to the statute book with the elected Chamber having given it no proper consideration.
</p>

<a name="50307-35_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_463"></a>I cannot imagine a more disturbing state of affairs, but I accept the reality of it because I accept the bona fides of the Government&#039;s intent. They should accept our bona fides in return. When we want a review and a limitation clause, it is not to undermine the Bill, it is to ensure that, upon review, it is in proper form. If we do not have a limitation and a review, the House of Commons will have lost its place and its function in this particular circumstance.

</p>

<a name="50307-35_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_464"></a>The second consideration is the campaign against terrorism. Just as we need to be urged on by the Government, they need to be urged on by us. A limitation clause would serve as a trigger for the Government to come back with a comprehensive and up-to-date anti-terrorism Bill setting out new offences and new procedures in a composite picture that satisfies the public that we are doing our best to beat terrorism.
</p>

<a name="50307-35_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_465"></a>So for the sake of democracy and for the sake of beating terrorism, when this comes back tomorrow I expect the House to favour review and limitation, and I hope that the Government will accept that what is intended is for the benefit of us all.
</p>




<p><a name="st_408"></a>
<a name="50307-35_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </b>   I entered the Chamber not intending to speak in this debate, but having listened to the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, perhaps I may say that, curiously enough, he and I, on different sides of this House, existed in the same chambers together for many years. That kind of compromise is what is needed at this moment. I believe that it is possible to achieve a Bill which is necessary for the short term, but it has many faults and we should be given the opportunity to look at it with greater leisure so that those faults can be removed. We will then have in place a law that is accepted by both parties and would meet the recognised need for having some means of dealing with terrorists who cannot be dealt with under our normal forms of judicial procedure.
</p>

<a name="50307-35_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_466"></a>The Government have rushed this Bill through unnecessarily and in a way that has provided no opportunity either in the Commons or in this place for a full debate. In fact one wonders what is going to happen when it returns to the Commons. Will the Government ask the Commons tomorrow or the day after to reject the amendments which they did not vote against in this House, and which have not been debated over there? Surely there is a case for a wider consideration of this Bill, and I share the view of the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, who I consider to be my <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_588"></a>

<a name="50307-36_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Judd: </b>   I too had not intended to intervene on this amendment, but the thoughtful and considered remarks of my noble friends Lord Clinton-Davis and Lord Desai made me think that perhaps I should. I simply want to make the point that I do not believe that anyone in this House, including the Government Front Bench, is happy about the predicament in which we find ourselves. We are introducing measures that go against not just the grain but the foundations of the system of justice that we and our predecessors have worked for over many centuries.
</p>

<a name="50307-36_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_467"></a>I hope that we do not now slip into the attitude that the task is how we perfect the course we have taken. It may indeed be necessary to contemplate improved legislation. I certainly endorse that proposition. If we are prepared to introduce into our legal procedures measures that cannot be reconciled with some of the fundamental principles of our legal system, as we have come to understand them, it is imperative that year by year the justification for continuing to do so is re-established.
</p>




<p><a name="st_410"></a>
<a name="50307-36_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I say straight away that the Government understand the importance of review. That is why the provisions in Clause 11 outlined the review that the Government have in mind&#151;the three-monthly reports, then the independent reviewer and the 12-month report.
</p>

<a name="50307-36_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_468"></a>Let me come to the issues raised so eloquently by my   noble friend Lady Hayman. I understand her frustration. Although I cannot compete with her, being a mere mother of two sons, I understand the fortitude that that takes. Therefore, her patience must be renowned. The important thing for all of us is to get the right balance of protection and civil liberties. My noble friend is absolutely right. We all seek an appropriate legislative vehicle.
</p>

<a name="50307-36_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_469"></a>There are certain issues that we all also accepted. There is a cadre of persons, albeit very small, who are unlikely to be amenable to any legislation dependent on evidence that can be brought before a court. We have been through the reasons about the nature of the evidence that we may have to rely on, on just a few occasions.
</p>

<a name="50307-36_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_470"></a>We have to accept that within the portfolio of orders, it is likely that, no matter what else we construct, we will need something similar to control orders. Therefore, this Bill should not be seen as the shortest of short gaps, for all the reasons given by my noble friends Lord Desai and Lord Clinton-Davis. Although I can say nothing about the likely time at which any general election might take place, I can rely upon the published dates for the summer recess. The noble Lord is right that we are going to have a relatively truncated period to consider this.
</p>

<a name="50307-36_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_471"></a>Review is a matter of importance, but, respectfully, a sunset clause of this nature will not help us, because of the many reasons already outlined&#151;the amount of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_589"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 589</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

time and the amount of detail. We hope that in a short compass we will be able to bring forward in the appropriate legislative vehicle further and other provisions that might better address the issues of a new offence.
</p>

<a name="50307-36_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_472"></a>It is very easy to forget the history of the past year and put on it a construct that it does not merit. Therefore, with great temerity, I should like gently to remind the Committee of the chronology of events.
</p>

<a name="50307-36_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_473"></a>There was, of course, the Newton report and the consideration given to it. That report was published, I think, on 18 December 2003. The Committee will know that the case of <i>Re A</i> moved through the courts in 2004 and, in July, I believe, we had the unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal, led by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice, which endorsed the provisions of Part 4 as having been sound.
</p>

<a name="50307-36_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_474"></a>Work of course continued, but it is important to accept that in recasting provisions one has to bear in mind the nature, extent and form that those new provisions may take. Unless and until we had the full judgment of the House of Lords in the case of <i>Re A</i>, it would have been impossible to set in place concrete provisions which did not reflect or could not have reflected the thinking behind that judgment. Now we have, as speedily as was reasonably practicable, brought forward these new provisions at the same time as continuing to work on the broader context of the other offences.
</p>

<a name="50307-36_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_475"></a>Although I of course accept and understand the frustration in regard to the timing, perhaps I might respectfully and gently suggest that it was not entirely of the Government&#039;s making.
</p>




<p><a name="st_411"></a>
<a name="50307-36_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. I am mesmerised by the charming way in which she is explaining the sequence of events and I am almost persuaded. But does she not recognise that we all read the newspapers and listen to the media? It is perfectly clear that the Government have briefed the media that there will be no further concessions made on the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50307-36_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_476"></a>The Minister has sat through the whole debate and Members on all sides of the House are putting forward very persuasive arguments, but that is in the context of a government who have already made up their mind that they are going to make no further concessions. Does the Minister understand why it is difficult to believe the script she is enunciating today when, outside, members of her own Government have been briefing the media that what we do will make no difference at all?
</p>

<a name="50307-36_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_477"></a>That of course makes it even more important that there is some kind of sunset provision. It seems to have become some kind of political test of virility whether the Bill reaches the statute book and some of us are concerned about the long-term consequences of it. That is where we are at.
</p>




<p><a name="st_412"></a>

Front Bench can be responsible for what is or is not said in the media. That is an aspiration that we all from time to time in our heady dreams have wanted to have, but it is not the reality. We have to confine ourselves to what is said from this Dispatch Box, and I can assure the Committee that we have continued to listen.

</p>

<a name="50307-36_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_478"></a>I agree with what was said by my noble friend Lady Hayman, endorsed by the noble Lord, Lord   Carlisle, and echoed again by the noble Lord, Lord Newton, that no one wants to die in a ditch for provisions which will not deliver what we jointly seek. Therefore, throughout these debates, I have   held on to a number of issues which appear from all the debates to be plain: notwithstanding the difference of view that might be expressed from the various Benches, we all wish the same thing.
</p>

<a name="50307-36_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_479"></a>No one on any side of the House has said anything to indicate that we do not value our civil liberties highly. We fully understand that balancing those things which we are driven to believe are necessary to protect the security and safety of the citizens of this country against those things which we trespass very carefully upon in regard to their civil liberties is a very delicate and difficult excercise. I say again that no one in this House&#151;and, I believe, in the other place&#151;wishes to be in the position in which we find ourselves, where that balance has to be struck.
</p>

<a name="50307-36_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_480"></a>I do not find in any of the contributions made from any side of the Committee any indication that any noble Lord is not absolutely serious about that issue. The issue for us all is where the line should be drawn: some of us fall on one side; some on the other.
</p>

<a name="50307-36_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_481"></a>I assure your Lordships that all the debates that we have entered into are being given appropriate and anxious consideration. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary has made it clear from the inception in the way that he has handled the matter that he would have preferred a consensus. However, we have also made it clear that the Government will do what we feel is necessary to protect.

</p>

<a name="50307-36_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_482"></a>We have a difficulty in relation to time. We do not believe that November would be an appropriate or convenient date. We have heard what noble Lords have said about the provisions currently contained in the Bill in relation to review, the three-monthly reports made by my right honourable friend the Home Secretary and the nature of the review after a 12-month period.
</p>




<p><a name="st_413"></a>
<a name="50307-36_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   If we do not have a certain date, this House will express itself in no uncertain way. The   Government have to take into account the overwhelming body of opinion expressed so far. I will not tie myself to 30 November, but there should be a sunset clause. That is the view of many noble Lords who have spoken in the debate. I invite my noble friend to suggest a date, because we are obliged to reconsider the whole legislation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_414"></a>
<a name="50307-36_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I thank my noble friend for that invitation but I regret that I cannot avail myself of it. We will consider the nature of the contributions that have been made. The general tenor <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_591"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 591</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of the debate indicates that November 2005 is not the appropriate date. I say clearly to your Lordships that the Government&#039;s view is that a sunset clause would not be appropriate. The Bill should not be seen as a short stop-gap.
</p>

<a name="50307-36_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_483"></a>We will have to give careful consideration to the other measures proposed to be brought forward in new legislation which will be contemplated. That will take a little time. It will be done as speedily as we can but it is unlikely to be anywhere near completion by November this year. We have listened carefully and I bear in mind the issues raised by my noble friends Lord   Brennan and Lord Judd, because they endorse the points made by my noble friend Lady Hayman. I thank my noble friend Lord Desai for his suggestion of a Joint Committee on the Bill in both Houses.

<a name="50307-37_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   I am trying to say as clearly as I can that the Government do not believe that a sunset clause is correct. I also said that we have accepted the necessity for a review of the provisions. That is why review provisions are contained in Clause 11. Of course we hear what noble Lords say about the nature of the review that they would wish to have. The import of what has been said is that the review should be an annual review.

We all believe that putting a judge in the front line of the control order system is only part of the answer. The other part is that the judge should operate within a judicial and not a political context.

</p>

<a name="50307-37_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_488"></a>In a previous debate that took place before the dinner adjournment, by accident, many of the issues raised by this amendment were fully discussed by the Committee. So I want to re-emphasise only two issues. First, I believe that it is absolutely crucial that the rules that apply to England and Wales are the same as those that apply to Scotland and to Northern Ireland. There is a difference, as the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor knows, in the way in which the rules will be made. In Scotland and in Northern Ireland, they will be made by the senior judge. At the moment, in England and Wales, they will be made by the noble and learned Lord. Our amendment would relieve the noble and learned Lord of that unnecessary responsibility. Of course, he would be consulted, but the last word would be with the Lord Chief Justice.

<a name="50307-37_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_489"></a>Secondly, despite the skilful exegesis of the noble and learned Lord of recent case law in the area of Article 6, I am in no doubt whatever that Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights not only ought to provide but does provide a floor of security for any rules that are made. In other parts of our debate this evening we shall raise some of the particular issues that we would like to see protected in the rules. I beg to move.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_77"></a>&quot;the Lord Chancellor is not required, before exercising the powers, to undertake any consultation that would be required in the case of rules made by&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-37_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_494"></a>the person by whom they are otherwise exercisable. That person is normally the rules of court committee of what used to be called the Supreme Court. There is a mandatory requirement for it to consult such persons as it considers appropriate before making any civil procedure rules. Why should the Lord Chancellor not be required to consult such persons as he considers appropriate? The only compulsory duty to consult binding the Lord Chancellor is to consult the Lord Chief Justice.
</p>

<a name="50307-37_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_495"></a>If the Lord Chancellor is to be vested with this power, the less disparity between the obligations upon   the rules committee and those upon the Lord Chancellor the better. Any disparity should be as slight as possible. That is not at the forefront of our problems in this Bill, but it is one that has its own significance.
</p>

<a name="50307-37_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_496"></a>I turn to my other amendment. The effect of Amendment No. 176A is that the rules must be subject to a requirement for affirmative procedure for approval. One glance at the hair-raising list of objectives that in some instances must be served by rules of court is surely enough to establish the case for that.
</p>

<a name="50307-37_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_497"></a>I propose, in the words on the Marshalled List, that


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_78"></a>&quot;An order made under sub-paragraph (5)&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-37_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_498"></a>shall be subject to the affirmative resolution. I realise that sub-paragraph (5) relates only to Northern Ireland, and I ought to have made the amendment broader. I will come back to that, if appropriate, on Report. The point, however, is the same. If the Lord Chancellor is to have these powers, it ought to be a matter for affirmative resolution.
</p>

<a name="50307-37_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_499"></a>I refer again, briefly, and in conclusion, to the report of the Select Committee. Paragraph 14 says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_79"></a>&quot;In view of the extensive powers given by the bill to restrict an individual subject to a control order, control order proceedings assume a particular importance. It is apparent from paragraph 4 <br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_594"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 594</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>of the Schedule that the rules are likely to contain provisions which would not be applied in other proceedings and which may well attract a level of controversy&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-37_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_500"></a>It can say that again.


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_80"></a>&quot;There is also a case for suggesting that because Parliament is being asked to consider the grant of these powers in some haste, the higher level of scrutiny should be applied when the power comes to be exercised. So the negative procedure provides an inadequate level of scrutiny. We consider that an affirmative procedure should apply to the initial rules by the Lord Chancellor for England and Wales and Northern Ireland, and recommend accordingly&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="50307-37_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_501"></a>That committee, on which I had the honour to serve for several years, is normally indulged by successive governments with the acceptance of its recommendations. I hope that when the noble and learned Lord replies, we shall find that that practice will not be departed from tonight.

<p><a name="st_424"></a>
<a name="50307-38_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   We have a number of amendments in this group. Amendments Nos. 173, 174 and 175 were intended to produce a slightly different solution from that proposed in Amendment No. 172. The Lord Chancellor, while still involved in making the rules, should be required to obtain the consent of the Lord Chief Justice rather than merely to consult him. However, having considered this matter further, we have decided not to move our amendments but instead to support Amendment No. 172, moved by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland.
</p>

<a name="50307-38_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_502"></a>Amendment No. 176 proposes that there should be the use of the affirmative resolution procedure which is strongly advocated by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee and which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, has just supported. However, we have considered the need, which I can understand, for rules to be brought into operation very quickly indeed, which would conflict with the need to make use of the ordinary form of the affirmative procedure.

</p>

<a name="50307-38_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_503"></a>We therefore intend to put down an amendment on Report which will introduce an unusual, but not unprecedented, form of affirmative resolution procedure for use in emergency situations. That means that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor will be able to bring his rules into force immediately the legislation comes into effect, but those rules will cease to have effect unless they are approved by a resolution of both Houses within 40 days. That seems to strike an appropriate balance between allowing the noble and learned Lord to introduce the rules with all necessary speed while requiring the use of an affirmative resolution after the event by both Houses and not simply having to rely on praying against the negative resolution procedure.
</p>




<p><a name="st_425"></a>
<a name="50307-38_spmin0"></a><b>The Duke of Montrose:</b>  I support my noble friend Lord Kingsland in this amendment. I am very much in favour of the rules being made by the Lord Chief Justice after consulting the Lord Chancellor. However, I rise with slight diffidence because I wish to raise another point.

<a name="50307-38_para2"></a>

happens, I have two amendments in that group which are rather similar. Going by the experience of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor this evening, one could very easily find that if you blink more than twice, the Liberal Democrats will have moved an amendment which would remove the clause to which you wish to speak.
</p>

<p><a name="stpa_505"></a>If and when my noble friend gets the chance to move Amendments Nos. 193 and 195 to replace &quot;Lord Chancellor&quot; with &quot;Lord Chief Justice&quot;, I am hoping to move amendments proposing that in Scotland it should be the Lord President.

</p>




<p><a name="st_426"></a>
<a name="50307-38_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   Beginning with the making of the first set of rules in relation to the control order procedures, the provisions made in the Bill involve the Lord Chancellor, after consulting with the Lord Chief Justice, making the rules for both England and Wales and for Northern Ireland. In Scotland, the Lord President makes the rules. That procedure is proposed because, in relation to each of the three jurisdictions, the rules are, in practice, required to be effective as soon as possible. The Part 4 powers lapse at midnight on 13 March, which is Sunday evening.
</p>

<a name="50307-38_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_506"></a>As for the proposal that if the Lord Chancellor makes the rules he should consult everyone that the Civil Procedure Rules Committee would consult in England and Wales and the Northern Ireland Civil Procedure Rules Committee would consult, that is not remotely practical. It is important that rules are in place. The critical question seems to be what is the best way to get there in a way that produces rules, as the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said, that are, in practice, judicial rules rather than in any way motivated by politics.
</p>

<a name="50307-38_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_507"></a>There are rules for the SIAC hearings at the moment which, although not identical, will be quite similar to the rules that will be applied in relation to this procedure. The best and most practical course in relation to getting rules that everyone consents to in England and Wales and in Northern Ireland, is for the Lord Chancellor to propose them, for the Lord Chief Justices in both those jurisdictions to consider them and then for all of us to reach agreement. I am sure that that is what will happen in practice. That will produce rules that are acceptable. But, as I said, these rules will need to be looked at very quickly thereafter because these are rules ultimately that we envisage being made by the Civil Procedure Rules Committee in both those countries.

</p>

<a name="50307-38_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_508"></a>How do we get to that point? The right course is for us to agree upon a procedure for the purposes of Parliament that the rules can come into effect straightaway but that they can, in some way or another subsequently, be reviewed by this House&#151;the sort of procedure proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. There could be an affirmative resolution procedure of an unusual sort, which the noble Lord suggested, or a negative procedure whereby this House could pray against the rules. I am not clear at the moment what the difference would be in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_596"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 596</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

practice, although I notice that the noble Lord, Lord   Garden, is shaking his head, so he is aware of what the difference between the two is.
</p>

<a name="50307-38_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_509"></a>I cannot see at the moment what the difference is, but we would need to consider some process by which the rules come into effect straightaway but that both Houses have a chance to look at them.
</p>

<a name="50307-38_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_510"></a>While that process is going on, no doubt the normal procedures will be gone through for the Civil Procedure Rules Committees in Northern Ireland and in England and Wales to produce appropriate rules. That way, we have covered the short-term problem. We have allowed Parliament to have a look at the rules and we have a process in place whereby eventually we get more permanent rules that apply.
</p>

<a name="50307-38_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_511"></a>Scotland is in a separate category. That was made clear in the course of the debates before the dinner hour adjournment. The Lord President will make the rules there, not the Lord Chancellor, on the basis that the rules of procedure of the Court of Session are a reserved matter not a matter for the Westminster Parliament or the Westminster government. The Lord President is confident he can produce rules within the time required. If further amendments are required, it is a matter for the Lord President to determine how those are dealt with.
</p>

<a name="50307-38_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_512"></a>This is a practical problem. I have sought in my proposal to accommodate all ranges of opinion around the House. It is not perfect but it is a sensible and workable solution. In those circumstances, I invite noble Lords to withdraw their amendments.

<p><a name="stpa_513"></a>I am most grateful for the amendment that has been tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, with respect to parliamentary approval. It seems to me that it would work.

</ul>

</p>




<p><a name="st_433"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 177 is the most radical in this group. It seeks to expunge the whole of paragraph 4 of the schedule to the Bill. This paragraph makes special rules of court. They are quite astonishingly different from the rules that one would normally find when engaging in litigation.
</p>

<a name="50307-39_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_519"></a>I am torn between two solutions on these matters. The first is simply to hand the whole thing over to the Lord Chief Justice and ask him to make a set of rules in the light of his experience and understanding of the matters which would have to be dealt with by control orders. On the other hand I am inclined to think that we need to do rather more than that on the face of the Bill. I am inclined to think that we need to put in some guarantees for the individual who is likely to be the subject matter of a control order. I have done that in two ways, partly by making some suggested excisions from paragraph 4 and partly by making some suggested additions to it. The excisions are contained in one line of the amendment and the additions are in the following line.
</p>

<a name="50307-39_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_520"></a>Paragraph 4(1)(a) deals with the burden of proof. I believe this matter is currently resolved because we have included in the Bill this afternoon the test of <br>&nbsp;<br>

balance of probabilities. So paragraph 4(1)(a), at least at the moment, no longer belongs in the Bill. I must say I find&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_434"></a>
<a name="50307-39_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   The matter is dealt with even more extensively. The problem with using the phrase &quot;burden of proof&quot; in the rules was that it might be said to give the rules the power to overturn the provisions about burden. Therefore, I have tabled an amendment that deletes the words &quot;burden of&quot;, which I think solves the problem completely.

<a name="50307-39_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_521"></a>Paragraph 4(1)(b) to the schedule enables or requires control order proceedings to be determined without a hearing. I find that rather alarming. In the extreme circumstances in which it might be inappropriate in some unforeseeable&#151;at least by me at the moment&#151;set of conditions not to have the defendant present, it would certainly be necessary to have the defendant&#039;s legal representative present at an oral hearing. I cannot understand how this paragraph can be justified when considered together with the imposition of a control order that is denying a citizen the rights that he has had since time immemorial.

</p>

<a name="50307-39_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_522"></a>I view paragraph 4(1)(c), which entitles the rules to make provisions about legal representation in such proceedings, with the gravest suspicion. It suggests to me that there might be some circumstances in which   the defendant might not be legally represented. That suspicion is confirmed by the last line of paragraph 4(2)(a), which refers to:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_83"></a>&quot;a relevant party to the proceedings or his legal representative (if he has one)&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-39_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_523"></a>I would have thought that if the potential subject of the control order is not entitled to have a hearing, <i>a fortiori</i> he ought to be entitled to have a legal representative.
</p>

<a name="50307-39_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_524"></a>By drawing your Lordships&#039; attention to the last line of paragraph 4(2)(a), I have said most of what I wish to say about the paragraph. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_84"></a>&quot;Rules of court made in exercise of the relevant powers may also, in particular . . . make provision enabling control order proceedings or relevant appeal proceedings to take place without full particulars of the reasons for decisions to which the proceedings relate being given to a relevant party to the proceedings or his legal representative&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-39_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_525"></a>I find that quite unacceptable. It may well be that a sifting process would have to take place so that the reasons given effectively disguise the sources of evidence or the means by which that evidence has been gathered, but I can see no justification for the terms of the clause itself.
</p>

<a name="50307-39_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_526"></a>Finally, I come to paragraph 4(3)(c), which is perhaps the most alarming provision in this entire paragraph. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_85"></a>&quot;The Secretary of State is not required for the purposes of any control order proceedings or relevant appeal proceedings to disclose anything to the relevant court, or to any other person, where he does not propose to rely on it in those proceedings&quot;.</p>

It seems to me to be contrary to all the principles that have been developed in the criminal courts over recent years.

</p>

<a name="50307-39_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_529"></a>It is very important that there should be a judicial decision for control orders if the principle of control orders is to be accepted. But, as we have said on previous occasions, the other side of the coin is that there must be due process&#151;something resembling a judicial hearing to enable a judge to take a judicial decision.
</p>

<a name="50307-39_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_530"></a>Almost everything seems to be excluded in this paragraph. There are provisions to be made about the mode of proof in control order proceedings&#151;obviously hearsay is involved in that; intercept evidence gets a paragraph to itself; but it also permits evidence that has been obtained by torture. I find it shocking that the Court of Appeal could recently decide&#151;as it is entitled to&#151;that it is part of the law of England that the courts will receive evidence obtained by torture subject only to one condition: that we do not do the torturing ourselves. I cannot understand why it is more reliable if the torture is carried out in Chechnya, Azerbaijan or some other place.
</p>

<a name="50307-39_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_531"></a>We have seen an unbelievable decline in standards, both in the United States through the way it has behaved at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo, and, I regret to say, in our own behaviour in Iraq, as has been found by recent hearings in the courts martial. This is another part of the decline of the judicial system being given statutory form. I find it absolutely shocking.

</p>

<a name="50307-39_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_532"></a>We will come on to sub-paragraph (3) of paragraph 4 in due course. But the one matter that really made me   stand up and throw the Bill away was sub-paragraph (3)(c) which deals with disclosure. Under the terms of this, it would no longer be necessary for the Secretary of State to disclose matters that were exculpatory as far as the suspect was concerned. Part 4 of the present Act has been condemned by the Judicial Committee of this House: but in that Act there are proper provisions for disclosure&#151;admittedly unsatisfactory in that it is disclosure to lawyers who have no opportunity of carrying out their fundamental duty of taking instructions from their clients. But here it is left to the Secretary of State to conceal from the claimant matters that are contrary to the Secretary of State&#039;s case or which might assist the claimant&#039;s case.

Would not each acknowledge that if prosecuting counsel were to be found in disciplinary proceedings to have withheld material that exculpates the defendant, that would lead unquestionably to his disbarring, as being in fundamental breach of a most important tenet of a member of the Bar, which is to serve the interests of justice?

taking out paragraph 4. The provision is repeated at different times. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, quoted paragraph 4(2)(a), which made,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_87"></a>&quot;provision enabling control order proceedings or relevant appeal proceedings to take place without full particulars of the reasons for decisions to which the proceedings relate being given&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-40_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_539"></a>Later on paragraph 4(3)(c) states,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_88"></a>&quot;to disclose anything to the relevant court, or to any other person, where he does not propose to rely on it in those proceedings&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-40_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_540"></a>That has a different connotation and meaning for me than it does for some other noble Lords. I am extremely worried and disturbed at how intelligence material in general and interception material in particular is being advocated by some noble Lords as suitable for disclosure in court proceedings. I am absolutely and implacably opposed to that for many reasons.
</p>

<a name="50307-40_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_541"></a>The whole area of interception is much more complex and sensitive than most people imagine. Happily that also includes the targets of those operations. It needs only a mention, a hint, let alone actual revealing, just once in any proceedings to lose that capacity. That would be an extremely serious blow to any intelligence or law enforcement service.
</p>

<a name="50307-40_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_542"></a>It is not often realised that when one takes action, it is a technical operation. In this country, it is completely controlled by the Interception of Communications Act, with a commissioner who is a judge. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, who unfortunately is not in his place, was the first such commissioner. Under that Act, operations are carried out by intelligence and security services, as well as police and other law enforcement agencies.
</p>

<a name="50307-40_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_543"></a>It is often said that other countries can use such evidence in court so why cannot it be done here? There are many good reasons for that. In some countries the evidence produced from a national police force in its own territory plugging into telephone lines is not a very sensitive operation. It does not give away anything much about techniques, and it usually does not endanger delicate sources. Technical operations often require agents to help with access. If it is cipher, there is usually a key to it from intermediaries who are recruited and who risk a lot to help.
</p>

<a name="50307-40_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_544"></a>To risk that in a court is quite wrong. The extent of the risk is not fully recognised. One cannot go into too many details, but one example in the public domain is the trial of the people who carried out the first attack on the World Trade Centre. The FBI put intercept material into court, and immediately Al&#039;Qaeda changed from using the form of communication from which that material had come, thereby putting back the effort against it considerably. There are lots of other examples but that is one of the main ones.
</p>

<a name="50307-40_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_545"></a>We also have to consider our legal system. There are many noble Lords in the Chamber who know our legal system much better than I do, and I have heard a lot about it tonight. One thing that is different about our legal system, of which we are proud, is the adversarial roles of counsel&#151;the defence, in particular. A defence counsel can range far and wide when he has evidence <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_602"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 602</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

or someone is in the witness box. I am not saying that that is wrong, but we should not then have sensitive material so that a defence counsel can go well beyond the part that is being produced in court proceedings.
</p>

<a name="50307-40_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_546"></a>That is a strong argument that people do not always appreciate. In other countries where there is an investigating judge or magistrate, things are different. Sensitive material can be used without the risk involved in using it in a British court. In this country, we not only have various agencies, which have a sophisticated and efficient means of interception, we also have a very close relationship between our security and intelligence forces and law enforcement agencies. I am not saying that that is unique in the world, but it is very rare. If you start to bring in material from the services, which have to take more risks and to use more sophisticated techniques, and you expose them, you will endanger a lot more than most people realise.

<a name="50307-40_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   I have huge, genuine respect for the noble Baroness&#039;s tremendous experience in the field of intelligence, and I think that everybody in this Committee respects her for that experience. But some of us lawyers have worked with intelligence material in court quite frequently&#151;currently, in my case. I would be interested to know whether the noble Baroness has recently been in a court to see how these intelligence matters are handled today, or whether she is looking back to a time, let us say, 10 or 15 years ago, when these matters were dealt with quite differently.
</p>




<p><a name="st_441"></a>
<a name="50307-40_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </b>   I was not in court then, and I have not been in court recently, but I do not have to be to know what is happening. And, yes, I am aware of what is happening. Of course things have changed a great deal. None of that invalidates anything that I have just said about the sensitivity of interception techniques, which you would endanger if you started producing them in court and to a defendant.
</p>

<a name="50307-40_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_547"></a>I have very rarely met a lawyer who did not want intercept material in a court. In my experience, most lawyers are always completely confident that anything can be contained and dealt with well in court. I accept that; it is a professional feeling, and if it were my whole world, perhaps I would believe it too. My world was different, and I do not accept that position. I am extremely disturbed at the idea of very sensitive material going into court proceedings.
</p>




<p><a name="st_442"></a>
<a name="50307-40_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Judd: </b>   Like the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, I have unlimited respect for my noble friend Lady Ramsay and her professional experience in these spheres. All of that means that we should listen to what she says with great care.
</p>

<a name="50307-40_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_548"></a>It is far too late in the evening to go over all the arguments, but I commend to the Committee the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which looked at the issue very seriously. I ask my noble friend to accept that we took the kinds of points that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_603"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 603</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

she has made very seriously. However, looking at practice elsewhere in the world, and looking at what was possible here, we concluded that the situation was not as absolute as she has very forthrightly expressed it this evening, and that there would be ways in which to    tackle this problem while maintaining the responsibility for the integrity of the operation and for the safety of those involved in terribly dangerous and vital work. I ask noble Lords on all sides of the Committee, if they can spare the time, to read the report and to see what the committee had to say on the matter.
</p>

<a name="50307-40_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_549"></a>I wish to respond to what the noble Lord, Lord   Thomas of Gresford, said about torture. Again, the Joint Committee on Human Rights has been deeply exercised about that and has spent a good deal of time considering it. I remind Members of the Committee that the Joint Committee is made up of six Members of this House and six Members of the other place, about half of whom are lawyers and half non-lawyers. All the principal parties are represented on that committee.
</p>

<a name="50307-40_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_550"></a>Of course the committee took into account what the Court of Appeal had ruled. But I hope that the Committee will forgive me at this late hour if I do not go into an expansive discourse. I beg the indulgence of the Committee if I read just three paragraphs from the Joint Committee&#039;s report, because I suspect that, given all the pressures of time and the rest, not everybody has had time to see them. I would just like to read them; they will not take long:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_89"></a>&quot;The UN Committee Against Torture, in its recent Concluding Observations, expressed its concern that UK law had been interpreted to exclude the use of evidence extracted by torture only where its officials were complicit, and recommended that the Government should give some formal effect to its expressed intention not to rely on or present in any proceeding evidence where there is knowledge or belief that it has been obtained by torture.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_90"></a>We asked the Home Secretary&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-40_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_551"></a>when the Home Secretary was giving evidence&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_91"></a>&quot;if he could confirm that none of the material which is relied upon in relation to the current detainees has been obtained from other sources abroad, including the United States, where there have been serious allegations of torture and prisoner abuse. The Home Secretary said that the Government did consider whether it believed that torture had been used in any particular case, and that it did not believe that torture had been used in the cases of the current detainees, but&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-40_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_552"></a>and I quote the Home Secretary&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_92"></a>&quot;&#039;we are in a serious difficulty here in that proving a negative in this case is a difficult thing to do.&#039; When pressed on how precisely the Government establish that torture has not been used, the Home Secretary repeated that proving a negative is a difficult thing to do. When asked for an assurance that he will apply an absolute rule that if there is any question that evidence has been obtained by torture it must not be used, the Home Secretary said&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-40_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_553"></a>and again, I quote&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_93"></a>&quot;I would need to be convinced that it had been used which . . .  I am not in this case&#039;&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-40_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_554"></a>Our report concluded with this paragraph:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_94"></a>&quot;We remain concerned about the possible use of torture evidence by UK authorities. Our concerns have not been allayed by the evidence of the Home Secretary. Indeed, we now have concerns about whether the Government has any system in place <br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_604"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 604</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>for ascertaining whether intelligence which reaches it in relation to people allegedly involved in terrorism-related activity has been obtained by torture. The Bill is silent on this question, despite the obvious concern that the material relied on by the Government to obtain control orders may well include material which has been obtained by torture. We recommend that the Government takes the opportunity presented by this Bill to implement the UNCAT recommendation that it give some formal effect to its expressed intention not to rely on or present in any proceedings evidence which it knows or believes to have been obtained by torture&quot;.</p>

<a name="50307-41_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </b>   I warmly endorse and   support everything that the noble Baroness, Lady   Ramsay, has said. I will, however, add two points. One is that we are also obliged to think about the rights of the agent who takes the risk, by working&#151;probably for many years&#151;in a highly dangerous environment, knowing that his life is at stake. That would be so in the kind of case we are discussing. Frankly, if such agents see this sort of thing happening in courts, and defence counsel&#151;quite properly, given the interests of their client&#151;revealing what should not be revealed, then we shall not have any agents. That would be a pretty serious situation.
</p>

<a name="50307-41_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_555"></a>It is also one of the more serious aspects of terrorism that it is extremely difficult to find people with access, courage, determination and lasting power. We should not overlook the fact that they too have rights. They need to be protected&#151;and need that protection more, I fear, than the person who would be on trial.
</p>




<p><a name="st_444"></a>
<a name="50307-41_spmin0"></a><b>The Earl of Onslow:</b>  I would surmise that the problem outlined by the noble Baroness, Lady Ramsay, and my noble friend Lady Park is not new. I assume that throughout the Irish Troubles we had agents deep within the IRA. We knew that we did not have to compromise them and we knew how not to compromise them.
</p>

<a name="50307-41_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_556"></a>On intercept evidence, I go back to the 1914 war. That may sound rather odd, but I refer to the famous Zimmermann telegram. Because we had broken the German diplomatic code, we could read all the German diplomatic exchanges within the United States. It was absolutely essential that we did not allow the Germans to know that we had broken their code&#151;exactly the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Ramsay.
</p>

<a name="50307-41_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_557"></a>Noble Lords will know that Zimmermann was the German Foreign Minister. He sent a telegram to the German ambassador in Mexico asking him to please stir up a war between the United States and Mexico. Mexico could then have Arizona, Texas and New Mexico back. That drove the United States up the wall. It was a really important piece of information. We had to convince the Americans that it was genuine&#151;Woodrow Wilson was being difficult&#151;and we had to convince the Germans that we had not broken their code.

</p>

<a name="50307-41_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_558"></a>The point is that there is nothing new in this problem and therefore we can deal with it in the old ways. We must be very careful not to compromise our sources of intelligence. Al&#039;Qaeda knows perfectly well, because it has been all over the American newspapers, that when one of Osama bin Laden&#039;s people uses a satellite television in a cave in Afghanistan, almost immediately a drone aeroplane zaps in from on high, having picked up the signal. Those people know that we have very high <br>&nbsp;<br>

quality interception. These problems can be overcome, as they have been in countless previous court cases, whether they concern the IRA or spies for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
</p>

<a name="50307-41_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_559"></a>On the subject of torture, the noble Lord, Lord   Judd, makes a good point in saying that the Home Secretary complains that he cannot prove a negative. If he gets a tip or information from the Uzbek intelligence community, it is almost a racing cert, because that is how those people function, that it has been obtained through torture. Equally, I suggest that the Egyptian anti-terrorist intelligence services are not exactly members of a Liberal Democrat parish council.
</p>

<a name="50307-41_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_560"></a>All these problems are knowable; there is nothing new in them and there is no reason why we cannot deal with them in complete conformity with a view to human rights and according to our own standards. That is what we are in this House to maintain.
</p>




<p><a name="st_445"></a>
<a name="50307-41_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </b>   I cannot refrain from saying, with the greatest respect to my noble friend, that he is talking absolute nonsense. This is a totally different situation, one that involves far more sophisticated people and much greater danger. Thank God we did have people within the IRA, but we would not have had them if they had been exposed in this way. That will happen again. We are not talking about the Zimmermann telegram, although that was an important issue; we are talking about human beings&#151;and human beings we will be putting at risk. I submit that that is not the same as putting systems at risk, although they are very important.

<p><a name="st_446"></a>
<a name="50307-41_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   These are important provisions about the rules of procedure and it is incumbent on the Committee to consider the material put before us by those who have engaged in the debate. I am extraordinarily impressed by what has been said by both my noble friend Lady Ramsay and the noble Baroness, Lady Park. Indeed, their words are wholly reflected by those with any experience of what has gone on within SIAC. I refer to three authorities in that respect. First, the committee chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Newton, made it absolutely clear that certain material could not be disclosed either to the suspect who was the subject of the orders or to his lawyers. Secondly, the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, made exactly the same points as the noble Baroness, Lady Park, in his report. He referred specifically to the fact that free disclosure would put human intelligence sources at risk. Thirdly, the judges in SIAC supported the non-disclosure of material to the suspect for precisely the reasons that the noble Baronesses, Lady Ramsay and Lady Park, put to this Committee this evening.
</p>

<a name="50307-41_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_561"></a>With respect to the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, he delivered an entertaining speech, although I prefer the epithet of the noble Baroness, Lady Park. It sounded absolute nonsense. One should look to see what methods had been crafted in the context of the present <br>&nbsp;<br>

situation and accept that the people who had been working it may know better than us. We should accept those provisions.
</p>

<a name="50307-41_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_562"></a>I also draw attention to the fact that, as far as lawyers are concerned&#151;in a sense, lawyers should follow a problem, rather than think they can impose a template&#151;the European Court of Human Rights adopted the approach whereby it was not disclosed to the suspect or his or her lawyer. Instead, they indicated that the use of a special advocate was the right procedure, which is SIAC. As I indicated during earlier submissions, the approach that SIAC has taken was explicitly approved on two separate occasions by the Court of Appeal as being a just process. The Court of Appeal looked at it and said that it is the right way to deal with it.
</p>

<a name="50307-41_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_563"></a>In the case of M, the noble and learned Lord, Lord   Woolf, the Lord Chief Justice, explained:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_95"></a>&quot;As this appeal illustrates, a special advocate&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-41_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_564"></a>which means that some material has not been disclosed to the suspect&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_96"></a>&quot;can play an important role in protecting an appellant&#039;s interests before SIAC. He can seek further information. He can ensure that evidence before SIAC is tested on behalf of the appellant. He can object to evidence and other information being unnecessarily kept from the appellant&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-41_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_565"></a>He concluded:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_97"></a>&quot;It is possible by using special advocates to ensure that those detained can achieve justice and it is wrong, therefore, to undervalue the SIAC appeals process&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-41_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_566"></a>That is somebody who has looked at it on a number of occasions. Everybody who has looked at it thinks that that is the right way to deal with it.
</p>

<a name="50307-41_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_567"></a>I shall go through the provisions about rules very quickly to satisfy the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. Paragraph 4(1)(a) states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_98"></a>&quot;make provision about the mode and burden of proof&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-41_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_568"></a>We delete the words &quot;and burden&quot; to deal with his point. I cannot believe that he objects to rules being made which talk about the mode of proof,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_99"></a>&quot;in control order proceedings and about evidence in such proceedings&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-41_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_569"></a>Paragraph 4(1)(b) states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_100"></a>&quot;enable or require such proceedings to be determined without a hearing&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-41_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_570"></a>I cannot believe that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, wants it to be necessary for there to be a hearing even where there is a consent order or for some minor matter. Of course not. Therefore, paragraph 4(1)(b) is not the horror that the noble Lord sought to suggest it was.
</p>

<a name="50307-41_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_571"></a>Paragraph 4(1)(c) states:

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-41_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_572"></a>That was put in so that the court can allow somebody who would otherwise not have rights of audience to have rights of audience. I do not know whether or not the noble Lord would wish that to be removed.

<p><a name="stpa_582"></a>Paragraph 4(3)(c) has also been referred to. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_106"></a>&quot;the Secretary of State is not required for the purposes of any control order proceedings or relevant appeal proceedings to disclose anything to the relevant court, or to any other person, where he does not propose to rely on it in those proceedings&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-41_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_583"></a>We make it clear that any exculpatory material has to be disclosed. The practice at the moment is that the Secretary of State gets his counsel to check through all of the material to see whether there is any exculpatory material. That is then disclosed to the court and to the special advocate acting in the context of the suspect, who does not see all of the material.
</p>

<a name="50307-41_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_584"></a>If there is any material that the Secretary of State objects to the suspect or his legal representative seeing, then, as long as the court agrees&#151;and it has hitherto&#151;it will not be shown to the suspect or his legal representative. So both the court and the special advocate definitely see the exculpatory material and, if there is no objection, then so does the suspect and his legal representative.

<a name="50307-42_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </b>   I am grateful for that description of practice, which is very welcome. Why can it not be included specifically in the Bill, in the rule?
</p>




<p><a name="st_448"></a>
<a name="50307-42_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   That is the way in which it works in practice. I do not think that the rule in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_608"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 608</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

paragraph 4(3)(c) would prevent that happening. That is the proposition that was being advanced. I shall certainly think carefully about what has been said in relation to it and, if I think that it does prevent that happening, or the rules reflect that happening, I shall come back to the House and seek to make an amendment to ensure that it does not happen.

</p>

<a name="50307-42_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_585"></a>Ultimately a point could be reached where, having disclosed the material to the court and to the special advocate, if the court took the view that the suspect should see that material and the Secretary of State took the view that that would be intensely damaging to national security, it would be for the Secretary of State to decide at that point whether he was going to proceed with relying on that material. But I make it clear that exculpatory material has got to be shown to the court and to the special advocate. I think that meets the point made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew.
</p>




<p><a name="st_449"></a>
<a name="50307-42_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   Perhaps the noble and learned Lord can help me on that topic. When the SIAC sees material that is not disclosed either to the applicant or to his representative, is it entitled to act upon it? Usually in a criminal trial the judge will look at material to decide whether it is relevant or whether it should be disclosed, but he does not act on it because there is a jury, and it is the jury who are the finders of fact. What happens with material disclosed to SIAC? Is it entitled to act upon that material?
</p>




<p><a name="st_450"></a>
<a name="50307-42_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   Of course it is entitled to act on it. The decision is being made by SIAC and it must make its decision on the basis of all the material that is put before it. If there is material that is shown to the court and looked at by the special advocate but not seen by the applicant or his legal representative, SIAC is obliged to consider all of the material before it in reaching a decision. There is no exclusion of the material from its decision-making process. It might not attach much weight to it for evidential reasons or it might attach significant weight to it; it is for SIAC to decide.
</p>

<a name="50307-42_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_586"></a>The way in which the commission operates is that it has to try to be as fair as it can be to everyone. It has to make its decision based on all the material before it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_451"></a>
<a name="50307-42_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   I am grateful for that clarification. Does it then follow that SIAC makes a decision and forms its reasons based upon material that is never shown to the applicant, but then does not tell him those reasons? So his liberty can be diminished without him ever knowing what SIAC has seen, what the allegations are and what the reasons are for his detention or whatever it may be. Is that how it works?
</p>




<p><a name="st_452"></a>
<a name="50307-42_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   Again, I am disappointed that the noble Lord has not read the Newton report and the Carlile report, which went through all of this in great detail. The court seeks to give as much material as it possibly can to the suspect and his legal representatives. Some of the material, if disclosed to the suspect or his legal representative, could endanger method or source of information. So a balance has had to be struck, an <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_609"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 609</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

approach that the European Court of Human Rights has upheld as a fair process because of the intervention of the   special advocate. I refer not to SIAC but to the deportation tribunals in 1997, where that was upheld. We submit that there is no difference whether it is a control order or imprisonment pending deportation. We have adopted a procedure that the convention has suggested.
</p>

<a name="50307-42_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_587"></a>We think that each paragraph in the rules is not the sinister thing that the noble Lord suggests but a sensible and workable way of putting together the rules. We put in the specific provisions relating to the rules in part to ensure that there will be a proper debate about what will go into the rules on the first occasion. I am glad that we did so because it has enabled us to get rid of some misconceptions and face head on the issue of how the procedure will work.
</p>




<p><a name="st_453"></a>
<a name="50307-42_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Falkner of Margravine: </b>   I wish to readdress the question of my noble friend Lord Thomas. Does the noble and learned Lord, the Lord Chancellor, accept or agree that a procedure used for immigration tribunals would stand the test were it to come forward in this context of restrictions on liberty and so forth?
</p>




<p><a name="st_454"></a>
<a name="50307-42_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   Yes, I believe that it would. I believe that it is the fairest procedure that can be devised that ensures that the suspect sees as much as possible and we protect our sources. The consequence for the people in respect of whom the procedure has been held to be fair is that they have been put in prison and have been in prison for a considerable time. Control orders will not go that far. I have little hesitation in saying that I believe this to be the fairest procedure. The Lord Chief Justice described it as a procedure whereby justice could be done. That is the essential test of whether it is fair.
</p>

<a name="50307-42_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_588"></a>We have to face up to the need to strike that balance. The consequence of what the noble Baroness, Lady   Falkner, is saying, is that if we cannot disclose everything then we cannot have control orders. That is not the approach that either we or, I believe, the Front Benches of either opposition party or the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, or the noble Lord, Lord Newton, or the courts take.
</p>

<a name="50307-42_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_589"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 179, the purpose of which is explicitly to prevent the court from using evidence obtained through use of torture. The Government unreservedly condemn the use of torture and have made it an important part of our foreign policy to pursue its eradication worldwide. There has been a great deal of speculation about the cases put before the Special Immigration Appeals Commission and whether they relied on material from other countries that may have been obtained using torture.
</p>

<a name="50307-42_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_590"></a>SIAC emphatically rejected any suggestion that any evidence relied on by the Home Secretary was or even may have been obtained by torture; or indeed by any inhuman or degrading treatment. The Court of Appeal confirmed SIAC&#039;s view. It is important to be clear that it is not the Home Secretary&#039;s intention to rely on or present to the court evidence where there is a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_610"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 610</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

knowledge or belief that torture has taken place. We do not believe that the amendment is appropriate because we do not need it.
</p>

<a name="50307-42_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_591"></a>I should make it clear that even though the Court of Appeal in <i>A and Others</i>&#151;that is not the <i>A and Others</i> case that went to the House of Lords, but the other <i>A</i>&#151;confirmed SIAC&#039;s view that there was no evidence that any material relied on by the Secretary of State had been obtained by torture, it decided by a majority the issue of whether such material could ever be admissible evidence.
</p>

<a name="50307-42_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_592"></a>On this issue the Court of Appeal held that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_107"></a>&quot;The Secretary of State could not rely on a statement which his agents had procured by torture, or with his agent&#039;s connivance at torture. He was not, however, precluded from relying, for the purposes of ss 21 and 15 ATCSA 2001, on evidence coming into his hands which had or might have been obtained through torture by agencies of other states over which he had no power or direction. If he had neither procured the torture nor connived at it, he had not offended the relevant constitutional principles. Provided that the Secretary of State was acting in good faith, a recognition of his responsibility for national security was required when assessing his approach to the material available to him. That conclusion was not altered by art 15 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-42_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_593"></a>That matter is now going to the House of Lords.
</p>




<p><a name="st_455"></a>
<a name="50307-42_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Judd: </b>   Does my noble and learned friend agree that it is not just a matter of human rights and related issues, but that it is fundamentally central to our considerations that information gained by torture is notoriously unreliable? If the Home Secretary does not know for certain how the information has been acquired, how can he evaluate that information and its reliability? Does that not serve to underline still further that, right at the centre of the decisions that may be made by the Home Secretary, there is the possibility that he is acting on information about whose quality he cannot be certain.
<a name="time_32"></a>
<a name="50307-42_time0"></a><h5>11.30 p.m.</h5>
</p>




<p><a name="st_456"></a>
<a name="50307-42_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   I repeat our utter repudiation of torture. Governments will obtain material from other governments, but they may not know the precise details of how it was obtained and yet they may regard it as reliable; for example, the source has given reliable material in other circumstances. So reliability can be judged by testing what has been said elsewhere.
</p>

<a name="50307-42_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_594"></a>On the basis that the material is reliable, and there is no suggestion that it was acquired under torture, the Home Secretary would be justified in relying on it so that steps can be taken to prevent an atrocity in this country. As I say, I make it clear that we repudiate torture and that is an essential part of our foreign policy.

<p><a name="st_457"></a>
<a name="50307-43_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </b>   Before we leave the topic altogether, the noble and learned Lord has quoted from the judgment of the Court of Appeal. Was it not the argument of the Government before the Court of Appeal that evidence obtained by torture, so long as it <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_611"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 611</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

was not obtained by people under the control of the Government, was admissible and acceptable? Is that not encouraging the use of torture in other countries?
</p>




<p><a name="st_458"></a>
<a name="50307-43_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   The Government&#039;s argument was that no material relied on by the Home Secretary had been obtained by torture. That was the first submission. The second submission was that, if, contrary to that first submission, it was obtained by torture and it was reliable, in certain circumstances it would be necessary for the Home Secretary to rely on it if he were to prevent an atrocity. Both arguments were accepted by the court, provided that the Secretary of State was acting in good faith. A recognition of his responsibility for national security was required when assessing his approach to the material available to him. The House of Lords will have to decide whether that is right or wrong.

</p>

<a name="50307-43_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_595"></a>I shall be interested to know the view of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, if the Home Secretary were confronted by material that was reliable, because it was confirmed in another place&#151;for example, material relating to another country had been provided by that source and it turned out to be right&#151;and that material suggested that an atrocity might be about to occur. To what extent would the forces of the state be entitled to rely on that? Perhaps that argument is for another day.
</p>




<p><a name="st_459"></a>
<a name="50307-43_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Falkner of Margravine: </b>   I appreciate that the noble and learned Lord&#039;s words are not addressed to me but to my noble friend Lord Thomas. I believe he goes to the heart of the matter. If the Home Secretary found that the evidence was reliable, perhaps the noble and learned Lord can tell the Committee how the Home Secretary would expect to know that the evidence is reliable when it might have been obtained by torture and he does not have any information on the veracity of the material. Will there be some definitional test whereby the Home Secretary will certify that the information on which he bases his decision is not obtained by torture? Ergo, essentially we do not know. Therefore, how can we take serious decisions, based on a serious perception of a threat when we simply do not know. We know empirically that evidence obtained by torture tends on the whole to be unreliable.
</p>




<p><a name="st_460"></a>
<a name="50307-43_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   I would much prefer that the noble Baroness, Lady Park, or my noble friend Lady Ramsay, answer that question. My instinctive reaction is to say, &quot;How is the Home Secretary supposed to know?&quot;. He has to make a judgment and he has to take advice. In relation to intelligence, it may be that one of the most indicative signs that something is to be relied upon is whether the source had produced material in the past that had turned out to be reliable. It might depend on what the source was, whether human intelligence or technological intelligence. One would put everything together and come to a judgment in relation to where, overall, the intelligence points. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_612"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column 612</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

That involves making a judgment and it involves the Home Secretary taking sensible advice and being able to evaluate all the material before him.
</p>




<p><a name="st_461"></a>
<a name="50307-43_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   I thank the noble and learned Lord for his response, and indeed all noble and noble and learned Lords who have spoken in this crucial debate.
</p>

<a name="50307-43_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_596"></a>Before I make my concluding remarks, I would like   to press the noble and learned Lord on paragraph   4(3)(c), which deals with exculpatory evidence. The noble and learned Lord said he was not sure whether his undertakings about exculpatory evidence were consistent with that paragraph. It seems to me that they are not.
</p>

<a name="50307-43_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_597"></a>The paragraph states that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_108"></a>&quot;the Secretary of State is not required for the purposes of any control order proceedings or relevant appeal proceedings to disclose anything to the relevant court&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p><a name="stpa_598"></a>I pause there&#151;

<ul>

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-43_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_599"></a>It would make a great deal of difference to me in this whole debate if the noble and learned Lord were prepared to make a clear distinction between revealing this evidence to the court and revealing it to any other person.
</p>

<a name="50307-43_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_600"></a>I accept the powerful speeches made by the noble Baroness, Lady Ramsay, and my noble friend Lady   Park, saying that there will be circumstances where it would be fatal to the national interest to reveal either the source of intelligence information or the method by which that source succeeded in gleaning it. I accept that it follows that evidence about the source and the methodology should not be revealed to any other person except the special advocate.
</p>

<a name="50307-43_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_601"></a>Does the noble and learned Lord agree, however, that the court ought to have all the evidence made available? By that, I mean the judge, because he would be in a position to sift that evidence and ensure that &quot;any other person&quot;, at the end of the day, was only aware of the consequences of what had been discovered, and not the manner in which it had been discovered or the person who discovered it. If the judge could render down the information they had to what he considered was essential for the prospective subject of the control order to know, in all fairness, I would derive a great deal of comfort from what the noble and learned Lord said.
</p>

<a name="50307-43_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_602"></a>To say that the Secretary of State can simply assert that evidence is reliable, however, and to have to do no more, would make these control orders an executive act, not the consequence of a judicial decision, even though they would be made by a judge.
</p>




<p><a name="st_462"></a>
<a name="50307-43_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord   Kingsland, exactly follows what I was saying. I am happy to go away and, if necessary, amend paragraph 4(3)(c) to make it clear that nothing must prevent&#151;indeed, there must be rules that require&#151;the disclosure of exculpatory material to the court and to the special advocate.

I completely agree that exculpatory material has to go to the court and the special advocate. The question is where the line is drawn after that. I am not sure whether paragraph 4(3)(c) prevents that, but if it does, then we will amend it to ensure that the court and the special advocate, at least, see it.

</p>

<a name="50307-43_para9"></a>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>Page 1, line 15, leave out &quot;or any part&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>The noble Lord said: Before I begin I should say that it is a pleasure again to be facing Ministers, particularly my colleague, the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, on the scrutiny of another piece of legislation, which is small but important. It seems strange that in a few weeks time we shall be changing sides and that it might be the last time that we are on these sides&#151;who knows?
</p>

<a name="50307-44_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>This is a probing amendment which goes to the heart of one of the important issues in the Bill, regarding the pilots, the size of the area that they cover and the criteria used to determine what falls within and without them. If a scheme is based on the location of parents, I am concerned that a situation might arise in which some pupils at a school received free transport and others did not. Will that constitute discrimination against the parents who did not receive free school transport?
</p>

<a name="50307-44_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>If a scheme is based on the location of schools, who will decide which schools are in or out of the pilot area and what will be the impact on the schools which are without and within the pilot areas? Which areas will a pilot cover if it applies to only a part of a county, for example? In urban-dominated LEAs, where most children live within three miles of a secondary school, a school transport scheme would be of interest in terms of its effects on urban traffic congestion, but it might not give any indication as to the impact of such a scheme on a more rural area of a county.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC184"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column GC184</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50307-44_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>Furthermore, in LEAs where there is little movement between schools, little evidence would be gained from a pilot on the impact of charging on school choice. It is easy to monitor the effects of a partial scheme in a small area and the benefits that will be gained from it. Alternatively, one might examine areas in which there is more variety of school choice&#151;for example, when there are both rural and urban parts in the same scheme.
</p>

<a name="50307-44_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>Local authorities will need guidance from the department and the Welsh Assembly as to what should comprise a partial pilot scheme area. In some LEAs, a pilot scheme that covered only part of an area would be highly inappropriate.
</p>

<a name="50307-44_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>I hope that the Minister can shed some light on this matter. As I said, this is a probing amendment and I would be interested to hear his comments. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="50307-44_spmin3"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills  (Lord Filkin): </b>  I thank the noble Lord for his kind words about us meeting here yet again. It seems like only last week that we were meeting here to discuss a Bill. I am also impressed by his optimism.

</p>

<a name="50307-44_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>I recognise that this is a probing amendment which addresses whether schemes should cover a whole area or could apply to part of an area. Although we will be keen to receive applications from authorities proposing authority-wide schemes, we want authorities to have the flexibility to develop the best pilot schemes that they can for their particular area.
</p>

<a name="50307-44_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>The Bill is deregulatory and is intended to provide flexibility for LEAs to design pilot schemes that best suit the particular local needs. During consultation, a number of local authorities suggested that some larger   authorities might wish to develop schemes which addressed issues in a limited geographical area with particular problems. They would wish to maintain the existing arrangements in other parts of their authority, where issues were different or where current arrangements were working reasonably well.
</p>

<a name="50307-44_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>When I was looking into this Bill, it struck me, for example, that an authority such as Kent, which is probably one of the largest geographic areas and has one of the largest populations, might well wish to develop a scheme to cover the whole area. However, the burden is   very different in terms of the thoroughness and consultation required for a population of a million, or for almost 250,000 pupils, from that required for a much smaller authority. Therefore, we were persuaded that there was good reason why the provision should be in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50307-44_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>The Bill would allow local authorities to take the action if they wished. We are not saying that they should or should not take advantage of it; they should be allowed the opportunity. Amendment No. 1&#151;granted, it is probing&#151;would restrict large authorities particularly, and might be seen as slightly discriminatory against them. As to the basis for the part-pilot&#151;whether it should be parental address or school address&#151;it is likely to be both parental address and school attended. It could <br>&nbsp;<br>

not cater for cross-boundary flows. I agree that we will need to put into guidance how such partial schemes would be dealt with, so that authorities understood it clearly.
</p>

<a name="50307-44_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>I hope that that is helpful. If a little more information would help, I would be delighted to write to the noble Lord.

<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="50307-45_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   The Minister did not mention parental choice at all. At the moment, transport is provided to the nearest appropriate school. I think that everyone&#151;certainly those of us in opposition&#151;wants to give more parental choice. The Government say that they want to as well. At the moment, that obviously involves charging people for parental choice, which I mentioned when I moved the amendment. Does the Minister have any comment on how parental choice will affect such a pilot scheme?
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="50307-45_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   We will deal with parental choice throughout the amendments. The position on it would be no different in respect of a partial scheme than in respect of a total authority scheme. That is not a defining characteristic in terms of this aspect of partial or total schemes. Transport will continue to be provided to the nearest school, and the option is to cater for parental choice in pilots.
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="50307-45_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   If local authorities are to pursue the pilots, they might want to begin to consider that parental choice be part of the scheme. I know that we shall deal with it in various parts of the Bill. The point that I made when I moved the amendment was that you could have a school with all the variations&#151;some free transport, some use of a pilot scheme and some parental choice. Therefore, there would be a lot of different regimes in the same school. Does the Minister think that appropriate? It obviously could be part of such schemes.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="50307-45_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   The noble Lord is right that that could take place. It is one of the consequences of allowing authorities to run part-authority schemes. We do not expect that that will necessarily be the preference for most local authorities. For the reasons I gave, it would be wrong not to allow that option, particularly as it would be beneficial to some large authorities. I shall reflect on what he said, and if I can add some further clarification before Report, I shall be delighted to do so.

</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 2 would require local authorities to consult admission bodies, representatives of denominational schools and a number of other bodies. It would prevent a scheme being made until those consultations had taken place. Amendment No. 6 would give the Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales power to make regulations specifying the consultation process that local authorities should undertake before making a scheme application. The regulations would also provide a list of statutory consultees.
</p>

<a name="50307-45_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>A full consultation process is vital to underpin any applications as part of the legislation. It is crucial that we achieve it, to ensure that the voice of the most vulnerable in society is heard. That is especially important as we are discussing changes to sensitive travel arrangements that could lead to additional costs being imposed on parents where children are classified as having special educational needs or attend denominational schools, for example. We must get the consultation right and, where possible, that should be reflected in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50307-45_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>Consultation is important because the measure will lead to significant change for many children who currently enjoy free school transport and it will impact on many children with special educational needs. There would be a huge impact on the institutions in local authority areas, such as denominational schools, special schools and schools in rural areas, with a number of people being affected.
</p>

<a name="50307-45_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>If people feel that they could lose out as a consequence of the Bill, perhaps being charged for transport that has hitherto been free, it is important that they are consulted when the scheme is drawn up. The guidance currently available to local authorities is too brief, and that is why Amendment No. 6 fleshes out the consultation process. In its pre-legislative scrutiny report, the Select Committee on Education and Skills said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;Well-run schemes should be based on wide consultation with schools as well as other stakeholders and should have secured agreement about their proposals&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="50307-45_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>Amendment No. 2 sets out the range of organisations that we wish to see consulted. The local admissions forum is the perfect body for a local authority to consult <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC187"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column GC187</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

because it is already set up to talk about issues such as school funding, budgets and service contracts between schools and local authorities. It is the automatic and logical focus for consultation with schools in discussing and drafting the proposed schemes.
</p>

<a name="50307-45_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>We must also ensure that representatives of denominational schools are consulted properly. It is important to recognise that there is concern within faith groups about this legislation. In later debates on other amendments, we shall talk about some of the aspects affecting denominational schools. Many such schools are concerned that charging for school transport will reduce the choice available to parents. We must ensure that they are happy and that they understand the schemes. They have concerns not only about the impact on their schools but about the impact of charging on some of the less affluent families in our communities.
</p>

<a name="50307-45_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>Another group will also be affected. Around two-thirds of the existing school transport budget is spent on children with special educational needs. That is a very visible part of the budget, and some local education authorities might feel that costs could be squeezed out of it through introducing these schemes. We must ensure that schools with pupils who receive free transport because of their special educational needs are part of the consultation process. The people who draw up the scheme should fully understand the impact on children who attend such schools and think carefully about the distance that they travel.
</p>

<a name="50307-45_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>Bus operators, too, will be affected by the Bill, particularly in areas where they currently operate schemes that a local authority might seek to take over&#151;through yellow buses, similar schemes or their own plans to provide transport for children. As many bus operators already provide transport to our schools, we must ensure that they play a part in any consultation processes.
</p>

<a name="50307-45_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>The two new paragraphs proposed in Amendment No. 2 arise from my concern to ensure that scheme authorities carry out a proper consultation process and that time is taken over it. We suggest a period of 28 days in which people may comment. It is also important that, when a scheme comes forward to the Secretary of State for his approval, scheme authorities should have identified to him the local concerns. Before he approves the scheme, he should know what those concerns are and, more particularly, how the scheme authority has responded to them. Clearly a scheme that attracts from the local community widespread opposition which has not been fully responded to by the scheme authority is unlikely to be effective in achieving the Government&#039;s objectives.
</p>

<a name="50307-45_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>I believe that the amendments are simple and sensible and I hope that the Minister will be able to respond to them. They are about trying to ensure that the consultation process underpinning the scheme is thorough and full and that it will deliver the agreement of all the stakeholders interested in school transport. I beg to move.

<a name="50307-46_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   I am happy for them to be grouped.
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="50307-46_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rix: </b>   In that case, I shall speak to Amendment No. 29. Members of the Committee will be aware that children with special educational needs and disabilities are among the main users of home to school transport services provided by local authorities, with 65 per cent of spending on school transport budgets. Therefore, this Bill is of particular concern to families of disabled children.
</p>

<a name="50307-46_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>It is vital that proper consultation takes place before school travel schemes are introduced so that new arrangements can meet local needs effectively. I am grateful that the prospectus now makes it clear that scheme authorities need to ensure that they consult parents of disabled children. I recognise that it may be appropriate for the detail of the consultation process to be spelt out in the prospectus. However, putting the principle of consultation in the Bill would provide reassurance to families. It would also put beyond doubt that consultation is integral to the development of new school travel arrangements.

</p>

<a name="50307-46_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>Although there is good practice, I am well aware that not all local authorities communicate with parents as well as they might. Setting up consultation mechanisms at the outset is more likely to ensure that a new culture of consultation continues subsequently. Parents are extremely worried that they will not be consulted before changes are made to the current provision of school transport for their children. Changing a disabled child&#039;s travel arrangements may have consequences for their safety, academic performance, behaviour at school and indeed their very access to education. It is vital that in piloting new arrangements, scheme authorities involve families. A duty to consult would provide much-needed reassurance.
</p>

<a name="50307-46_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>On Amendment No. 33, I am seeking to safeguard the progress that has been made to safeguard and clarify the prospectus. I am concerned that provision for disabled children may be eroded in future, as there will doubtless be ongoing pressure on the Government to make revisions from a range of stakeholders. I welcome the fact that many of the concerns raised about the Bill in relation to disabled children have been addressed through the prospectus. In tabling the amendment, I am looking for assurance that when the   Bill has been passed, any proposals to change the prospectus will be subject to full consultation in line with Cabinet Office regulations.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="50307-46_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   My name and that of my noble friend Lady Walmsley are attached to Amendment No. 36, which covers largely the same ground as the other amendments, except that we tabled it to apply after Clause 1 and, because the schedule intervenes between <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC189"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column GC189</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Clauses 1 and 2, it comes up somewhat later in the Bill. However, it is appropriate to speak to it with the other amendments, and it has been grouped with them, because it is all about consultation.
</p>

<a name="50307-46_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>The list for consultation is contained already in the draft prospectus, where many of those listed in Amendments Nos. 2 and 36 are already listed. However, there are two significant additions. In Amendment No.   36, we ask that local councillors&#151;district councillors, minor authority councillors and principal authority councillors&#151;be included within the consultation. That is extremely important. I know that my husband, who is a county councillor, has been involved with the development of a transport scheme in Surrey and that he has played a seminal part in it, because he knows precisely where the schools are and what the transport problems are. Often, local councillors know that much better than do council officials&#151;who in the case of Surrey are located in Kingston rather than in Guildford, where there has been some discussion of it operating.
</p>

<a name="50307-46_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>The other addition that we make in our amendment comes in the form of the children themselves. Once again, it important to remember the voice of the child. Too frequently, we consult parents and assume that they are proxy for children. But, particularly when considering secondary school children but also with primary school children, the children themselves are very sensible when they are consulted. We believe it to be extremely important that children should be consulted.
</p>

<a name="50307-46_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>We also have our names down to the two amendments proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Rix. My noble friend Lady Walmsley will be speaking later in the debate. We feel that it is extremely important that parents with children of special educational needs who currently receive transport help should be consulted in any proposed changes. Clearly, they are one of the categories that perhaps make most use of transport facilities. They need to know what is being proposed and their voices should be heard. We totally endorse what the noble Lord, Lord Rix, said.
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="50307-46_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   Amendment No. 8, in my name, is on a similar subject, which I shall speak to later. As the noble Lord, Lord Rix, mentioned the prospectus and, in particular, the section on children with special educational needs, can my noble friend help me with paragraph 32 of <i>School Travel Schemes&#151;Prospectus</i>, which is very unclear. I am probably being thick, but I would be grateful if my noble friend could help. Paragraph 32 states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;We will only approve schemes that protect pupils with SEN and/or disabilities from any charges additional to those that apply to children of the same age living in the same area who attend their neighbourhood school, if special arrangements have to be made to accommodate a child&#039;s disability or SEN&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-46_para6"></a>

consultation process right is the heart to making a good scheme. It does not mean that you get to a position where everyone agrees, but it is crucial that, before making decisions, there has been a very full engagement of all potential stakeholders, interest groups and those with views, whether they are directly affected or have interest in the issues. Of course, we will be using our powers&#151;if I can put it that way&#151;to ensure that only schemes that have had proper consultation will be approved by the department.
</p>

<a name="50307-46_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>Amendments Nos. 2 and 36 list a range of individuals, bodies or groups of people that the local authority would need to consult formally before submitting its application to the relevant national body. Such a list would also result from the regulations envisaged by Amendment No. 6, which would give the Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales powers to make regulations specifying the consultation process that local authorities must undertake before making an application.
</p>

<a name="50307-46_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>The lists of consultees are essentially the same as that provided for in paragraph 14 of the prospectus accompanying the Bill. We also agree that there are a number of key consultees who must be included in the consultation process in every authority. School travel schemes must engage all local stakeholders, not least pupils and their parents, particularly parents of pupils who currently have transport provided by the local authority, for obvious reasons.
</p>

<a name="50307-46_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>The stakeholders, which the noble Baroness lists in the amendment, are all significant and must have the opportunity to be involved in putting in place school travel scheme arrangements. We had envisaged dealing with consultation in a different way. Rather than placing a requirement for consultation in the Bill, we had envisaged using the prospectus.
</p>

<a name="50307-46_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>The prospectus that accompanies the Bill includes paragraphs 14 to 16 on local consultation and provides an almost identical list of organisations to be consulted before scheme proposals are submitted. The list has been developed following public consultation and scrutiny in another place. I hope that the list of consultees is now fully comprehensive, but we remain receptive to further suggestions.

</p>

<a name="50307-46_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>The list includes school governors, including governors of special schools where pupils in the authority are placed; teacher association representatives at local level; parents and prospective parents; the schools forum,   which is intended to capture the voice of pupils;   the admissions forum; bodies representing any denominations with schools in the area; transport operators; FE institutions; groups representing parents with children with SEN and/or disability; organisations with an interest in pupils safety; and any other partners with a material interest in school travel schemes, such as Transport for London and the passenger transport executives.
</p>

<a name="50307-46_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>Furthermore, the prospectus spells out the minimum length of consultations, which should take place during term time&#151;echoing our Education Bill debates&#151;to ensure the maximum potential input from interested parties.

<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>The National Assembly will be responsible for issuing a prospectus in Wales. We will also emphasise the importance of LEAs conducting wide consultation. The prospectus has been placed on a statutory footing and is binding on scheme authorities. We will not approve pilots that have not had adequate consultation.
</p>

<a name="50307-46_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>The second element of the new clause in Amendment No. 36 would make travel schemes part of local education development plan reviews. I remind the Committee that Sections 6 and 7 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, requiring authorities to prepare education development plans, were repealed by the Children Act 2004. In their place, we have the children and young people&#039;s plans, which will be a higher level and more strategic plan.
</p>

<a name="50307-46_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>The prospectus also requires local authorities to produce annual reports for the appropriate national authority, which will be published, analysing the effect that schemes have had and an account of what has gone well and badly, the views of key partners and financial annexes detailing the economies of the schemes. I had hoped that the prospectus, which is on a statutory footing, would have allayed the concerns. Pilots will not occur without adequate consultation.
</p>

<a name="50307-46_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>In response to questions from the noble Lord, Lord   Hanningfield, we have made changes following our consultation, pre-legislative scrutiny and the passage of the Bill through another place and have arrived at a list that mirrors the amendment. We have had very productive discussion with the Special Educational Consortium to ensure that the voice of children with SEN and others is included. I have provided for 28 days in term-time, more than is requested in the amendment. Schools forums consist of children and therefore provide the opportunity for children&#039;s voices to be heard. I cannot believe that if any child wrote to the authority, the authority would not take them into consideration.
</p>

<a name="50307-46_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>It is councillors who will decide what schemes go forward, at least in respect of the submitting authorities. The noble Baroness may have had in mind two-tier areas with district councils. Let me put it cautiously but clearly. I am highly persuaded by that argument but let me give it a little more thought. It seems to be an injustice not also to consult district councils, because they have interests in that respect.

</p>

<a name="50307-46_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>Turning to the amendments of my noble friend Lord Rix, I again agree with the importance of the full consultation process, which must underpin applications. Also, key consultees must be included in the consultation process in every authority. School travel schemes must engage all local transport stakeholders.
</p>

<a name="50307-46_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>I have already mentioned the list. I shall mention just part of it: the importance of consulting parents of children with special educational needs and of that being done during term-time. Strictly speaking, we do not think that my noble friend&#039;s amendment is necessary. The Cabinet Office is responsible for guidance on public consultation. Cabinet Office guidance is that public consultation would be expected wherever material changes to statutory guidance were proposed by the Secretary of State for England. Similar requirements apply to the Assembly Government for Wales.

</p>

<a name="50307-46_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>Having said all that, although I am absolutely clear that including the details of consultation obligations in statute would not be sensible because, undoubtedly, as the process develops, guidance will need to change, we will think about the need for further guidance and may even think of extra people who should be part of the process. I have listened seriously to the Committee&#039;s argument that it wants written in the Bill the principle of consultation, which goes to the heart of making good schemes.
</p>

<a name="50307-46_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>Although I cannot now give a categoric commitment, the Committee will be able to read between my words and know that I will seriously consider whether I can say something more positive about that on Report. I hope that that wink and nudge is helpful to all who have spoken to the amendments.

<a name="50307-47_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   We had this sort of debate last week on special schools, where young people are often from many different authorities. Some authorities may be piloting the schemes and some may not, and so there could be confusion. Does the Minister envisage that all authorities that support the special school will be consulted in respect of the scheme? It could also happen with denominational schools on the border   between local authorities. You can get pupils from three or four local authorities going to one denominational school. Do the Government accept that there could be a variety of different charges and schemes for children attending one special school? I hope that the Minister will agree that all authorities sending children to a school should be consulted about it, as some might have violent objections to it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="50307-47_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   I agree, for reasons that we touched on in part last week. Local authorities clearly have a direct interest in the school and so they should be consulted as part of that process.

<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="50307-47_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   The Minister said that the pupils themselves would undoubtedly be consulted about some of the changes. However, at the moment paragraph 14 of the current prospectus&#151;the one that is on the web&#151;containing the appropriate list, does not include consultation with pupils. It is appropriate that pupils be consulted, so it would be good to see them there.
</p>

<a name="50307-47_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>Similarly, the Minister mentioned councillors from minor authorities. I put in a plea that, although the authority itself is bringing in the measures, it is important that, in these days of executive Cabinets and so on, it makes a bit of an effort to ensure that the councillors who cover the local area are included in the consultation. There is a tendency for Cabinets to work with the offices and railroad things through rather than always to carry out appropriate consultation.
</p>

<a name="50307-47_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>We are grateful to the Minister for indicating that the principle of consultation may well be included in the Bill. We recognise how all Ministers dislike long lists in Bills. In so far as the prospectus and the regulations are the statutory guidance, it would be good if they mentioned the broad consultation with councillors covering the area.
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="50307-47_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   I am shocked to hear what Cabinets are up to; I find that very surprising. I take the noble Baroness&#039;s point. We must ensure that Back-Benchers have an opportunity to comment as well, and we shall look at that. With regard to pupils, I hoped that I signalled clearly and positively that the schools forum would be the prime focus for consultation. I went slightly further by signalling that I would expect a responsible authority to listen to any pupil who wished, in addition and of his own volition, to write and give his views on whether he thought something was a good or a bad idea.
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="50307-47_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   I do not believe that pupils have any formal role in schools forums. Basically teachers and governors have a role in them.

<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="50307-47_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   We have had an interesting exchange of views. I was pleased to hear the Minister say that basically he accepts that there should be something in the Bill about consultation. We shall wait to hear what comes of that.

</p>

<a name="50307-47_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>I am still concerned about situations where a special educational school or denominational school supplies education for an area wider than one local authority or where it covers the whole authority because it is a school with particular special needs. I was interested to hear the recent exchange on this matter but the schools forums have a long way to go. Obviously the Government have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC194"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column GC194</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

bigger ambitions for schools forums than is currently the case. Speaking from my own experience, I would still want professional associations to be consulted in order to obtain a representative view of teachers. The schools forum is fairly amateurish. It is well intended but, as yet, it is not fully representative of everyone in the education community. It might develop, but obviously the Government have big aspirations for it.

</p>

<a name="50307-47_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>I support what the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, said about involving local members. In these days of executive decisions and financial restraint, it is important to obtain the views of locally elected members on these issues, and I support that. However, the Minister said that he has taken all these points on board and we shall wait for him to come back to us. With that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p>(d)   arrangements to make a charge on those who use a motor vehicle within a specified distance from the school where paragraph (a) applies&quot;
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 3, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 14, which also stands in my name. Perhaps I should start by suggesting that the Bill may almost become the law of unintended consequences with regard to people driving their kids to school. There are some good things in the prospectus, even if I did not understand it all&#151;but I am not an educationalist; I have spent my life in transport. However, some of the objectives are good&#151;for example, to increase the modal share of walking and cycling, which has health and social benefits, and arrangements to provide cost-effective alternatives to the family car. I also support the fact that the prospectus states that schemes must aim to cut car use on the home-to-school journey.
</p>

<a name="50307-47_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>That is all very well, but when people discover that they will be charged for sending their children to school by bus whereas previously it was free, I think that there will be a terrible tendency for them to say, &quot;Oh well, I&#039;ll drive the children to school&quot;. I hope that that does not happen, but at present there are certainly plenty of parents driving children to schools in cars, causing fairly severe congestion outside schools and with some people displaying the most appallingly bad driving behaviour.
</p>

<a name="50307-47_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>Before I turn to the detail of the amendment, it may be worth reminding the Committee how many children are killed or seriously injured each year. PACTS, the Parliamentary Advisory Committee for Transport Safety, has provided me with figures which show that in 2002 more than 4,500 children aged 15 or   under were killed or seriously injured in road accidents. Of course, we have the highest proportion of such accidents in the whole of Europe. Therefore, I suggest that we should be a little careful that these good intentions&#151;or mostly good intentions&#151;in the Bill do not bring about the wrong consequences.
</p>

<a name="50307-47_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>My Amendment No. 3 would allow education authorities to include arrangements to charge those who use a motor vehicle within a specified distance. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC195"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column GC195</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

That might be difficult to envisage, and some people may have no alternative but to drive to school. It would not hurt if they dropped the children off half a mile away from school in some suitable place and made them walk. First, it would be safer and, secondly, it would give them some exercise. A specified distance needs to be included therefore. I believe that a way could be found&#151;if they charge people for going on the bus they could find a way of charging people for travelling by car.
</p>

<a name="50307-47_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>The other issue, which is the substance of Amendment No. 14, is that there are cars and there are cars. As regards the safety of cars, one sees that when people are driving their Chelsea tractors with little Johnny inside protected like a cocoon&#151;wonderful. But if one goes on to the European New Car Assessment programme website, you discover that, with the exception of a Volvo, all the large off-roaders have the lowest pedestrian rating test of all cars. There are about a dozen in that category. It is one star and the Suzuki has no stars at all. However, they score highly for the interiors.
</p>

<a name="50307-47_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>There is no reason why there should not be a variable charge dependent on the type of car used for taking children to school. That would send a message that is good for road safety and the message that if you have to drive your children to school, you either drop them off a certain distance from the school or you pay a charge that is commensurate with the equivalent bus charge which might be introduced by the Bill or a variable one depending on the safety of people outside the car. It does not matter about the inside because any collisions will be low-speed and the injury will be to pedestrians and accompanying people outside. The charge should also cover the emissions, which could be the case if the Government introduced the variable vehicle excise duty. They have the information and could make that charge already.
</p>

<a name="50307-47_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>I hope that this will never have to happen but&#151;should many more people drive their children to school as a result of the Bill, for all the disincentives contained in it&#151;it would be a useful provision for the LEAs to discourage people driving children so close to the school. I beg to move.

I give general support to the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley. However, in principle, we agree with congestion charging where there is a good reason for that. In practice, what the noble Lord is suggesting might turn out to be difficult.
</p>

<a name="50307-48_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>However, I hope that the local authorities which want to put these pilot schemes in place were listening to some of the points that the noble Lord made.

During the weekend, when I could not talk, I was reading the <i>Which?</i> report on the safety inside cars and the safety of pedestrians hit by cars.

organise walking trains. I would have thought that pub car parks, which are certainly not used at 8.30 in the morning or 3.30 in the afternoon, could be suitable starting and finishing points for such walking trains. Therefore, although I do not believe that we can support the noble Lord&#039;s amendments, I have a great deal of sympathy and I hope that people are listening to him.

<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="50307-48_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   I recall that my noble friend Lord   Berkeley raised this point on Second Reading. His intention is to impose a charge on parents who drive their children to school. I acknowledge, as he does, that there are many beneficial reasons for ensuring that fewer children are driven to school and that is one of the central aims of the Bill; we are one on that. But it is hard to accept that we will end up with no children needing to be driven to school by car, even with an enhanced bus service and the cycling and walking opportunities that school travel schemes will bring for some children.

</p>

<a name="50307-48_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>There are a number of measures that schools and local authorities can take. They can encourage car sharing, or actively encourage parents to park away from the school gate, with the children walking the last part of the   journey. Authorities such as Cambridgeshire are promoting &quot;kiss and ride&quot; schemes; I believe that that involves the parents kissing the children before they ride, rather than the pupils kissing each other when they are on the bus. In any event, that is its name. By that scheme, pupils can be dropped off and board a shuttle bus to their school. Many schools who have engaged with the Government&#039;s action plan on travelling to school are doing all those things through their active travel plans.
</p>

<a name="50307-48_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>The amendment itself is so widely drafted that it could suggest the imposition of a charge on anyone driving any motor vehicle within the distance specified. As my noble friend will know, and as the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, has just said, in England and Wales, local transport authorities already have powers under the Transport Act 2000 and similar legislation for London to introduce charging schemes to tackle congestion. In practice, in many urban places where schools are located closely together, a charging scheme under the proposed amendment would be indistinguishable from a charging scheme under the Transport Act.
</p>

<a name="50307-48_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>In other areas, a road user could be persistently confused about whether they were in or out of a charged area. There would be the potential for motorists to use rat-runs to avoid the coverage of any scheme. These are the real practical difficulties. There would need to be a great amount of thought given to the practical details of a scheme under the proposed amendment. Those practical details are a serious problem. How would the measure be enforced, and by whom? What would happen to any revenue collected? Would anyone be exempt? The amendment as drafted takes no account of those matters.
</p>

<a name="50307-48_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>Although I recognise the objective of the amendment, I feel that there are alternative and more suitable measures available to achieve it. Even if it <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC197"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column GC197</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

were possible to restrict the provision to parents driving their own children, I have grave doubts about such a provision. For one thing, it would mean that anyone else driving the child to school would probably not be subject to a charge being imposed. One could see the odd position emerging that the only person penalised would be the parent driving their own child to school. I am sure that that is not the intention of the proposal.
</p>

<a name="50307-48_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>If the charging scheme were to apply to all vehicles taking children to school, I assume that there would be a requirement to know the registered keeper of the vehicle, as identified from DVLA records, who would be liable for the charge. If the intention was to charge the parent, to distinguish between those two people would turn out to be an extremely expensive and complex scheme. As with current congestion charging, there would be a need to use cameras or barriers to find out who was making the transport movements. I do not believe that that would work.
</p>

<a name="50307-48_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>Amendment No. 14, taken with Amendment No. 3, would require that a charging scheme in the vicinity of a school would take into account the emissions of a vehicle and its implications for pedestrian and bicycle safety. The Government have introduced policies aimed both at improving the emissions of vehicles and reducing the danger they pose to pedestrians. These include measures for carbon-dioxide-based systems of vehicle excise duty and company car tax. The Secretary of State for Transport recently announced a new scheme for the energy-efficiency labelling of new cars to begin this summer. Similarly the Government have given incentives to the use of alternative fuels such as biofuels.
</p>

<a name="50307-48_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>As regards vehicles, these policies are facilitated by the registration and licensing system operated by the DVLA. Access to that system would be required by any authority which attempted to do what was requested in the amendments. Some authorities possibly now have an online link to the DVLA used in connection with their parking schemes and abandoned vehicle functions, but it does not give them access to emissions data, which would elaborate that process a great deal. I will not go into great detail, but the amendment does not specify the extent to which the emissions should count for any particular purpose.
</p>

<a name="50307-48_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>As regards the risk of injury to vulnerable road users, I agree substantially with a great deal of what has been said. There is a good deal of evidence from PACTS and others, although there is disagreement about some of it. It is argued that there are other types of evidence. When one watches off-road cars moving through the herds of cattle in Kensington one sometimes wonders what the purpose of them is. None the less, I understand the point made about bull bars and so on.

</p>

<a name="50307-48_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>Research shows that the risk of an accident involving a child is reduced by two-thirds in all categories when a 20-miles-an-hour zone has been introduced. That is an obvious and important limit. We believe that it is an <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="50307-48_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   Perhaps I may put two issues to the noble Lord, Lord Triesman. Better ways to school and   the introduction of 20-mile-an-hour limits are expensive to introduce. Many schools in the local authority area that I represent want to introduce better rules on ways to school, but they are in a queue because little money is available to construct cycle-ways and make other necessary changes. That is the first issue that the Minister must address. It is all very well saying that local authorities have the powers but they do not have the means. Having one without the other is nonsense.
</p>

<a name="50307-48_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>The second issue is that most of the congestion referred to arises close to the school. I can think of two cases in my division where congestion around the school is so bad that regular bus services had to be suspended because they could not get through. The local authority has introduced &quot;no waiting&quot; areas around the school which need enforcement. However, resources for that are limited. They are enforced one day, but the next day everyone comes back again.
</p>

<a name="50307-48_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>Therefore, in considering rules relating to better ways to school, will the Minister examine, first, the available funding so that schools can get into a queue and get their schemes working? Schools can contribute a great deal to the scheme in both thought and money. Secondly, should they not be allowed to look at one or two potential drop-off points which would be safe places to walk from? I refer to places which will not require people to cross roads and are generally in sight of the school gate.
</p>

<a name="50307-48_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>The problems referred to by the noble Lord, Lord   Berkeley, generally occur outside the school gates. Cars from two or three directions come together, people drive in and out, reverse and gossip. We must understand that much of the congestion takes place during periods of gossip. While that takes place, accidents happen. In one case, the local bus service has had to be suspended at about 8.45 a.m., when most people want to use it, because the bus cannot get through due to congestion around the school. While the remedies that the noble Lord suggested may not commend themselves to the Minister, the problems are real and need addressing.

<a name="50307-49_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   I support what the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, said. But, for example, my local authority constituency has just put two enormous roundabouts at a new road junction. Therefore, although the distance is still well below the statutory distance, it is impossible for children to walk across those very busy roundabouts. Arguments are going on about it, but no one has been able to afford to put in proper crossings. So, from a local authority point of view, if there was more investment in minor works, <br>&nbsp;<br>

there would not be so much need for this legislation because youngsters would be able get to school on the right type of routes.

<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>If the Government are to charge parents for driving their children to school, the quicker they bring it in before 5 May, the better. Perhaps the Minister will comment on that. We could do with more investment in minor works to enable youngsters to walk or to cycle to school.

<a name="50307-49_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   I agree with my noble friend Lord Bradshaw. The Minister referred to the herds of cows in Kensington and I agree with his sentiments in that respect. However, I hope that he will remember that in the remoter parts of Scotland and Wales, in particular, there are children who cannot get to school unless they are being driven in a 4x4, especially in winter when the snow is deep. If there is any question of charging people for using such vehicles in those areas, it would cause complete uproar and would be quite unjust.

</p>

<a name="50307-49_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>As regards congestion charging, does the Minister know whether there is any intention to introduce differential charging for vehicles in relation to their size in London? Are there any proposals to introduce any additional congestion schemes, other than the one we know about in Edinburgh&#151;for example, Cambridge?
</p>




<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="50307-49_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   All the questions illustrate precisely why this legislation is before Members of Committee. The intention is to encourage local authorities to deal with problems in the ways that they best judge are required. I was interested and intrigued, because it illustrates the point so well, to hear about the problems where two roundabouts have been built and the specific problems of a different kind in a different area. All those things are problems that require&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_41"></a>
<a name="50307-49_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   I am sorry to interrupt the Minister, but it is an irony, to some extent, that we have been discussing the charging of parents driving their children to school, whereas the Bill is about charging children in buses going to school. It might be appropriate to charge parents and to ring-fence those revenues to lay on school buses to take children to school.
</p>




<p><a name="st_42"></a>
<a name="50307-49_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   I remind the noble Baroness that nothing in my amendment refers to parents.
</p>




<p><a name="st_43"></a>
<a name="50307-49_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   I think that I shall persist in dealing with this Bill rather than one that made a completely different proposal. The Bill makes it possible for specific things to be done by local authorities to resolve the issues that they regard as central to getting children to school safely, without too much congestion and so on.
</p>

<a name="50307-49_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>I have argued that it is not appropriate to treat 4x4s differently in any respect, but it would be wholly inappropriate to treat them as though they were exactly the same if deployed as mobile weaponry in Kensington or used in some rather more remote place. We have no plans to do that. We have no plans to introduce charging before any date in May. It would <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC200"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column GC200</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

be inappropriate for us to have plans because it must be for local authorities to have those plans. They do that in the light of what they regard as best for management.
</p>

<a name="50307-49_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>The question of funding is important. The Department for Transport is providing &#163;659 million to local authorities in 2004&#150;05 for small-scale capital projects, including safe routes to school. Nearly 4,000 schools were expected to have at least one safe route by March last year. So a significant sum has gone into that. The 20 miles per hour zones are funded through local transport plans and associated funding.
</p>

<a name="50307-49_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>I hope that that addressed the first of the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, but I should say that it also potentially dealt with some of the points raised in his second question, although I am strongly tempted to say that local authorities which police parking effectively do not generally end up out of pocket. The revenues that are raised by the effective policing of places that should not be parked in&#151;whether people do that for a few minutes to gossip or whether they stay or whatever&#151;generally cover the costs more than effectively. If there were issues of that kind, it would be good to see the law enforced.

<a name="50307-49_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   I am grateful to noble Lords. We have had a good debate, have we not? I thank all noble Lords who have taken part. This is a group of probing amendments which are carrots and sticks. I am not sure that the carrot can yet be reached over the fence in all cases, but we have heard some good ideas.
</p>

<a name="50307-49_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>One matter that we have not discussed, because it is not part of the Bill, is what should be done about private schools, which are some of the worst offenders. That area clearly needs more enforcement and, although local authorities may cover their costs, if they do not spend any money in enforcement, they are not losing any. Therefore, I am not sure that that situation altogether solves the problem.
</p>

<a name="50307-49_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>My noble friend mentioned some other government policies, such as VED labelling in new cars, which is a great idea that I have always supported. He will be aware that it was reported in the press last week that the car manufacturers are trying to make the accident tests less stringent and those who are concerned about road accidents would oppose that. But the new car assessment programme that I mentioned originally is supported by the Department for Transport and many other member states. It is an official organisation, so to speak.
</p>

<a name="50307-49_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>I shall not press this matter any further. I should tell my noble friend that when our party is still in government in three or four years&#039; time and the Bill, I hope, has become law and a few trials are taking place, it would be interesting to revisit whether more cars are being used on the school run by parents, or whoever, taking children to school.

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-49_para9"></a>
<p>(d)   arrangements for the safety of the transport under the scheme,&quot;
</p>




<p><a name="st_46"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment would place on the relevant authority a duty to ensure that arrangements were in place for the safety of transport under the scheme in question.
</p>

<a name="50307-49_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>Evidence from the Transport Select Committee and the Education and Lifelong Learning Committee of the Welsh Assembly clearly shows that school buses   are often among the oldest vehicles on the road and that their cosmetic appearance does little to inspire the confidence of parents. Conversely, yellow bus schemes have proved more popular with parents who are, on occasion, willing to pay a small charge for the use of new, clean and reliable vehicles.

</p>

<a name="50307-49_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>We on these Benches agree with the recommendations of the Transport Select Committee that safety should form a prominent part of the Government&#039;s school transport initiatives. Indeed, the committee was slightly surprised that the Government admitted that they did not know the effects of the local government best value regime on the quality of school buses.
</p>

<a name="50307-49_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>Evidence to the committee showed that many authorities interpreted &quot;best value&quot; as &quot;lowest cost&quot; and that the safety of school transport schemes was suffering as a result. Therefore, does the Minister believe, like the committee, that there should be a national minimum standard for local authority school bus contracts? If he does not, how can his Government guarantee and ensure the quality and safety of such schemes? I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_47"></a>
<a name="50307-49_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   Again, I support the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield. In letting school contracts, local authorities always go for the lowest cost tender. In Oxfordshire, we have found that when the police undertake road tests of passenger-carrying vehicles, invariably it is school transport vehicles that are prohibited because they fail to meet the standards. I can conclude from that only that standards are very low.
</p>

<a name="50307-49_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>It is an area where a great deal of sharp practice takes place. Many operators have a set of tyres which they put on a vehicle when it goes in for a test, and they immediately remove them and replace them with a substandard set when the vehicle goes on the road. That is the kind of thing that happens. I know that in one case those at the vehicle-testing station marked the tyres so that they knew that they were the test tyres rather than the tyres that were usually used on the vehicle.
</p>

<a name="50307-49_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>Also, many drivers of such vehicles are treading very finely around the law because they are not full-time drivers. They have other jobs. They are part-time people who come off a night shift, and so on, and take children to school in the morning. The whole issue of the suitability of vehicles and drivers&#151;I am not talking about whether a person is a potential sex offender but whether his working life is such that it would allow him within a reasonable working day to drive a school <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC202"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column GC202</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

bus&#151;needs careful examination. I recommend that the Minister turns his attention to that&#151;perhaps not within the confines of the Bill but that he draws the attention of officials to some of the malpractice that takes place in this area and puts the safety of children at risk.

<p><a name="st_48"></a>
<a name="50307-50_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   The amendment seeks to provide that school travel schemes may include arrangements to ensure the safety of transport under the scheme, adding to the general categories of arrangements that could be covered by a school travel scheme, listed under paragraph 2(2). As that paragraph stands, there are:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&quot;arrangements for the provision of transport . . .  arrangements for the payment of the whole or any part of  . . . reasonable travelling expenses&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-50_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>and,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;arrangements to facilitate or promote . . .  different ways of travelling&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-50_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>I agree with both noble Lords who have spoken that the arrangements for the safety of transport are an extremely important issue. There can be no doubt about that. However, the amendment is unnecessary because safety is already a requirement. Paragraph 1 of the schedule refers to arrangements which the scheme authority considers it appropriate to make. The arrangements could not be appropriate if they were not safe and it could not be appropriate for someone to endorse them if they were not safe.
</p>

<a name="50307-50_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>Safety has a prominent role in the objectives that were outlined in the prospectus. The guidance states that &quot;best value&quot; is not only the cheapest but that safety issues&#151;for example, spot checks by VOSA, which does not rely on annual checks to enforce safety&#151;highlight best practice. There are certainly authorities that make vigorous checks to ensure that day-to-day safety is enhanced. Cheshire is one of those.
</p>

<a name="50307-50_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>It is open to all local authorities not to accept the lowest tender. In several areas where yellow buses have been introduced, local authorities have introduced enhanced provisions. They pay rather more for the quality of the vehicles and fund parents who are willing to pay for better standards. Hebden Bridge is an example of an authority that has taken that route.
</p>

<a name="50307-50_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>The Government&#039;s response to the Transport Select Committee&#039;s report on school transport makes those general points in a straightforward way. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&quot;It is illegal for anyone to use a vehicle on the road if it does not meet at least the minimum roadworthiness standards provided in legislation&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-50_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>I have tried to say a little about what those would be in this case. A number of control mechanisms are built into the system. Apart from annual roadworthiness, there is in-year inspection by the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency, and any licensed operator not complying with the terms of the licence, which include properly maintaining vehicles, risks losing his licence.
</p>

<a name="50307-50_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>It is genuinely disturbing to hear that there may be scandals, such as people changing the tyres. Although I stand to be corrected, I think that that would be a criminal act. I cannot believe that it would be lawful to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC203"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column GC203</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

have a vehicle tested with tyres that met legal requirements and then replace them with tyres that did   not. In those circumstances, I think that criminal prosecution would be just and merited.
</p>

<a name="50307-50_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>Of course, no one pretends that absolute safety exists in any transport system, but safer arrangements can be achieved by various means. For example, with dedicated buses contracted for LEA use, LEAs and transport operators consider whether escorts are necessary, and I am aware of some cases in which schools and LEAs work together to use support staff as bus escorts. Other safety enhancements can be achieved by providing safe parking bays at schools, by making rules for the driver about when to drive off and, of course, by teaching children how to behave in and around the bus.
</p>

<a name="50307-50_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>In practice, the prospectus deals with many of those matters concerning the Bill. Although I am sure that the Committee will not expect us to reproduce the road safety legislation in the Bill, we must of course insist that it is fully met. If there are scandals in Oxfordshire or anywhere else&#151;I was not familiar with that example until the noble Lord spoke&#151;they must be drawn to the attention of officials, and I will certainly do so.
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="50307-50_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   I want to ask the Minister about what he said about enforcing parking regulations outside schools. Also, we are all obviously concerned about safety in schools. I entirely agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, and the Minister said, but this all costs money. We have 600 schools in Essex and there is no way that we can enforce parking outside them all. Most of them are rural schools in villages that have not seen a policeman, let alone anyone else, for five years.
</p>

<a name="50307-50_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>If we are to do that through the local authority system, it will require quite a lot of investment. Is that investment expected to come from charging? Everything that has been said today will cost local authorities money that they do not have. It is all new money. Where does the Minister imagine that that money will come from? Will it come from the pilot schemes? If it does, there will be no income from them because it will all be spent on enforcement of safety or parking and all kinds of other issues.
</p>

<a name="50307-50_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>The Minister spoke about the amount of money being invested in safe school transport schemes. It is peanuts. We need almost billions of pounds of investment to get proper schemes for children to walk or cycle to school. Will the Government comment on where the real money will come from for the investment about which the Minister talked?

enforcing far more restrictive speeding areas. It is also true that enforcement could in part be funded from revenue derived from scheme proposals. None of the schemes under the Bill is intended to save money. I have no doubt that we shall return to that point. I   understand that community police in Shropshire are engaged in enforcement in the countryside because it is felt that that is a useful way to deal with an issue that they have chosen to prioritise.
</p>

<a name="50307-50_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>I return to the central point: local education authorities want to pilot those schemes. Knowing the costs and some of the consequences, they still want to pilot those schemes, because they believe that, overall, they will be of benefit.

</p>

<a name="50307-50_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>I conclude by making a point that I hope has not been lost, because I think that we agree about it. In my view, whether it is a school bus that goes through a test with one set of tyres before worse, defective tyres are put on, or whether it is a lorry or a car, that is a criminal act that should be policed. We cannot have vehicles that pass tests on one set of criteria careering around in a defective state. Those are all issues of the cost of policing in the case of any kind of vehicle, although I fully accept that we want to prioritise children&#039;s safety.
</p>




<p><a name="st_55"></a>
<a name="50307-50_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   I thank the Minister for that reply. I think that we all agree about safety: that it should be more policed or enforced and that buses should have legitimate tyres. I do not want to talk about Essex County Council again, but we now spend &#163;30 million a year on school transport. We have very little opportunity to police what we do. We now have 60 community policeman dotted around the county. They would not have a chance to enforce parking outside schools. They are all far too busy doing their various jobs. If we are to try to do some of those things, with much more enforcement and protection of the whole system, we need new people. The current system does not have the capacity to do that.

<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>We all agree that safety is paramount. I hope that the Government will reflect on how we can make certain that that is reflected in the Bill, so that people are not always looking for cheap options.

<p><a name="st_57"></a>The noble Lord said: In a way, this amendment is similar. Again, it is a probing amendment tabled so that we can hear the Government&#039;s comment about it. We are concerned about the possible&#151;abuse is not the right word&#151;support to vulnerable groups of children as they travel to and from school. There have been cases in which disabled children have had problems of physical and other abuse during their transport to school. Often they are taken to school in taxis and that will continue to be the case when just one or two of them are going to a school. Those youngsters are often unable to communicate their experience to parents, teachers or carers, which means that problems may continue. There should be more&#151;policing is not the right word&#151;supervision. Those drivers and escorts have regular and unsupervised access to that specially vulnerable group of children. Although there are Criminal Records Bureau checks, they are not always enforceable as we would like, especially in the case of taxi drivers.
</p>

<a name="50307-51_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>Moving to the second part of the amendment, appropriate disability awareness training for employees or volunteers who drive or escort pupils with special educational needs or disability would help to overcome some of the difficulties currently encountered. It is essential that escorts and drivers understand the particular disabilities of the children for whom they are responsible. A lack of awareness of disability among drivers and escorts can lead to the child&#039;s safety being put at risk. For example, children with autism often display challenging behaviour when they are frightened. It would therefore be good for their drivers and escorts to have some experience and training to help to support them.

There is DfES and Welsh Assembly guidance on preventing unsuitable people from working with children. It is clear that applicants for positions that are excepted from the provision of the Rehabilitations of Offenders Act 1974 should be asked to declare any convictions, cautions or bind-overs which they have incurred, including any that would be regarded as &quot;spent&quot; under that Act in other circumstances.

</p>

<a name="50307-51_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>In plain English, &quot;spent&quot; convictions are not spent for the purposes of people in particular positions where there is particular vulnerability. That includes any position in which the normal duties include caring for, training, supervising or being in sole charge of children under the age of 18 and would include taxi drivers or escorts in that position. In addition, taxi or private hire car drivers are already subject to enhanced criminal record checks when they apply for a licence and each time they renew it, in most parts of the country. That will also be the case in London by April   2006, which is before any scheme would be approved and in operation under this Bill.

</p>

<a name="50307-51_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>The guidance requires more than just CRB checks to be carried out before staff are recruited to work with children. In addition to the CRB process, the guidance says that potential employers should check an applicant&#039;s qualifications, references, including professional and character references, direct from the referee and including their most recent employer; and previous employment, including satisfactory explanations for employment gaps.
</p>

<a name="50307-51_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>The second part of the amendment relates to the provision of disability equality training. That issue was debated in the other place and as a result we have amended the prospectus to state that it is good practice for those responsible for planning and managing school transport to have disability equality training. We have also set out what we think the training should   include. The Special Educational Consortium provided the wording and believes that it is an excellent and effective addition.
</p>

<a name="50307-51_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>There is a wide variety of different issues which escorts and drivers of children with disabilities need to have an understanding of, which can vary markedly from case to case. This can range from receiving training on the use of specialised equipment or administering medication, through to the wider issues addressed by disability equality training, which explores the concept of people being disabled by society&#039;s barriers and attitudes, highlighting the role of the organisations in the removal of those barriers and in the changing of attitudes.
</p>

<a name="50307-51_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>I hope that with those clear assurances we will make these matters clear in the prospectus and remind authorities of their obligations that the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment.

<a name="50307-51_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   I thank the Minister for that answer. In tabling our amendment, we were not quite so worried by the criminal side. We hope that there are now sufficient checks in place to double-check that. We were more concerned with the training side with regard to helping taxi drivers and even some bus drivers. They may need training to help the children that require the service. The Minister mentioned that the Government were going to strengthen the training in the prospectus. That is what is required: better training for people who act as drivers or escorts for these youngsters. I shall read his answer in <i>Hansard.</i> I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="50307-51_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Rix: </b>   Amendment No. 7 is concerned with pupils with special educational needs and disabled pupils within walking distance of their school. I shall continue from where I left off, on the second page of my notes.

</p>

<a name="50307-51_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>Many children with disabilities will go to a school within the statutory walking distance but will require additional assistance to get to school safely. Although there has not been a separate duty for LEAs to make special transport arrangements for disabled children in those circumstances, LEAs currently have to provide transport where it is &quot;necessary&quot; to facilitate attendance under Section 509 of the Education Act 1996.
</p>

<a name="50307-51_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>Local authorities running school-travel schemes do not have any duties under Section 509, and instead their responsibilities are set out in the Bill. However, neither the Bill nor the prospectus clarifies the authority&#039;s responsibility to support disabled children who live within the walking distance of their school. In light of that omission, the Special Educational Consortium and I are concerned that such disabled children will have reduced entitlement to the support that they may need to travel to their school, should they live within two or three miles of it.

</p>

<a name="50307-51_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>The matter needs to be cleared up. The amendment seeks not to extend provision for disabled children, but simply to ensure that current entitlements are not undermined. We need to provide clarity for all stakeholders and much-needed reassurance for families. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="50307-51_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   My name and that of my noble friend Lady Sharp are attached to the amendment, which we support. It is clear that the current arrangements that local authorities have in relation to children with SEN and disabilities are removed and repealed by the Bill. There is a general understanding that the application of the two or three-mile limit is generally inappropriate where a disabled child is unable to walk the distance independently.

</p>

<a name="50307-51_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>I draw the Committee&#039;s attention to the fact that the Joint Committee on Human Rights questioned whether the continued reliance on walking distance as the trigger to the duty to provide school transport, without making any provision in relation to children with mobility difficulties who may not be able to walk the statutory distance in a reasonable time or at all, was in breach of Article 14 in conjunction with protocol 1 of Article 2. Protocol 1 provides the right to education, while Article   14 requires that the enjoyment of convention rights must be secured without discrimination. The new arrangements could discriminate against such children without objective and reasonable justification.

</p>

<a name="50307-51_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>The prospectus notes that concern in relation to ECHR and it states,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>&quot;we are clear that a child with mobility or other difficulties who is unable to walk 2 or 3 miles would have to be provided with transport or other assistance&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-51_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>However, as the noble Lord, Lord Rix, said forcefully, the Bill does not make that requirement.
</p>

<a name="50307-51_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>I understand that the DfES considers provision within the walking distance to be safeguarded by the Disability Discrimination Act and the ECHR. But that would have to be tested in court, so a family would have to go to judicial review. From my current experience, going to judicial review is very difficult. The fact is that the prospectus may change and develop in due course. So provision for disabled children must be laid out in the Bill. The entitlement must be very clear so as to reduce the likelihood of a series of disputes occurring. Where provision is withheld, there needs to be a straightforward route to recourse for parents, as in the Gateshead cases that I quoted in my Second Reading speech.
</p>

<a name="50307-51_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>It is not reasonable to expect parents to police LEA policies or to ensure compatibility with ECHR and the Disability Discrimination Act. Parents of disabled children face challenges enough that other families do not have to cope with. It is unfair to expect them to have the capacity to monitor and to take part in all future consultations on the prospectus.
</p>

<a name="50307-51_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>Before closing, I should like to add my confusion to that expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, about the meaning of some of the wording in the prospectus. Paragraph 32 states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>&quot;We will only approve schemes that protect pupils with SEN and/or disabilities from any charges additional to those that apply to children of the same age living in the same area who attend their neighbourhood school, if special arrangements have to be made to accommodate a child&#039;s disability or SEN&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-51_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>I am not sure what that means. Can the Minister clarify it? It seems to mean: if all children are to be charged, so will children with special needs. But, of course, in order to avoid such charges, able-bodied children can avoid going on the bus for which they might have to pay by walking, whereas disabled children cannot do that.
</p>

<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="50307-52_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   First, perhaps I may refer to what paragraph 32 of the prospectus means. My noble friend Lord Berkeley was patient and I should deal with it without further delay. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, quoted paragraph 32, which states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>&quot;We will only approve schemes that protect pupils with SEN and/or disabilities from any charges additional to those that apply to children of the same age&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-52_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>in the neighbourhood. That means that no pupils with SEN will be charged more than other children in the neighbourhood who attend the nearest suitable school; that is, no extra charges if they travel further to a special school, or no extra charges if other children walk a short distance to school that a pupil in a wheelchair cannot.
</p>

<a name="50307-52_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>As regards the specifics of the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Rix, and others, paragraph 2 of the schedule in the Bill requires local authorities to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC209"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column GC209</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

make &quot;appropriate&quot; travel arrangements. What is appropriate will depend on the circumstances in each child&#039;s case. When seeking applications to run the new innovative schemes, we will require LEAs to include in their applications a description of how their proposals cater for pupils with statements of SEN and/or pupils with disabilities.

</p>

<a name="50307-52_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>We are clear that &quot;statutory walking distance&quot; is not a relevant criterion where a child physically cannot walk or cannot be expected to walk due to his special needs. If a child cannot walk for those reasons, it would be unreasonable for the local authority to say that it was not appropriate to make travel arrangements for him.
</p>

<a name="50307-52_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>To clarify that, we have made changes to the draft prospectus to the effect that in deciding what is appropriate, the scheme authority should consider the needs of the child, the nature of the route, and so on, and should not take into account parental means.
<a name="time_5"></a>

</p>

<a name="50307-52_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>Paragraph 38 of the prospectus states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;Our other area of concern is for pupils with mobility difficulties, and those with SEN, where the minimum obligation to provide transport is not sufficient to meet their needs. Paragraph 2 of the schedule to the Bill requires LEAs to make appropriate travel arrangements for children, and we are clear that a child with mobility or other difficulties who is unable to walk 2 or 3 miles would have to be provided with transport or other assistance. In deciding what transport arrangements are appropriate, the scheme authority should look at the needs of the child, the nature of the route to school and the suitability of existing transport options. Parental means should not play a part in the decision as to whether transport arrangements are suitable&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-52_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>This up-dated version of the prospectus has been shared with members of the Special Educational Consortium. I pay tribute to the thoughtful way in which the consortium and the noble Lord, Lord Rix, has addressed these issues. It is sensible and realistic. We believe that in principle they are both content with the provisions, but it is important that they are put into the record in <i>Hansard </i>as part of the debate on the amendment.
</p>

<a name="50307-52_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>Other legislation offers protection. Article 14 of the EDHR outlaws discrimination &quot;on any ground&quot;, which would include disability, in the exercise of convention rights. Article 14 in conjunction with Article 2 means that scheme authorities may not discriminate on grounds of disability in providing school transport, unless that discrimination can be objectively and reasonably justified.

</p>

<a name="50307-52_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, referred to the   Joint Committee on Human Rights, questioning whether reliance of &quot;statutory walking distance&quot; was a breach of the non-discrimination provisions. Following our clarification based on paragraph 37 of the published prospectus, the JCHR&#039;s 17th report said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>&quot;We welcome the Government&#039;s response that, because the draft Bill requires local authorities to make appropriate travel arrangements for children, a child who has mobility difficulties and is unable to walk, or walk 2 or 3 miles, &#039;would have to be provided with transport or appropriate transport assistance&#039;.&quot;.</p>

</p>

<a name="50307-52_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>In addition, the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, as amended by the Special Needs and Disability Act   2001, also places a duty on local authorities not to discriminate against disabled pupils or prospective pupils in discharging their functions under the Education Acts. This would include their functions in providing school transport under Section 509 or our new Section 509ZAA of the 1996 Act. That is to say that a scheme authority could not, for a reason which relates to his disability, treat a disabled pupil less favourably than it treats, or would treat, others to whom that reason does not or would not apply, unless it can show that that treatment is justified.
</p>

<a name="50307-52_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>In summary, while we do not see any strong reasons to go further than the Bill, we would be happy to insert the above references to the DDA and to the ECHR into the prospectus as an up-front reminder to the LEAs of their responsibilities.

</p>

<a name="50307-52_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, referred to judicial review. I remind her that because of the power of the Government in terms of agreeing a scheme, we have a strong grip on an authority in that respect. That grip would apply subsequently because if it did something which we felt was in breach, after due inquiry we have the ability to impose sanctions as a consequence.
</p>

<a name="50307-52_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>I hope that that long and, at times, legal statement has been helpful. I hope that it sets at rest the minds of Members of the Committee. If not, we would be happy to have further discussions.

<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="50307-52_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   I would like clarification on one of the Minister&#039;s remarks. He said that if in the statutory walking distance an SEN child clearly needs transport, the child may be provided with that transport. However, he did not say whether the parents would have to pay for it or whether it would be free.
</p>




<p><a name="st_66"></a>
<a name="50307-52_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   No, what clearly was implied by what I said was that if the LEA has to provide transport, that is transport under those specific Acts. It does not imply a charge to the parents.
</p>




<p><a name="st_67"></a>
<a name="50307-52_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Rix: </b>   I am very grateful for that response&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_68"></a>
<a name="50307-52_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   If a comparator child were walking, it would be free. If a comparator child were paying, it would not be free.
</p>




<p><a name="st_69"></a>
<a name="50307-52_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Rix: </b>   Could the Minister explain that in a little more detail? I am sorry.
</p>




<p><a name="st_70"></a>
<a name="50307-52_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   I shall do my best, but there is probably a limit to how far one should go on expressing exactly how the law will apply in the situation. Essentially, the child who has a disability must not be treated any worse than a comparator child unless that can be specifically justified. Let us imagine a child who was disabled. If a comparator child were not to be charged, the disabled child should also not be charged. If a comparator child were charged, that could mean that the disabled child could be charged&#151;
</p>

</p>




<p><a name="st_72"></a>
<a name="50307-52_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   But it could be charged no more than the comparator child. I hope that the noble Baroness <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC211"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column GC211</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

will bear with me. That is a clarification, which I think is essentially what was sought. It is a guarantee of no &quot;worsenment&quot; or disadvantage.
</p>




<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="50307-52_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   Will the Minister take into account the point that I made? It was that, if a child lives within the walking-to-school distance and chooses to go on the bus, he or she may be charged and probably will be in future. I think that the Minister is saying that a child with disabilities in such a situation would also be charged&#151;no more, no less. Is that correct?
</p>




<p><a name="st_74"></a>
<a name="50307-52_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   Yes. Within the statutory walking distance of, say, three miles, if a child with SEN or disabilities&#151;they may not be physical disabilities&#151;is able to use the bus, their access to education is effectively not physically impeded. They are able to get to school. If a comparator child were charged a pound for using the bus&#151;for the sake of argument&#151;the disabled child could be charged a pound also. However, the reverse could not apply. The disabled child could not be charged when other children were not to be so charged.
</p>




<p><a name="st_75"></a>
<a name="50307-52_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Rix: </b>   That still does not make sense. If an able-bodied child chooses to use the bus, perhaps they have to pay charges. If a disabled child is unable to walk, surely the bus should be provided free to move that child from home to school.
</p>




<p><a name="st_76"></a>
<a name="50307-52_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   Yes.
</p>




<p><a name="st_77"></a>

</p>




<p><a name="st_78"></a>
<a name="50307-52_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   I would have hoped that a single word was a clear answer. If a child is not able to walk, they will not be charged as a consequence of the transport provided.
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo050307/text/50307-53.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_79"></a>
<a name="50307-53_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rix: </b>   Would that apply if a child had slight   behavioural problems and was seen as an embarrassment on the school bus by other parents? If they had, say, cerebral palsied movements that might cause upset to other parents and children, they would still be entitled to that free transport, I am sure.
</p>




<p><a name="st_80"></a>
<a name="50307-53_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   That is a fine distinction. The clear distinction that I sought to give was where it was apparent and obvious that the child could not walk to school. That was the point on which I was able to give such a strong answer. In the circumstances that the noble Lord described, the local authority would have to judge whether it was reasonable to expect the child to use that transport&#151;in other words, whether their various rights under the ECHR and so on would be fulfilled by expecting them to use that transport. If, in an extreme case, the local authority judged that the child&#039;s palsy and behaviour were so clearly acute that it was unreasonable to expect them to be able to travel with others, they would undoubtedly find under the various Acts that they had an obligation to provide transport.
</p>




<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="50307-53_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rix: </b>   Good. I thank the Minister very much for those responses. I also thank the noble Baroness, Lady   Walmsley, for a remarkable speech&#151;far better <br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>&quot;our 7 year battle will be wasted&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-53_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>That is a short case study.
</p>

<a name="50307-53_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>I am concerned about the changes that would occur under the Bill in respect of SEN children. The child to whom I referred probably has special transport for at least an hour and a half morning and evening with   escorts and so on. His local authority in Westminster&#151;he lives in Paddington&#151;has supported that and is paying for it. The school clearly fits the child, as do many other special schools; there is nothing unique about it. But will his parents have to pay for transport to the school in the future? Will local education authorities say, &quot;We&#039;re not going to source school places outside our area because the transport will cost too much&quot;? Even if LEAs continue with the group of children who are presently at special schools, what will happen in the future?
</p>

<a name="50307-53_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>At present, it is clear that if a child&#039;s parents, local authority or anyone else finds the right school to deal with a particular disability, the LEA will fund that, including the transport. I did not learn much from the discussions on the previous amendment&#151;that is probably me being thick again&#151;and I still do not understand whether under the new scenario of the Bill this child and those like him would continue to receive free transport and whether the education system generally would be prepared to act as responsibly and flexibly as it has done in this case by finding such children a suitable school a long way from home. I beg to move.

<a name="50307-53_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton: </b>   I want to speak to Amendments Nos. 21, 23 and 25, which are grouped with Amendment No. 8. Obviously we have touched on some of these issues already but, like the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, I, too, was not totally clear about the answer given by the Minister. Therefore, perhaps if I go over part of the issue again, I shall be able to look forward to a further explanation.
</p>

<a name="50307-53_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>We believe that as the Bill currently stands there are   serious flaws and deficiencies in the way that the legislation is drafted, in particular in relation to the protection of vulnerable children, those with special educational needs and their transportation to school. The general effect of our amendments would be to ensure that transport was provided for pupils with mobility problems or special educational needs that prevented them walking to school. They would either be protected from charges or protected from charges that were higher than those for their peer groups travelling to maintained schools.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC214"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column GC214</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50307-53_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>It is generally accepted that SEN provision is a large and growing part of the school transport budget. We also know that the situation varies considerably from place to place and that SEN covers a broad spectrum of circumstances. Pupils with statements of special educational needs may well have highly specialised transport needs. There may be an oxygen dependency or a requirement for measures to prevent pupils with brittle bone disease sustaining injuries. In those cases, the statement will usually set out the type of transport needed and the LEA will have to provide it free of charge.
</p>

<a name="50307-53_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>Those are the simple cases where there is no dispute. I doubt that parents will apply for statements purely to become entitled to free school transport. The process of statementing is based on educational need and applications are driven by a range of factors. It is unlikely that applications driven purely by the desire for free transport provision would get very far.

</p>

<a name="50307-53_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>Many parents of children with special educational needs have other financial pressures. Some grants for equipment are means-tested, and parents who do not meet that means test have to find significant sums from their own capital or income to buy specialist equipment. They also find that the respite care allocated from social services is insufficient for their needs and they have to pay for top-ups.
</p>

<a name="50307-53_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>Schemes will have to offer a complex range of transport facilities to suit the broad spectrum of need covered by the term &quot;SEN&quot;, and costs will necessarily increase as services get better at providing for pupils with   the highest level of need. We cannot help but believe that the Bill as it stands is not primarily concerned with the details of SEN transport and thus that it treats it in a manner that could produce unintended and detrimental consequences.

<p><a name="st_86"></a>
<a name="50307-54_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   This amendment is very similar to the third part of the next amendment in my name and therefore I want to say a few words about it now. I do not think that the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, is the only one who is, as he described himself, thick. I think we are all thick because I, too, was somewhat confused by the Minister&#039;s earlier answer, detailed and careful though it was.
</p>

<a name="50307-54_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>It strikes me that the Minister was saying that a child with an SEN or a disability may have to pay for his transport if he lives within the walking-to-school limit if his parents are not protected from charges because they are on a low income. That is a problem. I tried to intervene earlier but was too long-winded in making my point and another noble Lord intervened. The fact is that an able-bodied child can avoid such charges by deciding to walk to school but a child with disabilities cannot do so. That is the difference and that is why I do not think that disabled children are being treated the same as those who are fully able-bodied. Both groups of children may live within the statutory distance and be charged for their transport but they are different.
</p>

go once more into the breach, but it may well mean that noble Lords will be threatened with a serious&#151;but, I hope, not too complex&#151;and very thorough letter on these matters.

</p>

<a name="50307-54_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>I shall start where the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, ended and set out the position on one point. She said that it would be unreasonable for children with some form of special educational needs within the three-mile limit to have to pay if they were within walking distance. But that is the current situation. Many children with SEN living within a three-mile limit may currently be paying something towards their transport. That is a fact of life and it is the current situation. Not every child with SEN receives totally free transport.
</p>

<a name="50307-54_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>I turn to the specific example given by my noble friend Lord Berkley. One should never respond to specific examples from the Dispatch Box but it may be helpful in this case. The charges will not be high, if paid at all. They would be no more than those for a child who travels to an ordinary school. Of course, that situation in London is relatively straightforward because, as from September, all transport for children in London will be free. Therefore, it follows that in that situation transport for SEN pupils must also be free so that there is no worsenment under the ECHR.
</p>

<a name="50307-54_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>Under the legislation, a child with SEN would be protected if his peer group walked to school but not if the peer group paid for transport by bus. But the child in question would not pay any more than the peer group on the bus, irrespective of the complexity of need or the distance travelled by the child with SEN. The issue is not simple but I hope that I have started to clarify the matter, although my letter may achieve more. If the Committee can bear with me, I shall give noble Lords the full benefit of my admirable speaking notes because, again, that may help reflection.

</p>

<a name="50307-54_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>A number of problems are associated with Amendment No. 8&#151;not least that a child with special educational needs is not a legally defined term and there are no entitlements to free transport as such. An LEA is under a duty to provide transport where it considers it necessary to facilitate attendance.
</p>

<a name="50307-54_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>Amendment No. 21 seeks to include in the definition of &quot;protected child&quot; a limited proportion of children with a special educational need or a disability. Those included will be pupils who, because of their SEN or disability, are unable to use transport ordinarily available to children without that SEN or disability and who attend the nearest suitable school or another school where it has been agreed with the scheme authorities that they should be registered as a consequence of their SEN. Amendment No. 23 seeks to ensure that any pupils with mobility problems that prevent them walking to school will have transport provided and that they will be protected from charges.
</p>

<a name="50307-54_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>From my discussions with the Special Educational Consortium, I know that there is a helpful consensus that parents of pupils with an SEN should not be disadvantaged in comparison with parents whose children make their own way to their local school on <br>&nbsp;<br>

foot or by bicycle or bus and that, where possible, improvements to existing arrangements might accrue from travel schemes.
</p>

<a name="50307-54_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>After listening to these points being made in another place, we have provided a number of clarifications of that policy. LEAs will need to include in scheme applications their policy on providing transport to pupils with SEN. They are not approved schemes unless they protect pupils with SEN or mobility problems from charges which would be additional to those that accrue to the parents of pupils of the same age in the area in which they reside where special arrangements have been made by reason of disability or special needs.

</p>

<a name="50307-54_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>These provisions would cover transport provided as a result of mobility limitations or where a child&#039;s SEN prevented him making his way to school independently on foot where that was the normal mode of travel for children resident in the neighbourhood. It would also cover transport provided in order to meet a pupil&#039;s SEN where it could not be met through transport available to pupils generally in an area. It would include specialised transport to a local school attended by pupils with SEN and non-specialised transport to schools further away than those attended by pupils resident in the area.
</p>

<a name="50307-54_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>Paragraph 32 of the prospectus requires LEAs to set out in detail their approach to providing transport for pupils with SEN and, as I said, we shall not approve schemes that do not fulfil it.
</p>

<a name="50307-54_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>However, we cannot accept that throughout the Bill all SEN children can necessarily be protected from charges and that all SEN children should be able to travel free. I believe that in part that is what is behind the amendment. That is not currently the law and we do not think that it should be the law in the future. If, on the back of this Bill, one sought to make a major change of this sort, it would effectively frustrate to a major extent any possibility of flexibility or creativity by local authorities.
</p>

<a name="50307-54_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>It would be a nice world in which every parent of a child with SEN, whatever the nature of the disability, had everything free. But that is not the current law and we do not believe that it is reasonable to change the law in this respect. I pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord   Rix, for the fact that, when we touched on this matter at Second Reading, he made it clear that he was not seeking to be adventurous in that respect on the back of this Bill. That was reputable, given the pressures that were no doubt placed on him. I think that that was the difference between us and the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, on this matter.
</p>

<a name="50307-54_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>In many respects, the measure that I have outlined goes further than the amendment. It protects pupils who are unable to walk or cycle to school, along with their peers, from charges where they require transport. The amendment offers protection for children only where transport is normally available to the child&#039;s peers. In addition, there are practical difficulties but I shall not go into those.

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column GC217</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50307-54_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>With regard to Amendment No. 23, the children in question must already be provided with transport where it is needed. The Bill requires scheme authorities to make such travel arrangements as they consider appropriate for each child.
</p>

<a name="50307-54_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>Amendment No. 25 seeks to extend free school transport to pupils who have to attend a specific school because it caters for their special educational needs. I agree that it is important that transport costs and availability do not prevent pupils with SEN attending the nearest school that makes appropriate provision for those needs. However, I think that the existing system strikes the right balance between the needs of this group and the needs of mainstream pupils. Pupils   with statements of special educational needs may have specialised transport needs, such as oxygen dependency or measures to prevent those with brittle bone disease sustaining injuries. In these cases, the statement will set out the type of transport that is required&#151;which will continue to be provided free.
</p>

<a name="50307-54_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>In other cases, pupils with SEN will be able to attend a mainstream school alongside their peers and share transport. Pupils with severe dyslexia, for example, may fall into this category, as may pupils who are blind or deaf. In these cases, we would expect pupils with SEN to be treated in the same way as their mainstream peers&#151;which is the situation now.
</p>

<a name="50307-54_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>Some other pupils with special educational needs will have to travel to special schools or mainstream schools with specialised units attached. In these cases, children may have to travel a significant distance to a suitable school. If a local travel scheme has charges in place, then their parents are more likely to have to pay than when their children attend mainstream provision. We fully understand that parents in these circumstances may think that additional charges are unfair and I think that we have made it clear that LEAs will not be able to discriminate in that way.
</p>

<a name="50307-54_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>There is a further problem with the amendment&#151;and, again I shall not refer to technical faults. It refers to pupils attending a,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;school that is suitable by virtue of provision made for particular needs&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-54_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>This does not specify that the school has to be the closest school that can cater for the pupil with special educational needs. A parent could choose a school a considerable distance away rather than one with adequate provision that is closer to home. In some cases, a further school may be named on a statement by agreement between parents and the local education authority, with the agreement that parents will pay for transport&#151;putting these parents in the same position as other parents who exercise parental preference in the educational mainstream.
</p>

<a name="50307-54_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>If the Bill overturned these existing agreements which work, making all transport to special schools free, there could be unacceptable pressure on LEA budgets. We are not using the Bill to change the existing structure of protection further than is required to ensure compliance with the ECHR or DDA, or whatever.

<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="50307-55_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   Indeed. The Bill does not seek to introduce differential entitlement to home-to-school transport for children with SEN and it does not protect children with SEN from charges that a local education authority may wish to levy. But neither does it require participating LEAs to charge pupils with SEN for home-to-school transport. However, we are clear that pupils with SEN and/or disabilities must be protected from additional charges over and above their peers without additional needs.
</p>

<a name="50307-55_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>At paragraph 32, the prospectus states that scheme applicants must describe how their proposals cater for pupils with SEN with and without statements, disabled pupils and pupils with medical conditions. Where a disabled child is unable to walk a statutory walking distance, the LEA will be under a duty to make transport arrangements for them. We know that there is a great deal of concern about the way in which charges affect families with pupils with SEN and/or <br>&nbsp;<br>

disabilities. We will approve only schemes which will protect pupils with SEN and/or disabilities from any charges additional to those which apply to children of the same age living in the same area who attend their neighbourhood school if special arrangements have to be made to accommodate a child&#039;s disabilities or SEN.
</p>

<a name="50307-55_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>School transport arrangements cover transport provided as a result of a child&#039;s SEN and/or disability where a pupil cannot avail himself of transport provided for all pupils or make his way to school independently on foot or otherwise where that is the normal mode of travel for children resident in the neighbourhood.
</p>

<a name="50307-55_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>Transport has to be provided in order to support education and the meeting of pupils&#039; SEN which cannot be accommodated through transport available to other pupils living in the area. This would cover both specialised transport to local schools attended by pupils with SEN and specialised or non-specialised transport to schools further away than those attended by pupils resident in the area.
</p>

<a name="50307-55_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>The intention of this paragraph is to ensure that parents of children with SEN and/or disabilities do not pay any charges additional to those paid by parents of pupils without SEN and/or disabilities&#151;for example, where more expensive specialist transport is required&#151;or because they had to travel further to access suitable educational provision. That is the nub of it. When we give an example&#151;I shall not chance my arm and do so now&#151;it will become explicitly clear. We will use real examples of real charges and signal that they cannot be charged more than the charge for their peers going to a local school when they are going, for the sake of argument, 15 miles.
</p>

<a name="50307-55_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>To ensure that there was no charge to parents of pupils without SEN and/or disabilities&#151;for example, because they were able to walk to school&#151;there would be no charge to parents of a child with SEN and/or disabilities where transport arrangements are required by reason of that SEN or disability or because they had to travel further to access suitable educational provision. The prospectus accompanying the Bill is now on a statutory footing, as I have signalled on a number of occasions, and the guidance makes it clear that where pupils with mobility or other difficulties may need additional help, LEAs must consider whether their scheme discriminates against those pupils on ECHR and other grounds. It also requires LEAs to provide a thorough analysis of the impact. Furthermore, the DDA, as amended by the SEN legislation, also applies and I have covered that issue in speaking to other amendments. These functions would include providing school transport under Sections 509 or 509ZAA.

</p>




<p><a name="st_102"></a>The noble Baroness said: I tabled this amendment for the sake of the environment and for the sake of children with special needs.
</p>

<a name="50307-55_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>Paragraphs (a) and (b) of my amendment relate to all children who live outside the current walking-to-school limits. Naturally, some of those children will be from families on low incomes, whose free transport will already be protected by the Bill. But there will be other families who may&#151;and I say &quot;may&quot; advisedly&#151;be able to afford to pay for their children&#039;s school transport, which they now get free. It must be said that all families are under financial pressure these days; it is an expensive business bringing up children and even those not on benefits struggle to manage. Indeed, they are always looking for ways in which to do things more cheaply. That is what worries me, unless we include the amendment in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50307-55_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>Here is why. Parents, especially those with several children, who receive a bill for school transport having previously received it for free, may well pile all the children into the car and drive them to school. Then, hey presto, the stated objective of the Bill has been defeated. Normally we on these Benches are in favour of targeting financial help at those most in need. Indeed, the Minister reminded me of that fact in his reply at Second Reading. But on occasion that principle must be put aside in favour of the greater principle of protecting the environment. If a little bit of help were given through the amendment to families who strictly speaking do not need it, so be it. It would be worth it if it achieved the aim, to which the Government are committed, of getting the children out of the cars and on to the buses, or their feet, or their bicycle.
</p>

<a name="50307-55_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>Paragraph (c) of the amendment refers to children in special education who already have an existing entitlement to free transport. We have to be clear about the need to provide transport to those children strictly based on their needs and not on where they live. The additional cost of getting to a more distant but more suitable school must be covered, even if they have to pay the equivalent cost to the cost of getting to the nearest school, which their fully able peers would have to pay. That is because other benefits that they may receive are for other things&#151;for example, disability living allowance. The free transport that they have had up to now is not covered by any other benefit. That is why we need to ensure now that all such children are provided with free transport to the best school that can serve their special needs. I heard welcome reassurances from the Minister on that point a little earlier.
</p>

<a name="50307-55_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>As to those children who do not currently have free transport, the Minister assured me&#151;in reply to the very first question that I asked him in a pre-Bill meeting with the Minister and officials&#151;that money-saving is not the objective of the pilot schemes. One purpose of the pilots is to allow LEAs to redistribute in a different way the limited resources available to subsidised school transport. I would think that helping children with SEN or disabilities who currently pay some or all the cost would be a good way in which to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC222"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column GC222</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

redistribute those funds. If that was one of the objectives of one of the pilots submitted for approval to the department, how would the Government respond? Would they believe it to be an appropriate way in which to distribute the limited resources available? I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_103"></a>
<a name="50307-56_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton: </b>   Amendment No. 12, which is grouped with Amendment No. 9, is probing in nature and is an attempt to reinstate the status quo. It would ensure that children who live more than two miles away from their primary school and more than three miles away from their secondary school will still receive free transport. It would not prevent LEAs from trying to tackle congestion relating to children living fewer than two miles away from their primary school or fewer than three miles away from their secondary school. It would allow LEAs the freedom to do so.
</p>

<a name="50307-56_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>We need to recognise the fact that, under the Bill, parents could be looking at a charge of &#163;1 a day for each pupil. For a family of one child, that is about &#163;200 during the school year, but it does not take much for the figures to multiply according to the number of children. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said that it was expensive even for parents who are not on a low income; I might add that it is expensive for Members of this Chamber, too. A family of four children could face a bill of &#163;800 a year for sending their children to school, which is an expensive addition to housekeeping costs for many hard-working families. However, I noted in the prospectus that there is a particularly strong case for providing protection from charges for the fourth or subsequent child of compulsory school age in a household, as they comprise less than 1 per cent of the pupil population.
</p>

<a name="50307-56_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>We must also remember that the cut-off of free school transport for protected children is fairly low and is set at an income of about &#163;13,000&#151;the same as the entitlement for free school meals. In many constituencies, the average income is &#163;24,000. At the same time, however, the Government have introduced means-tested benefits through various tax credit and childcare schemes, from which families who earn up to &#163;59,000 a year can benefit. It is inconsistent to give money through some child tax credit schemes to families earning &#163;59,000 a year, while taking it away from families who may earn only a little more than &#163;13,000 a year. We must therefore be consistent in the way in which we tackle need and people&#039;s ability to pay.
</p>

<a name="50307-56_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>Amendment No. 24 introduces the case of a pupil attending a specialist school, having taken and passed the necessary entrance qualifications. It would be useful to allow a child who lives on the wrong side of town and who has a particular interest in attending a specialist school because of the nature of its speciality to attend that school, and it would be useful to provide some support for that child&#039;s transport costs. Amendment No. 22 raises a similar issue in regard to a child registered at a Welsh-language school.
</p>

<a name="50307-56_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>That raises the question of how one assesses whether the child ought to go to such a school and whether the school is suitable for the child. The Government have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC223"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column GC223</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

made some suggestions as to how we might determine what is a suitable school for a child and how we might introduce an objective test to measure it. In their response to the report by the Select Committee on Education and Skills on school admissions, the Government accepted the need for aptitude tests for certain types of school. The examples of that were special sports schools and schools specialising in visual and performing arts and languages. Those schools would be able to continue to set an aptitude test and select up to 10 per cent of their pupils on the basis of their aptitude in sport, the visual and performing arts or languages.
</p>

<a name="50307-56_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>If we are to go down the route of trying to encourage more pupils to attend a school that will meet their particular needs&#151;in this case, one that will give that child specialist support&#151;we ought to provide free school transport to the pupils who pass that aptitude test. It is an objective measure of whether that school is suitable for them.
</p>




<p><a name="st_104"></a>
<a name="50307-56_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   I fear that the Committee is to be subjected to a fairly long speech again from me, but I hope that it will bear it with fortitude and even that some of it is helpful.
</p>

<a name="50307-56_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>Amendment No. 9 would maintain the current entitlement to school transport of any child who attends primary school and lives more than two miles away or any other child who attends secondary school and lives more than three miles away; it seeks to prevent travel scheme authorities from removing any existing entitlement to free transport.
</p>

<a name="50307-56_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>If such an amendment was passed, the effect, if not the intent, of it would be to destroy the Bill. If you protect all those who are currently protected, you pre-empt such a large amount of the scope and funding that local authorities have that they will have precious little room for manoeuvre to do anything positive or creative to get more children out of cars into walking, cycling, other forms of transport such as buses or other ways to get children to school that are more environmentally friendly, healthy and equitable. I hope that that is self-evident from the arithmetic alone; if you protect everybody whom you currently protect, you pre-empt the scheme. I shall not assume that that was the intent; I shall assume that these are in the nature of probing amendments and unpack what lies behind them.
</p>

<a name="50307-56_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>Under the current system, only a small minority of pupils receive free or assisted home to school transport; only about 10 per cent of pupils in England and 20 per cent in Wales get anything at all. There is a relatively large subsidy&#151;although I shall be careful in referring to figures of &#163;600 million as large in front of the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, as it might upset him. About &#163;675 million was spent in England in 2002-03 on school transport; that is large in these contexts, if not in total local government terms. I am only teasing the noble Lord.
</p>

<a name="50307-56_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>That subsidy is given simply on the basis of distance criteria, because that was what legislators in the 1940s believed was a good enough rule. In practice, we know that nearly two-thirds of pupils who arrive at school by <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC224"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column GC224</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

bus have their fares paid by their parents, not by the LEA. Those pupils who have their fare paid for by their parents are disproportionately drawn from families with lower household incomes. I would be more sympathetic to the argument to protect the status quo if the status quo were not disproportionately subsidising richer rather than poorer parents. I have given the evidence for that previously. If we deny local authorities the opportunity to raise additional revenue for reinvestment to redistribute the subsidy for home-to-school transport, as this amendment and others would do, those children would continue to shoulder this burden and we would make no contribution to health or environmental improvement.
</p>

<a name="50307-56_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>As we said at Second Reading, there is no public funding available to expand free provision of school transport. Grown-up politics says at times that one has to consider how to get the maximum amount possible from a fixed sum of money rather than always being able to throw more money at something. So it is vital that local authorities are given the scope to be more thoughtful and creative in using their limited resources. Although the Bill will not lead to increased public funding, it will allow authorities to design improved services through a combination of efficient use of existing resources, reinvestment of revenue from charging and redistributing.
</p>

<a name="50307-56_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>The amendment would eliminate the possibility of reinvesting revenue, as schemes would be prevented from charging, prevent the redistribution of the existing subsidy, and remove the capacity to make improvements. I hope that no one really wishes that to happen&#151;otherwise we are all wasting our time. We are considering how to create a system that will achieve more equity and make an environmental contribution, as the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, rightly said that she wanted to.
</p>

<a name="50307-56_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>When charges are proposed, the prospectus asks scheme applicants to set out in great detail their proposals for charging, which must be the subject of wide local consultation. The prospectus emphasises that charges must be affordable and not pitched at a level which would increase car use&#151;otherwise the whole venture will be abortive and a waste of time, because it will lead to what it was meant to cure. It also requires local schemes to take full account of the effects of family size and the pressures on low-income families.

</p>

<a name="50307-56_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>On Amendments Nos. 22 and 24, I agree that transport for pupils attending denominational and Welsh-medium schools is important, as those pupils are likely to make longer journeys than their peers who attend their neighbourhood community or, in Wales, English-medium community school. Many parents exercise parental preference so that their children can attend denominational schools, and in those cases local education authorities have no obligation to provide transport, unless the school is the child&#039;s nearest suitable school and outside statutory walking distance. This is similar to the debate that we had on <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC225"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column GC225</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

SEN, in that we are not seeking to use the Bill to provide betterment for groups who currently do not have betterment. The consequence of that would be that we would remove the scope of the scheme for creative improvements.
</p>

<a name="50307-56_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>I understand that parents and pupils attending denominational schools are becoming increasingly concerned that discretionary transport to denominational schools, both free and subsidised, is being withdrawn by some authorities. The Catholic Education Service and the Church of England Board of Education recognise some of the problems with current transport arrangements to denominational schools, and want to work with us to put in place arrangements that will increase the availability of affordable transport to children attending denominational schools. That may be why they have not been at all averse to the Bill&#151;because they have seen its potential.
</p>

<a name="50307-56_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>Paragraph 10 of the prospectus identifies transport to denominational schools and to Welsh-medium schools as a priority area for school travel schemes. That is the relevance of it. The prospectus accompanying the Bill is very clear on how LEAs should address the question of charges and denominational schools. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>&quot;LEAs should pay careful attention to the impact of any charges on low income families whose parents adhere to a particular faith or philosophy, and who have expressed a preference for a particular school as a result of their religious or their philosophical beliefs (or in Wales because of the language of instruction). In our view, it is possible that these categories of pupils may be discriminated against if they are treated differently from other pupils from low income families, unless the different treatment can be objectively justified, for example on grounds of excessive journey length, or having a detrimental impact on the child&#039;s education&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-56_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>The prospectus also makes it clear that when provision is made for pupils travelling to denominational schools, it must be made for pupils travelling to non-denominational schools to be educated in accordance with their parents&#039; philosophical beliefs. However, we cannot accept that pupils travelling to denominational schools should receive free transport, if pupils attending community schools are making a contribution to their transport costs. I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, will see the comparison there with the debate that we had on SEN.
</p>

<a name="50307-56_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>The effect of Amendment No. 22 is to extend the protection from charges to all pupils of compulsory school age who attend a Welsh-medium school. We cannot agree to this amendment, not least because it is incompatible with the Human Rights Act. It would require scheme authorities to discriminate in favour of pupils who attend Welsh-medium schools, and therefore to treat those children more favourably than pupils who attend English-medium schools.
</p>

<a name="50307-56_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>Many parents exercise parental preference so that their children can attend Welsh-medium schools, and in these cases local education authorities have no obligation to provide transport. It is often provided on a free or subsidised basis, but that is discretionary, not <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC226"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column GC226</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

mandatory. On a practical level, different LEAs have different levels of Welsh-medium school provision. I shall not go into detail now, although I could do so later if that was helpful.

</p>

<a name="50307-56_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>The situation regarding specialist schools, which is the subject of Amendment No. 24, is somewhat different. We want all secondary schools to play to their strengths and provide a curriculum that offers flexibility. Our five-year strategy set that out. More than two-thirds of secondary schools have already achieved specialist status. To date, 15.8 per cent of specialist schools are rural schools. Specialist status does not limit pupil choice or narrow the curriculum; every comprehensive school in the country is obliged to provide the full national curriculum. Therefore, parents in rural areas will not need to make school preference decisions on the basis of a school becoming a specialist school. They will get the core offer of the national curriculum in any specialist school that they go to.
</p>

<a name="50307-56_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>The Government recognise that schools in rural areas are often geographically far apart. The specialist school concept does not pose a barrier in this regard and for school partnerships, we fully appreciate that it may be necessary to concentrate on ICT-based links, or teachers with a particular expertise travelling to pupils rather than pupils travelling further. Such approaches sit well with the programme.

</p>

<a name="50307-56_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>Amendment No. 24 would extend free school transport to pupils who have passed an aptitude test to attend a specialist school. Only 6 per cent of specialist schools and about 2 per cent of all secondary schools select by aptitude. Despite that, we cannot accept that pupils who have passed an aptitude test should receive free transport. If they attend their nearest school, we think that they should be treated in the same way as other pupils. When they do not attend their nearest school, we think they should be treated in the same way as other pupils whose parents exercise parental preference. Although some scheme authorities might implement proposals that would have the effect of facilitating attendance at schools of parental preference&#151;for example through area-wide concessionary fare schemes&#151;we feel that there should again be local discretion in that regard, as that is part of what the Bill is all about.
</p>

<a name="50307-56_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>There is nearly an end to this monologue. The part of the amendment to which I have just referred, if it became part of the Bill, might even lead to parents applying for places in specialist schools&#151;although let me not labour that point. I hope that the Committee will agree that this amendment would create unnecessary divisions between pupils in the same school, and would not reflect our wish that the cost of school transport for all pupils better reflects their family circumstances.
</p>

<a name="50307-56_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>I have spoken at length, but I hope that I have illustrated some of the essential architecture of the Bill, building on the debate that we had on SEN. I hope that my speech was helpful, despite being of a wearisome length.

<a name="50307-57_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton: </b>   I thank the Minister for his very full and detailed reply. Indeed, the intention was to probe and to unpack some of the thinking behind the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50307-57_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>I shall read the Minister&#039;s comments with care, although we are still concerned about the cost to low-income households. We believe that the Bill sits uneasily with the Government&#039;s mantra of choice, not only for denominational schools but for specialist schools. If a child has a particular talent and gets into one of the specialist schools, why should they be disadvantaged just because they come from a poor family? Why should the only choice that they have be their nearest school?
</p>




<p><a name="st_106"></a>
<a name="50307-57_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   I shall just make one comment, before I move to my amendment, on the little debate that we have just had about specialist schools and whether children should get free transport to the nearest specialist school if they have been selected on aptitude. I am aware that although specialist schools have that power, none of them uses it. If they are not going to give children free transport to such a school if they have been selected by aptitude and the school is further away than the nearest school offering the national curriculum, as all schools do, what is the point in having that power at all? I wonder whether the Minister could tell us whether the Government have any intention of removing the power to select on aptitude. No one seems to want it and no one is going to pay for it, so why bother to have it? It sends out the wrong message about those schools.
</p>

<a name="50307-57_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>I want to make a comment on Amendment No. 9 before I withdraw it. I accept all that the Minister says about the status quo giving the minimum help to those who need it most. I accepted in my opening remarks that some help currently goes to some people who do not need it very much and would continue to receive it if my amendment was accepted. I also accept what he says about my amendment probably destroying the Bill in destroying the flexibility that local authorities are looking for in running the pilots. But I was hoping by moving the amendment to open up a debate about the balance between two objectives that the Government say that they want for the pilots. That is the balance between the objectives of environmental protection and appropriate financial support for those who need it.
</p>

<a name="50307-57_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>I do not believe that we have had that debate, and I do not believe that we can, because this Bill is not the way to do it. What we really need is a bit of blue-sky thinking about public transport&#151;but this Bill is not it. The countries where they have really succeeded in getting people on the bus have done so by making it free for everybody, including those people who do not need the money. I do not need the money to come here free on the bus to your Lordships&#039; House, but because I am over 60 I have a &quot;freedom pass&quot;. That has made me use the buses more, even though I could perfectly <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC228"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column GC228</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

easily pay the fare. So I can tell you from personal experience that it does help to get people on to the buses. But that is a different debate for another day.
</p>

<a name="50307-57_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>I shall make a point that I did not make in my opening remarks. When children first go to a school from which they are more than three miles away, the parents expect that they will go to the school for seven or eight years. They start off with free transport. That is an implicit contract with those parents, who plan their family budget on the basis of it when the child goes to the school at 11 or 12. The Government are planning to let local authorities change that contract.
</p>

<a name="50307-57_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>I hope that the Government and the local authorities planning to do that will bear in mind the potential electoral consequences. More than that, I hope that they will bear in mind the potential consequences on the environment. People are only too willing to jump into the car if they think that it will save them money. People think about the cost of a car only when they put petrol in the tank. They forget that there are other costs in having a car, such as buying it in the first place, and having it serviced and insured. People do not think of that when they compare the cost of the bus fare with the cost of the petrol.
</p>

<a name="50307-57_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>We are living in the real world. We have to bear in mind how people actually act, leaving aside sometimes the logic of how they act. Sometimes it is illogical. If you take all the costs of a car into account, it probably is cheaper to go on the bus, but people do not always see it that way. I was hoping to open up a debate about the balance between the two stated objectives of the Bill. We have not really had it, and I do not think that we can because the Bill is wrong in many ways. There are other ways in which we need to address the needs of the environment and poor families. However, in the mean time&#151;

I know what she means in part; I take her point about reality and marginal costs of car use. It is open to local authorities if they wish and can afford it&#151;as Transport for London is doing&#151;to go further in terms of their transport schemes and bring in totally free transport of the sort from which she benefits. Perhaps I will benefit from it one day if I ever fill in the forms.

<p><a name="st_110"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is a probing amendment. It is intended to air the issue of statutory walking distance. The current position is that free transport is provided for primary school children who have to walk more than two miles to school and secondary school children who have to walk more than three miles. I am sure that we will touch on the issues that face rural areas later in our proceedings. However, as was mentioned at Second Reading, in many urban areas congestion problems arise not from children travelling more than two or three miles to their primary or secondary school, but from children being taken by car to school where the distance from home is less than two or three miles. By sticking to the two-mile to three-mile limits, to what extent are we requiring scheme authorities to grasp the nettle of congestion in urban areas where journeys are short?

<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley&#151;I am sorry that he is not in his place&#151;talked of the law of unintended consequences when he moved an amendment earlier. At Second Reading, the Minister said that I was pretending that a consequence of the charge would be that people might get into their cars. Had I not been suffering from a temperature that day&#151;my legs would not have got me to my feet&#151;I would have protested that I was not pretending. I have done a little of opinion polling of my own between Second Reading and today. I am not saying that YouGov, ICM or MORI would immediately dash to my door to ask me to join them. It is not necessarily a representative sample. I did not load it one way or the other. However, it slightly satisfied the frustrated psephologist in me.

<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>I asked: &quot;If the school is just down the road or if people start to charge for a journey that was normally free, what would you do?&quot;. The answer was: &quot;We would probably just get in the car and take our children to school&quot;. Someone said, &quot;It&#039;s fine, Trish, walking when the weather is nice&quot;. But most of the time where I live in Lancashire, it is pouring down, so it is much easier to get in the car to take your children to school.
</p>

<a name="50307-57_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>The Audit Commission study on school transport found that more than 60 per cent of primary school children who live between one and two miles of their school travel by car and that about 30 per cent of secondary school pupils who live between two and three miles of school also travel by car. If LEAs were forced to provide free transport for pupils who live more than a mile from school, that might make them look more carefully at congestion in urban areas, to which the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, also referred.
</p>

<a name="50307-57_para11"></a>

<a name="50307-57_para12"></a>

<a name="50307-58_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   We know that one of the problems with our processes is that it is not always transparent to spot what is lurking behind the amendment from the literal words of the amendment. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, was, I think, sorrowful that we could not have the debate that she wanted on her amendment as a consequence.
</p>

<a name="50307-58_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>At one level, the answer to the question posed by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, at its simplest, is that we will never know if it is possible, within the current Bill and the reality of constraints, to do better with the amount of money now available, unless we allow local authorities to see if they can innovate by a different form of subsidy than one simply based on geographical distance. Of course, that is at the heart of why a piloting approach is appropriate.
</p>

<a name="50307-58_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>Perhaps I may give the noble Baroness the literal responses to her amendment, which, in part, touch on what she was seeking. From the National Travel Survey, we know that 83 per cent of pupils walk one mile or less to school, 45 per cent walk one to two miles and only 16 per cent walk two to three miles to school. Many children who live between one and three miles from school travel to school by bus, family car or taxi, which is expensive for their parents, particularly when there are several children in the family.
</p>

<a name="50307-58_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>However, the amendment proposes that scheme authorities should be required to provide transport for pupils who live more than one mile from their nearest school. That would be unnecessary, unworkable and prohibitively expensive&#151;I shall give some illustration of that. It is unnecessary because there are already a substantial number of children, particularly of secondary school age, who walk or cycle more than a mile to school. Thanks heaven for that&#151;the problem would be even worse if they did not.
</p>

<a name="50307-58_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>The proposal is unworkable because it would sharply increase the number of pupils travelling to school by bus. Authorities would not be obliged to provide free transport, but if they charged free market fares, pupils might not use them. Above all, the bus network does not have sufficient capacity in the morning and evening peaks, just in terms of sheer supply. It would take a considerable time to build bus capacity.
</p>

<a name="50307-58_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>The killer issue, of course, is cost. The current arrangements are largely based on the two and three-mile statutory distances. It is likely that around &#163;700 million will be spent on home-to-school transport in England during the current financial year and about &#163;80 million in Wales. If we extended that to those who live more than one mile from school, our rough estimate is that it would require between &#163;1.2 billion <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC231"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column GC231</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and &#163;2 billion extra for all authorities. If someone has a free cheque to give for that, I am that sure local authorities will be pleased to receive it.
</p>

<a name="50307-58_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>However, there has to be a sensible scheme to see what can be done within the realities of finances, rather than thinking that limitless amounts of someone else&#039;s money can be thrown at it. That is not necessarily the only way to make improvements. By that, I do not imply that sometimes increased investment is not necessary, but we have to test it within those parameters. I hope that that has been helpful.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>Page 2, line 30, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-58_para7"></a>
<p>&quot;(1)   A scheme authority or school can withdraw the entitlement to school transport where a child&#039;s behaviour puts at risk the safety of other pupils using the same mode of transport.</p>

<a name="50307-58_para8"></a>
<p>(2)   The scheme shall have regard to the need to be consistent with the scheme authority&#039;s transport policy statement prepared under section 509AA of the Education Act 1999 (c. 56).
</p>

<a name="50307-58_para9"></a>
<p>(3)   A scheme authority exercising its right under sub-paragraph (1) will be deemed to have satisfied its obligations under section 444(4)(b)(i) of the Education Act 1996.&quot;
</p>




<p><a name="st_114"></a>The noble Baroness said: Poor pupil behaviour on buses is cited by parents as a major concern. Not only can it endanger the safety of passengers as drivers are distracted or equipment vandalised, but it also makes for an unpleasant experience for other pupils travelling on the bus. There is some confusion over exactly who is responsible for ensuring good pupil behaviour on school buses.
</p>

<a name="50307-58_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>It would be helpful if the Government issued guidance to LEAs setting out the extent of the responsibilities and powers in relation to pupil behaviour on buses. The provision of CCTV or escorts on school buses may be one way in which to improve behaviour. Escorts could be provided by schools or the bus operator but they would need to have adequate training and a clear remit in terms of power.
</p>

<a name="50307-58_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>If we want more parents to send their children on the school bus, we need to ensure that the behaviour of the children using the buses is of a high standard. In their response to the education committee&#039;s report, the Government said that if a child is excluded from a school bus, the LEA has to pay the cost of transporting that child to school. Therefore, there is a financial disincentive to the LEA excluding a child from the school bus. It would have to pay for a taxi or some other means of transport to get to school the child who is misbehaving on a school bus.
</p>

<a name="50307-58_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>There is no incentive for the LEA to exclude children who are misbehaving and putting at risk other pupils on the bus or damaging equipment on it. It is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC232"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column GC232</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

time that we took a much firmer line on the issue. It should not be the LEA that is left to pick up the cost of sending children to school in a taxi. We should say that the parents of such children should pay the cost of getting them to school and that they should take responsibility for ensuring that their children get to school. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_115"></a>
<a name="50307-58_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, raised a very interesting point. At the risk of making her argument still stronger, which is not my job of course, it could be an incentive for an extremely disruptive pupil to think, &quot;If I carry on doing this, I can travel by taxi&quot;, which would hardly be anyone&#039;s intention. But this is quite a complex issue and I want to go through it in detail because obviously we must get it right.
</p>

<a name="50307-58_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>The first sub-paragraph of Amendment No. 11 seeks to introduce a power for the LEAs to withdraw entitlement to school transport in scheme areas where the behaviour of a pupil puts at risk the safety of other pupils using the same transport. The amendment would not extend that power to LEAs which were not scheme authorities, and that might be a gap in the amendment. Nor would the amendment address a situation where a pupil&#039;s transport to school was not provided by the LEA&#151;for example, where a pupil consistently behaved badly while travelling on a train or a public bus. That is another possible gap.
</p>

<a name="50307-58_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>Therefore, although the amendment seeks to ensure the safety of other pupils, it is important to remember that pupils travel on transport used by members of the public, who, as I am sure Members of the Committee will agree, should be protected. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, that poor behaviour by pupils on school transport is an extremely serious issue to which we must get the right solution. The consequences of poor behaviour can be very wide-ranging.
</p>

<a name="50307-58_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>The DfES and DfT issued a joint document, <i>Travelling to School: an action plan</i>, which asks that each school should promote positive behaviour by pupils on their journey to and from school through rewarding positive behaviour and using sanctions to address poor behaviour. Guidance for schools on behaviour on school transport is contained in key stage 3 behaviour and attendance materials, so it is addressed in schools and in the curriculum. Schools recognise that positive behaviour on the journey can enhance the school&#039;s reputation. It also supports good behaviour in the school. We expect schools to work with the police, bus operators and the local community to promote positive behaviour.
</p>

<a name="50307-58_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>Similarly, we expect LEAs and transport authorities to tackle anti-social behaviour through driver training and to work with schools on an agreed approach to make pupils aware of the dangers of poor behaviour. The action plan cites the work done by Essex County Council&#151;I am very pleased to have the opportunity to say that&#151;which is obviously quite exemplary. It found that a behaviour liaison officer and escorts&#151;together with driver training&#151;reduced vandalism and poor behaviour, and significant changes were achieved.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC233"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column GC233</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50307-58_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>A number of authorities in Wales are also piloting the use of CCTV on routes where there have been some behaviour problems. Those measures are combined with a clear policy of sanctions for disruptive behaviour, including bans of varying periods from the school bus. The results so far are very encouraging.
</p>

<a name="50307-58_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>Poor behaviour on buses is an issue that the LEAs have also raised. We are aware of cases where children who are eligible for free school transport have misbehaved consistently while travelling to or from school and that some authorities have adopted a policy of withdrawing transport, either for a temporary period or, in the most serious and persistent cases, permanently, which, in a way, is what we were being appealed to consider in relation to this amendment.
</p>

<a name="50307-58_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>The intention is that such sanctions would be a deterrent and it is hoped that they would be used only rarely if they had to be invoked. However, it is important to signal to pupils and parents that behaviour which endangers other pupils&#151;or the driver or other passengers&#151;will not be tolerated. That is where there is a degree of confusion surrounding what can and cannot be done in terms of sanctions for poor behaviour on the school bus. Obviously, the intention of sub-paragraph (3) in the amendment is to find a way of assisting with that.
</p>

<a name="50307-58_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>Part of the confusion lies with the interplay between the provision of school transport and the law surrounding attendance at school. Section 444(4) of the 1996 Act describes the circumstances in which a parent of a pupil of compulsory school age would have a defence to the charge of failing to secure the child&#039;s regular attendance at school. Effectively, a parent of a child attending their nearest suitable school and living outside the statutory walking distance would have a defence against a charge for non-attendance if suitable transport arrangements have not been provided.
</p>

<a name="50307-58_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>However, the offence under Section 444(1) or (1A) is having a child who fails to attend school regularly. So if a child was banned from the school bus for a day, or perhaps a week even, the LEA would not be able to prosecute for non-attendance under Section 444. That means that an LEA could withdraw access to transport temporarily without having to consider whether alternative transport should be provided. It does not have to do that. That would not, of course, remove the parent&#039;s obligation to get the pupil to school by other means. That remains an obligation.
</p>

<a name="50307-58_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>As to the legal position where the withdrawal of transport would result in the child failing to attend school regularly, our legal advice is that there may be circumstances where there is no legal obligation on the LEA to provide alternative transport, which goes to the heart of what the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, was asking us to consider. The Act means that the LEA has to make suitable transport arrangements if it wants to retain the ability to prosecute parents for the failure of a child to attend regularly. But that is not the same as saying that they are under a legal obligation to provide the transport.

</p>

<a name="50307-58_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>In the circumstances that we are considering, the LEA would not be saying that transport was unnecessary and should not be provided; it would be saying that transport is necessary and that suitable transport has been provided but that the child&#039;s behaviour is such that the child cannot take advantage of it. That is a wholly different legal proposition. Furthermore, the DfES guidance on exclusion from school states that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a>&quot;Pupils&#039; behaviour in the immediate vicinity of the school or on a journey to or from school can . . . be grounds for exclusion&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-58_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>I believe that most people would agree that poor behaviour on transport is an issue that needs addressing through a variety of means: training for drivers, escorts, CCTV, as well as awarding good behaviour on transport and giving appropriate sanctions for poor behaviour. It is clear that the LEAs can already withdraw pupils from school buses on a temporary basis or, in cases of extremely bad behaviour, permanently. In either case, it would be the pupil&#039;s behaviour that made it impossible for the pupil to travel on the transport provided. That is the key in answering the points that have been, quite correctly, put to us.
</p>

<a name="50307-58_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>Very briefly, the obligations in relation to post-16 transport are obviously important here and they are covered in passing. I do not intend to make the whole speech that has been provided for me, but there is a duty on LEAs to plan and publish annual transport policy statements locally for pupils over the age of 16. It is our intention that those policy statements and programmes should not encourage the use of cars compared with the use of other forms of transport or walking or bicycling. We would certainly be very keen to ensure that pupils of sixth-form age or those not attending school but still in education are covered by good transport policies, which all pull in the same direction as the legislation in general. That is probably the neatest way of summarising the intentions of the legislation, which I believe are covered by the legislation. In that light, I invite the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column GC235</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>




<p><a name="st_118"></a>The noble Lord said: In Amendment No. 13, we seek to provide guidance to potential scheme authorities on how the charging mechanism might work. Paragraph (a) of the amendment means that there would be a need to understand what the basis of a charge might be. Would it be a flat-rate charge, with everyone on the bus paying the same amount, which would be very easy to administer? There are some attractions to that option, of course, but people living close at hand would probably end up subsidising those who lived further away who paid the same rate. There would be no correlation between the charge and the extent to which someone used the bus. The Government might find that attractive, because they could charge just one rate, as buses in London charge &#163;1.05 regardless of the length of the journey.
</p>

<a name="50307-59_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>On the other hand, if there were a distance-related charge, people living close at hand would not subsidise those who lived further away. Would the higher charge for those living in the more outlying or rural areas dissuade such people from using the bus? We had that debate before&#151;the charge is too high and people use cars, and so on. Most bus fares are distance related, but there is a trade-off between flat-rate and distance-related charges, and the Government and scheme authorities need to think about that in relation to any guidance given on the matter.
</p>

<a name="50307-59_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>Paragraph (b) relates to the basis for any future increases. It is all very well having a scheme that one day sets out a charge which those consulted think fair and reasonable. But what happens in subsequent years? What if there is a poor settlement for schools and a problem with local authority funding? The local authority might decide to increase the charges well above the rate of inflation in order to try to recover a shortfall in grant from government. Therefore, it would be interesting to have clarity on the basis of increase in charge.
</p>

<a name="50307-59_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>What happens about concessionary fares? Many groups are concerned about the impact of charging on social inclusion. We need to ensure that concessionary fares are discussed in the scheme consultation. We also need to consider who would collect the fare revenue. Will there be conductors in every bus collecting the flat rate or distance-related charge? Will we expect the head teacher to collect the money from pupils at school and so add to the burdens which they face? Will we expect the local authority to require parents to set up a standing order to enable it to collect the revenue? What would be the most efficient way to collect the charges?
</p>

<a name="50307-59_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>Will we expect parents to pay daily, weekly, monthly or each term? Clearly, collecting one payment per term would make life easier for LEAs and would cut down costs, but what if a family cannot pay a term&#039;s transport in one fell swoop? It could well be several hundred pounds and some families will find such a payment difficult. I would look to spreading the payment across a term.
</p>

<a name="50307-59_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>Revenue collection is a dull topic in many respects, but how many schools operate and how we collect the revenue will affect a household&#039;s finances. The purpose of the amendment is to tease out some of those <br>&nbsp;<br>

details and to get the department, in its next consultations, to consider the next draft of the prospectus and to discuss the issues with local education authorities. That way, before the scheme is unleashed on an unsuspecting public, there can be some guidance on these issues. They can be consulted on whether the scheme should apply in their area.
</p>

<a name="50307-59_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>I know from my knowledge in local government that often a great deal of time and money is spent collecting small amounts of revenue. We have to do that, but I want to examine the different ways in which we might cut down the bureaucracy. We shall be interested to hear the Minister&#039;s comments and I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_119"></a>
<a name="50307-59_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   The amendment would place a statutory duty on LEAs to insert details of charging proposals in travel scheme proposals, the basis on which they are to be calculated, arrangements for increasing charges, availability of concessionary fares and the method of collecting fares.
</p>

<a name="50307-59_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>Our formal consultation on the draft Bill revealed widespread agreement among local authorities that any introduction of charges for home-to-school journeys should be accompanied by an improvement in the services on offer. The prospectus accompanying the Bill requires scheme applications to explain what LEAs and local transport authorities are doing to ensure that good quality, well maintained and appropriate vehicles are used on the journey to school.
</p>

<a name="50307-59_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>The prospectus goes on to state:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>&quot;Scheme applications must set out local charging policies making it clear how many pupils will be charged and the level of the proposed charges&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-59_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>It also insists that charges must be affordable, pitched at a level which will not lead to an increase in car use. We also ask LEAs to explain how they propose to manage the charging regime effectively, taking into account the needs of low income and large families.
</p>

<a name="50307-59_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>I can therefore tell the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, that flat rate or distance as a method must be considered by the charging authority following consultation. It would need to do what suits the area and to examine the efficiency of the operation in relation to the methods of collection. We do not believe that it is right to prescribe those matters nationally because we want those who run the local schemes to think them through. But&#151;I return to the &quot;but&quot; because it is important&#151;a local authority which suddenly decided to charge for the whole year or even a term, or to charge a prohibitively large amount of money, would not take into account the needs of low income and large families or the other issues which are intended to discourage the use of cars. I hope that that gives the noble Lord some assurance on the important points he has made.
</p>

<a name="50307-59_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>We see these requirements as including details which have been sought in the amendment. However, the prospectus goes further than that. It states that charges may have a differential impact within scheme areas geographically. In some areas there will be net losers of public funding, with other areas gaining overall. LEA proposals must provide transparent information about any imbalances between the areas generating or <br>&nbsp;<br>

absorbing charges. The prospectus also requires scheme applicants to provide a thorough analysis of the impact of charging on different groups of pupils to clarify the net impact of any scheme on different segments of the pupil population.
</p>

<a name="50307-59_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>The prospectus also deals with transitional arrangements, requiring LEAs to set out their strategy for introducing the new arrangements. It also provides for ongoing monitoring and the provision of detailed financial information through annual reports as part of the evaluation process. It might be disproportionate in regulatory terms to go beyond all those requirements, which are pretty extensive in their own right.
</p>

<a name="50307-59_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>The place to deal with those issues is the prospectus rather than the Bill. It gives the scope to local authorities that we seek to give in the whole of the legislation, so I hope that the noble Lord will feel that that is a proper response to the issues that he probed and that he can withdraw the amendment.

As everyone will gather, I am not much in favour of the Bill anyway. I support the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley&#151;some blue-sky thinking on how we tackle the issues might be rather better. If we are to have this legislation, it might be best left to local authorities. However, I repeat that the cost of collecting very small amounts of money can be prohibitive. Local authorities will have to find various ways of doing it, otherwise people will be faced with large bills, which will not be very desirable in terms of affordability from the point of view of a lot of parents.

<p><a name="st_122"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendments Nos. 15 and 28 are fairly straightforward in their intent. They attempt to set out, with some clarity, what expenditure on the schemes can be used for. Heading (a) in Amendment No. 28 is straightforward&#151;&quot;payment for transport arrangements&quot; should be covered by the Bill anyway. As for proposed new headings (b), (c) and (d), under existing regulations, where a walking route to school is not safe, pupils are entitled to free transport. It would be a worthy use of some of the expenditure on the scheme, and perhaps of any revenue derived from charging, to improve the safety of walking routes to schools; we touched on that when I talked about my roundabouts early on. The work could be done by improving street lighting or with the installation of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC238"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column GC238</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

new pedestrian crossings&#151;again, I remind the Committee of my roundabouts&#151;to enable children to cross the road safely.
</p>

<a name="50307-60_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>There are apparently plenty of examples from overseas. When the Transport Committee considered the Bill, it commented that in Denmark legislation requires there to be a safe route to school for every child, and it gives a definition of a safe route. The legislation says that if there is no such route, free bus transport must be provided. There is a real imperative for the relevant authorities in Denmark to invest in safe routes to reduce the cost of free school transport. That sounds a possible way of proceeding.
</p>

<a name="50307-60_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>So often the measures governing school transport arrangements that we talk about concern the hard assets that we can acquire, such as buses or other equipment that will facilitate children getting to school. However, there are also softer areas that we should consider. Greater resources could be made available for teaching or encouraging children to cycle safely to school. We talked about more people walking to school or encouraging things such as cycling proficiency tests. Such a step might help to reduce congestion in urban areas where children do not have free school transport, and where many journeys are undertaken by car. Cycling to school might be a way to reduce congestion&#151;we discussed that before, but I should like further comment on it&#151;and to help to make children healthier.

</p>

<a name="50307-60_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>I return to safe routes. One of my early jobs in local government was walking school routes. That has been going on for all my time in local government. My postbag contains as much about unsafe routes and parents wanting free school transport as anything else. Although the Minister does not believe it, we would need more than &#163;600 million in Essex to make the routes safe. We need to give much more thought to how to make routes safer and then encourage parents to use them&#151;or insist that they do. Invariably, when parents protest about routes, there is some truth to that and, when you walk them, you accept that children should not walk them. In this day and age, one is concerned about children walking in unlit areas, and so on, so I would like further comment on investment and how we are to encourage people to walk. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_123"></a>
<a name="50307-60_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   The amendment would ring-fence revenue from charges so that it was spent only on furthering the objectives of the scheme. The Government have made it clear in the draft prospectus, in our response to the report of the Education and Skills Select Committee and in another place&#151;my noble friend Lord Filkin also made it absolutely clear in terms on Second Reading&#151;that it is not, was never intended to be and will not be a cost-cutting exercise and that the relevant national authority would not approve a scheme that sought to treat it as such. It is just as well to put that in plain English on the record.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC239"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column GC239</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50307-60_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>The prospectus accompanying the Bill states categorically:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;LEAs are expected to fund schemes from resources already committed to funding school transport, together with any charges levied on pupils . . . existing funds must continue to support school travel, with budgets uprated each year in-line with comparable LEAs&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-60_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>and that all fare income must be invested in improved services. That absolutely ensures that all the monies with which we are dealing are used for those purposes.
</p>

<a name="50307-60_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>To ensure that that happens, scheme authorities will be obliged to produce annual reports for either the DfES or the National Assembly for Wales. Those reports will contain financial annexes, detailing the economics of the scheme. The reports will form part of the overall evaluation of schemes and will be published by the appropriate national authority.
</p>

<a name="50307-60_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>Amendment No. 15 is intended to achieve that aim by requiring in the Bill that revenue be spent on furthering scheme aims. It is doubtful whether it would achieve that aim, as an authority that sought to reduce its overall school transport expenditure could argue that it was indeed spending the revenue from charges on scheme aims but was merely reducing its previous school transport spend. The approach outlined in the prospectus will be more effective in achieving the objective sought through the amendment, which is common ground between us.
</p>

<a name="50307-60_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>Amendment No. 28 sets out a non-exhaustive list of categories that the noble Lord has envisaged expenditure under the scheme including. The <i>Travelling to School </i>action plan published by two departments refers to a number of sources of funding that can be and are deployed to further the aim of more sustainable travel to school, including Safe Routes to School. Incidentally, investment is already in place for the Safe Routes to School programme. The Department for Transport provides funding through the local transport plan, which was mentioned earlier.
</p>

<a name="50307-60_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>However, including safe routes in legislation would not necessarily be beneficial. It could well lead to endless litigation about what was and what was not safe. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, made comments about Essex that, in a way, illustrate that very point: people could well have differences of view that could end up in litigation if there was a basis in the Act for such litigation to be pursued.
</p>

<a name="50307-60_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>The critical thing is that it is plainly for the local authority to determine what it wants to do to encourage safety, whether providing new footpaths, cycle routes, changes in road layout, about which we talked earlier, traffic-calming, and so on.
</p>

<a name="50307-60_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>However, quite aside from that, it is certainly still the case that the monies raised and deployed under the Bill must be for the improvements that I illustrated earlier. Since December 2003, all local authorities in England have produced strategies showing how they would draw on a full range of local resources to support sustainable travel to school. In the prospectus, we state that we expect scheme applicants to build on <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC240"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column GC240</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

those strategies when putting together their scheme proposals and to set out what is being done to boost walking and cycling.
</p>

<a name="50307-60_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>We want scheme areas to use the new legislation to support arrangements that offer a range of good quality, cost-effective alternatives to the family car on the home-to-school journey. Schemes do not have to enhance bus travel&#151;they can focus in whole or in part on increasing cycling, car-sharing or walking&#151;but the fundamental principle is that the LEA will decide how best to find the right balance for its area.
</p>

<a name="50307-60_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>Those are the key points about the amendment. As I said, any revenue from the scheme will be dealt with as I described earlier. The prospectus is explicit about that: LEAs are expected to fund schemes from resources already committed to funding school transport, plus any charges levied on pupils.
</p>

<a name="50307-60_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>I hope that the noble Lord will agree that matters related to scheme expenditure are best handled through the prospectus. That secures the money in precisely the way that his amendment intends. I therefore ask him to consider withdrawing his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_124"></a>
<a name="50307-60_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   I thank the Minister for that response. The real problem is that there will be a limited amount of money if schemes go ahead. There will not be the money to invest on improving cycleways, crossings, and so on. They are very expensive. It might be cheaper to encourage more youngsters to go by bike, and you could work with the schools to do that, but given that most of the money will be sent directly to schools anyway and the LEAs will not get much in future, the real money will come from the highways budget.
</p>

<a name="50307-60_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>Whether one is developing new road schemes, town centre schemes or whatever, one wants to take into account how one can create safe routes for children. They are very expensive. I was not joking. In Essex, &#163;600 million would not go very far. To create a really safe route requires a lot of money. These days, you do not get much for &#163;2 million or &#163;3 million when creating cycleways, and so on. They are very expensive. I know, because I have to live with that all the time. It is nice to hear the Minister saying that &#163;600 million is a lot of money, but it is not when it comes to creating road schemes and so on.
</p>

<a name="50307-60_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>Therefore, although there will be no magic wand when a Conservative government is in power in a few weeks&#039; time&#151;they will not have the &#163;600 million either&#151;we may decide that getting to school is part of the overall education budget. At the moment, it is a bit of an add-on. We might decide that we need to fund schools to help the education budget. We may all have the principle wrong at the moment and need to rethink it. But the Bill does not do that, so that takes us back to blue-sky thinking. With that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_125"></a>
<a name="50307-61_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford </b>   moved Amendment No. 16:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>Page 2, line 36, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-61_para0"></a>
<p>&quot;(   )   The policy to be set out under sub-paragraph (1) shall not discriminate financially against parents of any child who attends his nearest religious denominational, Welsh language, specialist or other school as defined under the admission policy in force within the local education authority.&quot;
</p>




<p><a name="st_126"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendment No. 20. This also concerns charging and the amendment also relates to charging policy. It concerns of discrimination and, above all, is intended to ensure that where a child or its parents choose to attend a particular type of school&#151;whether a denominational, non-denominational, specialist or Welsh-language school&#151;that is not its nearest school, they should not have to pay just because they have exercised the right to choice.
</p>

<a name="50307-61_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>The issue has arisen several times and was considered at length by the Select Committee when the Bill was in draft form. Partly in response to the criticisms of the Select Committee and the European Committee on Human Rights, the prospectus before us contains useful words on the issue. Paragraph 36 states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>&quot;LEAs should pay careful attention to the impact of any charges on low income families whose parents adhere to a particular faith or philosophy, and who have expressed a preference for a particular school as a result of their religious of their philosophical beliefs (or in Wales because of the language of instruction) . . . The obligation not to discriminate in Article 14&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-61_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>of the European Convention on Human Rights&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>&quot;requires that where transport provision is made for pupils travelling to denominational schools it must also be made for pupils travelling to non-denominational schools to be educated in accordance with their parents&#039; secular convictions, and vice versa. Similarly, an LEA which provides free transport to an English speaking school where the school nearer to the child&#039;s home is a Welsh speaking school must also provide free transport to a Welsh speaking school for children who wish to attend such a school. We think that wherever possible, LEAs should ensure that transport arrangements support the religious, philosophical or linguistic preference parents express&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-61_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>That is clear about expressing a preference concerning denomination, philosophy or language. However, as we know, the choice agenda has been extended considerably. Both the Government and the Conservative Party are placing a great deal of emphasis on the rights of parents to choose schools for their children. The choice agenda applies especially to secondary schools and hospitals. It is argued that nothing improves performance better than a dose of competition. Therefore, not only are the Government encouraging a variety of different kinds of secondary school to develop with different specialities&#151;voluntary-aided, academies, city technology colleges, denominational and non-denominational&#151;as set out in the five-year strategy, they are also positively encouraging parents to shop around and promising that popular schools will be allowed to expand and unpopular schools to wither on the vine.
</p>

<a name="50307-61_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>So choice is now a key dynamic of the system. Paragraph 4 of the new schedule incorporated in the Bill states in all innocence that a school travel scheme <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC242"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column GC242</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

will set out the charging policy and that any protected child shall not be charged. Paragraph 7 helpfully tells us that a protected child is one where Section 512ZB(4) of the Education Act 1996 applies. The Explanatory Notes are extremely helpful here, because they tell us that that means children who are eligible for free school lunches and free school milk. In other words, charges shall not be made to low-income families.
</p>

<a name="50307-61_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>However, extraordinarily, paragraph 13 of the Explanatory Notes states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>&quot;No charge may be made under the scheme for travel arrangements for children from low income families, unless the child has been given an opportunity to attend a suitable school closer to his home but chooses to attend one further afield&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-61_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>That poses an interesting issue and explains Amendment No. 20, because we must ask, &quot;What is a suitable school?&quot; Who says what is a suitable school? If we take the choice agenda at face value, surely a suitable school must be any school that the parents choose for their children.
</p>

<a name="50307-61_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>If a suitable school is any school that the parents choose under the choice agenda, does that mean that a low-income parent has a right to send their child to any school that they choose without any charge being made, or does only choice apply?
<a name="time_11"></a>
<a name="50307-61_time0"></a><h5>7.15 p.m.</h5>

</p>

<a name="50307-61_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>That is the issue at the root of the amendment. Does choice apply only to the middle classes who can afford to take their children further afield? Is choice restricted for low-income families only to denominational and non-denominational schools? It seems that there is some inconsistency between the prospectus and the Explanatory Notes and I should be glad if the Minister could explain the apparent contradiction between the explanations. I would also be glad if the Minister would precisely define a &quot;suitable school&quot;. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_127"></a>
<a name="50307-61_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   I shall deal with this briefly, because many of the substantive arguments were raised under the group of Amendments Nos. 9, 12, 22 and 24. They are arguments which my noble friend Lord Filkin has already put to the Grand Committee.
</p>

<a name="50307-61_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>There are some additional problems with this amendment. It does not define &quot;financial discrimination&quot;, which is a term that is sufficiently vague and uncertain in legal terms to make the provisions of the amendment unenforceable. The amendment would leave scheme authorities uncertain about what their charging policies should be. It would leave the Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales uncertain about whether schemes submitted to them could be approved. Whether the amendment is workable or not is a material issue.
</p>

<a name="50307-61_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>I turn to the more specific points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp of Guildford. I shall repeat in summary some of the points that have been made. First, we have accepted that pupils attending denominational schools and Welsh-medium schools are likely to make longer journeys than their peers who attend their neighbourhood community, or in Wales, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC243"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column GC243</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

English-medium community school. We accept that that is a reality. However, we have also said that LEAs are not under an obligation to provide transport to Welsh-medium schools unless the school is the child&#039;s nearest suitable school and outside statutory walking distance. Therefore, that is a discretionary provision.
</p>

<a name="50307-61_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>Parents can exercise preference so that their children can attend denominational schools&#151;and in those cases local education authorities have no obligation to provide transport, unless the school is the child&#039;s nearest suitable school and outside statutory walking distance. Some LEAs provide free or subsidised transport in those cases, but by no means all do, and they all take their own decisions about whether they wish to do that or not. That remains the case in relation to the points that have been made regarding the amendment.
</p>

<a name="50307-61_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>The cardinal point in relation to the amendment is that the prospectus makes it clear that where provision is made for pupils travelling to denominational schools, it must also be made for pupils travelling to non-denominational schools to be educated in accordance with their parents&#039; philosophical beliefs. Similar conditions will apply to Welsh and English-medium schools in Wales. That point was drawn out by the Joint Committee on Human Rights in its scrutiny of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50307-61_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>The effect of this is that, if concessions are made for pupils travelling to denominational schools for religious reasons, concessions must also be made for pupils travelling to community schools because their parents hold strong philosophical beliefs. We are talking about all pupils in all those circumstances having exactly the same rights, irrespective of cost and whether it would achieve the objectives of the Bill. It would make the Bill extremely difficult to operate.
</p>

<a name="50307-61_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>Two-thirds of secondary schools have already achieved specialist status, including many rural schools. We believe that we are well on the way to achieving our aim of all secondary schools reaching specialist school standard by 2008. Therefore, in the circumstances, it is unlikely to be a barrier to choice in many respects. Although they will be more widely distributed in a rural area, it will be perfectly possible for parents to make that choice.
</p>

<a name="50307-61_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>It cannot be right that, because they make that choice&#151;and all will have the opportunity to make that choice&#151;everyone should receive subsidised transport. We cannot accept that it is reasonable to use limited public funds to provide a guarantee in law for LEAs to transport children to a specialist school some distance from home when a place in another, closer school is available, unless parents want to exercise that decision and deal with the financial consequences.
</p>

<a name="50307-61_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>For low-income families, we have made it clear that LEAs should be careful to avoid discrimination that objectively can not be justified. Beyond that, we feel that LEAs are best placed to consult on and put in place arrangements which are fairer and which cater for more pupils than the current inadequate system. That is why the amendment is unnecessary.

<a name="50307-61_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>I should like to respond to questions that I was asked concerning the meaning of particular words. I was asked the definition of a child&#039;s nearest suitable school. It is the nearest maintained school, providing education suitable for the child&#039;s age, ability and aptitude and any special educational needs that he might have. That is in the DfES guidance. It reflects Section 7 of the 1996 Act.
</p>

<a name="50307-61_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>I should add that a recent High Court case has established that arrangements to provide transport to an unsuitable school cannot be &quot;suitable arrangements&quot;. If there were circumstances in which someone was directed to a school that was unsuitable in terms of the definition that I have just provided, those would not be suitable transport arrangements. So there is an additional protection on which the courts have decided.

It seems absurd for the Government to pretend that they are offering the choice agenda to all parents and then to withdraw it from those who cannot afford to pay for transport facilities to a school that they would like their children to attend.
</p>




<p><a name="st_129"></a>
<a name="50307-62_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   Perhaps I may respond briefly to the noble Baroness. It is clear that local education authorities frequently propose area-wide concessionary schemes to facilitate transport to schools of parental preference. They have precisely understood the problem. That is the question that we are asking them to address because they understand the needs of their area and they are finding the right answers to it.
</p>

<a name="50307-62_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>Alongside that, my fundamental point is straightforward. If every child should be paid for in all circumstances, which would be the consequence of the amendment, that should be the matter that is being put to us.
</p>




<p><a name="st_130"></a>
<a name="50307-62_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   I do not know that that is the consequence of the amendment.

those in the Explanatory Notes; they seem to be in direct contradiction to each other. For the moment, I shall look hard at what he said and what was said on Amendment No. 9 and see whether I can make any sense of it at all. For the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_131"></a>
<a name="50307-62_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield </b>   moved Amendment No. 17:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>Page 2, line 36, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50307-62_para3"></a>
<p>&quot;(3)   The policy to be set out under sub-paragraph (1) shall include details of concessionary fares including, but not limited to, the following categories&#151;
</p>

<a name="50307-62_para4"></a>
<p>(a)   a child who is part of a family with two or more siblings,
</p>

<a name="50307-62_para5"></a>
<p>(b)   a child who is not treated as a protected child under paragraph 7(1) below, but whose family income is less than the average family income for the scheme&#039;s authority area, and
</p>

<a name="50307-62_para6"></a>
<p>(c)   a child whose current transport costs are covered by a discretionary fare scheme.
</p>

<a name="50307-62_para7"></a>
<p>(4)   Where a concessionary fare scheme is not in place to cover a child in any of the categories in sub-paragraph (3) above, a statement shall be included in the policy explaining why such arrangements have not been made.&quot;
</p>




<p><a name="st_132"></a>The noble Lord said: We are covering much of the same territory&#151;this amendment is similar to one that we debated a short time ago. It is designed to provide clarity about concessionary fares in documents produced by the scheme authority.
</p>

<a name="50307-62_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>Amendment No. 17 effectively attempts to introduce safeguards for large families, who may not be able to shoulder the burden of transportation charges for their children, as we have discussed already. The number of children in a family should be taken into account when developing the charges for a transport scheme. An example is families who have a child at university as well as one in primary and one in secondary school. Should they have to pay the full charges for the school transportation, given that they are already paying a contribution towards the child at university? Families with two or more children in primary or secondary school should perhaps be charged a concessionary fare for the transportation of their children.
</p>

<a name="50307-62_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>The amendment also maintains the standards for children whose transportation costs are currently covered by a discretionary fare scheme. The introduction of a new transport scheme should not affect any arrangements already made for the transportation of a pupil. When we have wanted to do something difficult in introducing a new scheme, it has often been done for new entrants into a school rather than affecting young people and their existing costs.
</p>

<a name="50307-62_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>We need to ensure that when authorities introduce a scheme&#151;particularly when the scheme is under consultation&#151;they make their concessionary policies clear to families in the area. We have said it before&#151;everything should be transparent. That goes back to the explanation of the scheme to parents.

<a name="50307-62_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>This is a moment to mention one thing that I have not yet mentioned today; I would not necessarily expect an immediate answer. At the moment, local authorities are funded in the revenue support grant for the transport that they are obliged to provide. With the likely removal of the mileage limits for children, how will the revenue support grant affect local authorities? One would not expect it to be affected for some years until the schemes are worked through.
</p>

<a name="50307-62_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>This is probably the last amendment for today, and I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_133"></a>
<a name="50307-62_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   I expect that it is the last one today. The amendment is complex and I shall cover the ground by dealing with it in three parts. Let me start with the general position in relation to concessionary fares for children and young people. Secondly, I want to talk about the proposals for charges. Finally, I shall deal with the three categories of child listed in the amendment.
</p>

<a name="50307-62_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>The first point to make is that concessionary fare schemes stem from transport rather than education legislation. Outside London, and in Wales, the passenger transport executives&#151;PTEs&#151;and local authorities have discretionary powers under Section 93 of the Transport Act 1985 to offer concessionary travel for young people in full-time education. There is a range of provision for schoolchildren and young people which usually covers journeys in general and not just the home-to-school journey. In some cases, concessions cover travel by train, metro, tram and ferry as well as by bus.
</p>

<a name="50307-62_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>In the shires, decisions on concessionary fares are made by unitary and district councils, whereas in the metropolitan areas it is the PTAs, through their PTEs, which cover the entire metropolitan area.
</p>

<a name="50307-62_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>In London, children&#039;s fares are set by Transport for London&#151;guided by the Mayor&#151;and discounts are available for young people up to their 18th birthday. Children under 11 currently travel free and the Mayor intends to extend this to under 16s by September this year.
</p>

<a name="50307-62_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>In the shire areas, discounted fares are often offered by private sector bus operators as a matter of commercial policy. There may be restrictions on use, usually non-availability during the morning peak. There is no local authority involvement in these arrangements.
</p>

<a name="50307-62_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>I hope that that explanation has demonstrated that there is a great deal of variety in concessionary fare arrangements around the country. In many cases, they are either set on a commercial basis or else decided by transport authorities in a way that caters for transport in general rather than focusing on the school run.
</p>

<a name="50307-62_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>Let us look at that in relation to charging. The Bill will allow local education authorities to make charges for school transport, but of course it then provides that where a child is a &quot;protected child&quot; travel must be free. Where a child is not a protected child, we anticipate that the LEAs will continue to charge pupils for whom they provide transport now, where there is no <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC247"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column GC247</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

statutory requirement to do so, and to make small, affordable charges for transport provided to pupils who at present receive free school transport.
</p>

<a name="50307-62_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>The prospectus requires LEAs to set out their charging policies, making it clear how many pupils will be charged, in what circumstances and how much. Charges must be affordable and pitched at a level that does not produce an increase in car journeys to school.
</p>

<a name="50307-62_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>In England, pupils eligible for free school meals will be protected from charges provided that they attend their nearest suitable school. In Wales, the criteria for protection from charges will be set by the National Assembly for Wales in regulations. The Welsh Assembly government intend to lay regulations before the Assembly so that pupils eligible for free school meals and pupils whose parents are in receipt of working tax credit but with an annual income below the income tax threshold for child tax credit will be protected.
</p>

<a name="50307-62_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>The prospectus asks scheme authorities to pay careful attention to the effect of charges on low income working families and large families and records that there is a particularly strong case for exempting the fourth or subsequent child of compulsory school age from charges, especially in low income families.
</p>

<a name="50307-62_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>I turn to the three categories of children referred to in the amendment. With respect to children who are part of a family with two or more siblings, the amendment would require the LEAs to detail the effect of concessionary fares for these children. I presume that the amendment is intended to tease out whether there are arrangements for large families where three or more children are of compulsory school age, although this is not quite what it says.
</p>

<a name="50307-62_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>It is highly unlikely that concessionary fares would differentiate between children in different size families as there is no mechanism to do this cost effectively. We do, through the prospectus, encourage LEAs to consider offering lower, or no, charges to families with four or more siblings attending school.
</p>

<a name="50307-62_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>The second category of pupil referred to in the amendment is a child who is not &quot;protected&quot; but who is drawn from a family with below average family income for the authority&#039;s area. There are a number of difficulties with this proposition, which I will set out briefly.
</p>

<a name="50307-62_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>First, there is no mechanism for LEAs to obtain income details for families in their area, so it would be difficult to determine what the average family income was.
</p>

<a name="50307-62_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>Secondly, a family&#039;s needs depends to some extent on family size, as larger families need more income to sustain the same standard of living as smaller families and it seems unfair to penalise them through looking at average family income.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC248"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column GC248</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50307-62_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>Thirdly, average incomes vary greatly from place to place and the greatest concentrations of poverty are in inner city areas, although there are in some rural areas. However, generally speaking, most rural areas are relatively more affluent than the poorer inner city areas.
</p>

<a name="50307-62_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>The last category mentioned was children whose current transport costs are covered by a discretionary fare scheme. I assume that the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, is referring to children travelling to denominational schools, to schools which are within the statutory walking distances, or to other schools which are not the &quot;nearest suitable&quot; to which the LEA makes discretionary travel arrangements, about which I so irritated the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, a moment ago.
</p>

<a name="50307-62_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>We can see that there are good arguments for including information about the charges they currently bear and what charges will be in future scheme applications and we will amend the prospectus to achieve this. I hope that that will meet what I have been asked to do in the amendment.
</p>

<a name="50307-62_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>The amendment suggests that where a concessionary fare scheme is not in place to cover a child falling into the three specified categories, an explanation should be provided as to why not.
</p>

<a name="50307-62_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>I hope that Members of the Committee will agree that given the number of bodies dealing with the concessionary fare schemes and the ability of commercial operators to change them from time to time without reference to anyone other than their own internal management, it would be impractical to do some of the things that are suggested.
</p>

<a name="50307-62_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>Given that the prospectus, which will be placed on a statutory footing, contains a requirement for scheme applicants to spell out their charging schemes in detail, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment. We will certainly look at the revenue support grant issue and write as soon as possible on that.

<p><a name="st_134"></a>
<a name="50307-63_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   The last point I raised is very important because local authorities will want to know how the scheme will affect the revenue support grant. I shall be interested to have a response from the Minister on that.
</p>

<a name="50307-63_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>The Minister did not mention that when bus operators offer concessionary schemes, often the routes have been subsidised by local authorities. There is therefore some benefit. Local authorities often subsidise bus routes so that bus firms can offer children&#039;s fares. That is a double cost to the local authority because it is already supporting the route.
</p>

<a name="50307-63_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>There are many complicated issues on which we have already touched relating to youngsters already receiving discretionary fares. When do you start charging them and when do you stop them? One often finds that a desirable time to start charging is when there are new entrants into a school or when pupils change schools. One should not start sending large <br>&nbsp;<br>

bills when pupils are already in school and receive bills which they did not expect to have to pay. This issue arises throughout this part of the legislation.
</p>

<a name="50307-63_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Finance Act 2004: Pre-owned Asset Regulations</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="50307-63_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport  (Lord McIntosh of Haringey): </b>  My right honourable friend the Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement
</p>

<a name="50307-63_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a>Schedule 15 to the Finance Act 2004 provides for an income tax charge on the benefit that taxpayers gain,   in certain circumstances, from the continuing enjoyment of assets they formerly owned. The primary legislation leaves some matters&#151;the operative date for valuations, and the rates of return which apply for purposes of the schedule&#151;to be specified in secondary legislation. They also allow regulations to provide for assets to be valued less frequently than annually. More generally, they enable regulations to make further exemptions from the charge set out in Schedule 15.
</p>

<a name="50307-63_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>The Inland Revenue issued a consultative document on 18 August 2004 <i>Taxation of Pre-Owned Assets: Further Consultation</i> seeking views on the matters to be covered by regulations. There was a full and constructive response and I am grateful to all who took part. We propose to make regulations as follows, having regard to the responses received.



<a name="wms_st_2"></a></p>

<a name="50307-63_para8"></a>
<p><i>Valuation date</i>


</p>

<a name="50307-63_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><i>As proposed in our consultation document, the valuation date for a tax year will be 6 April in the year or, if later, the beginning of the &quot;taxable period&quot; for which the asset in question first becomes chargeable.</i>



<a name="wms_st_3"></a></p>

<a name="50307-63_para10"></a>
<p><i>The &quot;prescribed rate&quot;</i>


</p>

<a name="50307-63_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><i>The &quot;prescribed rate&quot; (to be applied to the values of chattels and intangible assets when quantifying the cash value of the benefit enjoyed) will be equal to the &quot;official rate&quot; of interest, as defined in Section 181 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003. The rate is currently 5 per cent.</i>







<a name="wms_st_4"></a></p>

<a name="50307-63_para12"></a>
<p><i>Valuations at extended intervals</i>


</p>

<a name="50307-63_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a>Regulations will provide, broadly, that land and chattels will be valued every five years. That is to say, a valuation will be made as prescribed in the primary legislation for the first tax year in which a particular asset becomes chargeable under Schedule 15. That valuation will also be used in any of the four succeeding years in which a charge arises.
</p>

<a name="50307-63_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a>If a charge arises in the fifth year after the first chargeable year, a fresh valuation will be made which will apply in the next four succeeding years, and so on    for years 10, 15 and subsequent five-year anniversaries. If no charge arises for the fifth year, or any later five-year anniversary, no valuation need be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS24"></a>

<b>7 Mar 2005 : Column WS24</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

made until the next tax year (if any) for which a charge arises, and a fresh series of five-yearly valuations will start from that year.
</p>

<a name="50307-63_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a>Valuations will be carried forward in cash terms without adjustment (e.g. for indexation against asset price inflation, as the enabling power would permit).

<a name="wms_st_5"></a></p>

<a name="50307-63_para16"></a>
<p><i>Equity release</i>


</p>

<a name="50307-63_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a>Schedule 15 provides exemption for any case where the former owner continues to enjoy an asset they have sold, so long as they have disposed of their whole interest in it (apart from the right of continuing enjoyment) and have done so either at arm&#039;s length or on arm&#039;s length terms.
</p>

<a name="50307-63_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a>It became clear in consultation that this was not sufficient to accommodate all open-market equity release transactions, under which homeowners often sell only a part share in their property. I made clear last autumn that regulations under Schedule 15 would cover the full range of <i>bona fide </i>equity-release schemes with arm&#039;s length providers, while continuing to bear down on schemes aimed at avoidance. With that in mind, we do not in general think it is appropriate to provide exemption for sales of a part interest which are made otherwise than at arm&#039;s length. If one member of a family needs to raise cash and another member of the family is willing and able to provide it, there are other and more straightforward ways of structuring this than adopting the form of an equity release transaction.
</p>

<a name="50307-63_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a>The point was, however, made in consultation that some intra-family part disposals can arise from patterns of behaviour adopted for good family or business reasons; for example, where a child moves in to care for an aged parent and acquires an equitable interest in their shared home as a corollary of that, or where younger members of a family take over the active role in a family partnership, and in doing so acquire an interest from the partners who preceded them. We also accept that any cases where asset owners have already sold a part interest within their family are unlikely, given the law as it stood at the time, to have chosen that approach primarily for tax avoidance purposes.
</p>

<a name="50307-63_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a>Bringing together these different considerations, the regulations will extend the existing exemption (described above) to all sales done at arm&#039;s length where they involve the whole or a part of the vendor&#039;s interest in their asset. They will extend this exemption to any part sale, even if not at arm&#039;s length, so long as it was made before today and on arm&#039;s length terms. This will also apply to future disposals if they are made for a consideration other than money or readily realisable assets.
</p>

<a name="50307-63_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a>Regulations to this effect will be made shortly, in time to take effect from the commencement of the new charge on 6 April. The Inland Revenue will also be publishing its guidance on the interpretation and operation of Schedule 15, it will be announced and made available at www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk

<a name="50307-63_spmin2"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Hewitt) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="50307-63_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a>My department today published a consultation document on the implementation of Directive 2000/52/EC amending the directive on the transparency of financial relations between member states and public undertakings. The objective of the directive as amended is to increase the transparency of funding given by government and other public sector bodies to other bodies operating in the market place and which may be in receipt of state aid. The directive&#039;s provisions will improve the Commission&#039;s ability to investigate potentially illegal state aid, including allegations of over-compensation for performing a public service obligation or the cross-subsidisation of public funds into other commercial activities.
</p>

<a name="50307-63_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a>A key objective of the consultation exercise is to gather information on which organisations are likely to be caught by the directive and whether and to what extent there may already be provisions in place that would meet the requirements of the directive, so that we can best judge how to implement it. However, the department&#039;s initial conclusion is that legislation may well be necessary to ensure full implementation of the directive. The consultation document therefore also seeks views on draft regulations.

These include a full-time engineering sector manager, who is based in Montserrat. DfID internal audit systems are also applied as appropriate. The procurement practices of DfID and the government of Montserrat are regularly reviewed to ensure effectiveness and value for money. For example, the government of Montserrat&#039;s practices were recently assessed by independent specialists as part of a wider review of Montserrat&#039;s budget system; and the European Commission has examined them as part of its process of administering allocations to Montserrat from the European Development Fund.

<p><a name="wa_st_15"></a>
<a name="50307w02_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   Working through its mission to the UN in New York, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) co-operates closely with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) on the role civilian policing plays in UN peace support operations (PSOs). Already a key element of PSOs, we are working proactively to ensure civilian policing needs are considered at all stages of the establishment of a mission, including pre-mission needs assessment, definition and development of mandates, intelligence gathering, rapid deployment&#151;on which we await further information on the DPKO&#039;s proposal to establish a standing civilian policing capability and pre-deployment training. In particular, we strongly support the DPKO&#039;s efforts to develop integrated mission planning, combining three closely interconnected pillars of the criminal justice system&#151;police, judiciary and penal institutions. To that end, a UK secondee to the DPKO helped in the development of a handbook on integrated planning last year.
</p>

<a name="50307w02_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_9"></a>At an operational level, the UK contributes police officers to two UN missions, with 93 officers currently deployed to UNMIK (Kosovo) and six to UNAMSIL (Sierra Leone). Building on our commitment to the 2000 Brahimi Report on Peacekeeping Operations, we support the development of other member states&#039; international civilian policing capability, and have to date delivered 11 &quot;Train the Trainer&quot; courses around the world. We are also in the process of developing a G8 initiative to help build African civilian policing capability. In addition, we continue to play an active role in the development and delivery of civilian police standardised training module workshops to assist in the training of military and police officers who are likely to serve in specialised functions in PSOs.
</p>

<a name="50307w02_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_10"></a>As far as the UK&#039;s own civilian policing contribution is concerned, the FCO is leading cross-Whitehall and Police Service consultation aimed at improving the UK&#039;s approach to international policing, and better prioritising and strengthening our response to calls for contributions from the UN and other international organisations. A strategic task force is expected to submit recommendations to Ministers in July 2005.

<p><a name="wa_st_17"></a>
<a name="50307w03_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   The Government welcome the high level panel&#039;s proposal to establish a peacebuilding commission at the United Nations (UN) and look forward to agreement on this proposal at the Millennium Review Summit.
</p>

<a name="50307w03_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_11"></a>The high level panel identified an important shortcoming in the international community&#039;s ability to take concerted action to prevent conflict and build peace. A peacebuilding commission, bringing together UN member states and agencies and a broader set of international institutions and regional partners to share analysis and plans, could strengthen our collective ability to deliver earlier and better conflict prevention, management and resolution.
</p>

<a name="50307w03_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_12"></a>At this stage, we envisage the peacebuilding commission playing an advisory role at the strategic level to ensure coherent, integrated and sustained international engagement in a country or region. It could also provide a forum to address cross-cutting issues relating to peacebuilding.
</p>

<a name="50307w03_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_13"></a>We will be considering carefully the views of our UN partners on issues such as how to achieve an appropriate membership of the commission, the relationship between the peacebuilding commission and the Security Council, and how to take forward the idea of a peacebuilding support office within the UN Secretariat.

<a name="50307w03_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   We support the work of the high level panel, and welcome the emphasis given to human rights issues. In particular, we welcome the proposals to improve links between the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Security Council/Peacebuilding Commission, and to increase the Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights&#039; funding from the regular budget. On the other recommendations, our position is as follows:
</p>

<a name="50307w03_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_14"></a>Universalising membership of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR): this could potentially remove accusations of lack of representation, and the need for divisive elections. But we are not convinced it would address issues of legitimacy. And we would need to consider how this would work in practice, to ensure it would not have a counter-productive effect on the overall handling of human rights in the UN system.
</p>

<a name="50307w03_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_15"></a>Human rights figures to head CHR delegations: we agree with the principle that there should be human rights expertise throughout CHR delegations. However, it is for governments to send who they wish&#151;many governments will wish to keep their head of delegation as a government representative.
</p>

<a name="50307w03_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_16"></a>Advisory council or panel to advise the CHR on country-specific issues and thematic mandates: the UK would like to see more detail on this. It would be important that this does not duplicate the current CHR sub-commission.
</p>

<a name="50307w03_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_17"></a>The Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights&#039; annual report on the situation of human rights worldwide: we welcome the aim of providing a neutral and objective basis for discussion at the CHR. However, this should not be seen as a substitute for country action, but an objective basis on which the UN can choose to take action.

<p><a name="wa_st_20"></a>
<a name="50307w03_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   The high level panel report makes suggestions to increase the authority of the United Nations Secretary-General and to increase resources available to him. We generally support these, in line with our overall objective for more transparent and efficient human resource management in the United Nations (UN). The Secretary-General needs to have powers to redeploy staff and resources to deliver the objectives that the international community sets for the UN.
</p>

<a name="50307w03_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_18"></a>We are still considering the proposals for increased staffing at the secretariat.

</p>

<a name="50307w03_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   The recent report of the United Nations Secretary-General&#039;s high level panel has recommended the deletion of the provision for a military staff committee in Article 47 of the United Nations Charter. The Government would support this change as part of a package of amendments to the United Nations charter, as the staff committee has never functioned as envisaged.
</p>

<a name="50307w03_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_20"></a>The United Nations charter gives the Secretary-General the power to bring matters to the attention of the Security Council where he believes that there is a threat to international peace and security. He also provides analysis to the council of situations which are already on its agenda. It is clearly vital that the secretariat should have the capability to provide accurate analysis to the Secretary-General to underpin these responsibilities. The High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change recommended that the secretariat&#039;s capacity should be strengthened in this area, and that responsibility for such analysis and information should rest with a second Deputy Secretary-General. We support the panel&#039;s view that the secretariat&#039;s performance in this area could be strengthened, and we look forward to the Secretary-General&#039;s response in his report on implementing the high level panel&#039;s recommendations in March.

We support the development of such principles as a tool to assist the Security Council in deciding when to authorise the use of force. We also note that the high level panel identifies that the Security Council needs to be more proactive in dealing with threats and that in certain circumstances force may be justified not just reactively, but preventively.

Only two out of 64 articles of the original text have been agreed, and there are alternative proposals on the table for much of the remaining text. The issue has therefore been one of discussion and negotiation, not signature. However, we were encouraged by the progress made in negotiations in the September and November/December 2004 working group sessions. We will continue to work with UN partners and indigenous representatives to reach agreement on a strong and meaningful declaration.

<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_37"></a>Whether they consider that media coverage of certain football matches as &quot;grudge fixtures&quot; has increased crowd trouble at recent games; and how they will work with the Football Association to prevent the return of football-related violence.

<p><a name="wa_st_35"></a>
<a name="50307w05_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal:  </b>  Football disorder will not be tolerated. Tough legislation is in place and targeted and public order policing operations will continue to identify troublemakers for banning order purposes. The Home Office works closely with the police, football authorities and fans in taking forward a comprehensive multi-agency strategy designed to minimise the threat of English football disorder at home and overseas. That strategy is working and football stadia in England and Wales are now among the safest and most secure in the world. There was a 10 per cent. decrease in the number of football related arrests last season with, on average, fewer than two arrests inside and outside of grounds at each match. Statistics for the current season show a continuing decline in the number of football-related arrests and incidents. However, there is no complacency. Football disorder may have been marginalised but it has not been eradicated. Clearly some matches pose a higher than average degree of risk due to local and other rivalries. These matches are easy to predict and there is nothing to suggest that the level of risk is significantly increased by media coverage.

<a name="50307w06_wqn7"></a><b> Lord Kilclooney </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_48"></a>Whether (a) United Kingdom; (b) European Union; and (c) United States official trade delegations now fly into Ercan airport in Turkish Northern Cyprus; and whether the isolation of Northern Cyprus is likely to decrease following the general election there on 20 February.   [HL1451]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_46"></a>
<a name="50307w06_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   I am unable to comment on whether official trade delegations from the EU or the US now fly into Ercan Airport in the north of Cyprus, but I can confirm that no official UK trade delegations have done so.
</p>

<a name="50307w06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_32"></a>The EU has already made clear its determination to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots. We support this and believe that it will make a Cyprus settlement more likely, less costly and easier to consolidate&#151;something that is undoubtedly in the interests of all Cypriots.
</p>

<a name="50307w06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_33"></a>The Government&#039;s objective remains the reunification of Cyprus, and we continue to support all efforts to achieve this aim in a manner that is fair, viable and lasting for the benefit of all Cypriots. We therefore welcome the continued strong support for settlement and re-unification among Turkish Cypriots as reflected in the outcome of their elections on 20 February.

<p><a name="wa_st_47"></a>
<a name="50307w07_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   During the course of 2005, the EU intends to hold human rights sub-committees with all Mediterranean partner countries that have a functioning association agreement: Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Israel and Egypt. Once the EU-Lebanon and EU-Algeria association agreements are ratified, similar structures will come into force. During our EU presidency, we will co-chair any sub-committees that fall under our presidency with the Commission. We also look forward to co-hosting with Spain the Euro-Med 10th anniversary event, scheduled to take place in Barcelona in November.

<a name="50307w07_wqn1"></a><b> Lord Dykes  </b> asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_50"></a>Whether they have assessed the extent to which the principles of equality in geo-strategic relations between the European Union and the United States have been accepted by President Bush on his current visit to the European Union&#039;s institutions and heads of government in Brussels.   [HL1505]</p></ul>



<p><a name="wa_st_49"></a>
<a name="50307w07_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   The visit of President Bush to Europe, so early in his second term, confirmed the importance he attaches to the transatlantic alliance. All leaders agreed on the need for the EU and US to continue to work in partnership on the challenges that face us in the 21st century. As President Bush himself said in his speech in Brussels on 21 February, our strong friendship is essential to peace and prosperity across the globe.

</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_51"></a>In which countries they believe that slavery is still in existence.   [HL1514]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_50"></a>
<a name="50307w07_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   We do not maintain a comprehensive list of countries we think are involved in slavery, either as traditionally understood or in contemporary forms, including people trafficking, child labour and bonded labour. But we do address these issues in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Annual Report on Human Rights, which highlights a number of countries where we have particular concerns and describes the actions we are taking in response. Copies of the report are laid before the House and are available in the Library of the House, and may also be found on the FCO website, www.fco.gov.uk.
