a firm supporter of the European Court of Human Rights. Guaranteeing
its effectiveness is a priority for the United Kingdom. The review of
the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, the ratification of Protocol 14
and the report of the Wise Persons Group should all help in alleviating
the problems of the court. There will be financial implications, but we
will seek to meet these through savings in the overall Council of

Russell-Johnston:</b> My Lords, the Minister will, I
am sure, know that, as of this morning, there were 85,000 outstanding
cases with the European Court. That represents a crisis. I urge the
Minister not to follow the course of action that he has outlined of
raiding the already inadequate Council of Europe budget to provide the
necessary resources for the court to do its work. Does the Minister
agree that both bodies do an enormously valuable job and that one
should not suffer for the
other?</p><p><a name="06071361000015"></a><b><a name="06071361001771"></a>Lord
Triesman:</b> My Lords, in working
through all the issues of European budgets in the last set of
negotiations in the settlement, we were clear that there ought to be a
realistic constraint on the spending of European institutions. We were
at the forefront of the efforts to do that, and we are committed to
zero real spending on the Council of the Europe. None the less, in 2006
it amounted to a shade under &#163;20 million. We think that there
are grounds for believing that there are credible savings in that
budget.</p><p><a name="06071361000016"></a><b><a name="06071361001772"></a>Lord
Goodhart:</b> My Lords, does the Minister recognise
that the European Court of Human Rights plays a vital role in justice
in the United Kingdom because it is the final arbiter on the
interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights? In those
circumstances, does the Minister agree that it is essential to have
improved funding and that the Government should press for a new
protocol to the European convention that would make it easier to sift
out the considerable number of unjustifiable
cases?</p><notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_820"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 820</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071361000017"></a><b><a name="06071361001773"></a>Lord
Triesman:</b> My Lords, I have nothing to add to the
point about the financing. I have answered the House on that, whether
my Answer satisfied noble Lords or not, but our view on zero real
growth in the funding of this budget head should not suggest that we do
not think that the court plays a valuable role as the final arbiter or
that we are not committed to seeing it deal properly and effectively
with the kind of cases that are brought before it. It is the primary
protector of human rights in Europe. We will certainly take our part in
discussions on any measures that help it to behave efficiently and make
sure that the cases that come before it are the critical
ones.</p><p><a name="06071361000018"></a><b><a name="06071361001774"></a>Lord
Slynn of Hadley:</b> My Lords, does
the Minister consider that the structural changes introduced some years
ago, in particular the abolition of the commission, have been an
advantage or a disadvantage from a financial point of view and from the
point of view of the working and efficiency of the European Court of
Human
Rights?</p><p><a name="06071361000019"></a><b><a name="06071361001775"></a>Lord
Triesman:</b> My Lords, it is hard to imagine that it
has been entirely an advantage because, as has been said, the number of
cases backed up is considerable. Without question, there are
efficiencies to be achieved, but it is also true that some of those who
have recently come within the overview of the court&#151;for example,
from Russia&#151;have produced a vast number of cases that they could
never have brought under the old regime and, arguably, through domestic
courts in Russia at present. That has produced a huge increase. Perhaps
the court and the whole system will need to adjust to those changes.
Throwing more money at it is unlikely to be the
solution.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06071361000005"></a>Crown

My Lords, prosecutors have an
essential responsibility in putting victims at the heart of the
criminal justice system. A number of steps have been taken to make that
a reality. The prosecutors&#146; pledge makes a series of specific
commitments about the way in which prosecutors communicate with victims
of crime throughout the life of a case. A new Crown Prosecution Service

authorities have introduced similar
commitments.</p><p><a name="06071361000022"></a><b><a name="06071361001778"></a>Lord

case that ends up in court? The anti-social behaviour aspects of crime

significantly.</p><p><a name="06071361000023"></a><b><a name="06071361001779"></a>Lord
Goldsmith:</b> My Lords, I agree with my noble friend
that anti-social behaviour affects a large number of people. The most
serious crimes are very important, but they do not directly affect so
many. I agree that it is important to do all that we can to deal with
victims of that crime. Many of the initiatives that we have
introduced&#151;direct communication with victims, witness care
units, guidelines on acceptance of pleas and the victims&#146;
code&#151;take account of those issues. However, I will bear in mind
what he said about those

Hamilton of Epsom:</b> My Lords, the shareholders of
Enron could claim to be victims of crime. Will the noble and learned
Lord the Attorney-General tell us why the Crown Prosecution Service
chose not to prosecute the NatWest Three and to have them extradited to
the US to be prosecuted
there?</p><p><a name="06071361000025"></a><b><a name="06071361001781"></a>Lord
Goldsmith:</b> My Lords, the position, which has been
explained before, is that a decision was made by United States
prosecutors to investigate the matter. The allegation&#151;I
emphasise that it is an allegation and that nothing has been
proved&#151;was that there had been a conspiracy between three
British bankers and two co-conspirators who were Enron executives to
take a sum of money from Enron, which is alleged to be a total of $30
million, part of which went into the pockets of those three.</p><p><a name="06071361000026"></a>There was never any
complaint in this country to the SFO about that case. The United States
investigated and produced evidence in relation to the case and asked
for extradition. The British courts were then asked to review the
decision by the SFO not to prosecute. They looked at that in detail and
rejected the allegations. Therefore, the extradition goes
ahead.</p><p><a name="06071361000027"></a><b><a name="06071361001782"></a>Baroness
Gould of Potternewton:</b> My Lords, one group of
people who really are victims of crime are women who suffer from
domestic violence. My noble and learned friend will be aware of the
improvements that have been made, certainly since 1997, to counter it,
but could he indicate what further support and help will be given to
local police forces to counter what is still a very serious problem? It
is a problem that occurred very seriously throughout the period of the
World
Cup.</p><p><a name="06071361000028"></a><b><a name="06071361001783"></a>Lord
Goldsmith:</b> My Lords, I do not
know the statistics about the last point, but it would not entirely
surprise me if that were right. I agree with my noble friend that this
is an area on which we need to concentrate. A great deal has been done
to gear up our response to domestic violence. Local police forces have
been very much involved in that work. There are special co-ordinators
who deal with domestic violence, and the courts take a different
approach to it. I shall be happy to discuss with my noble friend
outside the Chamber the particular steps that she would like to be
taken, what more she would like to be done and whether that is
possible.</p><notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_822"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 822</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071361000029"></a><b><a name="06071361001784"></a>Lord

otherwise. I hope that noble Lords will think that I have at least
attempted while on my feet to deal with an issue that, I know, is of
public concern.</p><p><a name="06071361000031"></a>As the Prime
Minister announced in PMQs yesterday, I have spoken with my counterpart
in the United States to ask what their approach to bail is, and he has
confirmed to me that US prosecutors will not oppose bail for the three
individuals. There is the question of conditions for bail, which will
have to be set and which will be for the court to set or for them to
agree. That is all that I can tell the noble Lord at this stage. I hope
that the House will think it helpful that I have given that
information.</p><p><a name="06071361000032"></a><b><a name="06071361001786"></a>Lord
Snape:</b> My Lords, will my noble and learned friend
assure us not only that the rights of the victim will be taken into
consideration but that proper and adequate punishment will be
administered to those who are guilty of anti-social behaviour, which
bothers so many people in this country? Can he assure us that the
Government will not follow the Conservative Party down the philosophy
of hugging a hoodie but rather will lock them up for misbehaviour, if
that is what they
deserve?</p><p><a name="06071361000033"></a><b><a name="06071361001787"></a>Lord
Goldsmith:</b> My Lords, everybody
who is guilty of misbehaviour should be considered for an appropriate
sanction if they have committed a criminal offence. I think that it is
enormously important that this Government have recognised that
anti-social behaviour, although it often simply concerns offences at
the low end of the criminal justice calendar, can be hugely distressful
to people and make people&#146;s lives an absolute misery. The
respect action plan that the Government have produced and in which
prosecutors play a key part is essential to that. One thing that we
have done is to have specialist anti-social behaviour prosecutors who
help with others to deal with the challenge to which my noble friend
refers.</p><p><a name="06071361000034"></a><b><a name="06071361001788"></a>Lord
Thomas of Gresford:</b> My Lords, does the Crown
Prosecution Service have instructions to supervise or control victim
impact statements that are read out in court or, as is intended,
victims speaking openly in court? The noble and learned Lord the
Attorney-General will appreciate that anything that is said in court is
subject to absolute privilege and may be reported in the press. I have
come across some outrageous and untruthful things that were said in
victim impact statements in order to influence the judge to pass a more
severe

Goldsmith:</b> My Lords, I
recognise a bit of a conflict here. First, it is important that the
impact of an offence on a victim is understood by the court&#151;not
the victim&#146;s views on what the sentence should be but the impact
on the victim. I see a huge number of

and some of them are very moving and plainly need to be taken into
account. The judges need to see them, and prosecutors need to make sure
that they have seen them. It will ultimately be for the court to
control what is said. But there is another side to this&#151;that
defendants through their advocates often say in court things that are
hugely distressful for the victims. They will allege, &#147;I only
did this because she led me on&#148;. It is important in those
circumstances that the victims, too, can come back through prosecuting
counsel and say, &#147;That is not acceptable&#148;. That is one
thing that I included in the guidelines that I issued to prosecutors
last year&#151;that must always be
considered.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06071361000006"></a>Imerys:

&#163;25 million to diversification and to finding other jobs for the
people who may be made redundant. Does he agree that the key issue in
Cornwall is probably diversification into other industries, one of
which must surely be to get rid of some of the spoil and secondary
aggregates that blot the landscape around St Austell? I am sure that he
will agree that that needs capital investment. Will the Government
re-examine the convergence fund and Cornwall&#146;s Objective 1

and whether alternative uses can be made of them. EU structural funds
will be part of any action that is taken to improve the situation.
Cornwall&#146;s Objective 1 status has already attracted &#163;328
million in European funding and, together with matched funding, a total
of &#163;878 million will go into the economy of Cornwall and the
Scilly Isles. Cornwall will be eligible for funding from 2007 from the

Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> My Lords, none of the
European funding to which the Minister referred that goes to Cornwall

the job losses. That is compounded by the fact that the DTI has just
published its assisted area status zones, removing west Devon from the
assisted area status zone so that the area will not be able to receive
that European funding. Will the Minister undertake to re-examine the

has seen a major transformation? There is no doubt about that. The
commitment given by this Government on Objective 1, Combined
Universities in Cornwall, the minimum wage and a whole raft of things
have been of considerable help. Nevertheless, there is not just this
loss of 700 jobs in Cornwall and of 85 in Devon; there is also an
effect on the peripheral, small businesses. Cornwall has no big
businesses and it is very different from the Midlands in that regard.
Therefore, does my noble friend agree that the principles of Objective
1 should continue? The money needs to be there, because it is not
possible to say to employees, &#147;There is a job down the
road&#148;. While I believe that employment in Cornwall has increased
and that all the indicators are going in the right direction, this
number of job losses in a very rural area is a major body blow. We have
time&#151;just over a year&#151;before the redundancies take place,

job losses will not take place until the end of 2007, so we have some
time to plan for this. It is essential that we use the action task

part of regional regeneration. We must make certain that you can get
both in and out of Cornwall easily and, in particular, that Cornwall is
linked into the international transport system, so that, if you are
trying to attract high-tech businesses that have a global market, which
is increasingly the situation, it is easy to get into the region and
out. In other circumstances, Cornwall is well placed to build up its
trade with

into finding alternative uses for the waste material from the clay

Efforts to ameliorate the environmental impact by levelling the clay

only the immediate impact on those employed by the company but the

problem. The waste material obviously has to be considered when looking
at the environment in Cornwall, but there are other ways in which I
would want to view long-term jobs: they should be based on modern
industries, innovation and new skills. In the end, that is what will
give stability to that
region.</p><p><a name="06071361000054"></a><b><a name="06071361001808"></a>Baroness
Miller of Hendon:</b> My Lords, given that the
800-odd redundancies constitute a much bigger percentage of the jobs in
this area than the 6,000 job losses at Loughborough and that they are
therefore much more tragic for the employees concerned and for the
families who have been in the industry for generations and given that
there does not seem to be much hope, can the Minister explain why the
Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of
State for Trade and Industry all went to Loughborough to talk to the
employees there and to try to encourage them and so on, but, as yet, no
one from the top has gone to this extraordinarily tragic
area?</p><p><a name="06071361000055"></a><b><a name="06071361001809"></a>Lord
Sainsbury of Turville:</b> My Lords, the job losses
in Cornwall will be just as bitterly felt as those at MG Rover.
However, there is one important difference: the real problem with MG
Rover was that 6,000 jobs were lost overnight, and that was a very
difficult situation to deal with. In this case, the job losses will be
as bitterly felt as they were at MG Rover, but at least we have until
the end of 2007 to find alternative jobs for the people
concerned.</p><p><a name="06071361000056"></a><b><a name="06071361001810"></a>Lord
Berkeley:</b> My Lords, can my
noble friend also ensure that the action group looks at transport
within Cornwall? With diversification and new job opportunities, which
we all hope will come, it is terribly important that people can get
around within the county. One of the road schemes near St Austell
proposed in the latest round has, I gather, been put on ice, and I hope
that that decision can be reversed. Is my noble friend also aware that,
when the new First Great Western franchise for passenger trains was let
this summer, many cuts to local services were proposed, not only on the
branch lines but in commuter services on the main Cornwall line? Can
the Government see whether some of those can be reinstated, so that
local train services can help people going to new
jobs?</p><p><a name="06071361000057"></a><b><a name="06071361001811"></a>Lord

honourable friend the Minister of State for Industry and the Regions
will ask her opposite number at the Department for Transport to look
again at this proposal in the light of the Imerys job losses, but it
was originally a local decision based on local
priorities.</p>

Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor (Lord
Falconer of Thoroton):</b> My Lords, with the leave
of the House I should like to make a Statement on the independent
report of the noble Lord, Lord Carter, into the procurement of legal
aid, which has been published today and copies of which have been
placed in the Libraries of both Houses. A joint consultation paper on
the proposals of the noble Lord has been issued simultaneously by the
Department for Constitutional Affairs and the Legal Services
Commission, and copies have been placed in the Libraries.</p><p><a name="06071361000062"></a>The report is the
product of a year of engagement between a number of different
stakeholders. Government, the Legal Services Commission, the Law
Society, the Bar Council, the judiciary, individual practitioners and
others, have all played a full part in the discussions that have led to
the noble Lord&#146;s recommendations. In his report, he identifies
the importance of a publicly funded legal service to ensure proper
access to justice for those in need of advice and representation, and
for those charged with criminal offences. He rightly identifies the
high quality of our legal
system.</p><p><a name="06071361000063"></a>In a time of finite
public resources and ever-increasing pressure on the legal system, it
is vital that we review our arrangements for the provision of legal
aid. For some time, under successive Governments, they have not fully
been serving either the public or the clients of the system. Changing
the way in which we purchase legal advice services is a key element of
our desire both to reform the criminal justice system and to provide
better outcomes in civil and family justice. I know from experience the
difficulty in balancing all the competing factors to ensure that legal
aid is fair to the vulnerable, fair to taxpayers, fair to defendants
and fair for practitioners.</p><notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_828"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 828</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071361000064"></a>The
noble Lord, Lord Carter, has concluded that fundamental change must be
made in the way in which legal aid services are procured so that
clients have access to good quality legal advice and representation; a
good quality, efficient supplier base thrives and remains sustainable;
taxpayers and the Government receive value for money; and the justice
system is more efficient, effective and simple. He recommends a new
system for the provision of criminal legal aid where the professions
ensure proper quality control over their members; where lawyers are, as
much as possible, paid on the basis of the completion of the case
rather than for the number of hours they have worked; and where they
are encouraged to be as efficient as possible by being able to compete
for work on the basis of
price.</p><p><a name="06071361000065"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Carter, has proposed that the criminal legal aid market should be
restructured alongside his suggested timetable in the following way:
April 2007 should see the introduction of a new fixed-fee scheme in
police stations; it should also see changes to standard fees for
magistrates&#146; court cases, changes to the advocates graduated fee
scheme in the Crown Court and an extension of the graduated fee scheme
to litigators in the Crown Court. For very high cost cases, the Legal
Services Commission should introduce an enhanced quality threshold and
use an increased level of in-house legal expertise and closer
management to bring greater control over the individual case
contracting regime. He proposes that that be achieved by the end of the
financial year 2007-08 through the Legal Services Commission
contracting solely with a panel of suppliers.</p><p><a name="06071361000066"></a>Panel membership would be determined
through the demonstration of the appropriate level of quality as well
as competition. Price competition should be introduced from 2009, with
quality-assured suppliers bidding for multiple units of cases in police
stations, which they would usually then take through to the
magistrates' and/or the Crown Courts, depending on where the case
ended. The transition to a more market-based approach comes alongside
changes to the regulation of legal services, as outlined in the draft
Legal Services Bill. Taken together, that will mean change for the
profession: a degree of re-structuring for solicitors and barristers
alike.</p><p><a name="06071361000067"></a>Those
changes must be managed in a way that ensures continuing quality and
choice for the public while giving the professions time and, where
appropriate, support, to adjust to the new model. The noble Lord
recognises the need to ensure the providers of legal services continue
to serve BME communities and those in less densely populated and rural
areas. He strongly acknowledges that one size does not fit all and he
makes detailed proposals to ensure the continued improved provision of
high-quality legal services for allthose communities. His
report contains detailed recommendations that will help us devise a
criminal justice system that the public expects: one that is simple,
speedy and makes best use of summary justice.</p><p><a name="06071361000068"></a>On civil and family
legal aid, the report provides for a more efficient, client-focused
service, concentrating on meeting differing local needs. The noble Lord
suggests that this will be achieved through the establishment of
community legal advice centres and 
<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_829"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 829</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>community legal advice networks, which is in line with the Legal
Services Commission&#146;s strategy for the community legal services.
Best value tendering for the new centres and participation in the
networks would begin in
2009.</p><p><a name="06071361000069"></a>New
forms of contracting are expected to promote greater links between
civil suppliers and, where possible, with family law suppliers, so that
clusters of problems can be dealt with earlier and more effectively to
avoid the risk that they multiply and lead to people falling into the
social exclusion trap.</p><p><a name="06071361000070"></a>The Legal
Services Commission also proposes to move to fixed and graduated fees
from April 2007 for a wide variety of civil and family work and for
most immigration work. This will promote and reward the most effective
working by suppliers. The consultation document published alongside the
noble Lord&#146;s report contains full
details.</p><p><a name="06071361000071"></a>The
noble Lord, Lord Carter, estimates that if these reforms had been fully
in place in 2005-06, criminal legal aid spending would have been
&#163;100 million lower, and this does not take account of the
potential further savings from best-value tendering. In addition, a
greater proportion of legal aid would have been spent on civil and
family matters. By the end of the implementation period, because the
reforms will also control unit costs far better than many elements of
the current scheme, spending will be lower than it would be without the
changes
proposed.</p><p><a name="06071361000072"></a>I
also welcome and accept the recommendation of the noble Lord, Lord
Carter, for better management and control of spending, including
through greater transparency and shared problem-solving between the
Department for Constitutional Affairs, the Legal Services Commission,
other government departments and the
professions.</p><p><a name="06071361000073"></a>In
conclusion, the Government strongly welcome my noble friend&#146;s
findings and we have today issued a consultation paper, which I
encourage everyone to respond to. I look forward to the challenges
ahead and to working with all stakeholders and the Legal Services
Commission. The dedication and commitment of those commissioners and
staff will be critical to success. Finally, I am immensely grateful to
the noble Lord, Lord Carter, for his work. He has provided a blueprint
for the future.</p><h5><a name="06071361000587"></a>11.42
am</h5><p><a name="06071361000074"></a><b><a name="06071361001814"></a>Lord
Kingsland:</b> My Lords, I am most grateful to the
noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor for making this Statement.
Like the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, I received it only a short time
ago. It may be that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, reads more quickly
than I do, or at least absorbs information more efficiently, but I have
not had the chance to take in everything that the noble Lord, Lord
Carter, said, so what I am about to say should be seen in that
context.</p><p><a name="06071361000075"></a>First,
will the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor say a little more
about how these proposals, and his response to them, fit in with the
development of the legal services Bill, which is in pre-legislative
review and is soon to emerge? Plainly, how the noble 
<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_830"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 830</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and learned Lord&#146;s remarks today relate to the legal services
Bill is important in developing the picture about cost efficiency and
financial savings.</p><p><a name="06071361000076"></a>The second point I
would like the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor to reflect on
aloud this morning is how he sees this new market-based approach
squaring with the quality-of-service approach that he also lauded.
Plainly, we all want to see legal services that are as cost efficient
as possible, but it is not desirable for that to be at the cost of the
quality of provision. This is not an easy matter to resolve, and I am
certainly not going to pretend to your Lordship's House that I know the
answer; but we have to grapple with it, as do those at the coalface
deciding where the money should be spent and where it should not. I
would like to see these ideas in a little more detail than they have
been in the report by the noble Lord, Lord Carter. In saying that, I
make no criticism of the noble Lord, because he clearly had a very wide
range of issues to consider.</p><p><a name="06071361000077"></a>One of the possible
consequences of the Government adopting the noble Lord&#146;s
proposals is a reduction in the number of solicitors&#146; firms
providing legal aid, although we hope the quality of advice will rise.
Has the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor taken into account
the likely geographical impact of this on the provision of legal
service throughout the country? I can see that it is highly desirable
to focus on those firms that have the appropriate expertise, but this
may mean some firms will disappear altogether from quite large towns.
In deciding which solicitors&#146; firms will receive legal aid
contracts in criminal matters, will a geographical criterion also be
applied by the DCA and the Legal Services Commission? In the context of
magistrates&#146; courts, both the noble and learned Lord the Lord
Chancellor and his predecessor, the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Irvine, have always stressed the importance of local justice locally
delivered. I respectfully suggest that it is desirable to have legal
aid advice locally delivered.</p><p><a name="06071361000078"></a>One of the difficulties of fulfilling the
task the noble Lord, Lord Carter, was entrusted with is that he has
been looking at defence costs without knowing the number of
prosecutions with which defence lawyers will be faced. That is
particularly true with regard to large prosecutions. It is difficult to
deal with legal aid in isolation from the prosecutorial policy of the
Crown. It is no good complaining about higher defence costs if more
prosecutions take place. Defence costs in criminal cases cannot be
approached in total isolation from what is happening on the
prosecutorial side.</p><p><a name="06071361000079"></a>A good
example is the recent Jubilee Line case, about which, noble Lords will
recall, your Lordships&#146; had a debate about a fortnight ago. The
noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General accepted, frankly and
openly, that the reason the case had gone on so long was entirely due
to mistakes made by the prosecution. We will get a grip on defence
costs in these more expensive cases only if we also get a grip on the
way prosecutions are conducted in those cases. I am sure the noble and
learned Lord understands the point very well; but when seeking to
determine how to progress the Carter report, I respectfully suggest
that he bear that factor in mind.</p><notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_831"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 831</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071361000080"></a>One of the most important reasons the
Jubilee Line case took a long time was the use of the offence of
conspiracy to defraud. That is a notoriously vague offence in criminal
law. It is ill defined, and frequently gives rise to many additional
evidential requirements. In the assessment of Mr Wooler, who conducted
the Jubilee Line inquiry, it added about 15 more months to the case.
The Law Commission, in its report on the reform of the offence of
fraud, recommended that conspiracy to defraud should be abolished. I
know the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General is reluctant to
accept that. We have had a debate about it in another context, and I do
not intend to dilate on the topic further today. I would be most
interested to know, though, and perhaps this could be done by sampling
from a few court cases, just how much time the addition of the
conspiracy to defraud offence has actually added to those trials. We
know the answer in the Jubilee line case; but I suspect that such an
analysis will produce the same evidence in other cases.
</p><p><a name="06071361000081"></a>The noble and learned Lord will
well rememberthe circumstances in which he commissioned the
report&#151;in the context of the public scandal about the amount of
money expended in high-cost cases. Fifty per cent of defence
expenditure costs in the Crown Court goes on 1 per cent of the cases
held there. That, in absolute terms, amounts to over &#163;100
million. With great respect to the author of the report, what he
concludes is the least satisfactory part of it.</p><p><a name="06071361000082"></a>In paragraph 97, he suggests certain
changes but admits that they would save only 5 per cent of total
expenditure. He says, in paragraph
98:</p><ul><a name="06071361000494"></a>&#147;It still results&#148;&#151;</ul><a name="06071361000469"></a>even
after the reforms that he
suggests&#151;<ul><a name="06071361000569"></a>&#147;in
approximately &#163;100 million being spent on a small number of
cases&#148;.</ul><a name="06071361000470"></a>He goes on
to speculate on why that aspect of legal aid is still totally out of
control. In paragraph 99, he
says:<ul><a name="06071361000495"></a>&#147;This results
partly from the established policy of each contract manager negotiating
independent of what is agreed on other contracts on the same case and
not being aware of the case management strategy being used by other
defence teams&#148;.</ul><a name="06071361000471"></a>He
then goes on, rather despairingly, to suggest that perhaps the only way
of resolving this problem is to have an overall budget for these
high-cost cases.<p><a name="06071361000083"></a>The noble and
learned Lord&#146;s success or failure in this matter will, as he
will know, depend on the extent to which he gets to grips with
high-cost cases. I suggest that, on this crucial issue, the noble Lord,
Lord Carter, has taken him no further and that he will need to think
again about what needs to be done. The noble Lord, Lord Carter, has
suggested that there should be an overall financial limit, but this
could not work unless you also had overall control of the number of
prosecutions brought. How can you possibly make an overall financial
limit work in high-cost cases if you do not know how many high-cost
prosecutions there will be?</p><p><a name="06071361000084"></a>It
seems, therefore, that the only way forward is to have very strict cost
controls on each case. I am not sure how that would work for solicitors
in the light of the other changes that the noble and learned Lord
proposes. Indeed, we do not yet know how any of 
<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_832"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 832</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>these changes will work; but, in the case of barristers, it must mean
that the noble and learned Lord will have to consider whether the brief
fee plus refresher system will have to be replaced by an overall fixed
contracted sum, irrespective of the outcome. In other words, the risk
would be shifted from the taxpayerto the Bar. I have no idea
whether the noble Lord, Lord Carter, discussed this with any of the
professions; or whether the noble and learned Lord himself gave
evidence to the noble Lord. But I am extremely surprised not to find
some analysis of that solution here, and I shall need a lot of
convincing that it should be dismissed out of
hand.</p><h5><a name="06071361000588"></a>11.54
am</h5><p><a name="06071361000085"></a><b><a name="06071361001815"></a>Lord
Goodhart:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Carter
of Coles, is to be congratulated on producing a very full report in
very reasonable time. Like the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, I have not
yet had an opportunity to read it, but I will do so rapidly and with
considerable interest.</p><p><a name="06071361000086"></a>It is
quite clear from the Statement and from brief consideration of the
executive summary of the report that the report will lead to very
important changes in the legal aid system. Indeed, together with the
Clementi report, it will lead to fundamental changes in the legal
profession, perhaps to an even greater extent than with the Access to
Justice Act 1999.</p><p><a name="06071361000087"></a>We recognise
that the increasing costs of legal aid have been and continue to be a
real problem. We accept that civil legal aid must be cash limited and
that procedures such as conditional fee agreements should be
introduced, although there are aspects of that case which need to be
looked at again. Like the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, we also accept
that very high-cost cases take far too great a proportion of the
criminal legal aid budget and are altogether too
expensive.</p><p><a name="06071361000088"></a>The report proposes
that, in effect, much legal aid should be put out to tender. We do not
object to that in principle, but will those granting legal aid be able
adequately to take into account the quality of services? The Government
have said in the Statement that they will do that, but we need ensure
that it happens and to strike the right balance between quality and
cheapness. What is needed here is value for money, not something cheap
and nasty.</p><p><a name="06071361000089"></a>I have some concern
over the proposal to place a limitation on the number of criminal cases
that can be dealt with by firms as a result of client choice. Are the
Government satisfied that the new system will put an end to the
problems of legal aid deserts? Legal advice centres and networks can
play an important part but could pose a serious threat to the
availability of general legal services in the locality. A further
important issue is whether the Government are prepared to ring-fence
civil legal aid. It is wholly wrong that increases in criminal and
immigration legal aid should mean a reduction in civil legal
aid&#151;including family legal aid&#151;which deals with cases of
the utmost importance to many
claimants.</p><p><a name="06071361000090"></a>Going beyond legal
aid and beyond the remit of the noble Lord, Lord Carter, will the
Government commission a review into changes in court procedures 
<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_833"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 833</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which I believe are inordinately lengthy and expensive compared with
those in most other countries? That would enable the same amount of
money tofund legal aid for more cases. The Woolf reforms have
been helpful, particularly in encouraging pre-trial settlements, but
this needs to be looked at
again.</p><p><a name="06071361000091"></a>Returning to the report,
we shall need a full study of the proposals when we have had time to
consider them. What is the Government&#146;s timetable for
implementation, and will it involve new primary legislation? If so,
will that be brought in as an addition to the draft Legal Services
Bill?</p><h5><a name="06071361000589"></a>11.58
am</h5><p><a name="06071361000092"></a><b><a name="06071361001816"></a>Lord
Falconer of Thoroton:</b> My Lords, I am grateful for
the measured responses of the noble Lords, Lord Kingsland and Lord
Goodhart. Perhaps I may say at the outset that throughout my Statement
I should have referred to my noble friend Lord Carter of Coles rather
than Lord Carter. I apologise for the discourtesy. I shall deal with
the specific points raised.</p><p><a name="06071361000093"></a>The
noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, asked how this would fit in with the Legal
Services Bill. The proposals are freestanding in the sense that they
are not dependent on that Bill. However, alternative business
structures that the Legal Services Bill would allow&#151;for example,
partnerships between barristers or partnerships between barristers and
solicitors&#151;will enable them to bid more effectively once
competitive tendering comes in. The noble Lord went on to emphasise,
entirely correctly in my view, the issue of quality, and I made it
clear in the Statement that proper arrangements must be in place to
deal with the question of quality. I refer noble Lords to pages 10 and
14 of the report setting out the specific proposals made by my noble
friend Lord Carter of Coles in relation to quality. In practice, what
he is proposing is that the monitoring and judging of quality be handed
over to the Law Society and the Bar Council respectively and that they
do it on the basis of peer review. That will take some time to
introduce, but I believe it to be a sensible proposal: those who know
should judge the quality of those who provide, and only those who
satisfy the relevant quality standards can then be in a position to bid
for legal aid work.</p><p><a name="06071361000094"></a>The next
point raised by the noble Lord, Lords Kingsland, is the worry about
geographical effect, another issue that the noble Lord, Lord Carter of
Coles, addresses. What happens if you live in Cumbria and you are
serving a geographically difficult market? He makes the point, and we
accept it, that one size does not fit all. It will cost more to provide
legal services in Cumbria than it might in some inner-city urban
areas.</p><p><a name="06071361000095"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Kingsland, then made the point that many of the difficulties in long
cases come not from procurement of defence services but in how the
prosecution is conducted. Again, we wholly agree. The report does not
in any way limit us in addressing the issue of, for example, the very
high-cost case, in terms of demand as opposed to procurement of defence
services. However, I have absolutely no doubt that the way in which we
procure defence services will 
<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_834"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 834</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have a significant impact on the length of some civil and criminal
cases. The specific difficulty in the very high-cost case is the lack
of predictability found in the smaller case. We need a system whereby a
fair estimate is made of what should be paid by reference to the length
of the case. Once that length is exceeded then the case should become
much less financially productive for those engaged in it. In practice,
that is what my noble friend Lord Carter of Coles is
proposing.</p><p><a name="06071361000096"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Kingsland, continues in that vein by saying that he is not satisfied
with the proposals of my noble friend Lord Carter of Coles on very
high-cost cases. I would ask him to look in detail at paragraphs 4.17
to 4.23, the relevant detailed recommendations. What it amounts to is
that only those who are capable of doing the long cases can bid. There
should be a rigorous tendering process. There should be involvement of
the prosecution, the defence and the judge in identifying how long the
case should last. It should be value for money based only on that. The
noble Lord asks whether consideration was given to brief fee and
limited number of days. Yes, it was. This is the conclusion that my
noble friend Lord Carter of Coles came to. I would therefore ask the
noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, to consider in detail what he says about
it.</p><p><a name="06071361000097"></a>I think that I have dealt
with all the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. The noble
Lord, Lord Goodhart, made the point on quality that I hope I answered
in response to the noble Lord,Lord Kingsland. The noble Lord,
Lord Goodhart, makes the point that he is anxious about limiting the
number of criminal cases that an individual solicitor or barrister can
take. My noble friend Lord Carter of Coles made it clear that client
choice is a vital part of our system. But if we want best value
tendering, it has to be, has it not, on the basis of tendering for a
number of cases and winning that tender? So, a balance has to be struck
between client choice and rewarding the lawyer for efficiency by
allowing him to tender on price.</p><p><a name="06071361000098"></a>I cannot guarantee that the proposal
deals completely with legal aid deserts, but in the long run it will
make more money available, particularly for civil and family cases. It
is also clearly focused on the proposition, as I said in answer to the
noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, that one size does not fit all. It will
address the issue. I cannot guarantee that it will do so everywhere but
I believe that it will make real progress.</p><p><a name="06071361000099"></a>I say no to ring-fencing the civil legal
aid budget. I think that it is a bad idea because it reduces
flexibility. It means that we could not shift funds from one to the
other when that would be appropriate.</p><p><a name="06071361000100"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, then
raised a point on court procedures with which I completely agree. The
now implemented proposals of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf,
have had a significant effect on civil litigation. I believe that we
can do that in criminal cases as well, both in the magistrates' court
and in the Crown Court. The judges have said time and again that the
day of the six-month case or above is over; those cases should be
shorter. The 
<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_835"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 835</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>judges are keen to see implemented in practice in individual
cases&#151;for example, in a criminal case&#151;the identification
of how long the defence and the prosecution have for individual
elements of the case. That promotes justice, in my view, rather than
inhibits it. So I entirely agree with what the noble Lord says about
the need for court procedures to make the length of cases
shorter.</p><p><a name="06071361000101"></a>Finally, the noble
Lord asked whether implementation will require primary legislation. It
will not. The Legal Services Bill will go ahead but none of our
proposals requires primary legislation. We have published today a
consultation document, which is also in the Library. The consultation
period ends in October 2006. The report gives a timescale, to which I
have referred from time to time. Broadly, it is that by April 2007
greater numbers of fixed fees will have been introduced, and that by
April 2009 the best value tendering will have begun and the quality
assurance arrangements will be in place. That is what we propose; it is
on that that we are consulting, and we should get on with
it.</p><h5><a name="06071361000590"></a>12.05

my noble friend is absolutely right that forecasting is extremely
difficult. Opportunities will be available for representations to be
made. However, one of the themes that comes out from the report is that
forecasting of demand can be a great deal better than it has been in
the past. Some of the problems that historically exist with legal aid
have been because the Department for Constitutional Affairs and the
Legal Services Commission have got their forecasts completely wrong. We
need to improve that
dramatically.</p><p><a name="06071361000104"></a><b><a name="06071361001819"></a>Lord

documents in detail, but it is right that I make a Statement to the
House on the publication of the document, so that I can explain the
position. Because primary legislation is not required, the way in which
input can come is through responding to the consultation. If the usual
channels take the view that the subject is appropriate for a further
debate in this House, no doubt they will make that available. That is
how we normally operate.</p><notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_836"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 836</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071361000106"></a><b><a name="06071361001821"></a>Lord
Campbell-Savours:</b> My Lords, my noble and learned

that &#163;100 million would have been saved in one year, plus the
value-for-money savings arising out of tendering. Do the Government
accept those figures? Do they believe that that level of economy would
be gained arising out these changes? In relation to the 50 per cent on

those statistics stay the same or change?</p><p><a name="06071361000107"></a><b><a name="06071361001822"></a>Lord
Falconer of Thoroton:</b> My Lords,
the&#163;100 million to which my noble friend Lord Carter of
Coles referred was putting aside tendering; it was on the basis of
fixed fees and greater efficiencies, with additional savings in
relation to tendering. Although we might quibble over the edges, we
accept in principle that such savings could be made. In answer to the
second question about the 50 per cent on 1 per cent of cases,
yes&#151;there needs to be a dramatic shift in that
statistic.</p><p><a name="06071361000108"></a><b><a name="06071361001823"></a>The
Countess of Mar:</b> My Lords, I am relieved to hear
what the noble and learned Lord has had to say about value and quality
so far as legal aid is concerned. I have been closely associated with
three major group actions: the Gulf War action, the sheep
farmers&#146; action, and the measles, mumps and rubella action.
Something like &#163;9 million of taxpayers&#146; money has been
thrown down the drain on those group actions because, as I ascertained
from the Legal Services Commission, no spot checks were done on work on
the cases. There was no assessment of the competence of the lawyers to
deal with the cases, and there seems to have been little follow-up for
four or five years about whether the cases were going to go anywhere
anyway.</p><p><a name="06071361000109"></a>I do not know whether
the noble and learned Lord recalls, but in the time of his noble and
learned friend Lord Irvine, I had an Unstarred Question on this matter,
and his noble and learned friend arranged for me to go to the Legal
Services Commission. I am frankly appalled at the waste of
taxpayers&#146; money and the distress that has been caused to the
litigants by the failure of these cases. They should not have been run
at all if they were not going to
succeed.</p><p><a name="06071361000110"></a><b><a name="06071361001824"></a>Lord
Falconer of Thoroton:</b> My Lords, I am very
conscious of the sorts of issue that the noble Countess raises. It is
not just a problem for those who end up receiving poor advice, which
sometimes people do. It is also about the fact that this limits the
budget for other people who have legitimate claims. My noble friend
Lord Carter of Coles recognises, quite separately from any of the
tendering or economic changes, that the quality assurance proposal that
he made will itself have an effect on the providers&#146; market,
because it will reveal some people who should not be able to tender for
legal aid
work.</p>

is highly desirable that at some point when the secondary legislation

it obviously will not all come at once. It will come gradually over a
period of time; for example, a new graduated fee scheme for Crown Court
advocacy, or a new graduated fee scheme for solicitors in the Crown
Court. I will take away the point made by the noble Lord, because
underlying his point he is asking me to think of a way whereby there
could be a proper debate about the arrangements. That seems to be

Assembly resolves that the First Minister or the Welsh Ministers no
longer enjoy the confidence of the
Assembly.&#148;</ul><p><a name="06071361000124"></a>The
noble Lord said: My Lords, we return to the amendment that we tabled on
Report. The Minister will remember that this matter has been drawn to
our attention by the organisation Tomorrow&#146;s Wales, which is
chaired by the Archbishop of Wales.</p><p><a name="06071361000125"></a>It is a serious amendment because there
appears to be no real ability within the Bill for the First Minister to
be dismissed in circumstances where there might be a vote of no
confidence in him or her in the Assembly. The amendment
states:</p><ul><a name="06071361000500"></a>&#147;The First
Minister shall tender his resignation to Her Majesty if the Assembly
resolves that the First Minister or the Welsh Ministers no longer enjoy
the confidence of the
Assembly&#148;.</ul><a name="06071361000472"></a>This
would ensure that the First Minister can be removed from office by a
vote of no confidence. However, at present&#151;and in contrast to
the position under the Scotland Act 1998&#151;the First Minister is
not obliged to stand down immediately if he loses a vote of confidence
but only when a new First Minister is appointed. A First Minister can
therefore only be removed by also electing his successor at the same
time. It is a rather strange situation which corresponds with the
practice in Germany, where it is known as the &#147;constructive vote
of no confidence&#148;. Consequently, it has the effect of
significantly weakening the control of the Executive by the
Assembly. <p><a name="06071361000126"></a>I know that in
Committee the Minister said, in particular, that the First Minister
will remain in office, as it states in the Bill, until a successor is
elected. We do not think that that is a desirable state of affairs if
there is a loss of confidence in the First
Minister.</p><p><a name="06071361000127"></a>As to the appointment
of a new First Minister, the argument is that there surely must be
someone in government in between times from whom the civil servants who
are the staff of the Welsh Assembly Government can derive their
authority to act. It should not be too difficult to find a person
within a ministerial competence of the Assembly Government to take over
the role of First Minister temporarily in the interim period. We do not
see why it should be that, in spite of there being a vote of no
confidence, the First Minister should continue. Clearly a vote of no
confidence means that the First Minister has lost 
<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_839"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 839</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the confidence of the Assembly and someone else, who might be equally
able, should take the First Minister&#146;s place in the interim to
ensure that the Assembly is run properly, which should sustain the
confidence of the Members of the Assembly. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06071361000128"></a><b><a name="06071361001833"></a>Lord
Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, I do not think there
is a great deal of difference between us, nor is there a major issue at
stake. I recognise that the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, pressed this issue
at Report stage and he has brought it back at Third Reading. At Report
stage I had hoped to indicate&#151;I obviously did not
succeed&#151;that the provisions of the Bill are absolutely
clear:</p><a name="06071361000473"></a>When a First Minister
loses a vote of confidence, that immediately triggers the process for
his replacement. The question is, what happens in the interim? The
noble Lord and I are in agreement that a vacancy could not just be
declared. Like nature, government abhor a vacuum, and if there is no
elected Member in charge, one has to have confidence that a civil
servant should occupy that role but that runs counter to every
constitutional principle that we follow as a nation in any of our
elected bodies.<p><a name="06071361000129"></a>The noble Lord
says that another Minister could take that position. But another
Minister might be a competitor for the role. How on earth could we
guarantee that there would be an easy judgment about who should fulfil
this role and how would that be arrived at?</p><p><a name="06071361000130"></a>We are saying that the First Minister,
having lost a vote of confidence, is a standby Minister until his or
her successor is elected. The moment that election has taken place, he
or she goes. It is similar to the removal van being at No. 10, when
things move with considerable dispatch. Things might take slightly
longer in this respect, but the principle is clear. The Prime Minister
is in office until his successor takes up the new position and has
kissed hands. For the Assembly, it is clear that the outgoing First
Minister carries on for a very short time until the election of his
successor. I hope that the noble Lord recognises that that is a
reasonable provision. The Bill makes it quite clear that that is
exactly what
happens.</p><p><a name="06071361000131"></a><b><a name="06071361001834"></a>Lord
Livsey of Talgarth:</b> My Lords, I hope the Minister

something that happened during the 1970s. I went to Downing Street; the
crowd were shouting &#147;Out&#148; to the Prime Minister, while
his successor was already in No. 10. I remember thinking that that was
rather amusing. Of course, one cannot just wander up to the door of No.

what the Minister said that this was not a problem. Some people might
not want to be First Minister&#151;in fact, I suspect that there
could be quite a number. I am sure it is not beyond the wit of the
Presiding Officer to establish who is in that position and perhaps a
successor could be found.</p><p><a name="06071361000133"></a>I

Part 3 about retrospectivity. As your Lordships will recall, both in
Committee and at Report, we tabled an amendment seeking to remove from
the Act the principle of retrospectivity. This arises because of Clause
95(4) which states:</p><ul><a name="06071361000502"></a>&#147;An
Order in Council under this section may make provision having
retrospective
effect&#148;&#151;</ul><a name="06071361000474"></a>&#151;that
is to say, an Order in Council made as a consequence of the Parliament
in Westminster deciding to expand a field, as defined in Schedule 5 to
the Bill, or a matter under that
field.<p><a name="06071361000140"></a>At
Committee and Report, we sought to have that provision removed
altogether. Now that we are at Third Reading, we are in
characteristically conciliatory mood and propose a less dramatic
solution to the problem&#151;to leave the existing text in, but add
the
expression,</p><ul><a name="06071361000570"></a>&#147;provided
that such an Order is not to the detriment of those who have either
benefited from or acted in reliance upon the state of the law before
the retrospective Order is
made&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06071361000141"></a>As
a consequence of our debate at Report, the Minister kindly sent me a
letter on the topic. I have read it a number of times. On each
occasion, I reached a different conclusion about what it meant. I
hasten to add that that is an observation on my powers of concentration
rather than on the intellectual coherence of the Minister who drafted
it. However, I am certain about one thing: the letter does not answer
the question that I posed at both Committee and Report. The Minister
will recall that that was, quite simply: can an order change,
retrospectively, the decision of a court and the consequences that flow
from that decision?</p><p><a name="06071361000142"></a>The letter
only goes as far as to say that a retrospective order, directed at a
matter of interpretation raised during a trial, cannot be made while
the trial is in progress. Plainly, that does not go far enough. In
those circumstances, I intend to press my amendment. In doing so, I
invite the Minister to agree that the matters and concerns that he
raised at Committee and Report will not in any way be adversely
affected by our particular choice of words. I beg to

partially&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 28/6/06; col.
1276.]</ul><a name="06071361000476"></a>We wrote a long
letter, which I am afraid has still not satisfied the noble Lord, so I
hope that in the next few minutes I shall be able to convince him that
nothing is happening with this clause that should be of
concern.<p><a name="06071361000477"></a>Amendments
Nos. 4, 12 and 13 would all limit the retrospective effect of the
respective orders under Clauses 95, 150 and 151 so that the order
applies only if it is,</p><ul><a name="06071361000571"></a>&#147;not to the detriment of those
who have either benefited from or acted in reliance upon ... the
law&#148;,</ul><a name="06071361000478"></a>before the
order was made. We discussed the issue of retrospective effect at
length in Committee and on Report. It is an important issue, and many
noble Lords have expressed measured and cogent concerns about these
provisions. To offer further reassurance, I wrote the letter that has
been mentioned, and I am glad that we have an opportunity to return to
the matter at Third
Reading.<p><a name="06071361000147"></a>As I stated
previously, the retrospective power exists primarily to allow technical
defects to be corrected. The merits of using it would need to be
decided on a case-by-case basis by weighing up the rights of
individuals, the public interest and the scale of the change involved.
Of course, the Welsh Ministers and the Secretary of State would have to
take into account whether making retrospective provision would be to
the detriment of any person. However, we cannot accept the amendments,
as that is not the only consideration that they would have to take into
account. There may be considerations in the public interest that
greatly outweighed an arguable detriment to an individual. That is why
the existing human rights legislation, which requires Ministers to
consider these issues in the round, remains the best constraint on
ministerial discretion. I also stress once again that these powers are
primarily intended to enable technical defects to be remedied and minor
and consequential amendments to be made.</p><notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_842"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 842</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071361000148"></a>As I stated on Report,
the Government do not envisage the power to make retrospective
provision being exercised except in very rare cases. The purpose of the
provision is to protect those who have acted in good faith as a result
of provisions in an Assembly measure that have subsequently been ruled
to be <I>ultra vires</I>. It is not intended arbitrarily to abridge the
rights of individuals, and there are safeguards in place to ensure that
the power could not be used in such a
way.</p><p><a name="06071361000149"></a>I emphasise strongly to the
noble Lord that, if there were ever any attempt to abuse this provision
and to use it in a way that was detrimental to the rights of
individuals, Parliament would block it. All orders under Clauses 95,
150 and 151 will be subject to full parliamentary oversight. Parliament
will therefore act as a constant check on the use of these powers, and
will be able to ensure that any retrospective provision made under
those clauses is proportionate and
appropriate.</p><p><a name="06071361000150"></a>I understand and
have considerable sympathy with the intention behind the amendments.
However, I point out to noble Lords that the amendments are technically
defective and would render the provisions related to retrospective
effect inoperable. It is impossible with any certainty to identify all
persons who could be detrimentally affected as a consequence of the
order in advance of the order being made. It would never be clear,
therefore, whether any order could lawfully be made, even if there was
an overwhelming public interest in making it. For that reason, the
Government believe that the safeguards that I have outlined, of human
rights legislation and parliamentary oversight, are the appropriate way
of dealing with this issue, rather than the approach adopted by the
amendments.</p><p><a name="06071361000151"></a>It is also worth
reiterating that this provision follows the model of the provisions in
Sections 107 and 114 of the Scotland Act 1998. Your Lordships may also
be aware that it was necessary for provision to be made under Sections
107 and 114 of the Scotland Act 1998 when it transpired that a
provision of the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 was considered
to be beyond the legislative competence of the Scottish
Parliament.</p><p><a name="06071361000152"></a>This power is
needed because, if it were considered that an Assembly measure was
outside its legislative competence, another provision of another
enactment might also need to be amended to reflect that. The Bill
provides that any provision of a measure that is outside the
legislative competence of the Assembly is not law. If it were to arise
that another enactment had made provision referring to that measure,
then it may be necessary to amend that other enactment as if it had
never referred to the <I>ultra vires</I> provision of the Assembly
measure. As the Scottish example shows, this will certainly be a very
rare event, but the provision may well be needed.</p><p><a name="06071361000153"></a>In all cases, the Welsh
Ministers and the Secretary of State, who would be engaged in
considering whether to propose a draft Order in Council with
retrospective effect, would have to consider the circumstances of the
particular proposal. The Assembly and both Houses of Parliament would
judge whether the draft Order in

therefore, be made at the whim of the
Executive.</p><p><a name="06071361000154"></a>I
hope that finally I have convinced the noble Lord, and with this
assurance I hope that he will feel able to withdraw the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06071361000155"></a><b><a name="06071361001839"></a>Lord
Thomas of Gresford:</b> My Lords, I have two
questions for the Minister. First, is he saying that this provision is
to deal with a situation that might arise because a measure had been
made that was <I>ultra vires</I>, and the provision is being used to
put that
right?</p><p><a name="06071361000156"></a><b><a name="06071361001840"></a>Lord
Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> My Lords, that is

Thomas of Gresford:</b> My Lords, do I also
understand the Minister to say that there would be no question of the
Welsh Assembly Government seeking to take away the fruits of victory in
litigation from the litigant and, if they attempted to do so, this
Government would block them by using the blocking mechanism of a
measure that is set out in the legislation? Is that
right?</p><p><a name="06071361000160"></a><b><a name="06071361001844"></a>Lord
Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> Yes, my Lords, I can
confirm that that is the
case.</p><p><a name="06071361000161"></a><b><a name="06071361001845"></a>Lord
Kingsland:</b> My Lords, first I
must say how much I have enjoyed working with the Minister throughout
this Bill. He has always set out, in the speeches that he has made, a
spirited defence of the Government&#146;s position. However, in this
case, far from reassuring me, he has confirmed my worst suspicions. He
has done so by explaining the process that would lead to an
order.</p><p><a name="06071361000162"></a>Perhaps I should say at
this point that the order is not one made by the Welsh Assembly but one
made by the Westminster Parliament. I am talking not about the second
range of orders but about the first
range.</p><p><a name="06071361000163"></a>The Minister described
the process of determining whether your Lordships' House and another
place should make an order as one of balancing the public interest
against the rights of the individual. From that, I conclude that, even
after a court has decided that a certain individual has certain rights
in law as a consequence of the trial process, those rights may be
retrospectively taken away from that individual if Westminster
considers it in the public interest to do so. That is my understanding
of what the noble Lord said. I derive no reassurance whatever from the
fact that there may be similar provisions in the Scottish legislation.
Those provisions may well turn out to have the same defects as, I
believe, I have identified in the definitions in this Bill.</p><notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_844"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 844</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071361000164"></a>Indeed,
the situation arises all the time in our own law. Where you have a
piece of delegated legislation that is passed by your Lordships&#146;
House and another place and on which people rely, and then subsequent
litigation establishes that that legislation is <I>ultra vires</I> the
primary legislation, there is no power in our constitution to
retrospectively change the rights that flow from that court decision.
Of course, Parliament can then change the law for the future, but not
for the past.</p><p><a name="06071361000165"></a>I believe that our

amendments relate to the process for Orders in Council and were tabled

designed to liberate the Assembly from the grip of Westminster by
making the process automatic, whereby the Assembly&#146;s will can
prevail.</p><p><a name="06071361000175"></a>I acknowledge that this
is a radical amendment to devolve more power to the Assembly, which is,
after all, a democratic body, and to take that power from the Secretary
of State. Everyone committed to true democracy should support the
amendment, because the Assembly has been elected by the people of Wales
and it is their will to put forward draft Orders in Council. There
should be confidence in that elected body&#146;s ability to do that

these amendments is that they exclude both Houses of this Parliament
from the procedure for securing approval for an Order in Council
amending the important Schedule 5, which lists the fields where the
Assembly has legislative competence. In other words, the amendment
would ensure that approval by only the Assembly was required for the
statutory instrument containing the order before it was approved by Her
Majesty in Council.</p><p><a name="06071361000177"></a>Orders under
Clause 95 may, as subsection (1) makes clear, add, vary or remove any
matter relating to one or more of the fields listed in Part 1 of
Schedule 5. Orders may also add, vary or remove any field from Part 1
or make changes in Parts 2 and 3, which cover restrictions on Ministers
and exceptions to those restrictions. The scope for order-making is,
therefore, very extensive and fundamental in the area of legislative
competence.</p><notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_847"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 847</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071361000178"></a>It cannot be right that
the Assembly and its Government alone decide the extent of their
legislative competence without the approval of this Parliament, which
is the ultimate source of their power. The absence of parliamentary
consent to the Assembly&#146;s exercise of legislative power in an
area that properly belongs to this Parliament would be totally
unconstitutional. I am not a constitutional lawyer, but I am sure that
I am right on this point. The practical consequences do not bear
thinking
about.</p><p><a name="06071361000179"></a><b><a name="06071361001848"></a>Lord
Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the
noble Lord, Lord Roberts, because he has largely made my case for me.
The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, said that this amendment was radical. I
know that &#147;radical&#148; is generally used in a positive way
in politics in the 21st century, but the original meaning of the word
is &#147;tearing up by the root&#148;, which is what this amendment
does. It tears up the concept of devolution by the root, because it
conveys to the Assembly something very close to sovereign power. The
amendment allows the Assembly to accrue to itself, of its own decision,
any additional powers that it wants.</p><p><a name="06071361000180"></a>When the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, sums
up, can he provide an illustration of any sub-national assembly in the
world, which is not sovereign, that has the right to increase its
powers unilaterally, without any reference to the sovereign parliament
from which it derives its original powers? If he could, I would be more
than a little surprised. The amendment does not propose a concept of
devolution, but an accession towards sovereignty. It would lead to a
system of government entirely unrelated to the settlement that the
Welsh people voted for in 1997; in fact, it would be outright
independence rather than devolution.</p>

<p><a name="06071361000181"></a>Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 are much milder
in scope and tighten the deadline. If they were accepted, the Secretary
of State would have no choice whatever, and the deadline would apply to
nothing more than the process of handing the draft Order in Council to
the Clerk. We see merits in the Secretary of State being able to
deliberate on these matters and having some time before taking
action.</p><p><a name="06071361000182"></a>Those
amendments are the minor part of this group, while Amendment No. 5 is
the blockbuster, the radical reform. I know that noble Lords in the
Liberal party are extraordinarily enthusiastic about devolution. I
recognise the principle that they subscribe to; they have merit in
doing that and they are joined by many other noble Lords, including
some in my party. But the noble Lord is arguing for
independence&#151;that is a different
matter.</p><h5><a name="06071361000595"></a>1
pm</h5><p><a name="06071361000183"></a><b><a name="06071361001849"></a>Lord
Livsey of Talgarth:</b> My Lords, I thank noble Lords
for their responses. I note what they have said and understand why they
see the amendment as provocative. That, however, does not mean that
there are a lot of anachronisms. The noble Lord, Lord
Roberts&#151;and, I believe, the Minister&#151;said that it
excludes both Houses of Parliament. Well, shock horror; but it is

one.</p><p><a name="06071361000184"></a>Some of the issues raised
by the Minister reminded me of the problems of dominion status in times
past in some countries, where sovereignty still lay in the UK but the
parliaments did not have that power as the legislation was still
sovereign. It is interesting to look at the New Zealand Parliament,
where the second Chamber has been abolished. There is just a big void
in its place and a unicameral system. The amendment probes these issues
and I well understand the objections of both the government Front Bench
and the Official
Opposition.</p><p><a name="06071361000185"></a><b><a name="06071361001850"></a>Lord

the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff. It comes from the body
Tomorrow&#146;s Wales, <I>Cymru Yfory</I>. It is very important in
that it highlights a timetable for the legislation to come into being,
as recommended in the Richard commission report. The amendment requires
the Secretary of State to lay a draft order for a referendum by 30 June
2010. That should allow the referendum to be held in time for the
Assembly, which is expected to be elected in May 2011, to assume the
Part 4 powers of the Bill, which, as we know, give primary legislative
powers to the
Assembly.</p><p><a name="06071361000192"></a>I
can certainly see why the present Government would feel partly
hamstrung&#151;perhaps more so&#151;by the imposition of a date,
but they would be wrong to think that they might be in power for ever.
Perhaps a Government of a different political persuasion would act to
hold a referendum at the moment when they were least likely to succeed
in granting more powers to the Welsh Assembly. That would be possible.
In fact, one could say that the present Secretary of State is looking
for the opposite&#151;that is, for an opportunity to hold a
referendum at the most propitious time. We believe it would be
desirable to take the power on when a referendum is held away from the
politicians and to put it into statute, stating that it should occur 
<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_849"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 849</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by 30 June 2010. It was considered in the Richard commission report, and
the timescale seems sensible. It would give certainty to when it might
be possible to bring the powers in Part 4 of the Bill into being, for
that to be voted on in a referendum and then to ensure the smooth
transition to primary legislative powers for the Welsh Assembly. I beg
to
move.</p><p><a name="06071361000193"></a><b><a name="06071361001853"></a>Lord
Crickhowell:</b> My Lords, I never
cease to marvel at the ability of the Liberal Democrats to contradict
its own arguments. Even with that thought in mind, I was absolutely
flabbergasted when I saw this amendment. I understand, and shall
comment later on, the extraordinary complexity of the
inter-relationship of Clauses 103 and 104, but I understand that the
amendment would require the Secretary of State to trigger a referendum
in four years&#146; time, whether or not the Welsh Assembly had
requested or wanted it, whether or not any consultation by the
Secretary of State had indicated that no one wanted it and whether or
not there was likely to be a crushing defeat for further devolution if
a referendum were
held.</p><p><a name="06071361000194"></a>When I
tried to lower the hurdles for a referendum at previous stages of the
Bill, the Liberal Democrats rejected my proposal on the grounds that,
if a referendum were held too early and in the wrong circumstances, it
would be a catastrophic setback for the move to further devolution and
it should be utterly resisted. Now, here they are, moving an amendment
to force a referendum in four years&#146; time, whatever the results,
even if the Welsh Assembly&#151;which, reasonably, they say
represents the views of the Welsh people&#151;has not voted for it
and does not want it. It is an astonishing amendment, even by the
standards of the Liberal
Democrats.</p><p><a name="06071361000195"></a><b><a name="06071361001854"></a>Lord
Thomas of Gresford:</b> My Lords, curiously enough, I
was of the opinion that the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, wanted a
referendum now, so it does not follow that he should oppose holding a
referendum within a timescale. It seems to me that we should give these
present provisions, which are temporary&#151;I think that everyone
recognises that they are just one step forward&#151;time to prove
themselves and, within a limited period, move to a referendum. If the
people of Wales decide before 2010 that they do not like the step being
taken under the Bill, so be it. But we think that we should move
forward and not leave it to another Administration to sit on any
further moves to add to devolution for all time. A positive time limit
should be placed on
it.</p><p><a name="06071361000196"></a><b><a name="06071361001855"></a>Lord

time on that point, but I shall deal with the main issue about which
the noble Lord, Lord Livsey,
spoke.</p><p><a name="06071361000197"></a>I

primary powers for the Assembly represent a fundamental change to the
devolution settlement. A further referendum is required, but it must,
and can, take place only when there is a broad cross-party consensus in
Wales in favour of such a move. It is an easy populist line for the
Liberal Democrats to set a date and to say that it should be taken out
of the hands of politicians, and I have no doubt that that will win a
few cheers in certain quarters. However, the political responsibility
is straightforward. The referendum would be on whether the National
Assembly should have increased powers, and if it were lost it would
severely damage the Assembly and present considerable difficulties for
its subsequent
work.</p><p><a name="06071361000198"></a>It must
be a political judgment and it must be right that politicians take
responsibility. The Liberal Democrats are at one with the Government in
seeing the Welsh Assembly&#146;s powers increased under the Bill over
the next few years&#151;earlier than the Richard commission
recommended. It will be a gradual enhancement of, and increase in,
powers, subject, of course, to the Orders in Council and to the
authority of this Parliament. It is then suggested that there should be
an arbitrary date on which that is put before the Welsh
people.</p><p><a name="06071361000199"></a>Everyone knows that
referendums can be conditioned by a range of issues in addition to the
matter in hand. It seems to me a denial of devolution to suggest that
politicians should abrogate any responsibility for deciding the date,
to say to the National Assembly that it should have no say on the date,
and that the date should be imposed on it and the Welsh people by the
very Parliament from which the Assembly is seeking enhanced
powers.</p><p><a name="06071361000200"></a><b><a name="06071361001856"></a>Lord

I have listened to the Minister with great interest. Does he,
therefore, say that one should wait for a favourable time to set the
dates for local government elections so that the Government can be sure
of winning them? Should the European elections, the Scottish

Livsey of Talgarth:</b> My Lords, I thank the
Minister for his response. I hear what the noble Lord, Lord
Crickhowell, says. My noble friend Lord Thomas has dealt with that. The
Minister made a number of interesting points. First, he will know from
previous amendments, which are not tabled today, that we are not great
believers in referendums, which would affect some of the arguments that
he has just deployed. The most powerful argument against his position
is that the referendum date of 2011 is arbitrary. The situation is very
interesting. He referred to a referendum in 1997. One does not have to
be a brilliant mathematician to realise that he is saying that 14 years
after the last referendum is not the time at which to have another one
to decide whether the powers of the Welsh Assembly should be increased.
That is a long time between one referendum and another and public
opinion in Wales has changed.</p><p><a name="06071361000205"></a>In the most recent
opinion polls, a majority of Welsh people wanted primary powers for the
Welsh Assembly. They have been asked that question more than once in
well organised opinion polls. There are two sides to this argument.
Traditionally, Governments have had the power to decide when they wish
a referendum to be held; this amendment would merely straighten out
that situation and say that it would be reasonable to hold it in 2011
and that we should prepare for it now so that we have four years
lead-in time. Those are very reasonable arguments. However, having
listened to what both sides of the House have said about the amendment
and, as a realist, having considered the chances of getting it through,
I withdraw the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06071361000206"></a>Amendment, by leave,

Assembly passes a resolution in favour of a referendum by the requisite

The First Minister must give notice of the resolution to the Secretary
of State and then, within 120 days, the Secretary of State

a referendum to be held throughout Wales about whether the provisions
in Part 4 of the Act should come into force. That is a pr&#233;cis of
the procedure and I know that my noble friend Lord Crickhowell will
have some interesting comments to make on that process under the next
set of amendments. For the moment, let us assume, &#147;So far so
good&#148;. Precisely at this point I see the rub. Subsection (3)(a)
says that the Secretary of State must do that
or,<ul><a name="06071361000511"></a>&#147;(b) give notice
in writing to the First Minister of the Secretary of State&#146;s
refusal to do so and the reasons for that refusal&#148;.</ul><notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_852"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 852</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><a name="06071361000482"></a>The First Minister's duty then is to lay
a copy of the notice before the Assembly and its duty is to see that it
is published so that the people of Wales know why the Secretary of
State is refusing a referendum on whether the Assembly should be
granted greater powers as specified in Part
4.<p><a name="06071361000210"></a>As some
of us have noted, particularly the Liberal Democrats under another set
of amendments, the Secretary of State has truly astonishing
interventionist powers under the Bill. He can slam on the brakes,
bringing the Assembly to a grinding halt, and not only when it is
calling for a referendum; he has a similar power to stop the Assembly
in its tracks in Clause 95 relating to Orders in Council amending
Schedule 5 to change the fields of Assembly measures. Clause 95(7)
allows the Secretary of State 60 days to lay a draft before each House
of Parliament or to give notice of his refusal to do so, giving the
reasons why. Again, under Clause 101, the Secretary of State can, by
order, prohibit the Clerk from submitting a proposed Assembly measure
for approval by Her Majesty in Council.</p><p><a name="06071361000211"></a>Those almost autocratic powers to
intervene might be justifiable in the context of the devilish
complexities of Part 3, but surely not in connection with Part 4, which
is much more straightforward. However, the powers are there, too. The
Secretary of State can not only stop a referendum, but later, when the
Assembly has fulsome legislative powers and is in full swing, under
Clause 114(2) he can make an order prohibiting the Clerk from
submitting a Bill for Royal Assent. As my noble friend Lord Kingsland
said on our second day on
Report:</p><ul><a name="06071361000512"></a>&#147;The real shift
in power is from this Parliament to the Executive and the Secretary of
State&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 28/6/06; col.
1237.]</ul><a name="06071361000483"></a>Never were truer words
uttered.
<p><a name="06071361000212"></a>Indeed, the more I
think about it, the more extraordinary I find this interventionist role
for the Secretary of State, and I know that others, including the noble
Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, find this centralist thrust almost
offensive. It certainly would be offensive to a genuine devolutionist.
In fairness, I am bound to say that there is a similar power in Section
35 of the Scotland Act for the Secretary of State to prevent a Scottish
Parliament Bill from receiving Royal Assent, but the circumstances for
intervention in that case are much more specific&#151;they are where
a Bill is incompatible with international obligations or has adverse
effects on the law relating to reserved
matters.</p><p><a name="06071361000213"></a>I shall concentrate the
rest of my remarks, which I hope will be brief, on the Secretary of
State&#146;s right to refuse a referendum when two-thirds of the
Assembly have voted for it. That is a special category of intervention.
What could be the reasons for refusing such a request if the proposal
was acceptable to the Assembly and the electors of Wales? When one has
dismissed potential natural calamities of tsunami dimensions, such as
the drowning of the Assembly in Cardiff bay, one returns to the
possible political scenario that might induce the Secretary of State to
refuse to lay an order requested by the Assembly before each House of
this Parliament. The fact that 
<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_853"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 853</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>such an order might be voted down in either House would not, in my view,
be a sufficient reason to refuse to lay it.</p><p><a name="06071361000214"></a>The only credible reason for the
Secretary of State&#146;s refusal that I can imagine is that the
Government of the day do not approve of the Assembly&#146;s decision
to go for a referendum and are determined to resist it at all costs.
But is it really necessary to spell out the overriding interventionist
power of the Secretary of State and central Government quite so
blatantly in an allegedly devolutionary measure? I do not think so,
which is why the amendment proposes the excision of the words. If the
Government of the day oppose the Assembly&#146;s will to hold a
referendum, they can defeat the order in another place or even in your
Lordships&#146; House. Surely Parliament is the proper body to
overrule the Assembly on a matter such as this, rather than the
Secretary of State. This Parliament continues to have an override
power, as it does in Scotland, even when Part 4 comes into effect. I
beg to move.</p><p><a name="06071361000215"></a><b><a name="06071361001862"></a>Lord
Livsey of Talgarth:</b> My Lords, we support this
amendment, and it is a pleasant duty to do so, given the exchanges that
took place earlier. There is clear agreement between us on the
importance of this amendment, which addresses the ability of the
Secretary of State to refuse to lay an Order in Council before
Parliament if the Assembly has passed a resolution asking for a
referendum to be held. On report, we agreed that a two-thirds majority
is appropriate, but others did not agree. Given that that is now in the
Bill, it is nothing short of scandalous that the Secretary of State has
the power to deny such a request.</p><p><a name="06071361000216"></a>Either there is a belief in democracy or
there is not. The process in the Bill is clearly not democratic, as the
Secretary of State can veto an Order in Council for a referendum to be
held. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, has deployed all the
arguments about why that is wrong, and I do not wish to delay the House
further. I entirely agree with him that a referendum is a special
category and that to deny a referendum is not appropriate. He is
clearly also right to say that only Parliament should have the power to
overrule the Assembly in such a situation. Therefore, we support the

Rowlands:</b> My Lords, that begs
the question. The Executive to which these powers are being transferred
are the same as the Executive here at Westminster: they are answerable
and accountable to an elected Assembly. They have to get measures
through using procedure that is almost identical to that used here for
primary legislation. We are handing powers to an Executive in the Welsh
Assembly and that Executive are directly accountable and answerable to
that elected Assembly. That is not a shift of power to an Executive; it
is a shift of power from this Parliament to the Welsh Assembly, from
this Executive to the Executive in Cardiff. That is not centralising;
it is genuine devolution. This is a devolution Bill and should not be
portrayed in any other way.</p><p><a name="06071361000220"></a>The
Secretary of State&#146;s power was portrayed in speeches from the
opposition Benches as an autocratic decision made by one person. If a
Secretary of State made a decision not to put an order before
Parliament, he or she would be reflecting not a personal view, but the
view of the Government of the United Kingdom, which would presumably
hold a majority in this Parliament. Therefore, it does not seem
unreasonable that the Secretary of State of the day should be made to
give reasons for doing that.</p><p><a name="06071361000221"></a>We all accept that the
situation would be extraordinary, but this amendment would remove the
provision requiring the Secretary of State who took such an
extraordinary decision&#151;presumably with the full authority of the
United Kingdom Cabinet and Government at Westminster&#151;to explain
why he or she would not bring an order before both Houses. It seems
reasonable to have a provision requiring the Secretary of State to give
reasons for doing that, because I agree that it would be an
extraordinary situation and something of a constitutional crisis, given
that the United Kingdom Government would be overriding the request and
the clear wish of the Welsh
Assembly.</p><p><a name="06071361000222"></a>There are two rights
here. There are two democracies. There are occasions when we talk
almost as if the only democrats who exist are in the Welsh Assembly.
There are democrats here who are elected and have a right to express
their views. If the United Kingdom Government of the day, for the most
extraordinary reasons, which I find difficult to envisage, decided that
they could not support the call for a referendum at that time, it is
perfectly reasonable that provision should be made requiring the
Secretary of State, on behalf of the United Kingdom, to give his
reasons and to explain them clearly.</p><p><a name="06071361000223"></a><b><a name="06071361001866"></a>Lord

that it would be for Parliament to block the referendum, not a
Secretary of State expressing the UK Government&#146;s point of view?
As the noble Lord says, one would envisage that the UK Government would
be supported with a majority in Parliament. The matter would therefore
be subject to debate, but they would have their

that Government had a majority in the House, the inevitable consequence
would be a defeat of the order. We should be more realistic about party
politics. If one could not persuade the Secretary of State and the
United Kingdom Government of the day, it would be almost a nonsense to
bring an order before the House unless one thought that there was going
to be genuine rebellion of one kind or another that could overturn the

the exchange that has just taken place and the arguments advanced at an
earlier stage of our proceedings by the Minister, who basically said
that the role of the Secretary of State is to find out what the rest of
the United Kingdom thinks and then express those views&#151;really,
therefore, to decide whether there should be an English veto over the

the Secretary of State can refuse to lay the order in the first place
and therefore cut off any chance of its proceeding. My response to the
Minister is that of course the Secretary of State can consult and
report to Parliament what in his and the Government&#146;s judgment
are the views and opinions in England. Surely it is then for
Parliament, in this House and in another place, to listen to those
arguments and to decide on their validity; it is for Parliament to
weigh up whether it should take more account of the views of the rest
of the United Kingdom put to them by the Secretary of State than of the
views of the Welsh Assembly, which would have requested that the
referendum be held. It would be open to Parliament to say no to the
Welsh Assembly, although in my judgment it would be unwise to veto the
proposal at that stage if the request had been made.</p><p><a name="06071361000227"></a>I believe that my noble
friend is right in seeking to delete the power of the Secretary of
State to say no. Of course the Secretary of State can express his
opinion and report on the outcome of his consultations, but surely it
is then for Parliament&#151;the other place in particular, in this
case&#151;to decide on the merits of the order. That is a perfectly
adequate
defence.</p><p><a name="06071361000228"></a><b><a name="06071361001869"></a>Lord
Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, we have had an
interesting debate on this important amendment. As far as the
Government are concerned, this is not an issue of seeking to aggrandise
the Secretary of State, but we think there is an issue of
constitutional principle here, and that is what I want to
defend.</p><p><a name="06071361000229"></a>I
also want to disabuse the House of the notion that the amendment would
be an essential defence against a Government who were hostile to a
referendum being conducted in Wales, and so should be put in the Bill.
The simple fact is that if a Government were hostile to a referendum
and potential progress on devolution, they would just produce primary
legislation to take 
<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_856"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 856</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>out Part 4 of the Bill entirely. If they were set upon that course,
nothing would prevent them so doing, provided they could command a
majority in both Houses. The amendment cannot stand as the essential
defence against such action and should not be supported as such,
because it will not provide that defence.</p><p><a name="06071361000230"></a>I agree with all
noble Lords who have spoken that it would be a somewhat unwise
Secretary of State who sought to block a referendum when the National
Assembly had expressed itself in these terms by a two-thirds majority.
Nevertheless, we think that the Secretary of State should have some
discretion in this matter and be able to take account of the views
expressed in consultation. If the order is to be laid before
Parliament, that is the proper responsibility of the Minister of the
Crown. It is not constitutionally defensible for the Assembly to be
able to demand that the Secretary of State does this regardless of
whether he has the will to do so. That is an important constitutional
point.</p><p><a name="06071361000231"></a>I am
not opposing the amendment on the grounds that the Bill needs a new
roadblock against devolution. I cannot foresee the circumstances in
which a Secretary of State would take such action when faced, as I have
indicated, with a majority decision of the Assembly, but there are
proper lines of constitutional accountability, which is why the
Secretary of State&#146;s position needs to be defined in these
terms.</p><p><a name="06071361000232"></a>There are also genuine
practical reasons why the Secretary of State should not be constrained
to lay a draft order within 120 days, as the amendment requires. He or
she would still have to comply with the requirements of Clause 103
before doing so, including possibly the preparation of the draft order
itself and statutory consultation. It would also be the case that the
draft order would be laid before the Assembly before it was laid before
Parliament. The amendment would leave no scope for altering that
timescale should it not be possible to complete all those steps within
120 days.</p><p><a name="06071361000233"></a><b><a name="06071361001870"></a>Lord
Roberts of Conwy:</b> My Lords, I must point out that
the 120 days is actually the Government&#146;s proposal in Clause
104.</p><p><a name="06071361000234"></a><b><a name="06071361001871"></a>Lord
Davies of Oldham:</b> Of course it is, my Lords, but
I am indicating that within this framework we need discretion for the
Secretary of State. If the120 days were not long enough in
practice, it would be perfectly possible for the Secretary of State to
say to the First Minister that the draft order could not be laid at
that moment. The amendment does not take any account of difficulties of
that kind.</p><p><a name="06071361000235"></a>We
cannot foresee the circumstances in which the Assembly might have
arrived at its two-thirds majority. There are practical issues. We
properly require some discretion for the Secretary of State because
constitutionally it is he, at the end of the day, who is responsible to
Parliament for actions that are taken. The amendment takes that power
from the Secretary of State.</p><p><a name="06071361000236"></a><b><a name="06071361001872"></a>Lord

sovereign? I

says that the Secretary of State cannot be told to do
something.</p><p><a name="06071361000237"></a><b><a name="06071361001873"></a>Lord
Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, of course I am not
gainsaying the sovereignty of Parliament. In fact, as the noble Lord
will recognise, in my opening remarks I said that the obligation is on
the Secretary of State to lay the order before Parliament&#151;the
sovereign body&#151;and not to be dictated to by the National
Assembly, which would be the effect of the amendment. Under the
amendment, the Secretary of State would be obliged to deliver the order
within the timescale specified with no
discretion.</p><p><a name="06071361000238"></a><b><a name="06071361001874"></a>Lord
Thomas of Gresford:</b> My Lords, surely if
Parliament has laid down that mechanism in the Act, there is no
question of the Welsh Assembly dictating to the Secretary of State, it
is just fulfilling the mechanism that Parliament has given to
it.</p><p><a name="06071361000239"></a><b><a name="06071361001875"></a>Lord
Davies of Oldham:</b> But, my
Lords, within the Bill, which I and, I hope, the noble Lord, want to be
enacted in the fairly near future, we seek to preserve the proper
constitutional responsibility of the Secretary of State for tabling of
orders to the sovereign Parliament, because he is answerable to it in a
way that the National Assembly clearly is not. The amendment will not
achieve what it appears to be intended to do&#151;to guarantee that
no government could interfere with the process if it were hostile to
what the National Assembly sought. The Government would have other
powers by which to carry out their will if, misguidedly, they decided
so to do.</p>

<p><a name="06071361000240"></a>It is essential that
the constitutional requirements and role of the Secretary of State are
preserved. On that basis, I ask the noble Lord to withdraw his
amendment.</p><p><a name="06071361000241"></a><b><a name="06071361001876"></a>Lord
Roberts of Conwy:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to all
those who have participated in this debate, especially to those who
have supported the amendment, which I am convinced is absolutely right
for the simple reason that the Bill spells out the proper procedure. It
is not an easy procedure to follow, as we have already established. The
two-thirds majority hurdle must be overcome in the Assembly. It is not
just two-thirds of those who vote, it is two-thirds of the seats. That
means that 40 out of 60 Members must vote for the Motion. Then, to
abbreviate the procedure, the resolution must be approved by both
Houses of this Parliament. It seems to me that the role of the
Secretary of State in interfering in that process&#151;the cut-off
power that has been referred to, the power to say no and to veto the
Assembly&#146;s wish&#151;deprives these Houses of Parliament of
their right to say no. For that reason, I seek to test the opinion of
the House.</p><h5><a name="06071361000598"></a>1.44

AmendmentNo. 11, I shall not reopen any of the arguments that
we had at an earlier stage of the Bill. These are drafting amendments,
which are appropriate for 
<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_860"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 860</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Part 3 and which attempt to introduce a tiny additional element of
clarity into two subsections that are extremely complex and difficult
to understand. They might be clearer if they were in reverse order, but
it is worth going over the procedures that must be followed to trigger
a referendum, if only to show just how complicated the matter is and
because, even after re-reading the subsections a dozen times, I may
still have got them wrong.</p><p><a name="06071361000247"></a>As I
understand it, the first step is that the Assembly passes a resolution,
moved by a Minister, with a two-thirds majority and recommending an
Order in Council. The second step is that the First Minister must give
notice of that fact to the Secretary of State. That triggers two
actions. First, under Clause 103(6), the Secretary of State
undertakes,</p><ul><a name="06071361000575"></a>&#147;such
consultation as the Secretary of State considers
appropriate&#148;.</ul><a name="06071361000484"></a>Until
he has done so, no draft statutory instrument can be laid before
Parliament or the Assembly. Then, as we heard in the previous debate,
he must lay a draft statutory instrument before each House of
Parliament within 120 days. Until a moment or two ago, I would have had
to add, &#147;or give notice of his refusal to do so&#148;, but
that position has altered in the light of the amendment that has just
been carried. <p><a name="06071361000248"></a>Then we get to
a rather curious position; it is worth going over this ground, if only
because I suspect the Government may attempt in another place to go
back to the position that we have just amended and return these
amendments to us. If the Secretary of State refuses to lay a draft
statutory instrument before both Houses of Parliament, he must inform
the Assembly of his refusal and of his reasons for it. Curiously,
however, he is not required to tell the Assembly that he has approved a
draft statutory instrument and has laid it before both Houses of
Parliament.</p><p><a name="06071361000249"></a>The Assembly must
now approve the draft order and, for the second time, achieve a
two-thirds majority. The first was at the start of the resolution
process; the second is to approve the draft order. Assuming that it
does so and that both Houses of Parliament do likewise, we go back to
Clause 103(1), in
which,</p><ul><a name="06071361000576"></a>&#147;Her Majesty
may by Order in Council cause a referendum to be
held&#148;.</ul><a name="06071361000485"></a>My amendment
would merely introduce a little clarity into at least part of the
procedure. It suggests that the Secretary of State should actually
inform the Assembly that he has laid orders before both Houses of
Parliament, and presumably should give it the details of those orders
so that the order laid before the Assembly is the same order, and
should request it to lay the order. It is odd that the refusal to lay
the order is in the clause, but there is no requirement that the
Secretary of State should tell the Assembly in effect, &#147;Okay, we
have got to the next step. You must now lay the order and have the
opportunity to vote on it for the second time&#148;.
<p><a name="06071361000250"></a>I had not recognised before I read the
two subsections a dozen times and attempted to understand them that the
Assembly has to give its approval twice by a two-thirds majority before
we can get to the Assembly stage. I would not change the

a requirement is written into the Bill that the Secretary of State
informs the Assembly that he is laying the order before both Houses of
Parliament and asks that it should do the same in the Assembly so that
we can complete the whole process. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06071361000251"></a><b><a name="06071361001878"></a>Lord
Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the
noble Lord for raising this issue and I do not think there is any
difference in intention between the Government and what the noble Lord
has expressed in terms of the process that should be conducted. We
think that we have described in the Bill a process which ought to
assuage his anxieties about these issues, although I recognise that
with his amendment he is seeking to be more
specific.</p><p><a name="06071361000252"></a>In practice, the
sequence of events for approving a draft referendum Order in Council
will be that the statutory consultation would take place first, and
then the draft laid before the Assembly for approval because if it were
not approved by a two-thirds majority, that would be the end of it. If
it is approved, the Secretary of State would lay the draft before both
Houses of Parliament for approval. That was the process we envisaged in
the Bill until the recent amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Roberts. It
is not necessary for Clause 104 to repeat the provisions of Clause 103.
Clause 104(3)(a) refers to a draft referendum order under Clause
103(1). That reference attracts the rest of the provisions of Clause
103 and it is clear that all the provisions set out in that clause must
be complied with in order to hold a referendum. Clause 103 governs the
process. It is therefore not necessary to spell out that the Secretary
of State must communicate the results of the consultation exercise to
the Assembly. If the outcome of that consultation were to lead to the
Secretary of State not laying a draft order before Parliament, that
would be made clear in the reasons given to the Assembly under Clause
104.</p><p><a name="06071361000253"></a>What we do expect is for
the Secretary of State to be in close contact with the Assembly First
Minister on the most important issue that the Assembly is likely to
consider. We naturally would expect the Secretary of State to inform
the First Minister of when the consultation had been completed and its
results, simply a matter of good governance and proper administration.
The aim of the legislation as drafted is to set out a minimum of what
must be done rather than to spell out in every detail the process which
needs to be carried out
administratively.</p><p><a name="06071361000254"></a>I hear what
the noble Lord says and understand that he is seeking to be helpful and
constructive here, but I think we have it right in these two clauses.
We have described the essential process, but the nature of the
administration is a matter for governance and administration, and
therefore does not need to be spelt out in the Bill. I hope the noble
Lord will see that we are of like minds on what should happen and is
destined to happen, without the need for an additional
amendment.</p><p><a name="06071361000255"></a><b><a name="06071361001879"></a>Lord
Crickhowell:</b> My Lords, I observed earlier that
one of the difficulties here is that we start with Clause 104 and then
have to refer back to Clause 103, 
<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_862"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 862</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a point made by the noble Lord. It is one of those back-to-front
arrangements of clauses that appears in the Bill not only on this
occasion, which makes it quite difficult to interpret. The noble Lord
has not said anything to sustain an argument for not including my
helpful clarification. While I have not attempted in any way to alter
the Bill, it would make the situation a bit clearer. I therefore regret
that he does not eagerly accept my amendment, which would have been the
simple thing to do and would have brought a little satisfaction to me.
We could have finished the Third Reading in a welter of harmony and
happiness, but since he will not do that, I hope that I have at least
been able to clarify exactly what the arrangements and procedures are.

quality of water in
England&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06071361000267"></a>My aim in
proposing the amendment is simple: we want to establish a principle to
provide for equality between England and Wales so far as water is
concerned. We believe that this is a very reasonable matter to be
asking for. Subsection (3) of the amendment
states:</p><ul><a name="06071361000522"></a>&#147;In considering
whether or not to continue exercising that function, the Assembly shall
have regard to&#151;</ul><ul><a name="06071361000580"></a>(a)
the representations made by the Secretary of State under subsection

impact that would be had on Welsh water by the discontinuation of the
relevant
function&#148;.</ul><a name="06071361000487"></a>In other
words, precisely the same situation as that which applies to water that
runs to England. Water is indivisible since it usually runs down into
the same river system.<p><a name="06071361000268"></a>Surely
it is right to achieve equality of the law, whether it is in England or
Wales. River catchment areas flow from one country to another. Yet as
the Bill is currently constituted, &#147;adverse impact&#148; is
drafted only as it applies to England. As a Welshman I find the
distinction rather extraordinary, so that if we can appeal to the
English sense of fair play, we believe that equality must be the
answer. In fact, the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, tabled an
amendment on Welsh water. I refer to one sentence from his
contribution. He said very forcefully indeed that the power and scope
of the Secretary of State&#146;s jurisdiction in this matter is
enormous. Without our amendment, this clause does not do justice to
Wales.</p><p><a name="06071361000269"></a>If one looks at the Bill
from the point of view held on these Benches, we see no primary
legislative powers yet. We have had long debates about when we might
possibly get them. We have government responses that appear to say,
&#147;But you might get some of these things&#148;. We cannot say
that the Government are actually denying us primary legislative powers
because of the Bill&#146;s ingenious process to pass at least Orders
in Council, but it is not the type of legislative powers that we
advocate. We believe that we do not have a fair voting system. We also
believe that the Secretary of State has an over-burdening influence, as
we have heard, on refusals, although we have just recently overcome
that provision in a vote. There is also a veto on Assembly measures by
either House of Parliament&#151;an issue that we could debate for
some time.</p><p><a name="06071361000270"></a>Surely the Government
must recognise that the issue of water in Wales, and the lack of
equality with England, amounts to playing with fire. Water is one of
the few remaining Welsh resources, but as far as one can see, as the
Bill is drafted, even the Assembly will have no influence over it. An
opinion poll was reported over the weekend that seemed to show that the
people of England now favour, albeit marginally, the creation of an
English Parliament. That is certainly not our policy, which is for
regional parliaments in England, but if the percentage is creeping up
over 50 per cent, as it seems to be, and if we have a new Government
who are of a different persuasion, there could be an English Parliament
with massive legislative powers. To slightly

naked into the Assembly Chamber without the necessary powers. And that
could apply especially to water, a basic resource. That would leave
Assembly Members with little or no power over basic resources in their
own country. I find that totally unacceptable.</p><p><a name="06071361000271"></a>In this amendment we are simply making a
plea: please can we have equality in the clause? Water in Wales and
water in England should be treated in the same way. The water issue
should not be excluded from the Bill. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06071361000272"></a><b><a name="06071361001883"></a>Lord
Roberts of Conwy:</b> My Lords,
very briefly, I have some sympathy with the amendment because I am
antipathetic to the clause, which appears to be based on central
Government&#146;s most profound suspicions of the Assembly and its
Ministers in matters relating to water. What wickedness do the
Government think Welsh Ministers might perpetrate that could have
such,</p><ul><a name="06071361000582"></a>&#147;a serious
adverse impact
on&#148;,</ul><a name="06071361000488"></a>water resources
supply and water quality in England as to warrant the brisk
intervention and possible takeover of functions by the Secretary of
State? The mind boggles.
<p><a name="06071361000273"></a>I agree with the noble
Lord, Lord Livsey, that the clause seems excessive in another way: it
concentrates on England's water interests and ignores Welsh interests
entirely. I therefore sympathise with the spirit of the amendment, and
I shall await the Government&#146;s justification of this rigorous
clause.</p><h5><a name="06071361000600"></a>2.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06071361000274"></a><b><a name="06071361001884"></a>Lord
Roberts of Llandudno:</b> My Lords, those of us who
live in Wales, or visit it, can still see the slogan after 40 years,
&#147;<I>Cofia Tryweryn</I>&#148;&#151;remember Tryweryn. That
valley was drowned 40 years ago to provide a reservoir to serve the
city of Liverpool. That act triggered great discontent and anger in
Wales. Every Welsh Member of Parliament voted against the proposal, but
their voices were not listened to. It was only last year that, under
the guidance of the then leader of Liverpool City Council, Councillor
Mike Storey, that Liverpool apologised for the insensitive way that its
predecessor council had acted. To allow this Government of Wales Bill
to have its Third Reading without this amendment is again most
insensitive and needlessly provocative.</p><p><a name="06071361000275"></a>All we ask is that the
needs of water provision for Wales be treated equally with the needs of
England. So many of the natural resources of Wales&#151;its coal
mining, its quarrying industry, the greatest iron and steel
manufacturing base in the world, the once great ports of Cardiff and
Swansea&#151;belong to the past. Time and again Wales' confidence and
dignity have been undermined. Sometimes we concern ourselves with the
effect on people who have lost their sense of self-worth and value, but
that can happen also to nations. I would suggest in supporting the
amendment that to deny Wales a substantial voice in the provision of
water within its own borders not only is insensitive but also once
again undermines the dignity of the Welsh
nation.</p><notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_865"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 865</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071361000276"></a><b><a name="06071361001885"></a>Lord
Thomas of Gresford:</b> My Lords, I support the
amendment. It so happens that my daughter-in-law&#146;s family farm
was drowned in Tryweryn, to which the noble Lord referred a moment ago,
and I am very conscious of the impact that that has had on the
community there. Subsequently I appeared with my noble friend Lord
Hooson on behalf of the objectors to the proposal to drown the Dulas
Valley, south of Llanidloes. It was a hotly fought battle between the
local community and the city of Birmingham, which wished to drown it. I
am happy to say that the then Secretary of State for Wales upheld the
inspector's recommendation that that valley should not be drowned and
that no other valley in Wales would be drowned in this way ever again.
It was a Labour Secretary of State who said it and we would hold this
Government to the promise.</p><p><a name="06071361000277"></a>It is a highly emotive
issue. When we see such a clause in the Bill, as the noble Lord, Lord
Roberts, said a moment ago, we wonder what is going on. Why should
there be a specific reference to what remains a large natural resource
in Wales? I fully support the amendment.</p><p><a name="06071361000278"></a><b><a name="06071361001886"></a>Lord
Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> My Lords, when the noble
Lord, Lord Livsey, rose to his feet he said that we had a debate on
this very late at night. My memory is that it was a very full and
interesting discussion even though it was late at night. All of the
issues which have come up today were raised in that late-evening
debate. As we heard, Amendment No. 14 would remove the Secretary of
State's power to intervene in the exercise of functions by the Welsh
Ministers or others where it appears to him or her that that might have
a serious impact on water resources supply or quality in England. That
power would be replaced by a duty to make representations to the
Assembly in such circumstances.</p><p><a name="06071361000279"></a>As I highlighted on
Report, the subject of this clause is executive functions. After the
separation brought about by the Bill, the Assembly will cease to be a
corporate body and the executive functions will become the preserve of
Welsh Ministers, not the Assembly. Therefore, the Assembly cannot
decide whether to continue exercising the function or have regard to
the representations of the Secretary of State. The Assembly will not be
exercising this function. That said, Welsh Ministers will in the
exercise of their functions relating to water have to have regard to
the impact on Welsh water. Of course the Secretary of State will make
representations to the Welsh Ministers on a government-to-government
basis if they are considering an action that could have an adverse
effect on English water.</p><p><a name="06071361000280"></a>I

The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, quoted the noble Lord, Lord

which I think has a very precise bearing on the issue we are
discussing.</p><notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_866"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 866</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071361000283"></a><b><a name="06071361001889"></a>Lord
Prys-Davies:</b> My Lords,
reference has been made to my noble friend Lord Elystan-Morgan. He very
much regrets that he is unable to be present today, but he is presiding
over the degree-awarding ceremony at the University of Wales,
Aberystwyth, which is a very important event in the university
calendar.</p><p><a name="06071361000284"></a><b><a name="06071361001890"></a>Lord
Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> My Lords, I am grateful
to my noble friend for drawing that to our
attention.</p><p><a name="06071361000285"></a>The point that I was
making was that the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, quoted the noble Lord,
Lord Elystan-Morgan, who said something else on
Report&#151;that:</p><ul><a name="06071361000523"></a>&#147;If
there ever was an attempt to aggrandise a Welsh valley in the way that
Liverpool did almost 50 years ago, it would be the biggest boost to
Welsh nationalism that has ever occurred&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official
Report</I>, 28/6/06; col.
1289.]</ul><a name="06071361000489"></a>The Government
entirely agree. It is almost inconceivable that a future Secretary of
State, from whatever party, would behave in such a recklessly
provocative and incendiary fashion. I cannot imagine the circumstances
that arose with the Liverpool example 40 years ago ever being
repeated.<p><a name="06071361000286"></a>The
Government&#146;s expectation is that, if differences arose between
the two Governments, every possible effort would be made to resolve
them through discussion and dialogue, with both sides fully aware of
the sensitivities involved. A number of noble Lords have raised the
business of equality&#151;that all that Wales wishes for is equality
with England. It is important to remember that, if the relevant
Secretary of State intervened, he or she would have to take into
account the interests of England and Wales. Under the present
settlement, that is the constitutional position. There is no reason for
noble Lords, particularly those from Wales, to be as concerned as they
are. It is still necessary for the Secretary of State to have the power
to intervene as a last resort if agreement is not reached and he or she
believes that the actions of Welsh Ministers will have a serious impact
on water resources, supply or quality in England.</p><p><a name="06071361000287"></a>A crucial point made on
Report&#151;I think it was by the noble Lord, Lord
Crickhowell&#151;was that the geological nature of Wales was not
linked to the political map, and the geological reality is that the
great rivers of Wales flow into England and not the other way round.
Equally, a large part of the water supply to England comes from Wales,
but Wales does not rely for a large part of its water supply on
England, if any part at all. The provision reflects the way in which
most of the water flows&#151;out of Wales and into England, and not
the other way round. The Bill has to provide for the intervention
powers because of that reality. Matters such as the approval of
significant new development by Welsh Ministers could have a serious
adverse effect on water resources, supply or quality in
England.</p><p><a name="06071361000288"></a>The intervention
powers provide an important and effective safeguard for the interests
of water users in England, but there is no reason to expect that the
Assembly or Welsh Ministers would use their powers irresponsibly and
that the intervention powers would need to be used other than as a very
last resort. As we have had another interesting debate on the subject,

Lord will feel able to withdraw the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06071361000289"></a><b><a name="06071361001891"></a>Lord
Livsey of Talgarth:</b> My Lords, we have indeed had
an interesting debate, and a number of assumptions have been made. I
particularly thank the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, for
sympathising with our amendment. I am sure that he heard what the
Minister said about it; the noble Lord said that he was going to wait
for that. I thank my noble friends Lord Roberts of Llandudno and Lord
Thomas of Gresford for their personal appeal on the issue and for
underlining its importance in Wales. I reiterate that, in spite of what
the Minister said about executive functions, if the Assembly expressed
a substantial opinion about water it is unlikely that the Executive
would disagree.</p><p><a name="06071361000290"></a>We do not
understand the approach to the issue of equality. All that we ask for
is equality. The Minister rightly quoted other comments that the noble
Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, made during our recent debate. However, it
looks to me as though we cannot even get equality; that is basically
what we have been told. Of course the geological reality is that water
flows into England, but the Bill protects England while Wales is
ignored. I wish to test the opinion of the House on the issue, which is
vital to those of us in
Wales.</p><h5><a name="06071361000601"></a>2.26

No. 17clarifies an uncertainty about the timing of the transfer
of functions from the old Assembly to Welsh Ministers. It makes it
clear that, in general, the provisions of the Bill come into force,
including relevant amendments to and repeals of other enactments, when
functions of the old Assembly transfer to Welsh Ministers.</p><p><a name="06071361000298"></a>Amendment No. 18 amends
the Statutory Instruments Act 1946 to provide a procedure for the
revocation of a statutory instrument made jointly by Welsh Ministers
and a Minister of the Crown which is annulled by the Assembly. Her
Majesty, by Order in Council, would revoke such an instrument.
Amendment No. 19 amends the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 to
give Assembly Members the same protection as MPs and MSPs in relation
to breach of copyright during proceedings. Amendment No. 20replaces references to the Assembly with references to Welsh
Ministers in the Official Secrets Act

Nos. 21 and 26repeal Section 154(3)(a) of the Government of

after this Bill comes into force. Amendment No. 22removes a
potential lacuna to ensure that any functions vested in the old
Assembly during the gap between the May 2007 election and the
appointment of the First Minister can be exercised by the former
Ministers. Although unlikely, this might be necessary in an
emergency.</p><p><a name="06071361000300"></a>Amendment
No. 23clarifies the provisions which ensure that the effect of

will be preserved when the Welsh Ministers assume the Executive
functions of the current Assembly. Amendments Nos. 24 and 25remove any doubt about the procedure governing subordinate
legislation made by Welsh Ministers to implement Community law. It is
the procedure set out in Clause 59 and not the procedure in Schedule
11. I beg to

Amendments Nos. 2 to 6.</p><p><a name="06071361000327"></a>The
amendment concerns the annual canvass of the Northern Ireland
electorate for the purposes of the electoral register. The Bill
proposes a canvass every 10 years. We think that is too long a period
and our amendments are designed to reduce the intervals to every five
years. We referred to this issue in Grand Committee and I have nothing
further to add to what I said there. It is a question of where you draw
the line. We think that 10 years is much too long. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06071361000328"></a><b><a name="06071361001902"></a>Lord
Glentoran:</b> My Lords, I support
the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Clifton. As the noble Lord has
already said, we had a long debate in Committee and we also believe
that 10 years is far too long. I also agree with the Government that
one year is far too short because it is expensive and impractical. If I
remember right, we felt at the Committee stage that some form of
compromise between one year and 10 years would be the right way to go.
The amendments seem to cover the right number of election periods and
would allow the electoral officer time to get his or her 
<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_872"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 872</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>feet under the table and to get a grip of the electorate and the
register. Because of the considerable movement of the electorate in
Northern Ireland&#151;with students growing up and going abroad,
people coming in, families moving and so on, it is a very mobile
electorate&#151;we feel that 10 years is much too long and five years
is probably an appropriate
compromise.</p><p><a name="06071361000329"></a><b><a name="06071361001903"></a>Lord
Rooker:</b> My Lords, as I will probably say quite a
few times today, as I said in Grand Committee where these amendments
were also tabled, under the new arrangements, the Chief Election
Officer&#146;s enhanced data sharing powers will replace the canvass
as the central means by which he will ensure the accuracy and
comprehensiveness of the Northern Ireland
register.</p><p><a name="06071361000330"></a>The provision to hold
the canvass every tenth year is the backstop to underpin confidence and
provide a safeguard for these new arrangements. It will no longer,
however, provide the substantive means of refreshing the register,
which will be done on an ongoing basis under the new arrangements set
out under Clause 7. So it is not, as one might think from the brief
speeches, that we are simply abolishing registration and doing nothing
about it because the new arrangements are set out quite clearly under
Clause 7. Therefore no advantage would be gained from the canvass being
held on a more regular basis, only an unnecessary expenditure of
resources. In addition, the clause makes provision for a canvass to be
held in any year if the Chief Elections Officer makes a recommendation
to the Secretary of State by 15 April that year and the Secretary of
State is satisfied that the public interest requires the
canvass.</p><p><a name="06071361000331"></a>Clause 3 also makes
clear that the Government&#146;s intention is that there will be a
canvass in 2010, by which point we hope that the new arrangements will
be fully embedded and everyone will be able to see that. However,
should the elections officer feel that a canvass is not necessary at
that time in order for him to meet the relevant registration
objectives&#151;perhaps on the basis that he feels the register is
comprehensive and accurate and would not be improved significantly by
the canvass&#151;he would be able to recommend to the Secretary of
State that a canvass should not take place in 2010. In the case of such
a recommendation&#151;and only in that case&#151;the Secretary of
State will be able to make an order to remove the requirement for a
canvass in 2010. That decision of the Secretary of State will be
subject to approval by each House of Parliament here at
Westminster.</p><p><a name="06071361000332"></a>Canvasses are
resource intensive, both in labour and money, and it is only right that
the Chief Elections Officer should be able to decide how his resources
would be best deployed in determining whether or not a canvass is
necessary in 2010&#151;which, of course, is only four years after the
final annual canvass as planned under the legislation. In addition,
Clause 3 also makes it clear that if there is no canvass in 2010 and
one has not been held before the end of 2015, one must be held in 2016,
which would of course be 10 years after the final annual canvass
proposed under the legislation presently before your Lordships&#146;
House.</p><notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_873"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 873</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071361000333"></a>We think that all the
mechanisms in place and the access to information set out in the Bill,
but not subject to these amendments, which were debated at some length
in Grand Committee, are such that we are confident that the Chief
Elections Officer can carry out a comprehensive canvass and keep it up
to date using all the means at his or her disposal. This would include
checking on the movements of people&#151;the noble Lord, Lord
Glentoran, said it is a moving population&#151;which have to be
recorded for all kinds of purposes. Whether it is rents for landlords,
local authority services and other such matters, the elections officer
will have access to that information for that purpose. Of course, he
will not have access to medical records and other such matters, but he
or she will have access to information to create an accurate register
in Northern Ireland and then have the means to keep it up to date.
Therefore we do not think these amendments are
required.</p><p><a name="06071361000334"></a><b><a name="06071361001904"></a>Lord
Smith of Clifton:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister

clearly been no shift in the Government&#146;s opinion in this
regard. This will put a very great responsibility on the electoral
registration officer and we must have faith in him or her that they
will be as diligent as they need to be. We would prefer a formal review

give us any specific assurance about the channels of communication set
up between the Electoral Commission here and agencies in the Republic
or about the conditions which Irish citizens will have to fulfil before
they can donate to a Northern Ireland party, we will have to reserve
our position.</p><p><a name="06071361000340"></a>At this stage, this is
a probing amendment. We want to hear from the Minister how the proposal
will operate in practice. I would be grateful if he could expand on

7. This is an important issue. At the end of the Committee stage, I
certainly did not feel that the Government had any idea how they were
going to manage this. The Minister was very keen to assure us that the
laws were sufficient safeguards and that our regulations would remain
consistent with those of the Republic of Ireland. My information, in
private discussions with Irish Government Members, does not encourage
me to think that way at all&#151;rather the reverse.</p><notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_874"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 874</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071361000342"></a>A number of serious
offences can be committed by a party in this area, including submitting
an inaccurate form and facilitating donations from impermissible
donors. People unconnected with the party can also commit offences.
That is all fairly familiar to us. It is an offence to withhold
information from a party about a possible illegal donation.</p><p><a name="06071361000343"></a>Can the Minister explain exactly who will
have responsibility for investigating all these possibilities in
Northern Ireland and abroad and when many of them will take place? Can
he explain exactly who will be making sure that political funds come
from legitimate sources, not bank robberies, illegal donations or
extortion money? Is the Electoral Commission to be given wide-ranging
new powers to travel abroad to ensure that the people involved are who
they claim to be, or will that role be delegated to the Irish
authorities or the authorities of the country in which the donor is
resident?</p><p><a name="06071361000344"></a>The recent
controversy over party fundraising merely serves to highlight how
important it is to maintain complete transparency about where parties
get their money from. Little more needs to be said. I do not believe
that the Government have a grip on this or that they understand how
they will manage this. I would like to hear it from the
Minister.</p><p><a name="06071361000345"></a><b><a name="06071361001907"></a>Lord
Rooker:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord has just raised
a point that he did not raise in Committee. It is not a feature of the
current controversy over donations to political parties. He actually
spoke about where the donor gets the money from. That is a new issue;
it has not been raised before. I cannot see how that can legitimately
be put on the agenda. Where the parties get their money from is one
thing, but asking where the donor got the money from is a different
kettle of fish altogether. I regret that I do not have a lot more to
say than I said in Grand Committee.</p><p><a name="06071361000346"></a>Amendment No. 8
requires the Secretary of State to report on the operation of the
provisions set out in Chapter 6, but the operation of these provisions
is a matter for the Electoral Commission. The commission is an
independent body, set up by Parliament, and it would not be appropriate
to require the Secretary of State to report in this way to the House on
the commission&#146;s work. There are plenty of opportunities for the
commission to be accountable for its responsibilities. Parliament has
set up the commission to do a job; it is not for the Secretary of State
to report on it or second-guess
it.</p><p><a name="06071361000347"></a>I appreciate the thrust of
both amendments and all those relating to donations in Northern
Ireland, which we debated at some length in Grand Committee. We have
considered the argument since 22 June when we debated these issues. We
think that we are right to resist the amendments for the reasons I
outlined then, which I will briefly reiterate.</p><p><a name="06071361000348"></a>I would welcome noble Lords accepting
that the Bill is a big step towards ending the current situation with
regard to political donations in Northern Ireland. The present
situation is untenable, unfair, undemocratic and hidden. The Bill is a
massive step towards changing that process. As usual, when you 
<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_875"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 875</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>give the Opposition a yard, they ask for a mile. That is what we used to
do in our 18 years in opposition, of course. But it would be nice if
people accepted that the Bill is a big step
forward.</p><p><a name="06071361000349"></a>As
was mentioned in Committee, the ending of the disapplication period is,
as the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, said, eagerly anticipated. Under
these provisions, the end is in sight. Following the end of
disapplication, Northern Ireland political parties and regulated donees
will continue to be able to accept donations from Irish citizens and
other Irish bodies which can currently donate to Irish parties in the
Republic. That is the Government&#146;s policy; it represents a
considerable narrowing of the regime as it exists, while ensuring that
the special place of Ireland in the political life of Northern Ireland
will continue to be respected.</p><p><a name="06071361000350"></a>We would like to stress that the precise
conditions setting out the eligibility criteria for donating to
Northern Ireland parties will be specified in legislation made in this
Parliament. That is one of the reasons why I do not have the details
with me today; we will be debating them at some time in the
future.</p><p><a name="06071361000351"></a>It is worth repeating
that legislation is not the end of the matter. This House will have the
opportunity to debate the proposals in considerable detail. The new
Chapter 6 inserted in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums
Act 2000 by Clause 12 makes it clear that the prescribed conditions
which additional categories of donors will have to meet can be
prescribed only by the Secretary of State following consultation with
the Electoral Commission. Such an order would have to be laid before
and approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament here at
Westminster. The conditions that these additional categories of donors
will have to comply with will therefore be fully and publicly debated
in both Houses at the time they are made. That is a big step forward
from the current position&#151;donations may come from anywhere and
anyone in the world, and there is no obligation on parties to disclose
them.</p><p><a name="06071361000352"></a>It is
scandalous that Northern Ireland has been allowed this period of time,
compared with Great Britain. We have to regulate the situation. As
Northern Ireland moves towards a normal civic society, they have to
start to work within normal civic rules, and one of those is that
donations to political parties are upfront and transparent. Like in
Great Britain, they cannot come from anybody, anywhere in the world.
However, no one is expecting the arrangements to be made
overnight.</p><p><a name="06071361000353"></a>Under
the new arrangements, donations to Northern Ireland parties, including
those from Irish donors, will be subject to regulation and verification
by the Electoral Commission until the end of the transitional period,
which we hope will be in 2010. Any impermissible donations will be
required to be returned to the donee, or
forfeited.</p><p><a name="06071361000354"></a><b><a name="06071361001908"></a>Lord

asked about setting out the conditions for eligibility in the Bill as
to how this will work in practice. I do not have the details yet; they
willcome to the House in the form of secondary legislation. We
need to consult further with the Electoral Commission and the Irish
Government. We have been consulting with them to get as far as we have
with this legislation, but we do not have all the i&#146;s dotted and
the t&#146;s crossed. We have to consult further to determine the
conditions for eligibility which need to be fair, effective and
enforceable. It is no good having something that looks okay; that would
be a sop. The Electoral Commission must be able to enforce the
situation and the political parties must understand how these
arrangements will operate on the ground. I do not know the details
because I was not involved in this when I was a direct rule Minister.
It was not part of my day job. I know that discussions have taken place
and that we need further discussions. There have been ongoing
discussions between government officials and officials from the
Government of the Irish Republic. To the best of my knowledge,
Ministers have not been involved. Things may have been discussed at the
highest level, but those ongoing discussions between officials have
been to try to arrive at a solution which will then be put to the
Ministers of both Administrations for approval before they come to
Parliament.</p><h5><a name="06071361000604"></a>3

It is in the style of enabling legislation. We need to get this on to
the statute book to get to the detail. We could not put that kind of
detail into the legislation. We need to come forward with proposals
that will be introduced to Parliament. The parties concerned will need
to be consulted on them and there will need to be some agreement
between the two Governments in any event. There will be an opportunity
to debate the detail when we have it ready. In other words, if we pass
this legislation today, nothing can happen about donations for
political parties until we have the other legislation in
place.</p><p><a name="06071361000359"></a>It is not as though the
House is being asked to approve this legislation which then sets up a
brand new system of transparency, fairness, enforceability and a
tightening of the rules. We need the other legislation. There will be
another opportunity&#151;probably more than one&#151;for the House
to debate these matters in detail. It would be fair to treat this as
enabling legislation to take us forward. Implicit in this

Ireland.</p><p><a name="06071361000360"></a><b><a name="06071361001912"></a>Lord
Kilclooney:</b> My Lords, I agree entirely with the
noble Lord that the present system of donations for political parties
in Northern Ireland&#151;external and foreign donations&#151;is
scandalous and requires tightening up. However, we need clarification.
Are we talking simply about Irish people donating to political parties
in Northern Ireland? If that is so, it is discriminatory, because in
practice funds will go only to the SDLP and Sinn Fein&#151;the
minority, Irish parties in Northern Ireland&#151;not to the majority
parties in Northern Ireland, the Ulster Unionist Party and the
Democratic Unionist Party.</p><p><a name="06071361000361"></a>Secondly, if this facility continues to
be extended to Irish people to donate funds to Northern Ireland
parties, will the same facility exist for Commonwealth citizens to do
so? Only then will there be equality so that the unionist parties will
benefit equally, because this provision seems to give funds only to the
Irish nationalist parties in Northern
Ireland.</p><p><a name="06071361000362"></a>Also, why are the
Government discussing electoral affairs in the United Kingdom with a
foreign Government?</p><p><a name="06071361000363"></a><b><a name="06071361001913"></a>Lord
Rooker:</b> My Lords, I understand that, under the
rules governing Report, I am not required to answer those questions.
However, I want to co-operate, so I will try to answer them. If the
noble Lord is concerned about discussions between the United Kingdom
Government and the Government of the Republic over this matter, he will
be more worried after 24 November if the Assembly does not return,
because discussions will deepen. Economic forces are at work that are
causing more co-operation between north and south than ever before,
leaving aside the political considerations.</p>

<p><a name="06071361000364"></a>The rules are that
Irish citizens anywhere in the world can donate to Irish political
parties; therefore, donations can come from abroad. Company legislation
is much more constrained. You cannot put a brass plate on the Dublin
office of a foreign company and use that as a basis for making
donations. You have to have a significant commercial enterprise in the
Republic to be able to donate. The noble Lord has no grounds for
asserting which political parties the money will go to. We are
regulating individuals and they are entitled to send their money to
whichever political party they want. It is their choice whether it is a
unionist or nationalist
party.</p><p><a name="06071361000365"></a><b><a name="06071361001914"></a>Lord
Kilclooney:</b> My Lords, that argument is facile.
This is not an economic matter; it is about electoral law in the United
Kingdom. The Government are negotiating with a foreign country about
what electoral law in the United Kingdom should be. I accept that in
theory it means that money can go to any political party in Northern
Ireland, but coming from Northern Ireland, I know that Irish funding
for political parties will go only to the SDLP and Sinn Fein/IRA; it
will not go to the unionist parties.</p><notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_878"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 878</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071361000366"></a><b><a name="06071361001915"></a>Baroness

the politics of Northern Ireland are. Although I welcome the thrust of
this Bill and the point that it is making&#151;I said that at the
beginning&#151;we want to know more about the technical details. The
Minister said that this was an enabling provision and that we would
have an opportunity to discuss the details through secondary
legislation. The Minister knows full well my view that recourse to
secondary legislation on the scale to which Northern Ireland has been
subjected raises serious concerns. With secondary legislation, we have
to take it or leave it, which is a real problem. However, reluctantly
in the light of what the Minister has said, I will not press this
amendment and I beg leave to withdraw the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06071361000368"></a>Amendment, by leave,

12.</ul><p><a name="06071361000371"></a>The
noble Lord said: My Lords, I am afraid that I am going a stage further
than the previous debate in proposing to leave out Clauses 12 and 13.
Our Government have failed to explain how these proposals will be
seriously implemented and managed. What the noble Lord, Lord
Kilclooney, said is relevant, because I understand that even the Irish
Government have grave concerns about the feasibility of accepting
political donations from the vast pool of people worldwide who hold
Irish citizenship. It is far too wide. However, it is not only the
practical implementation of allowing foreign donations that I object
to, but the continuing attitude&#151;and in fairness the Minister
made this point&#151;that Northern Ireland is inherently unable ever
to move on from its unfortunate past and develop a political system
that accepts all the restraints and obligations of those that operate
elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Northern Irish politics should not be
subjected to abnormalities, exceptions and fudges any longer than it
has to.</p><p><a name="06071361000372"></a>There is no doubt that
what is proposed is better than the current situation, but that does
not mean that it is an acceptable end point. These proposals are
another sign of the Government&#146;s continuing failure to raise
their expectations of what the Northern Irish people have the right to
expect. Nowhere in the Belfast agreement was the idea that political
funding should be allowed to remain a grey area, pandering to Sinn
Fein&#146;s refusal to behave within the constraints expected of
normal democratic political parties. It is in principle wrong that
non-nationals should be able to fund ideologies and actions of which
they will never have to suffer the consequences. Northern Ireland
politics should be decided by the people of Northern Ireland and the
Minister and everyone else in your Lordships&#146; House have said
that again and again. The principle of self-determination was stated 
<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_879"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 879</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>repeatedly in the Belfast agreement, and that is what this Government
should be working towards. Instead, these proposals drive a coach and
horses through that principle, with scant regard for the long-term
effect on the long and sometimes painful road that Northern Ireland
must go down towards political normalisation. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06071361000373"></a><b><a name="06071361001918"></a>Lord
Kilclooney:</b> My Lords, I want to underline that I
consider this a most discriminatory measure, and Her Majesty's
Government should hang their head in shame, because it favours Irish
nationalismin practice and discriminates against the British
majority in Northern Ireland. Extending these facilities to Irish
citizens and people who claim Irish nationality across the world means
that, in practice, it will support only those parties that wish to
subvert Northern Ireland&#146;s position in the United Kingdom. We
are preparing a measure that supports the financing of parties that
wish to destroy the United
Kingdom.</p><p><a name="06071361000374"></a>I am very keen that
Commonwealth citizens should have the same facilities, but why do they
not have the same possibilities as Irish people across the world? Is it
because Spain has successfully applied to the European Court of Justice
to ban the right of1 million Commonwealth citizens in the
United Kingdom to vote in European
elections?</p><p><a name="06071361000375"></a><b><a name="06071361001919"></a>Lord

Lord Glentoran, pressed the amendment, we would support
it.</p><p><a name="06071361000376"></a><b><a name="06071361001920"></a>Lord
Rooker:</b> My Lords, I shall try to give a bit more
explanation, although we debated this in Grand Committee. That is not
an excuse for not discussing this matter, as noble Lords have every
right to bring it back on
Report.</p><p><a name="06071361000377"></a>I should tell the noble
Lord, Lord Kilclooney, that, as I said in my original response, the
Bill takes account of the special factors on the island of Ireland. We
are not denying that; it is not being slipped in by the back door. It
is open to anybody in the United Kingdom&#151;England, Scotland and
Wales&#151;if they are on the electoral register, to donate to the
political parties in Northern Ireland. The unionists in Northern
Ireland are not limited to raising funds in Northern Ireland. Anyone
would think that they were being treated differently from everybody
else in the UK, but they are not; people are free to give to political
parties in the United Kingdom, if they are on the electoral register.
It is up to them who they give to; it is not a closed area. It is not
as though unionists are prevented from seeking funds outside Northern
Ireland. There is the rest of the United Kingdom, for a
start.</p><p><a name="06071361000378"></a>The debate which we have
just had on Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 goes to the reasoning behind these
clauses, and I shall have to repeat some of those points. This is a big
step forward. At present, notwithstanding the complaints of the noble
Lord, Lord Kilclooney, anybody in the world can get money into the
Northern Ireland political parties secretly, 
<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_880"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 880</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>without anything being published or known about it. This Bill stops
that. It does not go all the way, but it is a big step
forward.</p><p><a name="06071361000379"></a>When the disapplication
period is over, by 2010, Northern Ireland parties and the donees will
continue to be able to accept donations from Irish citizens and other
Irish bodies who are legally able to donate to Irish
parties&#151;that being the Republic. This is a narrowing of the
regime. I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Smith, about the
inability to amend secondary legislation that comes before this House,
but I re-emphasise that it does not come out of the blue. It will come
following consultation.</p><p><a name="06071361000380"></a>I have
got something completely wrong here&#151;if this is the case, I do
not think it is fair. You have to be on the Northern Ireland electoral
register to donate to Northern Ireland parties, but that cannot be the
case if you can donate from abroad. If you are eligible to donate in
the Republic, you are eligible to donate to the North. That is the
difference. There is a restriction, but it applies equally to
nationalist and unionist, because it is up to people where they give
their money.</p><h5><a name="06071361000605"></a>3.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06071361000381"></a><b><a name="06071361001921"></a>Lord
Kilclooney:</b> My Lords, the Minister is quite
right. This is a vast improvement compared with what applies in
England, Scotland and Wales. People throughout the world can send
donations to political parties in Northern Ireland, but the very bad
news for Northern Ireland is that Her Majesty's Government in
restricting this facility are now limiting it to Irish citizens and
companies and so on to send funds to political parties in Northern
Ireland. I am saying, bluntly, that that is totally discriminatory. You
are helping to finance Irish nationalist movements within Northern
Ireland at the expense of the majority British unionist community. They
should havethe same facility to get funding from British
Commonwealth citizens, and you are denying them that right. It is total
discrimination.</p><p><a name="06071361000382"></a><b><a name="06071361001922"></a>Lord
Rooker:</b> My Lords, I accept the narrowing.
However, I do not have a note on this, because specified classification
of Commonwealth citizens did not come up in Grand Committee. I cannot
answer the point today, but there will be another opportunity at Third
Reading, so we can have a look at this next week. I do not know about
the Commonwealth situation, which I regret, but there is that
narrowing. At present, anything goes, which must be wrong&#151;and
not only that, anything goes and it is kept secret. That must be
completely wrong,
too.</p><p><a name="06071361000383"></a>I realise
that this is like a red rag to a bull, but there are restrictions in
the Republic, which is why we in the UK must discuss this with the
Government of the Republic to ensure that we get the rules right and
that they are fair, transparent and enforceable. We must ensure that
brass-plate companies cannot be used as a means of feeding money into
Northern Ireland political parties of whatever ilk, because there would
be ways round it. That is why we must have discussions. I suspect that
the Irish Republic Government would 
<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_881"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 881</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>probably take the same view, and that they would rather brass-plate
companies could not be used to get money to political
parties.</p><p><a name="06071361000384"></a>The
point is that the conditions will be in separate legislation. As I was
about to say before I had to dig myself out of a hole, the legislation
will come to this House not out of the blue but after consultation with
the Electoral Commission and all the political parties&#151;it is not
as though this is done simply with the technocrats in the Electoral
Commission. All the political parties in Northern Ireland, of which
there are quite a few, will have the opportunity for consultation on
this issue before the order gets near the House. It is not as though
this is the end of the matter. It is a significant step forward under
the current arrangements. As I said, it takes account of the special
historical&#151;but what the noble Lord would consider
unacceptable&#151;relations between the parties in Northern Ireland.
That is the state of play. It is the Government&#146;s policy
following the arrangements that we have made and the discussions that
we have had. If I can keep going for about another 30 seconds I shall
be given an important note, which I hope will set the context even
further.</p><p><a name="06071361000385"></a>This Bill is not the
end of the matter; it is enabling. The Electoral Commission is the
guardian of the rules on funding. We must make sure that back-door
routes are not made available. The political parties in Northern
Ireland have to run candidates to be funded. They cannot be brass-plate
political parties as well as brass-plate companies. Locks must be built
in to ensure that that money cannot filter across the Irish Sea to
political parties in Great
Britain.</p><p><a name="06071361000386"></a><b><a name="06071361001923"></a>Lord

whether that means I have to withdraw my apology. It is all too
complicated. I know that it is Thursday, and we have Third Reading
listed for next week, but I shall have to write to noble Lords before

able to donate only to parties running candidates for election in
Northern Ireland. Those parties will not be able to make donations to

Ireland branch of UKIP, be funded by citizens in the Republic of

money could then be siphoned, at least in part, from UKIP Northern
Ireland to UKIP Great

It is the case at present, so far as I am aware&#151;I stand to be
corrected&#151;that no party that is registered with the Electoral
Commission to fight elections in Great Britain fights elections in
Northern Ireland. That is the issue. In Northern Ireland, there are
members of the main parties represented in this House, but they do not
fight elections. The noble Lord referred to UKIP, which is a United
Kingdom party, as indeed, are the Conservative Party, the Labour Party
and the Liberal Democrats. Those parties do not fight elections under
their banners in Northern Ireland. If they have branches

a mechanism to make sure that that money is not used as a back door

Gruyère. It is unlikely but not inconceivable that one or other
of the Ulster Unionist parties could resume the relationship that the
Ulster Unionists had with the Conservative Party before 1970. That may
be unlikely, but legislation should provide for what is possible and
not just what is
likely.</p><p><a name="06071361000397"></a><b><a name="06071361001932"></a>Lord
Smith of Clifton:</b> My Lords, before the Minister
replies to the imaginative suggestions of the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit,
relating to the intervention of the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, I
point out that in my lifetime one of the predecessors of our party, the
Liberal Party, contested seats in Northern Ireland. Who knows what
might come in the future? This is a lacuna that clearly needs to be
looked
at.</p><p><a name="06071361000398"></a><b><a name="06071361001933"></a>Lord
Rooker:</b> My Lords, I agree. I have to say that to
the best of my knowledge at no time was this issue covered in any of
the briefings on the Bill that I have read or in any of the debates in
the other place&#151;noble Lords should not forget that the Bill came
to this House having been thoroughly debated in the other place. I
looked at some of the Standing Committee debates. The noble Lord, Lord
Tebbit, is quite right; there was a time when the Conservative and
Unionist parties were linked and fought on a UK-wide basis. At no time
in any of the briefings on this legislation has that situation been
envisaged for the future. I shall seek to rest my case on that, having
dug myself half way out of the hole and I shall make sure that I write
to noble Lords well before Third
Reading.</p><p><a name="06071361000399"></a><b><a name="06071361001934"></a>Lord
Glentoran:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for his
good-humoured responses. I am now even more convinced that the solution
to the noble Lord&#146;s problems lies in my amendment, which, I
hope, brings Northern Ireland pretty much into line with the United
Kingdom on these matters and will tidy up all sorts of
things.</p><p><a name="06071361000400"></a>Certainly, my
grandfather was a member of the Conservative and Unionist Party, was
Chief Whip in the other place and was a Minister of agriculture. Our
parties have been together. The Conservatives now have one councillor
in a local authority and we are very much involved in Northern Ireland

noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment would ensure that there will
be appropriate consequences for a Northern Ireland Minister who
publicly refuses to support the role of the police and to accept the
legitimacy of the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland. In
Committee, I dropped a previous amendment concerning Ministers taking
an oath to support the judiciary and the police. I believe that this
amendment will serve very well. Those who understand the operation of
Northern Ireland governance will know that the measure would have to be
enacted in the Assembly by a cross-community vote.</p><p><a name="06071361000409"></a>The Minister will be pleased to hear that
I have carefully considered what he had to say about the difficulty of
changing the pledge of office without active agreement from all the
parties in Northern Ireland. Although I remain hopeful that the
appropriate action will be taken, should it become necessary, I am
prepared to leave it to the Northern Ireland Assembly to take those
steps.</p><p><a name="06071361000410"></a>However, the amendment
that I have retabled is very necessary and is appropriate to be put
intothis legislation. The criteria for exclusion were first
established in primary legislation passed through this House in 1998.
Now that the political climate has developed enough for police and
justice functions to be devolved, it is our responsibility to see that
the legislation that will safeguard those functions is updated. The
1998 Act established that a Minister or junior Minister should be
excluded on the ground of promoting violence or non-peaceful and
non-democratic means, and so on, but there is no reference to a failure
on the part of a Minister to uphold the rule of law. I know that the
Minister has said many times that someone who does not support the
police and uphold the rule of law is the opposite of those
things&#151;a robber or a cowboy or
whatever.</p><p><a name="06071361000411"></a>In Committee, the
Minister tried to reassure me that there was no chance of a Minister
coming to power who did not fully support the police and justice
systems. He quoted the leadership of the republican 
<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_887"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 887</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>movement as accepting the need to engage in policing and being committed
to following a peaceful path. That is quite clearly not enough; the
police rely on the active support and help of the community, including
the encouragement of Ministers. Imagine a Minister for justice in
Northern Ireland who did not support the criminal justice system. Until
Sinn Fein and the IRA accept that they must co-operate fully with the
police in all matters and encourage their supporters to do the same,
they should not be considered ready to take up positions in
government.</p><p><a name="06071361000412"></a>Unfortunately, that
is far from the case. As the Minister said in Committee, Sinn Fein is
considering the policing issue. A consideration can go two ways, and if
Sinn Fein decides that it will not start co-operating with the police,
it is not fit to serve in government and should not be allowed to
remain in a position of power. This amendment would ensure that it
would be removed and the police would not be further undermined. I beg
to
move.</p><p><a name="06071361000413"></a><b><a name="06071361001937"></a>Baroness
Harris of Richmond:</b> My Lords, this amendment
empowers the Secretary of State to require the Presiding Officer to
move a motion in the Assembly excluding people from office if they or
their parties do not support the police and uphold the rule of law. As
the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, pointed out, it is unacceptable for a
Minister in government, who is running the functions of state, not to
support the state&#151;in other words, the police, who help to ensure
that the state is run properly. We certainly hope that that will never
happen, but these Benches support the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06071361000414"></a><b><a name="06071361001938"></a>Lord
Rooker:</b> My Lords, the arguments on this amendment
were rehearsed in Grand Committee and in another place. As I said
before, I have much sympathy with what the amendment is trying to
achieve, but I must disagree with the way in which the noble Lords are
seeking to do it. There is no argument with the principle. Indeed, the
Government have consistently said that we want all the parties,
including Sinn Fein, to support the policing arrangements in Northern
Ireland. Likewise, we cannot call into question the underlying aim of
the amendment, which is that support for what we know as &#147;the
rule of law&#148; be embedded into the political life of Northern
Ireland. But we do not believe that this amendment helps us to achieve
that aim.</p><p><a name="06071361000415"></a>It
is important that we give due recognition to the arrangements that are
already in place in the existing pledge of office under the Northern
Ireland Act 1998. That pledge of office, which all Ministers must
affirm before taking up their posts, already requires a commitment to
non-violence and exclusively peaceful and democratic means.
Furthermore, as the noble Lord, Lord Smith, pointed out in Grand
Committee, the wording of the pledge is taken directly from the text
agreed in the Good Friday agreement. It has therefore been agreed by
the parties and is not to be amended lightly. I should add that
amendments to the 1998 Act made in 2003 have shored up and strengthened
the requirements set out in the existing pledge of office by allowing
consideration of the Independent Monitoring 
<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_888"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 888</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Commission&#146;s recommendations and by providing safeguards where
Ministers and parties fail to observe the pledge.</p><p><a name="06071361000416"></a>The pledge is not the only requirement to
which Northern Ireland Ministers are subject. Throughout the debate, I
have repeatedly stated my concern that, while we all understand what is
meant by &#147;the rule of law&#148;, it is not easily defined in
legal terms and is therefore quite unhelpful when put forward in the
amendment. However, I am sure that noble Lords will agree that the
heart of what we term &#147;the rule of law&#148; is respect for
the independence of the judiciary. This issue was not mentioned in
Grand Committee, but we must not overlook the fact that all Northern
Ireland Ministers are already subject to a strict
statutoryduty, under Section 4 of the Constitutional Reform
Act 2005, to uphold the continued independence of the judiciary. It is
evident that the rule of law is already protected and therefore we do
not needthe further provision afforded by the amendment.
Section 4 of the 2005 Act is subtitled:</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60713-0954.htm"/>


<ul><a name="06071361000551"></a>&#147;Guarantee of continued judicial
independence: Northern Ireland&#148;.</ul><a name="06071361000490"></a>Section 1 begins:
<ul><a name="06071361000552"></a>&#147;The following persons must
uphold the continued independence of the judiciary-</ul><ul><a name="06071361000553"></a>(a) the First Minister,</ul><ul><a name="06071361000554"></a>(b) the deputy First
Minister,</ul><ul><a name="06071361000555"></a>(c) Northern
Ireland Ministers, and</ul><ul><a name="06071361000556"></a>(d)
all with responsibility for matters relating to the judiciary or
otherwise to the administration of justice, where that responsibility
is to be discharged only in or as regards Northern
Ireland&#148;.</ul><a name="06071361000491"></a>Other
subsections follow that talk about Ministers not being able to
interfere with judicial decisions through any special access to the
judiciary. That is on top of the pledge that I have referred to from
the Belfast agreement. <p><a name="06071361000417"></a>As I
said at the outset, the underlying aim of embedding support for the
rule of law into the political life of Northern Ireland is
unquestionable: it is not questioned by me or by anyone in the
Government. For the reasons that I have outlined, however, the
Government are of the view that the existing arrangements under the
1998 Act and the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 are sufficient. We have
made it clear, both here and in the other place, that if the parties
want to make changes to the pledge of office, and if they can agree on
a form of words in the context of a package on the other strand 1
issues, we stand ready to take such changes forward in legislation. I
ask noble Lords not to push the amendment, for the reasons that I have
given today and in Grand Committee.</p><p><a name="06071361000418"></a><b><a name="06071361001939"></a>Lord
Tebbit:</b> My Lords, what worries some of us is that
we have seen in the papers recently that Sinn Fein activists have
sought to justify the murder of a very decent and brave lady in
Northern Ireland on the basis that she was an informer. Informers have
been treated by Sinn Fein as lowly creatures but, surely, if justice is
to be established, we have to have informers. If we had had more of
them, perhaps there would have been fewer
murders.</p><notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_889"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 889</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071361000419"></a><b><a name="06071361001940"></a>Lord
Rooker:</b> My Lords, I do not want to go into the
detail of that case, which I am aware of from the media, but the fact
remains that we need more co-operation with the forces of law and order

civic society, which it is not at present.</p><p><a name="06071361000420"></a><b><a name="06071361001941"></a>Lord
Glentoran:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for
what he has said. I do not believe that on this occasion my amendment
would interfere at all with the pledge of office&#151;I had dropped
that amendment. This amendment is purely to make obvious failure to
support of the rule of law, the judicial processes and the PSNI a
reason for the removal of a
Minister.</p><p><a name="06071361000421"></a>I felt that the
Minister had some sympathy with that. His explanation of Section 4 of
the 2005 Act was something that I had not heard before and need to
brush up on; in fairness to him and other noble Lords, I should
research it a little more. I think that the Government know what we are
after here. However, there may be a way in which we can between now and
Third Reading bring some provisions of Section 4 to the fore and
strengthen the Bill.</p><p><a name="06071361000422"></a>As I said
in my opening remarks, this is something that could be enacted only by
the Assembly and which would require cross-community agreement because
of the way in which voting takes place in the Assembly. So I shall do
some research and probably bring back the amendment at Third Reading,

noble Lord said: This is on a very different subject. I thank the
Minister for inviting me to discuss this measure&#151;I believe that
he had similar discussions with the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton.
To use the vernacular, I suppose that it is about anticipating a plan
B. In tabling the amendment, we are trying to set up a democratic
process that is both transparent and efficient and allows both Houses
of this Parliament to operate cohesively. The current procedure is more
akin to how the Colonial Office used to rule far-flung territories of
the British Empire than it is to an acceptable method of government for
an integral part of the United
Kingdom.</p><p><a name="0607147000004"></a>The
noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux of Killead, once referred to Ulster as an
internal colony. Reliance on direct rule for the foreseeable future is
unfortunately a very real possibility. The deadline set for November
this year would be meaningless if it were not. Of course, the preferred
option is that the Stormont Assembly will take over the handling of
devolved matters, but we cannot gamble the future of democracy in
Northern Ireland on that hope. It is now more than eight years since
the Belfast agreement. If it is not possible to form a stable
Government in that time, we must stop burying our heads in the sand and
come up with an acceptable way to govern Northern Ireland from
Westminster.</p><p><a name="0607147000005"></a>As the debate in
Committee showed, we all appreciate the flaws in the current procedure.
Current scrutiny of Northern Ireland Orders in Council is cursory,
especially in another place. The closest thing to democratic
accountability that the procedure allows is outright rejection by
Parliament, with no possibility of amendment or
improvement.</p><p><a name="0607147000006"></a>We
have been challenged to come up with an alternative. I venture to think
that the amendment will provide the basis for a workable procedure that
will provide much greater scrutiny and accountability than what has
gone before. Our previous amendment was challenged because of the
potential for an irreconcilable clash between this House and another
place. We have therefore returned with a new and improved version. The
amendment allows both Houses to vote on suggested amendments to a draft
Order in Council, which the Secretary of State would then consider and
incorporate&#151;or not, as he sees fit. The amendment would allow
Northern Ireland Orders in Council to be subject to more effective and
constructive scrutiny than before, without unduly wasting parliamentary
time or establishing dangerous parliamentary
precedents.</p><p><a name="0607147000007"></a>I
was going to wind up my remarks at this point, but I think that it is
worth saying this. The Minister and the Secretary of State for Northern
Ireland and his team are very anxious that no plan B should be
considered feasible at this stage, but this proposal is not so
important that it will affect parties&#146; decisions whether to
accept the opportunity to devolve government and work together. I
simply do not believe that having this process on the statute book,
which will allow us to handle Northern Ireland legislation
democratically and efficiently, will affect the decision-making process
of any of the parties negotiating the future of devolution, and I
strongly support a number of the Government&#146;s policies, which
may not be popular in the Assembly,

improve and modernise the process of government in Northern Ireland,
and to modernise local authorities and so on. With all that on option,
I simply do not believe that a little administrative order or issue
such as this will change the minds of Ian Paisley, Mark Durkan, Gerry
Adams and Sir Reg Empey. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="0607147000008"></a><b><a name="0607147000328"></a>Lord
Smith of Clifton:</b> My Lords, a small number of
Members of your Lordships&#146; House who follow Northern Ireland
activities will know that, for two or three years now, I have been
pressing for a change in the character of the executive order of much
Northern Ireland business. That is not to say that there is no case for
secondary legislation, but, as the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, said,
the take-it-or-leave-it character of orders and statutory instruments
is extremely frustrating and frankly does scant justice to the Northern
Ireland business that comes before
Parliament.</p><p><a name="0607147000009"></a>I
do not believe that it is beyond the wit of humankind&#151;although
after today it may be beyond the wit of the Northern Ireland Office,
judging by what we have heard from it&#151;to contrive to have a
protocol that is susceptible to amendment. I say to the officials who
continually brief Ministers that nothing can be done, and who come out
with all this rigmarole about the conflict between two Houses, that
those are British constitution A-level essay-type things. Frankly, they
must get it into their heads that constitutional protocols are for
humankind and that humankind is not for constitutional protocols. They
must get their priorities
right.</p><p><a name="0607147000010"></a>Much has
been said in Grand Committee and by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, and
I shall not delay your Lordships by repeating the arguments for
determining Northern Ireland business more democratically. After all,
this is not new. In the debates on the Legislative and Regulatory
Reform Bill, there are signs that the Government have accepted that it
would be wrong to push through primary legislation that would implement
Law Commission recommendations by means of statutory instrument. I
believe that Ministers from the Department for Constitutional Affairs
are exploring, with opposition spokespeople, the best way in which to
ensure that uncontroversial proposals are expedited with proper
scrutiny. In Committee on that Bill, the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton of
Upholland, said:</p><ul><a name="0607147000059"></a>&#147;It is
right to try to find a solution that would enable uncontroversial
reports to find their way through a parliamentary process. The elements
of such a process that I plan to explore would be: ensuring that the
reports were genuinely uncontroversial; that they commanded support in
principle, therefore, from across your Lordships' House and another
place; that the choice for such a procedure would be endorsed by
Parliament; that a suitable process of scrutiny could be found; and
that both Houses of Parliament would have the opportunity to debate
them with the possibility of amendment&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official
Report</I>, 10/6/06; col.
574.]</ul><a name="0607147000047"></a>If it is possible for
another government department to consider a new parliamentary procedure
to satisfy such criteria, why is it not possible for the Northern
Ireland Office to consider a similar procedure for dealing with
Northern Ireland orders? This is very important.

the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, I would add that it is extremely
unlikely that having this measure as a safety net would somehow
negatively influence the parties in Northern Ireland that are
discussing whether or not to reconvene the Executive. This ought to
urge the parties to get on with it and to re-establish the Executive at
Stormont. While it helps as a prod to those discussions, it also gives
us a fail-safe if, unfortunately, 24 November comes and goes with no
restoration. We cannot then suddenly start considering what needs to be
done. We need at this point to prepare for that eventuality. We should
hope for the best, but we need to prepare for the
worst.</p><h5><a name="0607147000060"></a>4

Kilclooney:</b> My Lords, it is
refreshing to hear the words of the noble Lords, Lord Smith and Lord
Glentoran. There has to be a plan B. Of course, Her Majesty&#146;s
Government have already announced such a plan because when the Prime
Ministers of the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom met in
Armagh City in May, they said that, failing the creation of an
Executive on 24 November, the Dublin Government and Her
Majesty&#146;s Government would work more closely together in the
administration of Northern Ireland. At the time, we saw what was in my
opinion substantial decommissioning by one of the terrorist groups, the
IRA. The other two main paramilitaries, the UVF and the UDA, were also
moving towards decommissioning. But what happened? Following the
announcement by the two Prime Ministers that Dublin was going to become
involved in the administration of Northern Ireland should the Executive
not be created on 24 November, the two loyalist paramilitary groups
immediately announced that they were not proceeding with
decommissioning.</p><p><a name="0607147000013"></a>Alarm
bells started ringing right across Northern Ireland. It was seen as a
compromise by Her Majesty&#146;s Government that the Republic of
Ireland would become involved in the internal affairs of Northern
Ireland. Noble Lords may think that this is not important, but to the
people who live in Northern Ireland it is very serious indeed. It is
time that notice was taken of the danger of that statement. Whether you
disagree with it or not, it was a plan B. The great news is that both
the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives are thinking of alternative
plan Bs, but it is very important to recognise what is happening in
Northern Ireland today. I do not believe that we will have a settlement
by 24 November&#151;I shall not go into the reasons
why.</p><p><a name="0607147000014"></a>Yesterday we had our
national holiday, and there is a holiday today as well. What was
significant in Northern Ireland yesterday was that the Union flag was
not flown as much as usual. Across Northern Ireland, the Ulster
flag&#151;the Northern Ireland flag&#151;began to emerge as the
main flag flown by the majority community. That is a warning to Her
Majesty&#146;s Government and to Parliament in London: things are
beginning to move in Northern Ireland in very dangerous way. I do not
want to exaggerate the situation, but I believe that the British
majority in Northern Ireland is preparing for a major conflict. It is
time that the Government addressed this problem before it overtakes
them.</p><notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_893"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 893</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="0607147000015"></a><b><a name="0607147000330"></a>Lord
Rooker:</b> My Lords, I realise the seriousness
attached to the issue in the amendment and I hope that I have made it
clear that the Secretary of State, along with the whole Northern
Ireland team, shares those concerns. The current Order in Council
process is not adequate in the long term, but while I do not want to
revisit old battles, one has to admit that it has served Northern
Ireland since, I think, 1972. I cannot believe that that was not looked
at during the long years of Conservative Government to try to find a
better system for more scrutiny in both Houses. Obviously, a solution
was not found. We do not have one either at the moment though I suspect
that every Member could find a way of doing it.</p><p><a name="0607147000016"></a>We take the concern
seriously, but we may not be believed until we have put our solution on
the table. At the moment the Government are not prepared to put a
solution on the table. I am not saying that these issues are not
thought about. We genuinely do not want plan B or plan C to interfere
with plan A; we want the Assembly back. It is the duty of Northern
Ireland politicians to get elected and to serve their people. Direct
rule and inadequate scrutiny of Orders in Council have to be second
best in any democratic process. If restoration of the Assembly is not
possible, we would want to engage with Members of both Houses to find a
way of making the system work better. We have had discussions in the
past 12 months on that but we have not come up with a Northern
Ireland-proof solution, specifically for it&#151;though I accept that
the amendment is&#151;that does not spill over into the management of
the business of secondary legislation across the Houses. The Secretary
of State has asked and charged the Minister of State, David Hanson, to
take this matter forward with the parties in due course if that
situation arrives. However, we do not want to plan for
failure.</p><p><a name="0607147000017"></a>For
some, the present situation is very comfortable&#151;direct rule,
part-time commuting Ministers; it&#146;s great for them. They love it
because they do not have to grow up and take decisions themselves. They
coalesce only in attacking the Government; it&#146;s the one thing
that unifies them. They don&#146;t have to stand up and say what they
would do, how they would fix the budget. They have no responsibility
whatever. We want them to grow up and take adult decisions on behalf of
those they seek to represent. But some people are comfortable with the
status quo. I genuinely think that the amendment, though it may offer
the seeds of a possible solution, could get in the way and help the
prize slip from our grasp. We have some distance between now
and24 November. I realise that there will be a Recess, but I
think that the situation will hot up considerably towards the end of
the September/October period. I do not want to say anything now that
will cause problems in that period.</p><p><a name="0607147000018"></a>I want to put a couple
of points to noble Lords. One of my colleagues in the other place,
devaluing the argument somewhat, said to me, &#147;I don&#146;t
understand what the Conservatives are complaining about. They are a
party of government; they have been in government and aspire to be a
Government, and the Lib Dems haven&#146;t been there for 100 years or
near enough, yet they come up with these solutions because they think
it&#146;s easy&#148;. Well, it isn&#146;t easy. If it was, we
would have 
<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_894"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 894</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>found a solution by now. In fact, we would have found a solution under
the direct rule of the Conservative
Administration.</p><p><a name="0607147000019"></a><b><a name="0607147000331"></a>Lord
Smith of Clifton:</b> My
Lords&#151;</p><p><a name="0607147000020"></a><b><a name="0607147000332"></a>Lord
Rooker:</b> My Lords, perhaps I can just make this
point. Then I will give way to the noble Lord,
obviously.</p><p><a name="0607147000021"></a>We
have looked at the amendment, and I have had brief discussions during
the week. If it were carried, we could not, for a start, use the Grand
Committee process. We could not use the Grand Committee process in this
House to discuss the draft of an amendment because it is rigidly
organised to allow debate only on non-controversial matters and does
not allow for changes or amendments. That does not apply to every
order; many orders could be considered there. However, those orders
could not go to a Grand Committee. They would have to be considered on
the Floor of the House. We have to find ways of dealing with
this&#151;ways that have not been found in all the years since the
Stormont Parliament was first set aside.</p><p><a name="0607147000022"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Smith, talked about a
failsafe. I say with due respect that, because we are serious about the
date of 24 November, a failsafe will have to be seriously and urgently
considered after that date. We do not want to do so beforehand, for the
reasons I have explained.</p><p><a name="0607147000023"></a>I shall briefly address
the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney; it is not the first
time that he has made it, and I made sure that those responsible for
the issues were made fully aware of his point when he first made it.
The tune changed slightly. It is not envisaged&#151;it was never part
of the plan&#151;that the Government of the Republic of Ireland will
in any way, shape or form be involved in the administration of Northern
Ireland. We have no mandate as a Government for that and do not seek
it, but I and colleagues have pointed out that the cross-border issues
do not go away, given all the pressures of the economy and the position
of the island of Ireland within both Europe and the world economy. For
example, we have had questions in the House recently about a common
corporation tax on the island of Ireland, specific to businesses both
north and south. They can make a case that it ought to be different
from Great Britain. That pressure comes not because of political
forces, but because of the economic changes in the world. I am not
saying that it will happen, but there will be areas of co-operation.
Part of the Bill creates a wholesale electricity market; that is part
of those pressures.</p><p><a name="0607147000024"></a>I was going
to mention the subject of yesterday earlier, and have just been
reminded of it; I was obviously not there. Yesterday was the most
peaceful 12 July for 30 years. In fact, it was the first time
in30 years that the Army was not deployed on 12 July. That is
absolutely fantastic. I am still doing duty weekends in Northern
Ireland, and I have seen the collection of the bonfires ready and all
the paraphernalia that goes on which people want to celebrate. I know
what has happened in the past as a result of that, whether it is
hotheads or others just out 
<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_895"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column 895</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to cause trouble. The atmosphere that we have at the moment, when 2006
is the first time in 30 years that the Army is not out on the street on
the major holiday, has to be of major
significance.</p><p><a name="0607147000025"></a>The noble Lord,
Lord Kilclooney, made a point about flags; I cannot respond to it in
detail. I look on it as maybe positive that other flags were used
rather than the flags of the past, although I take the serious
point&#151;the implication of what he said&#151;that the loyalist
paramilitaries are keeping their arms ready to fight British soldiers.
That threat is the implication of not disarming; he agrees. It is
outrageous. We want them disarmed like the others. There is no excuse
for the paramilitaries to keep their weapons. There is no selling out,
to use the terms that people have used in the past. The Government of
the Republic will not be involved in the administration and governance
of Northern Ireland, but there will be north-south co-operation as
there are areas of co-operation east-west, such as the health service.
Citizens of the Republic can go into hospitals in Northern Ireland,
particularly the north-west, where the hospitals are closer to them
than those in the south. I am sure that such good areas of co-operation
will continue.</p><p><a name="0607147000026"></a>That does not mean to
say that the Government of the Republic will be involved in the
administration of Northern Ireland. That is not a plan B. However, it
is a natural consequence that if there is not a Northern Ireland
Assembly, we as the UK Government will not mind the shop. We will push
forward areas of reform&#151;of public administration and of other
areas in Northern Ireland&#151;and, where it suits us both,
particularly in economic co-operation, it makes sense to have those
arrangements. However, that can in no way be construed as the
Government of the south having a role as a threat over the
non-Assembly. If the Assembly were up and running, I suspect that the
same thing would happen, because the economic forces would drive north
and south to do such things on a joint
basis.</p><p><a name="0607147000027"></a><b><a name="0607147000333"></a>Lord

Smith of Clifton:</b> My Lords, the
noble Lord&#146;s peroration is part of his rhetorical repertoire to
keep the momentum going, but I am afraid that I have to bring us back
to a couple of his points. He said that the Conservatives did nothing
about secondary legislation during their time of direct rule because,
like the Labour Party, they are a party of Government, but that the
Liberal Democrats have not been in Government for a long time. That
reveals a mindset about executive government that erodes the role of
the legislature and is all part and parcel of the modern cast of mind
of Government. I do not find it a very convincing
argument.</p><h5><a name="0607147000061"></a>4.15
pm</h5><p><a name="0607147000030"></a>Secondly,
the noble Lord, as he does, showed very real sympathy. As I said in

the residues still there, although they are becoming less and less, I
fear. We must look at this from the point of view of democratic
accountability. The argument that it is not convenient at this stage to
consider a plan B means that there is the danger that the parties in
Northern Ireland will think that24 November is a moveable
feast.</p><p><a name="0607147000031"></a><b><a name="0607147000336"></a>Baroness

on the basis that executive Government know all; I am not saying that.
I am with noble Lords on this; so is the Northern Ireland
team&#151;Peter Hain and the rest of them. The present arrangements
for degrees of scrutiny under direct rule are unsatisfactory, and we
must find another solution. However, we are not in an isolated area; we
are a few months away&#151;and the House has passed the
legislation&#151;from trying to get up and running an Assembly that
would carry out that legislation,. It is not a question of simply
saying that we are in a period where nothing is going to happen. We
want to focus on getting the Assembly up, not by threats or blackmail
but, if you like, by a bit of cajoling and some encouragement, and not
too much slagging them off; they do not like that. Northern Ireland
people deserve better from Northern Ireland politicians than what they
have been getting, and they know that.</p><p><a name="0607147000034"></a>The money for the Assembly Members is a
token, but the Assembly will disappear on the 25th; the Assembly will
be gone. The status quo will not simply carry on. There is the Review
of Public Administration, and the changes to local government do affect
central government in Northern Ireland; they are bound to. The idea is
to move powers from the Government of Northern Ireland in Belfast to
local councils. That means that we will be looking at the ministries
and the way in which they are structured. If anyone is thinking,
&#147;Oh, in a few months&#146; time we will pop back and all the
d&#146;Hondt ministries will still be there&#148;&#151;as one
noble Lord said to me earlier in the week&#151;they may not be
there.</p><p><a name="0607147000035"></a>We are
pushing forward changes in the health service and in local government.
We have said that we will push the reform programme forward, and we are
not going to ease off on that. Indeed, the Secretary of State has said
that he will speed it up if the Assembly is not there. That is our
position, and that is why we concentrate and focus exclusively on
getting plan A, which is the best option, of a devolved Administration
back in Northern Ireland, and at the same time admitting that we are
mindful of the deficiencies of the present system and admitting that if
the Assembly is not back we cannot carry on as we have been for the

elucidation. We did have, let&#146;s face it, a plan B following the
meeting in Armagh city of the two Prime Ministers. I do not believe
that Her Majesty&#146;s Government recognise how badly that message
went down across Northern Ireland. If the Government do have a plan B
that was announced in Armagh, why are they not prepared to consider an
alternative plan B, which would be a greater democratic system for the

We believe the best option is an Assembly in Northern Ireland with
Northern Ireland politicians.</p><p><a name="0607147000038"></a>I
repeat, finally, that whatever may have been said about it, the Prime

today. We have got plan A, and that is what we are concentrating
on.</p><p><a name="0607147000039"></a><b><a name="0607147000340"></a>Lord
Glentoran:</b> My Lords, I accept what the noble Lord
has said. I accept that there is no plan B and I accept that the
Government do not want a plan B. But, as I said in my opening remarks,
I do not see this amendment as providing a plan B. I support the
Government totally in their wish to see Stormont back in being and back
at work. I see the amendment as using this miscellaneous provisions
Bill&#151;an opportunity which is often difficult to find for major
legislation for Northern Ireland&#151;as a means of ensuring that I
do not have to come back here at the end of October, or whenever we get
back after conferences and so on, with clearly no agreement in sight
and having to go back to the old grind. Soon we will have the Northern
Ireland budget coming up for the next year. I do not want to go through
that; I do not want to see all of that again. I want a more efficient,
more democratic, more open process of governing Northern Ireland. I beg
leave to take the opinion of the
House.</p><h5><a name="0607147000062"></a>4.21

be the case. However, I am advised that the amendment needs some more
work, which we will urgently look at. In other words, we shall have to
come back at Third Reading with another amendment. I will not hide

Counter-Narcotics</h3><p><a name="06071359000010"></a><b><a name="06071359000083"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office
(Lord Triesman):</b> Following the
launch of the national drug control strategy at the London Conference
on Afghanistan in January, the UK continues, as partner nation, to
support the Government of Afghanistan's counter-narcotics effort. This
year's planting season predated the launch of that strategy and,
although last year saw a 21 per cent decline in opium poppy cultivation
across Afghanistan, this year it is likely that there will be a
significant rise in cultivation. This is worrying and is due, in part,
to a substantial increase in planting of opium poppy in the south of
Afghanistan, including in Helmand province. But in areas where
governance, security and levels of development have improved, there are
signs that last year's cultivation reductions will be sustained. At the
same time, the Government of Afghanistan's eradication effort has been
more effective than in previous
years.</p><p><a name="06071359000011"></a>The
Government of Afghanistan's national drug control strategy offers the
best means to tackle the opium trade at its source. We are determined
to work with the Government and people of Afghanistan to sharpen
delivery in order to achieve sustained impact on the ground. In
particular they will be focusing their efforts on targeting the
traffickers and their accomplices who profit most from the trade. We
will be assisting by helping to establish the rule of law across
Afghanistan, which is essential to counter-narcotics efforts and to the
success of the broader reconstruction process. The UK is working with
the Government of Afghanistan and with other donors to develop new
intelligence structures and to build the capacity of counter-narcotics
law enforcement and criminal justice agencies. These efforts are
starting to show results. Since August 2005 we have seen the conviction
of over 190 traffickers, and a significant increase in drugs-related
seizures and the destruction of laboratories. These actions are helping
to disrupt the trade, forcing traffickers to move and store drugs in
smaller
quantities.</p><p><a name="06071359000012"></a>The
Department for International Development also continues to support
Afghan national programmes focused on strengthening and diversifying
legal rural livelihoods, including in Helmand province where my right
honourable friend the Secretary of State for Development (Hilary Benn)
recently announced that the UK would contribute &#163;30 million to
livelihoods activity over the next three years. Since April 2003 more
than 12 million labour days have been provided and more than 8,000
kilometres of roads rehabilitated. Almost $70 million micro-finance
loans have been disbursed over the past two years and $180 million in
grants approved to some 10,000 community development councils. In
addition, since September 2005, more than 500,000 farmers have been
provided with seeds and fertiliser.</p><notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS52"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column WS52</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071359000013"></a>On 5 September last year my honourable
friend the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Dr
Kim Howells) announced, in a jointpress conference with Afghan
Counter-Narcotics Minister Qaderi, that the UK would spend a total of
&#163;270 million in support of the Afghan nationaldrug
control strategy between 2005-08. This includes &#163;130 million of
DfID funding. In 2005-06 the UK spent the following in support of the
eight pillars in the national drugs control
strategy:</p><p><a name="06071359000014"></a>Pillar
1: Public Awareness&#151;&#163;649,000 in support of Afghan efforts
to inform members of the population about counter-narcotics policies,
legislation, operations and alternatives to poppy cultivation and to
persuade farmers not to grow
poppy.</p><p><a name="06071359000015"></a>Pillar
2: Demand Reduction&#151;&#163;1,112,000 on treatment,
rehabilitation and harm reduction
programmes.</p><p><a name="06071359000016"></a>Pillar
3: Law Enforcement&#151;&#163;20,787,000 on building the capacity
and equipping the Counter-Narcotics Police of Afghanistan and the
Afghan Special Narcotics
Force.</p><p><a name="06071359000017"></a>Pillar
4: Criminal Justice&#151;&#163;1,112,000 to establisha
counter-narcotics criminal justice task force of84 judges,
prosecutors and investigators and high-security detention
facilities.</p><p><a name="06071359000018"></a>Pillar 5:
Institution Building&#151;&#163;5,177,000 to establish and staff a
fully operational ministry of counter-narcotics (MCN) and to build
capacity within the counter-narcotics division of the Ministry of
Interior.</p><p><a name="06071359000019"></a>Pillar 6: Alternative
Livelihoods&#151;&#163;37,520,000 to strengthen and diversify legal
rural
livelihoods.</p><p><a name="06071359000020"></a>Pillar
7: Eradication&#151;&#163;5,709,000 to support survey, monitoring,
and verification of eradication; to target it where legal livelihoods
exist.</p><p><a name="06071359000021"></a>Pillar
8: International and Regional Co-operation&#151;&#163;2,006,000 to
support border control and other regional projects focused on
disrupting the flow of illicit drugs and precursor materials across
Afghanistan's borders.</p><p><a name="06071359000022"></a>The UK
also contributed &#163;9 million to the Government of Afghanistan's
Counter-Narcotics Trust Fund and a further &#163;1,500,000 to the Law
and Order Trust Fund established to cover the cost of police salaries
and equipment. A further &#163;2,970,000 was spent on strategy,
research and reviews, including support to the United Nations Office on
Drugs and Crime&#146;s annual poppy
survey.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06071359000002"></a>Buncefield
Explosion</h3><p><a name="06071359000023"></a><b><a name="06071359000084"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and
Pensions (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath):</b>
The independent Major Incident Investigation
Board&#151;appointed by the Health and Safety Commission (HSC) to
supervise the investigation into the explosions and fires at the
Buncefield oil storage depot, Hemel Hempstead, on 11 December
2005&#151;will today publish its initial report. The report has been
received by the HSC and the board of the Environment Agency who have
endorsed its publication. Copies of the report will be placed in the
Libraries of each House.</p><notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS53"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column WS53</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071359000024"></a>The report indicates that good progress
has been made in identifying the root causes of the Buncefield
incident. This is in spite of the widespread damage to forensic
evidence caused by the explosions and fires, and the dangers posed by
the site to the investigation teams until well after the incident. The
investigation board considers that enough is known to set out with
reasonable confidence the sequence of events leading to the incident,
though uncertainty remains about why the explosion was so
violent.</p><p><a name="06071359000025"></a>It is of paramount
importance to ensure that all the lessons of Buncefield are learnt to
prevent recurrence of such an incident, and to ensure the maximum
effectiveness of emergency arrangements if an incident does occur. The
board's initial report identifies several areas of concern, while
noting the extent of the work already underway to address them. In
particular, the board welcomes the post-Buncefield programme of
inspections being undertaken by the Health and Safety Executive and the
Environment Agency as the competent authority regulating Buncefield.
The safety alerts issued on matters of immediate concern, and the
industry-chaired task group convened by the competent authority to
review the results of these initiatives, are also noted. The board
makes clear that it intends to focus on several broad areas of concern,
and pay close attention to the preliminary conclusions from the
different strands of work as they
emerge.</p><p><a name="06071359000026"></a>The board also draws
attention to the process of incremental development around Buncefield
and expresses an interest in the cross-government work addressing the
implications of new information about major hazard sites recently
gathered by HSE. This work has been underway since before the
Buncefield incident, but will take account of information and analysis
arising from the investigation. Once clear conclusions emerge, the work
will be the subject of consultation with stakeholders. Information
about this was set out in a previous parliamentary Statement on the 15
May.</p><p><a name="06071359000027"></a>The investigation is
continuing. Many people, not least the local residents and businesses
directly affected by the incident, need answers to resolve the
uncertainties caused by Buncefield. The investigation board is keenly
aware of their needs, while ensuring the investigation is thorough and
fully considers the implications of its findings. The board is also
conscious that in doing so it must not prejudice any future criminal
proceedings, should it be decided that there be grounds to pursue them.
The HSC and Environment Agency are now considering the initial report
and the board's early conclusions, and will ensure that actions
identified are taken forward without
delay.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06071359000003"></a>Democratic
Republic of
Congo</h3><p><a name="06071359000028"></a><b><a name="06071359000085"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and
Industry (Lord Sainsbury of Turville):</b> My right
honourable friend the Minister of State (Ian McCartney) has made the
following Written Ministerial Statement.</p><notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS54"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column WS54</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071359000029"></a>The All-Party
Parliamentary Group on the Great Lakes Region and Genocide Prevention
(APPG) reported in February 2005 on the effectiveness of the
application of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises
(guidelines) to the Democratic Republic of
Congo.</p><p><a name="06071359000030"></a>It made
a number of recommendations, and in response the Government committed
to consult on possible improvements to the UK National Contact Point's
(NCP) promotion and implementation of the
guidelines.</p><p><a name="06071359000031"></a>The
Government received 10 written responses to the consultation document
by the deadline of 6 January 2006. In addition, a joint working group
(JWG), established under the aegis of the APPG to explore the scope for
common ground between businesses and non-governmental organisations on
frameworks for business conduct in areas of conflict and weak
governance, requested and was granted further time to submit a
response. It did so on 23 June
2006.</p><p><a name="06071359000032"></a>The Government are
grateful to all interested parties who took the time and effort to meet
the NCP and/or submit written responses to the consultation document.
They are particularly grateful to the members of the JWG for their
willingness to discuss and make recommendations that commanded broad
support from both the businesses and the NGOs involved. The Government
believe that the similarities between their own, evolving
considerations since the publication of the consultation document and
the views expressed by businesses and NGOs reflects an emerging
consensus over practical and effective steps that can be taken to
improve the promotion and implementation of the
guidelines.</p><p><a name="06071359000033"></a>I have today
published the Government's response to the consultation. A copy will be
made available in the Libraries of both Houses and will be
accessibleon the DTI website. Among a number of commitments,
the Government will:</p>launch a refocused NCP by
September 2006 to include officials from the Department for
International Development and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as
well as the Department of Trade and
Industry;establish a steering board to
oversee the operation of the NCP. It will include representatives of
all government departments with an interest in the guidelines as well
as independent members selected for their expertise in relevant issues;
andtighten criteria and timescales and
improve transparency when the NCP considers allegations that the
guidelines have not been
followed.<a name="06071359000082"></a>The Government
will review the effectiveness of the changes, in consultation with
stakeholders, in a year's
time.<p><a name="06071359000034"></a>The
Government want the new NCP to work with businesses, employees and
other parties to deal with issues raised under the guidelines. I
believe that this approach, allied with the changes set out in the
Government's response, will deliver a more openand transparent
system in which all organisations can put their faith in encouraging
responsible business activities

My honourable friend the Parliamentary
Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Anne McGuire) has made
the following Statement.</p><p><a name="06071359000036"></a>The
Government's Office for Disability Issues (ODI) has today published its
first annual report to the Prime Minister, which details the progress
that is being made towards realising the Government's ambitious vision
for real equality for disabled people by 2025. Copies of the report are
available in the Vote Office and Printed Paper
Office.</p><p><a name="06071359000037"></a>The
ODI was launched in December 2005 to deliver the strategy set out in
the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit report, <I>Improving the Life
Chances of Disabled People</I>. Since then, the ODI has successfully
formed partnerships with internal and external stakeholders and driven
forward an ambitious programme of
work.</p><p><a name="06071359000038"></a>This first report
highlights a broad range of initiatives that are starting to address
the barriers disabled people experience in accessing services,
including housing, transport, justice and leisure. For example, through
the individual budgets pilots, we are testing out new ways of giving
people more choice and control over the way they are supported. Three
pilot sites in Oldham, Essex and west Sussex are already testing this
new way of working, with the remaining 10 sites to come on stream this
month.</p><p><a name="06071359000039"></a>The report provides an
update on action against all the recommendations in the <I>Life
Chances</I> report and makes clear what further activity is necessary
to deliver improved outcomes for disabled people. One key area where
Government need to do much more is in involving disabled people in the
design and delivery of services which impact on their lives. The ODI's
report provides information on our progress in developing a UK advisory
network on disability equality, which will be established from later
this year.</p><p><a name="06071359000040"></a>I commend this report

My honourable friend the Parliamentary
Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Anne McGuire) has made
the following
Statement.</p><p><a name="06071359000042"></a>As
my Statement of 1 February said, the Government set up the Review Group
on Common Parts, during the passage of the Disability Discrimination
Act 2005, to review the legal position in relation to alterations to
the common parts of let residential premises and of residential
commonholds and to make recommendations. The Government are very
grateful for Members' work on this and have published the group's
report on my department's website at
www.dwp.gov.uk/aboutus/business.asp.</p><p><a name="06071359000043"></a>This is an initial
response to the report and covers the five non-legislative
recommendations made by the review group. We are continuing to consider
the complexities of the legislative recommendations, including 
<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS56"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column WS56</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with the devolved administrations, and will issue a further response as
that work develops.</p><p><a name="06071359000044"></a>The review
group considered disabled facilities grants (DFG) to be an important
source of assistance for disabled people who need alterations made to
their home. We agree and have recently increased resources in England
so that we could end the means testing of families where alterations
are for children. DFG funding is already available for alterations to
the common parts of residential premises, and this will continue. DFG
resources have been increased significantly by this Government (in
England from &#163;56 million in 1997-98 to &#163;121 million in
2006-07). The review group called for more money to be made available
for DFGs and we will consider this further as an integral part of the
cross-government spending
review.</p><p><a name="06071359000045"></a>In addition, a
government review of DFGs is currently underway following independent
research and recommendations made by Bristol University. This review is
looking to make the DFG process easier and quicker to use in respect of
all alterations, including those to the common parts of let residential
premises. As recommended by the review group, we are also considering,
in the context of the review of DFGs, the merits of an increased role
for regional housing boards in the provision of accessible housing and
housing
adaptations.</p><p><a name="06071359000046"></a>The
review group recommended that guidance should be made available on
making alterations to the common parts of let residential premises and
of residential commonholds. This would inform landlords, commonhold
associations and disabled people about the current law and other
relevant issues, and help them resolve potential disputes. The
inclusion of appropriate guidance in housing organisations'
publications about housing-related issues would be an effective way of
disseminating good practice and, in particular, such guidance could
encourage the use of alternative dispute resolution procedures rather
than automatic resort to the courts where disputes arise. We will
prepare such guidance in consultation with the devolved administrations
and will discuss it with appropriate organisations. And, as the review
group recommended, in considering responses to our consultation on
proposals for a code for sustainable homes for England, we will
consider the extent to which it would be appropriate to incorporate
guidance on improving the accessibility of common parts of premises in
new
builds.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06071359000006"></a>London:

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and
Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b>
My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for
Communities and Local Government has made the following Written
Ministerial Statement.</p><p><a name="06071359000048"></a>The
Government are today publishing a Statement setting out final proposals
for additional powers and responsibilities for the Greater London
Authority (GLA)&#151;the Mayor of London and the London
Assembly.</p><notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS57"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column WS57</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071359000049"></a>In November 2005 we
launched a consultation exercise which looked at options for giving the
Mayor a greater say in the planning and delivery of London's strategic
services. The consultation exercise stimulated a great deal of interest
and debate about the future strategic governance of London. We have
carefully considered all the responses to consultation in deciding the
final package of new powers published
today.</p><p><a name="06071359000050"></a>The Mayor will have new
lead roles in housing and adult skills in London, a strengthened role
over planning in the capital, a stronger strategic role on waste and
additional strategic powers in a wide range of policy areas including
culture and sport, health, energy and climate change and appointments
to the boards of the GLA's functional
bodies.</p><p><a name="06071359000051"></a>On housing, the Mayor
will prepare and publish a London housing strategy and a strategic
housing investment plan, setting out the priorities to meet the housing
needs of all Londoners. The Mayor will decide the broad allocation of
the affordable housing part of the regional housing pot in London in
line with the strategy.</p><p><a name="06071359000052"></a>On
skills, the Mayor will chair a new skills and employment board, in
partnership with London's key business leaders, which will prepare an
adult skills strategy for London. The board will be supported by the
learning and skills council (LSC) for London, which will sit within the
national LSC structure and spend its adult skills budget in line with
the priorities set out in the
strategy.</p><p><a name="06071359000053"></a>The
Mayor's planning powers will be enhanced to give him a greater
strategic say on planning in London. He will be able to direct changes
to boroughs' programmes for the local development plans they produce.
The Mayor will also have a stronger say on whether draft development
plan documents are in general conformity with his London Plan.
Furthermore, the Mayor will have discretion to determine planning
applications of strategic
importance.</p><p><a name="06071359000054"></a>The
Mayor will work closely with the boroughs in a new, London-wide waste
and recycling forum, which will manage a new fund to improve
performance and promote collaboration in waste and recycling. The Mayor
will make appointments to the boards of key London cultural
organisations. His health role will be enhanced. He will promote the
reduction of health inequalities in London, and prepare a strategy to
tackle those
inequalities.</p><p><a name="06071359000055"></a>Finally, the Mayor
will have a new lead role in tackling climate change. The GLA will be
subject to a new duty to take action to mitigate the effects of climate
change and adapt to its unavoidable impacts. The Mayor will publish a
climate change and energy strategy setting out his plans for minimising
emissions of carbon dioxide caused by the use of energy in the capital,
helping eradicate fuel poverty and harnessing economic opportunities
for London from investment and innovation in energy technologies and
energy efficiency. He will also publish a climate change adaptation
strategy setting out how the capital should adapt to the effects of
climate change.</p><p><a name="06071359000056"></a>We are
strengthening the London Assembly's role. The Assembly will be able to
set its own budget, publish an annual report highlighting its work and 
<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS58"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column WS58</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>achievements and hold hearings with candidates for key appointments the
Mayor proposes to make. The Mayor will be required to have specific
regard to the views of the Assembly and the GLA's functional bodies
when preparing or revising his statutory
strategies.</p><p><a name="06071359000057"></a>Arrangements
for appointing GLA employees will change so that most appointments will
be made by the head of paid service. The Mayor and Assembly will
jointly appoint the authority's three statutory
posts.</p><p><a name="06071359000058"></a>This package devolves
powers from Whitehall to London wherever feasible. In specific cases it
strengthens the Mayor's powers in relation to the boroughs where we are
convinced this will deliver better co-ordinated strategic
services.</p><p><a name="06071359000059"></a>It
provides a robust and coherent set of strategic powers for the Mayor
and Assembly, fulfilling the Government's manifesto commitment. It
ensures the capital has the strong leadership it needs as a successful
world city to meet future challenges, including hosting the 2012
Olympic and Paralympic Games. It builds on the success of the GLA to
date, providing the authority with additional powers to make a real
difference to the quality of Londoners'
lives.</p><p><a name="06071359000060"></a>We plan to implement the
changes as quickly as possible. We will introduce a GLA Bill as soon as
parliamentary time allows to enact any changes requiring primary
legislation. Other changes will be made through secondary legislation
or by
agreement.</p><p><a name="06071359000061"></a>Copies
of the policy statement, an accompanying regulatory impact assessment,
a summary of responses to consultation and the responses to the

Local Voice</I>, which sets out the Government's plans for the future
arrangements to support public involvement in health and social
care.</p><p><a name="06071359000065"></a>The update on health
reform sets out a clear vision: to develop a patient-led NHS that uses
available resources as effectively and fairly as possible to promote
health, reduce health inequalities and deliver the best and safest
possible healthcare.</p><notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS59"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column WS59</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071359000066"></a>The centrepiece of
today's update publication is a framework for commissioning. It will
act as a manual for new primary care trusts to achieve excellence in
the way they secure healthcare for their local
people.</p><p><a name="06071359000067"></a>Commissioning
is the means by which we secure the best possible healthcare and
outcomes, including reduced health inequalities, within the money made
available by the taxpayer. Commissioning itself is not new, but
stronger primary care trusts and the acceleration of practice-based
commissioning&#151;together with the powerful new set of incentives
and mechanisms introduced by the health reforms&#151;provide the
opportunity for far more effective commissioning that will benefit
patients and taxpayers
alike.</p><p><a name="06071359000068"></a>Effective commissioning
will require:</p><p><a name="06071359000069"></a>Real community
engagement and a stronger voice for patients achieved through increased
choice, widespread involvement and greater opportunity to influence
changes to services:</p>clinical
engagement through practice-based commissioning;
improved information to support commissioning;
andcommissioning levers through choice,
payment by results and robust
contracts.<p><a name="06071359000070"></a>The
reorganisation of PCTs, the moves towards universal coverage of
practice-based commissioning, and the establishment of the specialist
commissioning groups will provide the basic architecture for
commissioning NHS
services.</p><p><a name="06071359000071"></a>The
Department of Health will be seeking views from the NHS and partner
organisations over the summer on the key proposals to inform final
decisions. Views are sought on options for contracting in the NHS, a
governance and accountability framework for practice-based
commissioning and triggers for
petitions.</p><p><a name="06071359000072"></a>The framework sets
out the development programmes we are making available to all PCTs as
they build on the good commissioning practice that already exists. We
are also issuing an OJEU notice today to procure a framework agreement
and call-off contract which will enable PCTs to draw on private sector
expertise to support their commissioning. This does not in any way
affect or relate to PCT directly provided services. PCT boards will be
entirely free to choose to what extent, if any, they make use of the
call-off contract. In all cases the PCT board remains accountable and
responsible for all commissioning
decisions.</p><p><a name="06071359000073"></a>This
commissioning framework focuses on commissioning NHS services, and in
particular commissioning hospital services. This is the first step 
<notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS60"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column WS60</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in making commissioning truly effective. We know that joint
commissioning of services with local authorities and commissioning for
health and well-being are important too. A second framework covering
these wider issues will be published in
December.</p><p><a name="06071359000074"></a>The
commissioning framework is supported by an update on the other elements
of the reform programme: choice, provider reform, workforce, system
management, tariff and other financial incentives and
information.</p><p><a name="06071359000075"></a>Effective
commissioning will require real community engagement. The commissioning
framework will therefore work alongside <I>A Stronger Local Voice</I>,
which sets out the Government's plans for the future arrangements to
support public involvement in health and social
care.</p><p><a name="06071359000076"></a>These
include plans to build on patient and public involvement forums through
the creation of local involvement networks (LINks). The networks will
provide a flexible vehicle for communities and groups to engage with
health and social care organisations, and will promote public
accountability in health and social care through open and transparent
communication with commissioners and
providers.</p><p><a name="06071359000077"></a>We also plan to
simplify and strengthen the legislative requirements currently set out
in Section 11 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001, to clarify the
duties on all NHS bodies to involve and consult patients and the public
on all services they provide or commission. There will be a new duty
placed on commissioners to respond to what patients and the public have
said.</p><p><a name="06071359000078"></a>We believe that the new
environment being created by the reforms, using incentives and
commissioning, will mean that commissioners become advocates for
patients and taxpayers, driving up the quality, fairness,
responsiveness and value for money of NHS
services.</p><p><a name="06071359000079"></a>Copies of all today's

on or after the relevant
date.[HL6763]</ul><notus-date day="13" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WA138"></a><b>13 July 2006 : Column WA138</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071360000017"></a><b><a name="06071360000083"></a>Baroness

and (3) of Section 1 of the 1997 Act is that a person who had one of
the specified forms of British nationality immediately before the
relevant date can qualify for registration only if he or she would
otherwise have been stateless. Since that would not be the case where a
person already had another nationality or citizenship, it follows that
subsection (6) can be referring only to the giving up of another
nationality or citizenship acquired on or after that date. That is why
the instructions say that a person will be disqualified if, on or after
the relevant date, he or she
has,</p><ul><a name="06071360000062"></a>&#147;acquired and
renounced, or otherwise voluntarily relinquished, the nationality or
citizenship of another country or
territory&#148;.</ul><a name="06071360000061"></a>The
noble Lord rightly points out that acquisition of another nationality
or citizenship on or after the relevant date will not, in itself,
operate to disqualify the person concerned. We shall look at the

improved so as to avoid possible
misunderstanding.<p><a name="06071360000018"></a><b><a name="06071360000084"></a>Lord

to the Written Answer by the Baroness Scotland of Asthal on 28 June (WA

the Home Office Nationality Instructions, on what basis a British
Overseas citizen minor who has had another citizenship or nationality
taken away from him due to no act, or failure to act, of his own is

&#147;action or inaction&#148; that brought about the loss of the
person's non-British nationality or citizenship must have been that of
the person himself. It therefore seems to us unnecessary to inquire
into the extent to which the person was cognisant of an action taken on
his behalf (in this instance, an application by a parent for him to
have a British passport). The actions specified in paragraph 3.4 of
Annexe D to Chapter 12 of the Nationality Instructions, which relate to
deprivation and nullity of citizenship, are of a different order in
that they are taken neither by nor on behalf of the person

Written Answer by the Lord Davies of Oldham on 15 June (<I>WA 41</I>),
whether they will describe, including the measurable element, the
Department for Transport's scheme to offset carbon emissions generated
by its Ministers and officials while undertaking official travel;
whether the scheme includes forms of transport other than air travel;
how and on what date the details of the scheme were communicated to
officials within the department likely to use it; and how many times
the scheme has been used since its
introduction.[HL6496]</ul><p><a name="06071360000029"></a><b><a name="06071360000095"></a>Lord
Davies of Oldham:</b> The Department for Transport is
participating in, and contributed to, the development of a scheme to
enable government departments to offset the carbon impacts of their air
travel from April 2006. Investment through a Government Carbon
Offsetting Fund will replace or reduce the use of fossil fuels and the
subsequent emissions of carbon dioxide and compensate for the carbon
dioxide released by air travel. The department will calculate its
annual offset requirements based upon air travel cost and distance data
for the year, multiplied by a factor of two to reflect the fact that
the impact of aviation on climate change is increased over that of
direct carbon dioxide emissions alone by some of the other emissions
released and their specific effects at altitude. The scheme covers air
travel from April 2006. Staff were notified in May through the
department&#146;s in-house
magazine.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06071360000007"></a>Railways:
