<A NAME="50628-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Orr-Ewing </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether any, and if so what, action has ever been taken against Channel 4 for breaking the regulations laid down in Section 6 of the Broadcasting Act 1990.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of National Heritage   (Viscount Astor): </B>  My Lords, the Independent Television Commission has issued formal warnings to Channel 4 on two occasions. The first was for excessive violence and use of a knife in an omnibus edition of "Brookside" on 8th May 1993 and the second was for taste and decency transgressions in editions of "The Word" broadcast on 9th and 23rd December 1994. In addition, the ITC reported a total of eight interventions for breaches of its Programme Code in 1994. These involved on one occasion requiring Channel 4 to deliver an on-air apology for a grossly offensive remark in another edition of "The Word" broadcast on 12th December 1993.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Orr-Ewing: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that detailed reply. Is he aware that a large number of people write in with complaints to the commission? I believe that last year it was over 3,000. Very few of those were upheld; and it is alarming that when complaints are upheld we never hear what follows. While the commission may admonish, no penalty seems to follow in monetary terms, as regards the producer being stood down or programmes being cancelled for onward transmission.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-01_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, I believe that broadcasters take the judgments of the ITC, the Broadcasting Standards Council and the Broadcasting Complaints Commission very seriously. They take note of those judgments. As I said, on one occasion Channel 4 had to deliver an on-air apology and on another occasion quite recently Granada Television was fined by the ITC.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Ashbourne: </B>   My Lords, have the Government asked the ITC for an explanation of why it saw fit to show the film of "The Last Temptation of Christ", which is manifestly a blasphemous film and completely contrary to the Broadcasting Act 1990; and, if not, why not?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-01_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, as regards showing the film, it is a judgment for the ITC to make under the 1990 Act. These are difficult judgments which involve balancing a number of considerations. The commission did not consider that showing the film was in breach of either the Act or its Programme Code.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-01_spnew4"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Lincoln: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that many Christians find the film "The Last Temptation of Christ" at best banal and at worst offensive? The serious effect of its being transmitted on Independent Television is that it is made accessible to a large number of people. There is no real physical or financial control exercised over people watching it. That causes deep offence not only to Christians in this country but to many other decent people as well.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-01_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, I understand the concerns of the right reverend Prelate. However, the ITC considered the matter carefully. It is always difficult to make these judgments. There will always be certain viewers who will be upset if it is broadcast and others who will be upset if it is not. We believe that the 1990 Act works. It is a longstanding principle of the Government that we do not intervene in programme matters regarding either arrangements for scheduling or content.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-01_spnew6"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   My Lords&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-01_spmin2"></A><B>The Lord Privy Seal   (Viscount Cranborne): </B>  My Lords, I know that there is an enormous amount of interest in this subject. Perhaps noble Lords will allow the noble Viscount to speak.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-01_spnew7"></A><B> The Viscount of Falkland: </B>   My Lords, are we not in danger of becoming overheated on the subject? Does the Minister agree that if a broadcaster transgresses he must pay for his actions? In this case a most extraordinary hysterical attack on Channel 4 and Mr. Grade has been whipped up in the press. No doubt many of the comments that have appeared have been offensive and have offended people. However, let us not forget that Channel 4 has been a most successful British television enterprise. Does the noble Viscount further agree that the film industry has now been recognised, but we would have no film industry at all had it not been for the work of Channel 4 and Mr. Michael Grade? Surely things must be kept in proportion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-01_spnew8"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, the noble Viscount aptly demonstrates that there is more than one view on such matters.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos: </B>   My Lords, if a similar film about the Prophet Mohammed were shown in this country, what would be the consequences?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-01_spnew10"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, it is up to the ITC to decide in that scenario. The commission said quite clearly that in its view the Act and the programme guide were not broken by the transmission of the film. Therefore, no action was called for by the ITC.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-01_spnew11"></A><B> The Earl of Halsbury: </B>   My Lords, are Starred Questions the best forum for this complex subject? The noble Lord, Lord Orr-Ewing, has put down an Unstarred Question on television programmes on no named date. Can the usual channels collaborate to bring the debate forward so that we may have a proper discussion before we go away on holiday?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-01_spnew12"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, it is up to the usual channels, and I am sure that my noble friend the Chief Whip will take note of what the noble Earl says. It is important because the subject is complicated. It is difficult to give short answers to many of the questions asked which are hypothetical because they concern broadcasts which may or may not happen in the future.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Harmar-Nicholls: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that the ITC and the Broadcasting Standards Council share the responsibility for examining the matter? Would it not be better if one or the other had full responsibility so that it could be answerable to this House and anyone who wished could question it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-01_spnew14"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, the merger of the Broadcasting Standards Council with the Broadcasting Complaints Commission was announced in the White Paper on the BBC. That will reduce the potential for duplication between the two organisations. Under the Broadcasting Act, we believe that the ITC has the necessary powers. Indeed, it can impose heavy financial penalties of up to 3 per cent. of qualifying revenue on ITV or Channel 4.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Jenkins of Putney: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Viscount aware that I did not see the "The Last Temptation of Christ" because I was sure that I would not enjoy it? Might it not have been better if other noble Lords who had the same feelings had done the same?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-01_spnew16"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, in considering complaints, the ITC has to balance the considerations of good taste, decency, privacy and fair representation with the important right of freedom of expression in this country.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-01_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, the Broadcasting Act 1990 requires, among other things, that the commission shall ensure that nothing offensive or, under Section 6(1) (d) nothing abusive, of the religious opinions of any religious denomination or member of it shall be broadcast. My noble friend said how difficult is the decision that has to be made by the ITC. How can he maintain that it is difficult when before the broadcast 1,454 people wrote to tell the commission that the film would be offensive; that a steadily growing number of people wrote in afterwards saying it was offensive; and that the few of us who forced ourselves to watch that regrettable performance can confirm that it was deeply offensive to Christian opinion?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-01_spnew18"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend has a strongly held view on the subject and I respect that view. But under the 1990 Act it is for the broadcasters to make judgments about the content of individual programmes and the time at which they are broadcast in the light of the responsibilities placed on them by Parliament and the ITC Programme Code.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-01_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, like, I suspect, most noble and indignant Lords, I did not see any of the programmes mentioned. But they appear to have gone beyond the always uncertain frontiers of good taste. Does the Minister agree, however, that it is the unique remit of Channel 4 to pursue minority tastes in experimental programmes? We should understand that and also that sometimes Channel 4 gets it wrong. When it does, it is quite right that the ITC should hammer Channel 4 firmly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-02_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, it is not for me to defend or attack the judgment of Mr. Grade. It is for him to decide what should be broadcast. However, it is for the ITC as the regulator, through its Programme Code, to regulate Channel 4. That is what it did and it issued a warning to Channel 4, as well as insisting on an on-air apology.

<P>
<A NAME="50628-02_spopq0"></A><B> Baroness Sharples </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What advice is given to registrars concerning the reporting of marriages which may be bogus.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Baroness Cumberlege): </B>  My Lords, superintendent registrars are instructed to send a report to the Registrar General where they have good reason to suspect that a proposed marriage has been arranged for the sole purpose of evading statutory immigration controls. If the Registrar General is satisfied that the marriage is purely one of convenience, then the facts will be passed on to the Home Office.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-02_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Sharples: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that reply. Can she say how many people are involved? Would it be possible for the so-called immigration consultancies to be licensed so as to prevent the exploitation of many immigrants who wish to settle in this country?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, I understand that last year there were 470 suspected marriages of convenience, of which 404 were passed to the Home Office. With regard to the licensing issue, I understand that my right honourable friend the Home Secretary is actively reviewing the immigration rules concerning bogus marriages. I am sure that this is one issue which he would wish to take into account.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rea: </B>   My Lords, are the Government to ask registrars of marriages to act as informal informers for the Home Office? Their real job is to establish a good rapport with couples before and during the civil ceremony. Will the registrars perhaps be offered performance-related pay according to the number of so-called bogus marriages that <P>


<a name="column_749"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 749</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>they unearth? Surely the problem should be tackled by using approaches other than asking registrars of marriages to give information.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, a lot of quips are made about marriage. I was told one at the weekend&#151;"Where there's a will, there's a relation"! I do not believe that that is the case. For some people this is a very serious matter. There are people who want to gain access to this country, and I can understand why. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary is considering this issue at the moment. The noble Lord has a point; superintendent registrars are not there to do the policing for the Home Office. This difficult issue is being actively addressed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-02_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the category of marriages which "may be" bogus is somewhat short on precision? Will she bear in mind the case of my late great Uncle Henry, then Lord Stanley of Alderley? He was married three times to the same woman and, when he died, it turned out that he was not married at all! Will the Minister accept that the noble Lord acted in perfectly good faith?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-02_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, I am distraught that I did not know this great Uncle Henry. He obviously had tremendous charms.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, my relatives declared the marriage bogus after the death of our mutual great uncle so that they could get the jewellery back. Is the noble Baroness aware that 404 cases is a very small number, and by no means justifies the hysteria about bogus marriages that has been whipped up in parts of the popular press? Can she say how many of the 404 cases reported to the Home Office resulted in prosecutions and how many people were subsequently convicted?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-02_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, I am afraid that I do not have that information. I know that last year 17,000 people applied to remain in this country on the basis that they are married to a person who is settled here or that they are a British citizen. The noble Lord may have a very good point when he says that the issue has been whipped up. However, it should be addressed. Feelings on the matter are very strong, and it is quite right that my right honourable friend should address them. We should hear something before the Recess.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-02_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that it would be logical for the Home Secretary also to consider those cases that represent genuine marriages with people in other countries who have waited for many years and who have a legitimate right to live in this country? Will she seek to ensure that her right honourable friend the Home Secretary will review the procedure in those cases as well?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-02_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, an overseas national who is in the United Kingdom gains no automatic entitlement to remain here simply by marrying a British citizen or a person settled here. There are people who wish to try to gain access to this country and who perhaps have no intention of marrying and remaining married except for this one particular purpose. We do not believe that that is a legitimate way to gain access to this country, and therefore the matter needs to be addressed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-02_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry if I did not answer the noble Baroness. If the case is genuine, then there is not an issue. Indeed, certain conditions are laid down to ensure that cases are genuine. A person coming to this country must not, for instance, be a burden on the state. A number of different conditions apply. I will certainly write to the noble Baroness.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that at the outbreak of the last war my father entered into a marriage of convenience with a lady of German extraction who was of the Jewish faith in order to prevent her being sent back to Nazi Germany? Does the Minister condemn or condone such action?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-02_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, I find that an impossible case to answer. One has to look into the details. Perhaps I may simply say that I married at 17; it was the best decision I ever made, and it has been very successful.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-02_spnew15"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, divisions on delegated legislation are infrequent because of the convention that, although noble Lords have every right to do so, they do not vote directly on delegated legislation.
<P>

<a name="50628-02_para0"></a>Since 1979 this House has rejected delegated legislation on only one occasion. In 1988 two special procedure orders relating to the harbour authorities of Harwich and Newport were annulled on Motions moved by the Government and agreed to without Division, because they were found to be technically defective.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that reply. Will he confirm that his reply makes it clear that this House has the right, if it so wishes, to reject a regulation, even though that regulation was passed in another place?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-02_spnew17"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, I believe that my noble friend was aware of and attended the debate initiated by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, in October last year, when the House agreed to a Motion in almost the same terms as his supplementary question.

<A NAME="50628-02_spnew19"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord will be aware that both he and I see the force and good sense in maintaining the convention, with the exceptions to which I alluded in the Answer to my noble friend's Question. Exceptions were made for reasons of good sense; namely, the orders were technically defective. I am most grateful to the noble Lord for signifying his agreement to both those matters. My noble friend Lord Brabazon of Tara, who replied to the debate, made it very clear that there were good commonsense reasons, to which I know the noble Lord's party agreed at the time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-02_spnew20"></A><B> Baroness Seear: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Viscount realise that if the Government insist on producing more and more legislation which is merely skeleton legislation, and under which so many important decisions are being made by regulation, a great many Members of this House will use the right to oppose that exists?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-02_spnew21"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, I am well aware that the noble Baroness and her party have warned frequently of that danger.

<A NAME="50628-03_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, I always agree with the views of my noble friends on the Government Front Bench. If noble Lords will allow me, I should like to try to give a serious answer to the noble Lord's Question. There is a very good case for making a rational judgment about the proper place of secondary legislation, the proper place of primary legislation, and the relationship between the two. There has certainly been a less ordered approach than has sometimes been necessary in the past. I have made that view clear during debates in this House on this important subject. This House has an extremely important role to play, particularly in relation to the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee, to try to make sure that a proper watch is kept on the relationship between primary and secondary legislation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-03_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Onslow: </B>   My Lords, is it true that more than 3,000 regulations have been passed during the last year; and that of those 3,000, some went into hundreds of pages? How can we possibly look with any ability whatever at legislation that appears in such vast quantities? Surely, Britain is a very over-governed country, and that must be brought to a halt.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-03_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, I do not wish in any way to appear to my noble friend as unduly self-regarding. Perhaps I may refer him to some of the remarks that I made during the course of recent debates on the quality of legislation. I have no doubt at all that my noble friend will in no way disagree with my remarks.

<A NAME="50628-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Willoughby de Broke: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend the Minister for that very encouraging reply. Can she elaborate a little, in particular as regards the liability of the future government of the Hong Kong special autonomous region? Will that government be accountable at law, bearing in mind that Article 19 of the Basic Law which refers to acts of state will be included in the court of appeal Bill? Can she say whether that provision could possibly be interpreted as making that future government immune from prosecution by their members?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-03_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, the Basic Law does not give either the Hong Kong Government or the Chinese Government the power to avoid the court's jurisdiction at will. It would be for the courts of the Hong Kong special administrative region to decide what is or is not an act of state.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-03_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that the latest agreement is that the court will only be set up after 1997, despite the agreement in the joint liaison group as recently as 1991 that it would be set up before 1997's surrender? What has happened to the policy that it was critical that the Court of Final Appeal be set up and running and an established part of Hong Kong's legal system before 1997?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-03_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, it is important to understand that the aim of the 1991 agreement was to prevent a judicial vacuum in Hong Kong in 1997 by establishing a proper Court of Final Appeal before 1st July 1997 in a way that would enable it to continue after 1997. As we know, back in 1991, the Legislative Council voted against implementing the 1991 agreement. That is why the Hong Kong Government were unable to set up the court in 1992 or 1993 as originally planned. But by this year, China no longer believed that it was feasible to set up the court before 1997. So we were faced with the need to find a way to ensure the continuity of law in Hong Kong and to secure the principles at the heart of the 1991 agreement. The 1995 agreement does just that.
<P>

<a name="50628-03_para0"></a>The LegCo members have a clear choice. They can either pass the Bill and ensure that a proper Court of Final Appeal is set up on 1st July 1997, or they can reject it and ensure that Hong Kong has a judicial vacuum in 1997 until the special administrative region government sets up <P>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 753</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a Court of Final Appeal at a time and on a basis about which there could be no certainty. I hope and I am sure that the whole House hopes that LegCo will support the Bill unamended and that enactment in the present Session will be in the very best interests of Hong Kong.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-03_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry to press the Minister, but is it the UK Government's view that it was not feasible to set up the Court of Final Appeal before July 1997?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-03_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, I have already answered that question. Perhaps the noble Baroness was not listening. Will she please listen? It is no secret whatever that the United Kingdom Government would have preferred to set up the court before the handover, but that China no longer believed it feasible to set up the court before 1997. So we had to find a way to ensure the continuity of law in Hong Kong, to secure the principles at the heart of the 1991 agreement. The agreement does just that. I am sure that when the noble Baroness reads what I have said in answer to her questions, she will see the sense of my remarks.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, would the noble Baroness at least acknowledge that there is a substantial body of opinion among the elected members of the Legislative Council which holds that the agreement is not consistent with the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law? Will she accept that the particular quarrel that they have with the agreement is that acts of state are to be defined by the Chinese Government, thereby giving that government immunity from proceedings in the courts of Hong Kong over a wide range of public activities?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-03_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, of course I know what Mr. Martin Lee has said. But that is not the case. The position is exactly as I have just explained to the noble Baroness.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-03_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Dunn: </B>   My Lords, I have come from Hong Kong. Will the Minister accept that the agreement on the Court of Final Appeal and the Court of Final Appeal Bill has been warmly welcomed by the Chief Justice, the local and international business community, our major trading partners and, through an independent poll, the majority of Hong Kong people? People see it as a sensible and workable arrangement and feel that a major uncertainty about the continuity of Hong Kong's judicial system has been removed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-03_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, I am indebted to the noble Baroness for those words. She knows better than any of us the great difficulty in which Hong Kong was placed by the refusal of China to implement the 1991 agreement. I am relieved and pleased to see that we now have an agreement which will be in the interests of all the people of Hong Kong and to have her confirmation of that today in your Lordships' House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-03_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that many of us, in the past, have had some reservations about the conduct of policy in the area, principally because it could leave the people of Hong Kong exposed without an independent Court of Final Appeal? Will she accept that <P>


<a name="column_754"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 754</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>we are very glad indeed to have the opportunity to congratulate the Government on having pulled off that agreement in very difficult circumstances?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-03_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, I am indebted to my noble friend. From my discussions in Hong Kong just three weeks ago, I can say that the agreement is good news for Hong Kong and for the rule of law. It is also to be hoped that LegCo will understand that it is the best way of resolving the matter; but it is of course up to LegCo. I repeat what I said earlier in answer to the noble Baroness&#151;we hope that LegCo will support the Bill unamended, because it is in the interests of all Hong Kong people. Amendment will be inconsistent with our international obligations and therefore unacceptable. We do not want a judicial vacuum. We want this matter cleared up for the sake of all the people of Hong Kong.

<br>
("half the cost by that person and the balance by the person required to keep the meter in proper order by sub-paragraph (1) or (3) above;").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50628-04_para20"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 69A is tabled in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Peston. It is directed towards a situation where a supplier finds himself in dispute with the customer. We are seeking to make the supplier pay half the cost of having a meter tested if there is a dispute in relation to the accuracy of the meter.
<P>

<a name="50628-04_para21"></a>This was an issue which the Gas Consumers Council raised, because the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act of 1994 caused serious anxiety in relation to the doubling of the fee for testing domestic meters. We are talking of a cost of around &#163;40. Clearly that sort of cost, particularly for consumers who are not financially very well endowed, is likely to deter some consumers from having their meters tested. We feel that making the supplier bear at least a proportion of the cost may act as a deterrent if the supplier insists on undertaking a meter test which is not necessary, unless the accuracy is genuinely in dispute.
<P>

<a name="50628-04_para22"></a>This is an issue which also affects those who pay promptly. I do not know whether any Members of the Committee ever find themselves in the position of paying their gas bills promptly, but I suppose it must happen. It may be found, to one's great embarrassment, that one is being asked to pay an exorbitant fee in respect of one's gas bill. There are a number of occasions where a serious dispute between the supplier and the consumer can arise in that respect.
<P>

<a name="50628-04_para23"></a>In dealing with perfectly genuine cases we are anxious to enable an individual involved in any such dispute to go to the utility and ask the company to look at the meter. We are talking of people who are essentially hard up and will find &#163;40 a real deterrent and threat. This issue was raised in the standing committee in another place and the Minister indicated that he was not impressed with what we and the Gas Consumers Council were suggesting. He said that there was a risk that the supplier may not have to pay the full cost where circumstances which justified that position had arisen. He said that the balance struck by the Government was about right.
<P>

<a name="50628-04_para24"></a>We feel that we are not satisfied in that regard and nor is the Gas Consumers Council. We are seeking to weigh the scales rather more in favour of the consumer than <P>


<a name="column_757"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 757</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>appears in the Bill as drafted. I hope the Minister will not say that we have the wording slightly wrong&#151;this applies to all the amendments. We are not in the position of having skilled parliamentary draftsmen and we do our best in these situations. The principle is very clear and I hope that the Government will acknowledge that. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-04_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I welcome the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, back into the deliberations on this Bill. It is a delight to see him, even if his first intimation resulted in the extraordinary information that he does not normally pay his gas bill promptly&#151;at least that is what I thought he was suggesting; that noble Lords did not pay their gas bills promptly, which insinuated that it takes one to know one.
<P>

<a name="50628-04_para25"></a>I assure the noble Lord that I shall not accuse him of not having the wording right on the amendment. But it goes a little further than that. I recognise the concern that he expresses&#151;that people should be entitled to have the meters checked at a reasonable cost. However, I see no logic in providing for a permanent subsidy under which suppliers or public gas transporters have to pay towards the testing of meters which turn out to be perfectly accurate&#151;especially as the supplier and transporter have to pay if the meter is found to be faulty.
<P>

<a name="50628-04_para26"></a>The best way to approach this problem is at its source. The deregulation Act allows for the consumer to have his disputed meter tested by private sector meter examiners appointed by the director to undertake that work in competition with government meter examiners. It is intended that that flexibility will allow the actual costs of meter tests to be driven down.
<P>

<a name="50628-04_para27"></a>To a large extent it is a temporary problem. I do not know whether the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, is familiar with the technicalities, but the old-type meters are leather diaphragm meters. Once they have been replaced&#151;that is scheduled to happen by the end of 1996&#151;the proportion of meters found on examination to record inaccurately should reduce.
<P>

<a name="50628-04_para28"></a>I hesitate to tell the noble Lord that his amendment is worded inaccurately, but it does have a perverse effect in that suppliers could challenge a customer-owned meter and require the customer to pay half the cost if the meter turned out to be all right. Therefore, while I understand the noble Lord's anxieties, they are exaggerated and the situation should in time settle down.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-04_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   For the record, some of us actually pay more than promptly because some of us pay a regular monthly sum and in my case I am always in credit with the gas company, though I do not receive any credit for that at all. I might add that I certainly have no desire to subsidise those who pay in arrears.
<P>

<a name="50628-04_para29"></a>Is not this a matter of balance? Essentially, someone is sitting there convinced that there is something wrong with his meter because his gas bill is disproportionately high and he is not willing to believe that he is using more gas or something like that. Then he has what is essentially a gamble. He can say, "Is it worth &#163;40, or whatever it is, to have my meter tested?". I take it that the Government's view is that that is how it ought to be; that we have to have some deterrent from excessive neurosis about the meter and that the Bill as drafted provides that deterrent in the <P>


<a name="column_758"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 758</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sense that if one wins the bet one has one's bill put back to the right level and one is not charged for testing but if one loses the bet&#151;the meter is perfectly all right&#151;one has to pay the cost and the bill is not adjusted. The point of an amendment like this is to ask whether that is the right balance or whether there could not be an intermediate stage where one is less at risk. What is the Government's view on that?
<P>

<a name="50628-04_para30"></a>I do not know how many individual privately owned meters there are. It is not a matter I have looked into. Can the noble Earl tell us whether that is a very big problem. Quite clearly, there would be an anomaly. A gas supplier who was looking for trouble&#151;I cannot believe that there would be such a supplier&#151;could go around demanding that privately owned meters be checked. I had not thought of such a thing. It had not occurred to me that most people own their own meters. Perhaps we could be given some information on that.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199495/ldhansrd/vo950628/text/50628-05.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-05_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   This debate is becoming enormously interesting. First we were told by the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, that he does not pay his bills very often. Then the noble Lord, Lord Peston, in a burst of self-righteousness, said that he pays his bills not only on time but in advance. He is a very remarkable man, particularly as he is an economist.
<P>

<a name="50628-05_para0"></a>The question posed by the noble Lord, Lord Peston, is a perfectly reasonable one. If one feels concerned that one's meter is a duff meter, one feels that one wants to have it tested. The noble Lord asked whether the Government are really saying that if someone is right the gas company pays and if that person is wrong he pays. One could say that that is very often what happens in a court of law. If one wins the case one has one's costs paid; if one loses it one pays the costs of the other side.
<P>

<a name="50628-05_para1"></a>I was trying to explain that meters are pretty accurate. They are likely to become more accurate as the leather diaphragm meters are replaced. The chances of meters being wrong are pretty small. It may be that one or two go wrong. One can get some very disgruntled folk who say, "This is quite intolerable. My meter must be wrong", when the meter is perfectly all right. If one goes to the trouble of getting the supplier concerned to test a meter which is perfectly all right, I do not think it is unreasonable to say that one ought to pay. If one complains that the meter is wrong and the company finds that it is wrong, then it is right that the company should pay. I do not think that that is unduly rigorous.
<P>

<a name="50628-05_para2"></a>The noble Lord asked how many meters are privately owned. As I understand it, there is none at the moment, but there may be some in the future.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   This has been an interesting short debate because what has been revealed beyond any reasonable doubt and at one fell swoop is the integrity and naivety of my noble friend Lord Peston in terms of the payment of the gas bill. I want to make it quite clear that I am never in arrears with the payment of my gas bill. I might be resentful, but that is another matter. However, I do not think that I should allow on the record the noble Earl's impugning of my integrity in that regard, which I feel terribly hurt by.
<P>

<a name="50628-05_para3"></a>What the noble Earl had to say in relation to the theory is fine. But what matters is what happens when one gets down to the nitty-gritty. The reality is that people who are <P>


<a name="column_759"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 759</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in the very low income bracket would find this situation a deterrent. I am interested in what the noble Earl had to say about the private sector meter examiner. Who pays for that? Does that go on top of the &#163;40? Perhaps the noble Earl will reply to that point.
<P>

<a name="50628-05_para4"></a>One comes into collision with this sort of problem more in relation to telephone bills where some people feel that there may have been an overcharge. It is very difficult to sort out the problem. It is more difficult when the amount by some standards may be quite small; by others it may be in relative terms quite high. We feel that the balance here is not quite right.
<P>

<a name="50628-05_para5"></a>I have been reminded of another factor by some mysterious hand a moment ago. A meter can be recording quite accurately but a high reading could indicate that a leak has occurred elsewhere. A problem might exist in that respect.
<P>

<a name="50628-05_para6"></a>I should like the Minister to comment on the points I have made. In relation to the private sector meter examiner, who bears the cost of that? What is the amount involved if there is a charge? Perhaps the noble Earl could also comment on the point I made a few moments ago.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-05_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   The noble Lord said that one very often can have difficulty in checking up on telephone bills and so forth. I agree that that is a difficulty. However, I do not think that that is a strictly accurate comparison. With telephone calls, one makes a number of calls but the meter is housed elsewhere. In that respect it could be said that it is quite difficult to check, although now one gets detailed accounts it is relatively easy to check. However, one has the gas meter in one's own house. The bill consists of one set of figures which depict the amount of gas that has gone through the meter. That is a very much easier matter to determine. Where the difficulty comes&#151;the noble Lord is quite right&#151;is when there is a leak. There are ways of discovering and dealing with leaks. But that is not the point that the noble Lord is concerned about. He was concerned about who should pay if one wants to have one's meter checked. One comes back to what I said originally. If someone is concerned and complains that his meter must be checked&#151;he may even be cantankerous&#151;and the meter is perfectly all right it is not unreasonable to say that he ought to pay the bill. It is unreasonable&#151;or could be said to be unreasonable&#151;that he should transfer that obligation on to the company which has provided a perfectly good meter which is perfectly all right.
<P>

<a name="50628-05_para7"></a>The noble Lord referred to private sector meters. There is no additional cost for private sector meters. The examiners act in the same way as existing meter readers. The examiners will not cost any more.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-05_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Seear: </B>   The noble Lord made an interesting point about leaks. Who pays for the leak? A leak may have occurred on your premises; it may have occurred just outside. I once had the unfortunate experience in France of having a ploughman ploughing into the water pipe and emptying my water supply completely. I had to pay for all the water, although it was not on my ground. At what point does one become liable for the leak? I had no control over what this ass was doing with his equipment which cut the pipe, but I nevertheless had to pay.

<A NAME="50628-05_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   We are getting into deep water now. We are changing from gas to water. I can quite understand what the noble Baroness says because I have done the same thing. At my agricultural operations we were operating with a mole-plough, which may not be a familiar instrument to the noble Baroness but it is one of those things that goes down about two feet below the ground. It does to electric cables what I have just done to a glass of water&#151;it smashes them. But that is not what happens with gas. If there is a gas leak before the gas comes into the meter, that is the responsibility either of the supplier or of the transporter. The responsibility of the householder comes from the meter onwards.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-05_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Seear: </B>   If the gas pipe leaks at a point where it is in your home but before the connection to the meter, who pays?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-05_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   The responsibility for the gas pipe before it comes to the meter is with the gas transporter. If the transporter's method of transporting is inadequate, the transporter will pay. One then comes to the meter. At that point it becomes the supplier, and for a moment the transporter changes to the supplier. The supplier puts the gas into the house via the meter, and thereafter it becomes the responsibility of the owner.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-05_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   Perhaps I may join in because this is the most interesting event of the day. Surely, the logical point is very simple: one only pays for the gas which is metered. If a leak occurs before the meter there is no possible way that one will be charged for it. It is as simple as that. Therefore, I do not believe that the noble Earl should be in the least concerned. A leak before the meter may present problems, but one will not end up with a charge because one pays for the metered gas.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-05_spnew8"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord. I did not have the slightest concern; it was the noble Baroness who was concerned. I was trying to reassure her, but the noble Lord, Lord Peston, has, of course, done it far better than I could have done.

<P>
<A NAME="50628-05_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Sefton of Garston: </B>   The question was as to who was responsible when the gas leaves the main owned by the transporter and goes into the domestic dwelling. For many years the regulations used to be that a cut-off was made within 18 inches of the boundary of the dwelling to be supplied with gas. The owner of the property was responsible for anything that ensued between the cut-off point&#151;that is to say, the stopcock outside, and inside the dwellinghouse. So there are two ways. The occupier of the dwelling would be responsible, through the meter, for the gas, but if any repairs were necessary between the meter and the outside boundary of the estate, the occupier would also be responsible for them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-05_spnew10"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Sefton of Garston, has a remarkable capacity for muddling up everything. I tried to explain perfectly clearly that up to the point where the gas pipe comes into the meter, it is the responsibility of the transporter and after that it is the responsibility of the individual. I do not believe I can put it more clearly than that.

<A NAME="50628-05_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Sefton of Garston: </B>   I have had 45 years playing about with gas mains in the street. I can assure the Minister that he has completely misinterpreted the whole of the question as regards the law relating to the responsibility for pipes inside the dwelling.

<P>
<A NAME="50628-05_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   I advanced the argument about leaks with some trepidation. My misgivings have been more than fulfilled. After all, this Government have paid very heavily for leaks and know very much more about them than we do. However, having regard to the Minister's reply, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-06_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Ferrers </B>   moved Amendment No. 70:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 21, line 17, leave out ("until those requirements have been complied with").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50628-06_para0"></a>The noble Earl said: In moving this amendment I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 80, 83, 88 and 89. It may be for the convenience of the Committee if at the same time we discuss Amendment No. 81 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Peston.
<P>

<a name="50628-06_para1"></a>As regards Amendments Nos. 70, 80, 83, 88 and 89, Schedule 2 provides for the disconnection of consumers' premises in a number of circumstances, such as non-payment and meter-tampering. But it also extends to more esoteric faults such as operating a gas-powered compressor without having in place an anti-fluctuator or a valve to protect the pipeline system against air getting into it.
<P>

<a name="50628-06_para2"></a>The amendments make clear that a transporter or a supplier is under no obligation to reconnect or recommence the supply in this kind of situation until the customer has made good the default or remedied the problem that led up to the disconnection, and the supplier or transporter has been paid the reasonable costs of the original disconnection and reconnection. Amendment No. 88 inserts a new paragraph to achieve that and Amendments Nos. 70, 80 and 83 delete other parts of the schedule which are superseded by this new paragraph. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   In so far as I understand the noble Earl's amendments they are rather technical. I have not the faintest idea of the meaning of some of the words he used. I am certain that, among other things, they involve the technology of the industry. I am perfectly happy to have my amendment grouped with these amendments, but it is slightly different. The only connection is that it is to do with cutting off. Essentially, I am looking for the noble Earl's view on what we find in subparagraph (6) of paragraph 7 where the supply of gas has been cut off and the,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"supplier shall not be under any obligation to resume the supply...in default",</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50628-06_para3"></a>until that has been made good and,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the reasonable expenses of cutting off and of restoring the supply",</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50628-06_para4"></a>have been paid.
<P>

<a name="50628-06_para5"></a>I am puzzled by the way in which the Bill is drafted and leaves out what I should have thought was the main point; namely, that the customer in default simply owes the gas company money. The sensible thing, both for the <P>


<a name="column_762"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 762</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>customer and the gas company, is to make some arrangements for the repayment of arrears and also arrangements for payments in future so that the problem does not arise again.
<P>

<a name="50628-06_para6"></a>My amendment is aimed at trying to find out whether those ideas are implicit in the provisions under subparagraph (6) (a) or whether we need to expand the subparagraph along the lines of my amendment in order to incorporate into the Bill what I would regard as good sense.
<P>

<a name="50628-06_para7"></a>It is in no one's interest for a customer to be cut off. It is neither in the interest of the supplier nor that of the customer. It is in no one's interest that there should be default, but it is in everyone's interest that people should behave reasonably both as regards arrears and the future. The purpose of the amendment is to guide us towards that. It may well be that subparagraph (6) (a) means that, but I do not know. Therefore I look forward to the noble Earl's reply as to what that provision means and for his judgment on my amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-06_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Peston, found my vocabulary difficult. I thought that things like gas-powered compressors and anti-fluctuators were part of his everyday vocabulary, as they are of mine. I warned the noble Lord beforehand that some of these things are technical and if he does not understand them, sometimes that will make two of us&#151;meaning, of course, the noble Lords, Lord Peston and Lord Clinton-Davis!
<P>

<a name="50628-06_para8"></a>He said that the only link between his amendment and mine was the reference to cutting off. That was an interesting observation. Perhaps I may tell him what is the real problem about his amendment. The subparagraph which it wants to amend is proposed to disappear altogether by virtue of my Amendment No. 80, which is part of an exercise to bring together all the obligations on a consumer to make redress before reconnection.
<P>

<a name="50628-06_para9"></a>That could, of course, be sorted out at a later stage. More fundamentally, however, there seems little point in the proposed provision in the noble Lord's amendment. Its effect would be that a supplier would be obliged to reconnect if he agreed a repayment plan with the customer. But he would not have agreed the repayment plan unless he was willing to reconnect on that basis. The present provisions, both as printed in the Bill and as proposed to be replaced by Government Amendment No. 89, already allow for this as they deal with what the supplier is obliged to do and not what he may choose to do.
<P>

<a name="50628-06_para10"></a>I understand that that is what actually happens now. In the great majority of cases premises which have been disconnected are reconnected within about 24 hours, once the customer has reached an arrangement with British Gas. There is no reason why that should change in the future. Suppliers will continue to prefer being paid rather than keeping customers cut off. Therefore, it is in the nature of things that the arrangements will be made fairly quickly and the supply restored.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Earl. What he says makes perfectly good sense. The puzzle is&#151;and this is true of subparagraph (6) and the new wording in Amendment No. 89&#151;that what happens does not seem to be in that paragraph. I entirely agree with the noble Earl <P>


<a name="column_763"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 763</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that one would not make all these arrangements, as outlined in my amendment, if it was not proposed to reconnect. The point is that in some senses the Bill reads as if that will no longer be the case. The Bill refers to "made good the report", "remedied the matter", and "paid the reasonable expenses of disconnecting and reconnecting". It is almost as if the central point, which is to behave sensibly about payment so that you will be reconnected (which is what actually happens at the moment) is somehow ruled out. But I take it that it would be a mistake to interpret the noble Earl's amendment as in any way ruling that out.
<P>

<a name="50628-06_para11"></a>If I understood him correctly, the noble Earl was arguing that such provisions do not have to be in the legislation because that is what happens. Is that what the noble Earl was saying? The noble Earl agrees that the provisions of my amendment correspond to what actually happens in the world, and that that will continue to happen. There is nothing in the Bill to impede that in the future. I am trying to make clear why I was concerned because it is possible that the Bill has a meaning which is different from what the noble Earl says&#151;and I agree&#151;is what happens in the real world.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-06_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for trying to make that clear. However, in his endeavours to do so he has made things a little more obfuscatory for me. In fact, I believe that the noble Lord is right and that what has happened in the past will continue to happen. What I am saying is that if the noble Lord's amendment were accepted, it would cut across my amendment. There is no question that there will not be a fairly quick remedy of the situation. Therefore, the noble Lord is worried unduly.
<P>

<a name="50628-06_para12"></a>Ultimately, of course, suppliers will need to be paid. Deadlock in negotiations with customers is of no use to suppliers who are trying to get back their money. Consumers will want a supply of gas again and will want that as quickly as possible. However, if a consumer is not prepared to part with the money or otherwise satisfy a supplier that he will be paid, it is right and reasonable that the supplier can keep the gas switched off; but I do not think that that is likely to happen. That will be the last resort.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-06_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I thank the noble Earl. I imagine that it will all work out happily in the end. In any case, I have got my views down on paper, as has the noble Earl&#151;or at least they will be down on paper by tomorrow. If those in the noble Earl's office who scrutinise these things think that the provisions are not right, I am sure that they will be able to put them right. However, as the noble Earl has satisfied me on this point at the moment, I shall seek leave to withdraw my amendment when we get to it.

<br>
(" .&#151;(1) No person shall undertake the reading of gas meters or the provision of other services relating to gas meters unless he is&#151;
<br>
(a) an authorised officer of a public gas transporter, gas supplier or gas shipper; or
<br>
(b) a meter service provider registered in accordance with the scheme provided for in sub-paragraph (2) below.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_764"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 764</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=2>
<br>
(2) The Secretary of State shall by order provide for the establishment and operation by the Director of a scheme for the registration of persons entitled to act as meter service providers.
<br>
(3) Where a meter service provider is acting in accordance with the instructions of a public gas transporter, gas supplier or gas shipper, for the purposes of this Schedule he shall be treated as an authorised officer of that transporter, supplier or shipper as the case may be and references in this Schedule to an authorised officer shall be construed accordingly.
<br>
(4) Nothing in this paragraph shall be taken to prohibit a consumer from reading a gas meter installed in premises he occupies or any transporter, shipper or supplier from arranging for a consumer to read such a meter.
<br>
(5) In this Schedule "meter service provider" means a person registered as such in accordance with sub-paragraph (2) above.
<br>
(6) If any person acts in contravention of this paragraph, he shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50628-06_para14"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment deals with the setting up of a registration scheme for meter readers other than individuals directly employed by licence holders. Perhaps I may remind the Committee that at present gas meters are read by persons who are directly employed by British Gas and they have an identification which they reveal. If anybody has any doubts about that person, they can immediately check up by telephoning the number shown on that identification card.
<P>

<a name="50628-06_para15"></a>The trouble is that one of the effects of opening up the domestic gas supply market will be the creation of a competitive market for the provision of meter services, such as meter reading, meter servicing and meter sales. From 1st April 1999, individual gas consumers will be able to determine who provides those services&#151;in other words, they need not go to the licensees. A consumer would be able to obtain his or her gas supply from a particular supplier but have his meter services provided by someone else. Furthermore, the licence holders could provide those services either with their own employees or by subcontracting the work to another firm. The whole point of the amendment is to provide some safeguards for consumers where meter services are provided by persons other than those directly employed by licensees.
<P>

<a name="50628-06_para16"></a>Concern has been expressed recently about security services not being properly registered. It is perfectly possible to envisage difficulties caused by people who pretend to be skilful and knowledgeable in matters such as meter reading and meter servicing but who do not have any such qualifications. Therefore, I believe that it is important that suitable safeguards should be provided to consumers where those providing such services are not directly employed by licensees. That would put them in a position comparable to that of employees of British Gas. The amendment addresses the position of the rest of the market. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-06_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   I rise to support the amendment ably moved by the noble Lord, Lord Ezra. Questions of security and safety for consumers unfortunately loom large in this day and age when there are too many instances of people of doubtful reputation entering people's homes by all sorts of bogus means. There is therefore a great deal of concern, and that concern has <P>


<a name="column_765"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 765</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>been registered with us by the Gas Consumers Council, and others, who say that there is a need to remedy what appears to be an omission from the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50628-06_para17"></a>The Government should take on board the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, that the regime is changing and could operate even more to the disadvantage of consumers. The noble Lord was right to mention the private security industry, which was considered by the Select Committee on Home Affairs in another place, which expressed the unanimous view that statutory regulation was needed to govern that particular industry. If there is a need for statutory regulation in that case, why not in relation to this industry also? I hope that the Minister will regard that as a fair point.
<P>

<a name="50628-06_para18"></a>More than that&#151;it is not only consumers, but also British Gas and AGAS, which support the idea. It is not something that the noble Lord has simply dreamt up with our support. This is a matter of real concern. Going back to my days as a Member of another place, I do not say that this was at the top of the list of complaints made by constituents, but there was a certain regularity to the correspondence about people being able to gain entry to other people's homes. I am sure that all those who have had to deal with constituents can confirm that point. I hope that the Minister will be positive in his reply. Indeed, in another place on 30th March the Minister indicated that the Government would reflect on this concern as the Bill went through its various stages. Therefore, I hope that the Government will be positive in those reflections.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-07_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Fisher of Rednal: </B>   I should like to comment briefly in supporting the noble Lord, Lord Ezra. When the gasman calls to read the meter, housewives and householders can feel a certain confidence by being able to look out of the window and see the British Gas van outside. That clearly identifies the fact that the meter reader really is from the gas company. Many consumer groups are worried that as the industry becomes more privatised meter readers may use normal cars. That will mean that householders do not feel the same confidence about opening their doors. We should consider seriously any ways in which we can make this easier for consumers. It is particularly important now that more and more people will receive their gas from private suppliers as well as from what we used to call the National Gas Board.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   The Committee may remember that last week in the unavoidable absence of the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, I assayed a small joke at my own expense about my employment prospects. It could well be that I become the gas meter reader for my block of flats. Who will monitor me? In defence of my noble friend Lord Ferrers, I would add that the Government have moved a long way on this matter in conditions 8 and 22 of the re-formulated draft supply licence which most of us did not have available last week, and which I hope most of us have available now and have read and considered. One of the things that the re-formulated draft licence envisages is that the consumer can select his or her own meter reader. It says also that there is a two-yearly must-read obligation. That is a new requirement, which is sensible and reasonable.
<P>


<a name="column_766"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 766</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50628-07_para0"></a>It occurs to me to ask my noble friend whether he could take the situation a little further and put the guts of the monitoring, which I see as the essential part of the amendment, into the licence rather than clutter the Bill with it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   Before the noble Lord sits down, I was interested in his proclamation that he might well become a gas meter reader for his block of flats. Will he give me an assurance that he will not propose himself in any such capacity for mine?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   The more blocks of flats the merrier.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   If the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, is to become a gas meter reader, he is likely to become redundant fairly soon because the technology exists, and has existed for some time, to read the meters down the telephone line. I am sure that many consumers will opt for that procedure. Perhaps the Minister will bear that in mind when responding to the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-07_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   I must respond to that. The noble Lord, Lord Haskel, is well aware that, although the technology has existed for a long time, the cost of changing 18 million meters means that I am likely to be employed as a gas meter inspector for many years to come.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-07_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Cochrane of Cults: </B>   I differ from the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, despite his great experience in the gas industry, in that his amendment and the speeches of Members of the Committee look back to the day of the smartly uniformed municipal employee who came round regularly, and one of whose abilities when he read the meter card was to be able to subtract upside down.
<P>

<a name="50628-07_para1"></a>I do not believe that the amendment is necessary. I first came across the suggestion in a consultation document regarding competition in gas supply. I wrote what I thought was some splendidly pithy remarks, and I was glad to see that that suggestion vanished from the Bill, or projected Bill as it was at that time.
<P>

<a name="50628-07_para2"></a>Gas meter reading, with or without the assistance of my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale, will become a localised operation. It may operate on a very local basis, around a housing estate, for instance. A married woman at home may want to do it. There is nothing to prevent gas suppliers from issuing their meter readers with an identity card, a jacket, or what have you. I do not believe that personation is a great risk, nor do I think that unlawful entry is a great risk, because meters will now be outside houses.
<P>

<a name="50628-07_para3"></a>On those grounds, I feel that the amendment is redundant. I am horrified, unless I have misunderstood it&#151;perhaps the noble Lord will tell me in a moment&#151;that it would appear to be an offence to read one's neighbours' meters for them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-07_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I think that I can say in all seriousness that I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, for putting down the amendment, because it raises an important point. I understand his concern in trying to ensure that people are not conned by those who purport to be meter readers, which is really the point of the amendment. I am bound to say that my imagination was jolted into <P>


<a name="column_767"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 767</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>overdrive at the thought of my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale becoming one such meter reader, but, one never knows, anything can happen!
<P>

<a name="50628-07_para4"></a>I recognise that protection of the consumer in respect of rights of entry is an important matter. Clause 1 widens the director's duties specifically to take that subject into account. The fight against crime means that we should take all steps to stop bogus callers. What the Government are not convinced of is the claim that the additional regulation, proposed by the noble Lord in the amendment, will help.
<P>

<a name="50628-07_para5"></a>Perhaps I may outline the protections which are already in the Bill and the licences. Schedule 2 gives statutory rights of entry to licensed suppliers, shippers and public gas transporters so that they can read the meter, and for other purposes. Those rights of entry are subject to certain restrictions in matters such as reasonable times and the production of evidence of authority, which are set out in the schedule. They are subject also to the provisions of the Rights of Entry (Gas and Electricity Boards) Act 1954. That provides that such rights may be used, except in an emergency, only with the consent of the occupier or under the authority of a magistrate's warrant.
<P>

<a name="50628-07_para6"></a>We have also put in place new provisions in standard conditions 24 and 25 of the draft suppliers' licence, which will extend the regulation of rights of entry to protect consumers. All licensees will have to make arrangements, which must be approved by the director, to ensure that officers are authorised to enter people's premises and are fit and proper, and that the public can readily identify them. That could mean that Ofgas, for instance, could require them to carry a badge or to be in the right uniform.
<P>

<a name="50628-07_para7"></a>All those protections apply also if any meter reading function is subcontracted out by the licensee. The licensee will be responsible for ensuring that any subcontractor he uses complies with the rules. The supplier will be accountable to the customer for the quality of the service provided. The identity to be shown is required by Schedule 2. Any confirmation by telephone is required by standard condition 25. Both requirements apply to the licensees' subcontractors as well as to the licensees themselves.
<P>

<a name="50628-07_para8"></a>It would dilute the accountability of the supplier to the customer, if the supplier could say that Ofgas had approved the subcontractor and that therefore he, the supplier, had no further responsibility. It is essential that the buck stops with the licensee; in other words, with the supplier. That was the view of my right honourable friend the Minister for Industry and Energy in another place, and it remains my view. We are in a time and an age where we have seen a number of duties which we have commonly believed to be carried out by others, subcontracted to different people. From my old incarnation in the Home Office, one knows that security firms now carry out functions previously carried out by the police. That of course is not the case with meter readers&#151;they are subcontractors.
<P>

<a name="50628-07_para9"></a>We come now to the problem of meter readers appointed by the customer. Those people have no rights of entry. They are the invitees of the customer in the same way as plumbers, carpet layers, cleaning ladies, and so forth. The state does not regulate whom a person should <P>


<a name="column_768"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 768</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be allowed to invite into his home in those fields, and we remain of the view that such regulation is not needed for gas. A meter reader appointed by a customer could be dismissed by the customer if the customer was not satisfied as to the quality of the service given by the meter reader. That is the customer's protection.
<P>

<a name="50628-07_para10"></a>The threat of bogus callers should not be addressed by additional bureaucracy for legitimate callers. It should be addressed by people being careful about whom they let into their homes, and insisting on seeing identification. There is an important issue here&#151;almost one of public education&#151;to which I hope the industry will contribute.
<P>

<a name="50628-07_para11"></a>It is true that a concern has been expressed about the quality of service that may be provided by meter readers. My right honourable friend in another place considered that point and gave a commitment in Committee. We have discussed it further with Ofgas. As a result we have added in the new draft licence a requirement to ensure that meter-reading officers possess the appropriate expertise for the specific tasks that they will perform, which I think immediately clears my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale out of the firing line. It could include such matters as ensuring their competence and training. We have also added detailed provisions in the licence which will require a supplier to ensure that the meter is properly read at least every two years, that it is appropriately checked for safety and fraud and that that information is reported promptly.
<P>

<a name="50628-07_para12"></a>By giving the director the power to approve the arrangements for these areas, we will, in effect, require suppliers either to conform with the so-called codes of practice which Ofgas has been developing with the industry or to demonstrate that they have met the requirements in another way. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, will consider that the arrangements which we have put in place, and which we have expanded since the Committee stage in another place, meet his concerns, which are properly held, and that the consumers are adequately protected.

<P>
<A NAME="50628-07_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   I am indebted to the Minister for the seriousness with which he took the amendment. Members of the public hold real anxieties about people entering their homes under false pretences. They have built up a feeling of trust for the meter readers employed by British Gas. If they were to transfer that to anyone who in future sought to enter their homes to read meters, some of whom might not be proper persons, a serious problem could be created.
<P>

<a name="50628-07_para13"></a>I wish to read most carefully what the Minister said and to study more deeply the conditions that have just been issued in order to see whether any gaps exist. The gap which worries me, and to which I may return later, relates to meter reading firms. We are talking not only about meter reading, which is where the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, will require more training, but about ensuring that the meters work, that they are safe and that they have not been fraudulently tampered with. That requires training and expertise. I am anxious about the setting up of meter reading firms which purport to have those skills, but which do not, in order to take advantage <P>

<A NAME="50628-08_spnew1"></A><B> 
Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall now repeat a Statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister on the European Council in Cannes. The Statement is as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<a name="50628-08_para2"></a>"With permission Madam Speaker, I shall make a Statement on the meeting of the European Council in Cannes, which I attended with my right honourable friends the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer and with my honourable friend the Minister of State for Europe.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para3"></a>"The Council rightly gave priority to the need to promote growth and employment. It called for flexible job markets and on rigorous budgetary policies to keep inflation and deficits down. These are the policies we have been advocating for years.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para4"></a>"We need to create a Europe of enterprise. Seventy per cent. of the jobs in the European Union are in small companies, and I welcomed the Council's focus on the need to free these businesses from red tape.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para5"></a>"We have promoted work in Europe on deregulation designed to stimulate employment and innovation, and the Council has now called for specific proposals from the Commission this year.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para6"></a>"At the Summit, the Heads of Government discussed a single currency. As I have made clear to the House, I believe that a single currency carries significant economic, political and constitutional implications. That is why at Maastricht I fought for our right to keep the pound.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para7"></a>"At the Summit, other Heads of Government showed a growing awareness of the difficulties of the plan for Economic and Monetary Union. It was agreed that there can be no question of any member states moving to Stage 3 in 1997. I am equally clear that there is not the remotest prospect of all 15 states meeting the convergence criteria by 1999, although it is probable that a small number will do so.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para8"></a>"At this Council, for the first time it was acknowledged that a move to a single currency by some member states and not others would have serious practical and economic consequences for the future operations of the Union. Finance Ministers have now been asked to look at this problem and report further.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para9"></a>"What would a move to a single currency mean for those who did not participate? Would those bound into monetary union benefit? Or would those remaining <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_770"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 770</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>outside the union gain advantage? What are the implications for the Single Market? What would be the impact on resource transfers? Many questions arise.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para10"></a>"I have long believed it is vitally necessary to examine these problems. It should lead to a much more realistic and informed debate.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para11"></a>"Any decision to move to a single currency will be the most far-reaching structural change for the whole Union: vital, of course, for those who participate in it. But it will be equally vital for those who do not. At the very least, it will change the Union profoundly&#151;perhaps in ways that are unexpected.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para12"></a>"I believe it is essential for this country to participate fully in that debate. Here, above all, we must make our practical views count and stand up for our interests in Europe.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para13"></a>"Yet our ability to influence the debate on a single currency now, when it matters, would be destroyed if we exercised our opt-out now. We would forfeit our influence over the most crucial current issue affecting Europe's future. That would not be in our interests. We should seek to influence the debate before we finally decide our position.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para14"></a>"Agreement was reached on Europol and the Customs Information System, which will reinforce the fight against cross-border crime and drug trafficking. Agreement on Europol had been held up because some member states insisted that the European Court of Justice must have jurisdiction.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para15"></a>"I would not agree to give the European Court of Justice a role in such a sensitive area involving our police and criminal intelligence activities. After a long debate, the question of possible ECJ involvement in the dispute settlement procedure for Europol was set to one side, while in the meantime the convention was agreed.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para16"></a>"The European Council will examine the dispute settlement procedure again in June 1996, but I have made emphatically clear that I do not anticipate we would take a different position then. The ECJ will not be the arbiter in any case relating to Europol which involves the UK Government or arises in the courts of the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para17"></a>"The UK has also led the fight to combat fraud in the Community. The last European Council at Essen agreed the plan of action which we proposed. The Cannes Council confirmed agreement on a regulation and convention providing tools for the task; and at Madrid in December we shall review the actions member states are taking to crack down on fraud.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para18"></a>"The European Council took stock of the early preparations for next year's Intergovernmental Conference. It agreed that the preparatory study group should consider how the European Union could better respond to its citizens' expectations. At the heart of this is the need for effective and rigorous application of subsidiarity.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para19"></a>"In 1990 the Commission proposed 185 pieces of primary legislation. In the first half of this year, it has proposed 11.

<P>

<a name="50628-08_para20"></a>"At Cannes, the Commission was instructed to complete its two-year review of subsidiarity applied to existing legislation in time for consideration at Madrid in December.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para21"></a>"The prospect of further enlargement was highlighted by the meeting yesterday between the 15 members of the Council and the Heads of Government of 11 prospective member states. They will benefit from the programmes agreed for help to central and eastern Europe and the Mediterranean.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para22"></a>"The Council decided that the next European Development Fund would provide 13.3 billion ecu, or about &#163;11 billion, to the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para23"></a>"The United Kingdom also provides high quality bilateral aid to many of these countries. I want to ensure that multilateral contributions do not swallow up our bilateral aid.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para24"></a>"Our contribution to the eighth European Development Fund&#151;worth 1.63 billion ecu, or about &#163;1.35 billion, over five years from the year 2000&#151;will be very substantial. But we are taking a smaller share than under the seventh European Development Fund, and as a result placing less pressure on our bilateral programme.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para25"></a>"On the former Yugoslavia, the new European Union mediator, Mr. Carl Bildt, reported on his first visit to the region. We asked him to concentrate urgently on ways of reopening talks with all the parties on the basis of the Contact Group plan, and to continue efforts to secure recognition of Bosnia by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para26"></a>"During the Council my right honourable friend and I met the Irish Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister for bilateral talks. We commissioned a joint report on how the paramilitaries could decommission weapons and explosives. The Taoiseach and I will discuss this report in due course.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para27"></a>"We can take considerable satisfaction in this summit. On economic issues, in the fight against cross-border crime, on Community fraud, in the emphasis on enlargement, in the sensible balance reached in the allocation of external funds, and in the support given to Mr. Bildt's diplomatic efforts over Bosnia, the Council has followed courses which we advocated. On other areas of vital national interest we have influenced the debate while retaining our own rights of decision.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para28"></a>"I would not pretend these results were invariably easy to secure. But, as this Council again showed, the debate within Europe has evolved significantly in our direction over recent years. I am confident we can carry this evolution a great deal further by robust advocacy, by patient negotiations, and by standing by our belief in a common-sense Europe.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para29"></a>"I have made clear that I believe that the way forward for Europe is as a Europe of nation states built upon co-operation. Key decisions affecting this nation must be taken in this House.

<P>

<a name="50628-08_para30"></a>"My guiding principle is to do what I believe is in our national interest: to argue for Britain's interests in Europe and to build a Europe which carries the trust of the British people. That I will continue to do.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para31"></a>"I should like to add one further point. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary has devoted 43 years to unbroken public service&#151;as a diplomat, a politician and a Minister. This was the 16th European Council he has attended as Foreign Secretary. His huge contribution to foreign policy co-ordination between European governments was recognised at the summit in a moving tribute by his colleagues. His contribution to our relations outside Europe has been equally important. At this summit, as throughout the past five-and-a-half years, his deep knowledge and calm authority have earned great credit for this country. My right honourable friend has justly earned respect on all sides of the House, and I believe that we owe him our thanks".
<P>
</UL>
<a name="50628-08_para32"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_time1"></a><H5>4.13 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Viscount the Leader of the House for repeating in this House the Statement made by his right honourable friend the Prime Minister in another place.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para33"></a>I should like to begin with the last point that he made. I too would like to pay some tribute to his right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary. He has been a distinguished public servant for years. He has represented this country in many fora. He has had to advocate many policies. I have always felt that he was rather more of a diplomat than a politician, which having regard to this Government's record is perhaps a not inconsiderable compliment from this side of the House. He has done his duty extremely well. We have not agreed with him on every occasion, but we respect him for his abilities.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para34"></a>What are we to make of this summit? Yet again I have a complaint to make at the outset. I beg noble Lords who are interested in these matters to read the presidency conclusions and not merely to read the gloss put upon them by one of the participants. That is especially important when that participant is a candidate for the leadership of his party and his Statement is perhaps more of a personal manifesto than an accurate reflection of what went on at the summit over the weekend. I shall quote two paragraphs from the conclusions in a moment to see whether the House agrees with me.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para35"></a>The summit itself was a rather inconsequential, not to say boring one. It resulted in a somewhat impenetrable and lengthy communiqu&#233;, a great deal of which deals with the relations between the European Union and the Mediterranean. Perhaps the most significant practical result was the agreement reached in the margins with the Irish Government over the decommissioning of IRA arms. For that we are extremely grateful.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para36"></a>I am interested to see that the Prime Minister has so far managed to avoid the fate suffered by his predecessor when she attended a summit in France. She lasted two days after her return; he has at least until next Tuesday.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para37"></a>The Prime Minister is fortunate in his colleagues in Europe. They showed forbearance and understanding. It is somewhat shaming that they felt that he needed it. For <P>


<a name="column_773"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 773</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Britain to be represented at a European summit by a Prime Minister who had voluntarily placed his position at risk and by a Foreign Secretary who had just resigned meant that our voice was hardly at its strongest and our contributions were hardly the most effective.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para38"></a>I want to put three specific questions to the noble Viscount the Leader of the House. First, will he confirm that after the reductions in our contribution to the EDF the contribution of Germany will be somewhere in the region of 3 billion ecu, that of France 3.12 billion ecu, of Italy 1.6 billion ecu and the United Kingdom 1.6 billion ecu? In other words, from being one of the major contributors, our contribution has fallen in comparison with that of Germany and France.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para39"></a>Secondly, in relation to the Rapid Reaction Force, for which the summit expressed support, I ask the Leader of the House what exactly its role will be. How is it envisaged that it will be used, against whom, for what purposes, in what circumstances and, most important, who will give it its orders? We have asked for answers to those questions before but we have not had them.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para40"></a>Thirdly, I wish to ask the noble Viscount the Leader of the House a specific question on the communiqu&#233;. I hope that he has a copy. Page 7 of the communiqu&#233;, subscribed to by the Prime Minister at the summit, reads thus:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The European Council [of which he is a member] restates its firm resolve to prepare the transition to the single currency by 1 January 1999 at the latest in strict accordance with the convergence criteria, timetable, protocols and procedures laid down in the Treaty".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para41"></a>Later, in another paragraph, which the Prime Minister accepted, it states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the European Council would like work on preparing for introduction of the single currency to continue unabated ... It requests the Council to define, in consultation with [the Commission and the European Monetary Institute] ... a reference scenario guaranteeing full compliance with the Treaty, this being a precondition for the irreversibility necessary at the start of the third stage, with a view to reporting back to the Madrid European Council".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para42"></a>Later it
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"calls on the Council to continue with all the necessary discussions and to report back to its Madrid meeting so that it can decide on a scenario for introducing the single currency".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para43"></a>Is it the policy of the Government, and is it the policy of Mr. Major as a candidate for the leadership of his party, that he has a firm resolve to prepare for transition to the single currency by 1st January 1999? We are entitled to ask that question. We are entitled to have a clear answer from the Government as to what their position is.
<P>

<a name="50628-08_para44"></a>Finally, I say this to the other side of the House. For Heaven's sake, get your election over quickly. The present state of limbo and transition is doing the country absolutely no good whatever. I speak as one who is as patriotic as any other Member of this House, but I have to say that the spectacle that we saw at the summit over the weekend was frankly demeaning for a power like Great Britain.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-09_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Seear: </B>   My Lords, I should like to thank the noble Viscount the Leader of the House for repeating the Statement. I should also like to follow the noble Lord, Lord Richard, in paying tribute to the Foreign Secretary for, as appears in the Statement, 43 years of devoted work in foreign affairs in one role or another. That role must have been quite extraordinarily difficult for him to carry out over recent years.
<P>


<a name="column_774"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 774</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50628-09_para0"></a>The Statement makes it clear that a great many of the questions which were discussed are matters of central importance to this country. There are European questions which cannot be solved on a purely national basis. For example, the question of Europol and of international crime is essentially a Union matter as well as a matter for individual countries. Therefore, one is a little surprised to find, especially in view of the debates in this House and of reports which have been placed before us, that the role of the European Court is so ruled out as having no part whatever to play in a matter which is surely so plainly international and, indeed, supranational in many ways. It is likely that, sooner or later, the European Court will have to play a role.
<P>

<a name="50628-09_para1"></a>However, when one looks at the other subjects which have been discussed, it is clear that they are all matters which are vital to the well-being of this country. Indeed, the Statement starts with reference to "growth and employment". If they are to be successful in this country, they must be seen at least on a European Union scale. They cannot be considered solely in national terms.
<P>

<a name="50628-09_para2"></a>Of course, the same applies to the question of the single currency. I hope that we shall have an explanation on the apparent divergence between the Statement here and the points read out by the noble Lord, Lord Richard, as to the position that we are taking over the single currency. I should have thought&#151;and we on these Benches have been quite clear in our support for the eventual establishment of a single currency&#151;that it was fairly obvious that some of the countries inside the Union will not be anything like ready for a single currency by the date which has been given. Therefore, one welcomes the suggestion that there should be a report from European Ministers on the matter. It is not a matter that could possibly be set aside. It is vital not only to European development; it is also vital for the development and well-being of this country as a country and as part of the European Union. Indeed, one could continue looking at all the points that have been made. The well-being of this country vitally depends on how such matters are handled at the European level.
<P>

<a name="50628-09_para3"></a>It was most fortunate that the Prime Minister was able to meet and talk with representatives of the Irish Republic. I do not think I need remind your Lordships that, although it is not a specifically European matter as such, it is a matter of the very greatest importance. The opportunity that was given to the Prime Minister to deal with the matter&#151;or, at least, to advance it to some extent&#151;is one which is most welcome. It is not for me from these Benches to pay tribute to the Prime Minister; indeed, that is not my role and I have no intention of doing so. However, if the Prime Minister was able to advance his remarkable successes so far with the Irish question by his attendance at the Cannes summit, that at least would be something that has been gained. It is surely a remarkable achievement to have got even as far as we have in the Northern Ireland situation.
<P>

<a name="50628-09_para4"></a>As I pointed out, I could continue to talk about all the matters decided and discussed at the summit. However, I shall not do so. They are matters of European Union <P>


<a name="column_775"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 775</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>importance; but they are also matters which are vital to the development of our country. That is why we on these Benches have always been such unqualified supporters of Britain's role inside the European Union, taking a vital part in the development of that Union.
<P>

<a name="50628-09_para5"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Richard, that it is shaming that our representatives had to attend the summit with English nationalists baying at their heels&#151;because that is what they are. If the Tory Party continues to support an English nationalist body, the sooner it falls the better.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-09_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, I thought that I would be able to smile sunnily on the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, until her peroration. However, I should like to thank both the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Richard, for the generosity of their tributes to my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary. With their permission, I should like to convey the burden of their remarks to my right honourable friend.
<P>

<a name="50628-09_para6"></a>If the noble Lord, Lord Richard, will allow me to say so, there were clear implications in what he said which, in view of the amount of time that I spent with my right honourable friend the Prime Minister in the past few days, I found a little distressing coming from the noble Lord's lips. He accused the document that I repeated to your Lordships this afternoon of being a personal manifesto from my right honourable friend and said that it was not an accurate reflection of what happened.
<P>

<a name="50628-09_para7"></a>My right honourable friend has been urged, as I think the noble Lord would expect him to be, to sink his rhetoric into one particular objective in the past few days; namely, to forget anything that might deflect him from winning the leadership election in this party. My right honourable friend has been absolutely adamant every minute of the day in saying from the very beginning of his trip to Cannes, and in his preparation for that trip, that his first priority was to defend what he saw to be the interests of this country.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-09_spnew2"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Hear, hear!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-09_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, I think it is fair to say that most of the results that my right honourable friend brought back amply demonstrate the extraordinary mastery of the issues which my right honourable friend has acquired over the past five-and-a-half years. Even if the noble Lord opposite cannot agree with that and he still feels that the summit was boring, I have to tell him that such matters which, as the noble Baroness emphasised, are extremely important&#151;and I agree with her in that respect&#151;tend to be extremely detailed and do not always make very good theatre. However, they matter. I am very proud that this country has a practical man to represent it at international gatherings.
<P>

<a name="50628-09_para8"></a>I was also extremely pleased and touched to hear the noble Baroness's tribute to my right honourable friend's achievements on Northern Ireland. I was also very pleased to hear the noble Lord, Lord Richard, allude to that fact. We do not know what the joint talks that have been agreed as to examining ways in which weapons could be decommissioned from the para-militaries will yield in the way of proposals. We must wish them well. <P>


<a name="column_776"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 776</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>As the noble Baroness emphasised, they are matters which are of supreme importance in view of the tragedy which has been continuing so long in the Province.
<P>

<a name="50628-09_para9"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Richard, asked me three specific questions. First, I can confirm that the noble Lord gave the correct figures for Germany, Italy and France and that the United Kingdom's overall aid to ACP countries has not changed. What we have done is to protect our highly cost-effective bilateral aid programme. I believe that the House will be well aware of the remarkable job that my noble friend Lady Chalker has done to intensify the effectiveness of our aid programme during her tenure of office. It would indeed be a shame if the main thrust of what we do in that very important sphere were in any way diverted and if the controls and the focus which my noble friend has enormously improved were in any way to be diluted. We will still be the third largest contributor in the European Union. We will have as a result the best targeted bilateral aid programme. The OECD report that was recently produced on this subject confirms that.
<P>

<a name="50628-09_para10"></a>Secondly, the noble Lord, Lord Richard, asked about the Rapid Reaction Force. He asked who will give it its orders. I rather hoped that I had made that clear when repeating a Statement in your Lordships' House not too long ago. It is clear that the Rapid Reaction Force is under United Nations command. I apologise to the noble Lord if he did not feel that my answer was clear, but I thought I made it clear what its purpose was. I know that the noble Lord understands very clearly the difference between peacekeeping and peacemaking, particularly in the context of what is happening in Bosnia.
<P>

<a name="50628-09_para11"></a>Thirdly, the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, and the noble Lord, Lord Richard, also quoted charmingly, if I may say so, from the lengthy document which was produced as a result of the summit. I wish to remind both the noble Baroness and the noble Lord that my right honourable friend has secured an opt-out from the single currency&#151;if and when it comes about&#151;whether partially or completely. I do not wish to repeat in any way the careful explanation that my right honourable friend gave this afternoon in another place, and which I have repeated here, on the reasoning for that. All I can do is to recommend to the noble Baroness and the noble Lord that they should reread&#151;I hope I do not sound too patronising&#151;what my right honourable friend said. The reasoning seems to me to be impeccable. As the noble Baroness said, we are talking about matters of supreme national importance. I cannot over emphasise how much I agree with her on that point. It is only sensible therefore that my right honourable friend should remember, as indeed he has done, that we believe in the supremacy of Parliament in this place and that it is for Parliament to decide these matters.
<P>

<a name="50628-09_para12"></a>Finally, I cannot resist coming back to the peroration of the noble Lord, Lord Richard. I could not agree with him more in one sense; that it is important to get this election over quickly. We shall do so. I can speak with some authority when I say that we have work to do but we will ensure that my right honourable friend not only wins but wins well. That will enable us to continue with renewed vigour to prepare ourselves for resisting the suggestions from the party opposite about what policies this country should follow on Europe in particular where as usual, like <P>

<A NAME="50628-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   My Lords, your Lordships' House is, I think, more than usually grateful to my noble friend the Lord Privy Seal for repeating the Statement and, if he will allow me to say so, for the excellent replies he has just given to the points that have been made by those opposite. I think the great advantage that we derive from the Statement is that it brings out clearly how very fortunate we are in our Prime Minister, and the hope that he will be able to continue to render these distinguished and able services without disturbance for many years to come.

<P>
<A NAME="50628-10_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to my noble friend for what he said and for his recognition of the selflessness with which my right honourable friend has ensured that his primary task at Cannes, as always, is to try to make sure that he represented what he saw as the real interests of our country.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Viscount clarify a point about the single currency issue? It was reported in the newspapers that the proposal President Chirac made of having a committee of wise men was rejected. Reference was made to the European Commission itself. There is a point that may be missed in this respect and that is the tie-in between the completion of the single market and the establishment of a single currency. Although people have linked the two they have not made quite sure that all the subsidies in various industries are uniformly eliminated across Europe. Until that happens any single currency experiment would pose dangers. Was that point pushed by any party at the summit?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-10_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, as usual the noble Lord, Lord Desai, always asks the most difficult and reasonable questions. I have to admit to the noble Lord that I was not at Cannes myself. I had one or two other things on my mind at the time. However, I have seen nothing in the papers that I have read or any account from any of the officials or Ministers who were there to show that the specific point was raised. However, we are well seized, as he is, of the validity of the point that he makes. If I may make a general point, it is clear that the benefits of a single market are considerable for this country, whether we have a single currency or not. The noble Lord with his academic qualifications, which sadly I lack, will be more aware than I that it is not only tariff barriers and fiscal barriers but non-tariff barriers, some of them of an extreme sophistication, which will inhibit the single market. My right honourable friend is heavily seized of the importance of this and the importance of reducing them. He will, I think, continue to do everything he can to meet the desires of the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-10_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, while agreeing entirely with what the noble Viscount the Lord Privy Seal said about the importance of the single market, and bearing in mind <P>


<a name="column_778"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 778</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the risks of a large export business with fluctuating exchange rates, does he think that any decision against a single currency could possibly constitute a threat to the survival of the single market?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-10_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   No, my Lords, I do not think it necessarily would. After all, the fastest area of growth or destination for exports of this country is outside the European Union. It is perfectly plain that the dramatic growth we are seeing, for instance, in the markets of south east Asia and the Far East, makes them extremely lucrative and successful destinations for British exports. There is no prospect whatever of our unifying the pound sterling with the yen or the renminbi. I would suggest that that will not inhibit the success of British exporters in the future any more than it has done in the past 12 months where our success has been dramatic and a direct consequence of the liberalisation and the supply side reforms that this Government have carried out over the past 16 years.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-10_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Waverley: </B>   My Lords, did France specifically make up a part of the UK shortfall in EDF contributions, thereby making future payments by the fund more in favour of Francophone countries? Does the noble Viscount the Lord Privy Seal agree that the United Kingdom's long-term interests, from support in the United Nations to other long-term issues, are being eroded by not supporting more fully ACP multilateral development issues?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-10_spnew6"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, it was not just France but also Germany and other countries. I should emphasise that the United Kingdom remains fully committed to ACP development and the overall value of our aid, bilateral and multilateral, remains the same.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-10_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Gridley: </B>   My Lords, in all humility I support my noble friend the Lord Privy Seal this evening in what he has said. I consider that there was much more that was of greater importance than just the question of how we might have governed during these past few months, or even years. There is a question of honour and of how this country behaves when under certain difficulties. That issue arises in this case. What has fortified me over the whole of my life has been the inspiration that I have gained from the way in which this country has behaved in difficult situations. I had to suffer in a gaol in Singapore in the last war. I could not envisage how on earth we were going to get out of the situation that we were in until I saw Louis Mountbatten standing outside the gaol in splendid naval uniform.
<P>

<a name="50628-10_para0"></a>This country has provided great inspiration to the whole of the world. Generally speaking, we are admired wherever we are spoken of.
<P>

<a name="50628-10_para1"></a>A matter of honour is involved. The Government have been in difficulties for some months, perhaps even years. However, it is more important that we govern in our own way in this country. Greater issues have been at stake. I thank my noble friend the Lord Privy Seal for the way in which he has brought the matter before us this evening.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-10_spnew8"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to my noble friend for his kind words. Perhaps I may crave the indulgence of the House for a moment to say this to him. It is entirely appropriate to hear from my noble friend <P>


<a name="column_779"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 779</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in view of the fact that today my right honourable friend launched&#151;before an unusually well-behaved press, if I may put it that way&#151;the programme of events for the VJ-Day commemorations, assisted by the chairman of Tribute and Promise, who is the immediate past chairman of the Royal British Legion, and the noble Viscount, Lord Slim. It is very clear that that programme will be a just recognition of the sufferings that people like my noble friend endured under the Japanese. It will be an opportunity for our country to express her thanks to those who fought and died throughout the Second World War.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-10_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Viscount the Lord Privy Seal aware that many noble Lords on this side of the Chamber will have taken great offence at his description in his closing remarks of my noble friend Lord Richard. When he accuses my noble friend of looking ridiculous, it seems to me that he should have been looking at his own party. Can nothing be more ridiculous than a leader of a party who resigns as leader of the party&#151;even though apparently he wishes to remain as leader of the party&#151;when he has no need to do so, and in advance of a vital and important conference? As a result of his actions, and of making himself look foolish, he has also made this country look foolish and sidelined at a vital conference which greatly affects this country.
<P>

<a name="50628-10_para2"></a>I hope that he will not repeat the accusation that this side of the House looks ridiculous when commenting on matters which concern noble Lords on this side, and the country.
<P>

<a name="50628-10_para3"></a>Having delivered myself of that, perhaps I may ask the noble Viscount about the single currency and reference to the Commission of discussion on that issue. Can we be assured that we shall have a better, much deeper result from the Commission than its previous document, which was very shallow? Can we also be assured that those who urged us into the ERM with such disastrous consequences will have nothing to do with any discussion of the future of this country regarding EMU and the single currency?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-10_spnew10"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, for giving me an opportunity to clear up any belief that he may have had that I made an ad hominem attack on the noble Lord, Lord Richard. I hope that the party opposite and the noble Lord will accept, if doing so does not get him into bad odour with his party, that I have absolutely no feeling that the noble Lord Lord Richard is anything other than totally "unridiculous".
<P>

<a name="50628-10_para4"></a>The burden of what I wished to convey was that the policies of the noble Lord's party are ridiculous. If I failed to convey that, I hope that the party opposite will forgive me.
<P>

<a name="50628-10_para5"></a>There is no question whatsoever, so far as I know, that my right honourable friend remains Prime Minister of this country. As such it is his clear task to carry out his duties as effectively as he can and it is perfectly clear that he has done so at Cannes.
<P>

<a name="50628-10_para6"></a>As regards the results of any investigation by the Commission, I think that the noble Lord, above all, will accept the belief of my right honourable friend that it is for Parliament to take a view of those results; and it is <P>


<a name="column_780"></a>

<A NAME="50628-10_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords in the Statement, my noble friend referred to Europol, and the decision that citizens and member states should be able to seek redress through the courts of member states for any wrong done to them through Europol rather than at the European Court. Can my noble friend tell the House whether the United Kingdom was alone in persuading the other member states that that should be so; or, as was reported in at least one newspaper, was there support from the Scandinavian countries and France? I was not able to give my noble friend notice of that question and he may not, therefore, be able to reply. However, the matter is important, in particular in view of the assumption made by the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, that it was bound to become a European issue.
<P>

<a name="50628-10_para7"></a>Europol comes under the third pillar of the Community, where inter-governmental arrangements are the order of the day and matters do not have to go through the European Commission. Therefore, whether there was support for the United Kingdom is important. I had hoped that the Statement would inform us, but it did not. I am sorry if I have caught out my noble friend.

<A NAME="50628-11_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, the House will judge whether or not my noble friend has caught me out.
<P>

<a name="50628-11_para0"></a>On the question of whether or not we were alone, it is perfectly plain that there is always a body of opinion which longs to accuse Her Majesty's Government of being in a minority of one on European issues. I can confirm to my noble friend that on this issue, as with others during the course of discussions at Cannes, we were not alone.
<P>

<a name="50628-11_para1"></a>I agree with my noble friend that Europol is important. The matter is extremely complex. However&#151;and I agree with my noble friend&#151;it is perfectly clear that it would not have been appropriate in the case of Europol for us to change the situation. Indeed, my noble friend is right. This touches on sensitive issues of national criminal law and police operations that are firmly under the third pillar, which is within the competence of individual members.

<P>
<A NAME="50628-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, it is doubtless admirable that the United Kingdom Government and the Government of the Republic of Ireland reached agreement in Cannes on the decommissioning of terrorist weapons in Northern Ireland. However, does the noble Viscount the Lord Privy Seal agree that inter-governmental agreements are all very well, but the only important thing is that the major terrorist organisations show themselves prepared and ready to decommission a substantial proportion of their weaponry? Of that there appears to be no sign whatever.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-11_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry if there is any misunderstanding&#151;clearly there is from the noble Lord&#151;about what my right honourable friend and Mr. Bruton agreed. The British Government have made their position perfectly clear over decommissioning of weapons. That position has remained entirely consistent ever since the present d&#233;marches opened.

<a name="50628-11_para2"></a>What was agreed at Cannes between my right honourable friend and the Irish Prime Minister was that officials from the two governments would meet to examine proposals for decommissioning weapons in Northern Ireland. Those proposals may be acceptable to both governments&#151;we do not know whether they will be&#151;when officials have reported to the governments. However, as the noble Lord said, that is only the beginning. What matters is that the proposals should be made to work and be consistent with the position of Her Majesty's Government, which we have already made clear.

<P>
<A NAME="50628-11_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, I hope that the noble and gallant Lord will in no way expect any answer other than "yes" to that question. We are a long way from the action suggested and circumstances would have to change. The nature of the orders, the rules of engagement, the colour that the vehicles are painted, the insignia, and many other matters with which the noble and gallant Lord is more familiar than I, would have to be addressed. The role is clear: deployment is taking place and I know that the noble and gallant Lord will be relieved to find that he and I are in no way apart on the issue.

<P>
<A NAME="50628-11_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Inglewood </B>   moved Amendment No. 72:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 21, line 30, after ("premises") insert (", or to any premises previously owned or occupied by him").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50628-11_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: I hope that I shall not be considered to be introducing too much bathos into proceedings if I ask the Committee to focus its mind on gas meters again. In moving Amendment No. 72, I wish also to speak to Amendments Nos. 76, 77 and 78. Amendments Nos. 72 and 77 provide that a supplier has the right to cut off a consumer for default on payments for gas at premises previously occupied by the consumer. Where consumers move around leaving debts unpaid, they should not be able to expect the same gas supplier to take them on without the debt being paid and without the ultimate sanction of disconnection remaining available. Where the customer changes premises and gas supplier, the rules for allowing disconnection in respect of assigned debt will apply as if the customer had changed supplier at existing premises.
<P>

<a name="50628-11_para5"></a>Amendments Nos. 76 and 78 are purely technical. A supplier has the right to cut off premises only where he is a relevant supplier. However, it is possible in a competitive market that a consumer may have more than one supplier in order to take advantage of the most competitive rates for supplying him at different times of the day or year. <P>


<a name="column_782"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 782</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>That may be unusual, but it is a possibility we need to provide for. In such cases, we do not consider a supplier's right to cut off should be restricted by the fact that there is another "relevant supplier" at the premises. Amendments Nos. 76 and 78 clarify the point. I beg to move.
<P>

<a name="50628-11_para6"></a>On Question, amendment agreed to.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-11_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness David </B>   moved Amendment No. 73:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 21, line 32, at end insert ("and fails to reach agreement with the supplier about arrangements to pay any arrears").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50628-11_para7"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 73 I wish also to speak to Amendments Nos. 74 and 75. I should like to say at the beginning that British Gas has maintained high standards of customer service and a safe and reliable gas supply and has ensured that older and disabled members of the community receive specialist advice and help in using gas appliances. The company has also developed a fair and reasonable code for dealing with customers who fall into debt. That is what the amendments are about.
<P>

<a name="50628-11_para8"></a>The rapid decline in the number of customers disconnected for reasons of debt clearly indicates that the range of payment arrangements and account management options available are sufficient to ensure that physical disconnection from the supply is no longer necessary. British Gas currently distinguishes between those who will not pay and those who cannot pay. This distinction also features in the draft standard licence condition 19 proposed by the DTI.
<P>

<a name="50628-11_para9"></a>In those circumstances, it is strange that the gas code should fail altogether to reflect the alternatives to disconnection. So the three amendments attempt to provide alternatives or safeguards. The first, Amendment No. 73, inserts at the end of sub-paragraph (1) (b) in paragraph 7:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"and fails to reach agreement with the supplier about arrangements to pay any arrears".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50628-11_para10"></a>In the same place, Amendment No. 74 adds:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the consumer refuses to accept a prepayment meter".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50628-11_para11"></a>The third amendment, Amendment No. 75, adds:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"This paragraph does not apply to consumers who are disabled or aged 60 years or over".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50628-11_para12"></a>All those I hope the Minister would be prepared to accept. The old are particularly vulnerable; they need protection from the cold. They are unable very often to move about quickly to get warm, and they are naturally anxious about having a continuing supply. No doubt the gas supplies the heating as well as the hot water. We need these precautions in the Bill to safeguard people and to keep up the good practice of British Gas. I hope very much that the Minister will look well on the amendments. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-11_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   I am a little surprised by Amendment No. 75 which excludes application of the paragraph not only to disabled people&#151;for which there is an argument&#151;but to everyone over 60. I am perhaps biased in not regarding 60 as an age of great debility and weakness. A large proportion of people in their 60s do full-time work and are well remunerated for it. Therefore, if it is desired to make special provision for the disabled, where there is an argument, I suggest that selecting also to be bracketed with them all those&#151;fit or not&#151;of 60 and over is a mistake. The amendment therefore goes too far in any event.

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-11_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   The general ground has been admirably covered by my noble friend. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, that there is an argument to be made about when we regard old age as beginning. The Bill recognised from the outset that 60 is the relevant age. I am over 60 and I do not feel all that much older than when I was considerably under 60, so I take the noble Lord's point. He is clearly older than me and shows no sign of going into decline.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-11_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   I am glad that the noble Lord does not feel that he is in need of particular care.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-11_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   The point I make is that the drafters clearly believe in all other parts of the Bill that 60 is the important age. Therefore, it is not for the likes of us to go against the Government on such a matter.
<P>

<a name="50628-11_para13"></a>I suppose that the argument for the age of 60 which is worth bearing in mind is that we are discussing the conditions under which someone may be cut off. I could put up some kind of case for arguing that someone over 60 who is behind with payments may have good reasons for it. It could hardly be fecklessness or something similar. I take the noble Lord's point that there could be an argument about the matter.
<P>

<a name="50628-11_para14"></a>On the question of the age, the Minister can perhaps comment. When it was discussed in another place, the Minister accepted the argument about the age of 60 possibly rising when the common retirement age becomes 65. On 16th May, in Standing Committee A in another place, the Minister said at col. 208 that in accepting the argument the Government would themselves introduce an appropriate amendment, so far as I understand it, at the Commons Report stage. My reading of the matter is that that simply has not happened; we have not had an amendment on the same topic in this House. I rise not to add anything to the arguments of my noble friend Lady David, but to ask what has happened to that ministerial commitment on the part of the Government to introduce an amendment. Is the noble Lord able to answer that question now? If he is unable to answer now, there are one or two caring amendments which will arise during the course of today when he may wish to take the opportunity to do so. The Minister in the other place used the words, "We shall introduce an amendment." So there can be no doubt about what was said.
<P>

<a name="50628-11_time1"></a><H5>5 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-11_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   I support the broad thrust of these amendments, so ably introduced by the noble Baroness, Lady David. The amendment that has been moved raises one of the important issues in the Bill. At Second Reading a number of us expressed concern that as a result of the changes in the Bill those who are disadvantaged&#151;I do not want to go into the argument about whether or not 60 year-olds can afford to pay&#151;should be treated at least as well, and as considerately, as they are under the British Gas regime. That is what the argument is all about. If we can be assured by the Government that it is their intention that that will be so and that there is adequate provision&#151;perhaps strengthened by accepting these amendments or in other ways&#151;a number of us would be satisfied.

<a name="50628-12_para0"></a>As matters stand a consumer can be cut off by refusing to accept a prepayment meter irrespective of whether he has refused to pay his bill. I do not think that that is the intention. I think that the word "and" is needed to link the proposed new sub-paragraph with the two that precede it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   I am most grateful for noble Lords' interventions on these amendments. I must say at the outset that I am sympathetic to the intention behind Amendments Nos. 73 and 74. As to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Airedale, about Amendment No. 74, I hasten to say that it is an amendment for which I am not responsible. I am sure that we, and those who are responsible for it, will look most closely at the point raised to see whether the wording poses the kind of difficulties that the noble Lord anticipates. I am reliably assured that he is very often right in these matters.
<P>

<a name="50628-12_para1"></a>The amendments are intended to ensure that before a customer is cut off for defaulting on payments, consideration should have been given by the supplier to reaching an agreement with the customer either to install a prepayment meter or to pay by instalments. These matters are already dealt with in draft standard condition 19 of suppliers' licences. This provides that a supplier indeed has to offer arrangements to a customer who is in genuine difficulty, including offering a prepayment meter or a payment plan which must in each case take into account the customer's circumstances. Condition 19 also reiterates that the supplier cannot cut off supplies unless he has complied with those arrangements. The concerns behind the amendments seem to us already to have been met.
<P>

<a name="50628-12_para2"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 75. We understand the concerns. We recognise the importance of protecting pensioners against being cut off in winter. The point was debated previously in Committee at some length. That is why standard condition 20 of the draft supply licence prohibits such disconnections in genuine cases. I hope that this will help to reassure the noble Lord, Lord Ezra. It is an advance on the present position whereby British Gas offers protection only on a voluntary basis.
<P>

<a name="50628-12_para3"></a>However, we believe that it would be wrong to extend this provision to year-round protection. Ultimately, gas has to be paid for. If we were to abolish the right to disconnect pensioners, we should find that we had abolished the ability of such people to receive gas on credit. Suppliers would insist on a prepayment meter unless the pensioners concerned had sufficient assets to make a court action worthwhile.
<P>

<a name="50628-12_para4"></a>I heard the remarks of my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter and the noble Lord, Lord Peston. Not being 60 yet, it makes me feel much more relaxed about that prospect as it comes daily closer. The noble Lord, Lord Peston, raised a point about pensionable age. I am sure the noble Lord is familiar with the definition of <P>


<a name="column_785"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 785</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>pensionable age contained in paragraph 49 of Schedule 3 on page 61 of the Bill. I hope that the definition in sub-paragraph (3) (2B) will help the noble Lord.
<P>

<a name="50628-12_para5"></a>We believe that it would not be appropriate to extend the winter disconnection protection to disabled people. Its purpose is to protect those who are at risk from cold. Many disabled people are young or middle-aged and are in good physical condition apart from their disability. I hope that this will provide reassurance for the Benches opposite and will explain some of our thinking on the matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I am not certain which page the noble Lord asked me to look at in relation to the schedule.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   I referred to page 61.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-12_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I shall look at that definition. However, the fact remains that the Minister made a remark in the other place, "We shall introduce an amendment", that can only be read as a definite commitment. I am merely asking a rather simple question: where is it? It cannot be an amendment if it is already in the Bill. I am referring to Standing Committee A.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-12_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   This is the Bill as it came to this House from the other place. It is possible that a change has been made since the Committee stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-12_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   My noble friend referred to pensionable age. But of course for men, 60 is not pensionable age; it is 65. Parliament has already passed legislation under which, over the years, the pensionable age for women is to move from 60 to 65. So, for men already, and for women in respect of what is already in legislation for the future, 60 would in any event be wrong.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-12_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   I am most grateful to my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter. If it would be helpful to the Committee, I will read out the relevant section of Schedule 3:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A person is of pensionable age for the purposes of this Part if (a) he has attained pensionable age (within the meaning given by the rules in paragraph 1 of Schedule 4 to the Pensions Act 1995; or (b) in the case of a man born before 6th April 1955, he is the same age as a woman who has attained pensionable age (within the meaning so given)".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50628-12_para6"></a>I believe that that covers the point my noble friend raises.
<P>

<a name="50628-12_para7"></a>To return to the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Peston, the Bill that we are discussing is of course the Bill as amended by a Commons Committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-12_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   Perhaps I may mention one other point that I did not intend to raise under these amendments, but later. The noble Lord used again the argument that he used last Thursday; namely, that there are protections in the draft standard conditions of gas suppliers' licences. He is right. At least, there is wording that corresponds. I meant to ask the noble Lord then, as I intended to ask him later today: is he able to make a statement about the statutory basis of the licence conditions? In what sense are they the same as if the material appeared in the Bill? Is it the same; or is there a difference? In other words, do the conditions in the licences have the strengths of statute in exactly the same way as if they were in the Bill? I meant to ask the Minister that in relation to other amendments. We can probably clear up many matters of this kind if he is able to make a definitive statement.

<P>
<A NAME="50628-12_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   Perhaps I may follow up that question. I gathered, certainly from the briefing that I received, that the licence conditions are not reflected in the gas code. I wonder if the Minister can comment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-12_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   Perhaps I may begin by replying to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Peston. The point about the conditions is that from the point of view of the person affected by them, they have the same standing as anything that is on the face of the Bill. They provide the consumer with exactly the same protection as though they were written on the face of the Bill. I should like to return to and confirm the point made by the noble Baroness.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-12_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   Is it not a fact that the licences can be altered by the director general or the Secretary of State without coming back for parliamentary scrutiny?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-12_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   The noble Lord is right about that. We shall be debating the point later this afternoon. The way in which the licences may be altered is such that they provide a considerable degree of parliamentary scrutiny of what is involved.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-12_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   I thank all those who have spoken about these amendments. Clearly the noble Lord, Lord Airedale, is right. Something needs to be done to Amendment No. 74 to get it to fit in with the Bill as it stands. There seems to be little doubt about some matters. I should like to reflect on them and on what the Minister and other Members of the Committee have said. There is still the question about age and the disabled. Although some disabled people can move around quite fast, many of them cannot do so. They can feel the cold very much indeed. I should like to think about the matter. For the time being, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="column_787"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 787</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>paragraph 8 of Schedule 2. That paragraph provides for there to be a "deemed contract" between a supplier and a customer, where the consumer takes gas without a contract being in place. That could happen, for example, where there is a change of occupant at premises and nobody informs the relevant supplier.
<P>

<a name="50628-13_para2"></a>Amendment No. 81B specifies that where someone takes gas and the premises in question are not supplied by any gas supplier, that person is deemed to have contracted with the "appropriate gas supplier". The new sub-paragraph (2) covers the cases covered by the original sub-paragraph, but it is in general terms and would deal, for example, with cases in which there had been theft of gas.
<P>

<a name="50628-13_para3"></a>Amendment No. 81B provides that the "appropriate supplier" for this purpose is the supplier who last supplied the premises; or, where that supplier's licence has been revoked or restricted at the licensee's request, is the successor supplier.
<P>

<a name="50628-13_para4"></a>Amendments Nos. 81A and 81B define the "relevant time" at which the deemed contract starts as that at which the supplier begins to supply gas to the consumer or the consumer begins to take gas.
<P>

<a name="50628-13_para5"></a>Amendment No. 81C provides that the supplier's deemed contract scheme may provide for the determination of the amount of gas to be treated as supplied in such cases before the meter is read. It is essential that if the amount of gas taken is unknown, there should be some means of estimating it for the purposes of a deemed contract. However, it is appropriate to afford customers protection and standard conditions 4(8) and 5(4) of the draft conditions of the supplier's licence restrict how such deeming may be undertaken. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   I should like to comment on the amendments in general. Some of them are technical and others are less technical. I have only just received today some Notes on Clauses. That may be my fault because I was away last week. I want the Minister to understand that we have had very little time to appreciate the technicalities and to obtain advice on them. In those circumstances, we reserve our right to come back on Report if we have any problems with them. It is quite possible that problems will not arise. I am sure that the noble Earl will recognise the problem. I just wanted to make the position quite clear at this stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-13_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I absolutely understand the noble Lord's point. I am conscious of the fact that he did not receive the details earlier than today, which I should have liked, had it been possible. I am sure he will realise that some amendments were necessarily tabled rather late and therefore we could not give the full account of these amendments until then. I understand that the noble Lord would like time to consider them and that is perfectly reasonable.

<P>

<a name="50628-13_para11"></a>Amendments Nos. 84 and 85 clarify that if a person unlawfully reconnects a supply of gas to premises that have been disconnected, the transporter or supplier, as appropriate, has the right again to disconnect them. That reflects a provision in Schedule 5 to the Gas Act 1986, which was not initially carried across to the new Bill. <P>


<a name="column_789"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 789</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Although the power to cut off again in the event of an unlawful reconnection is implicit in many cases, it may not be so in all cases and so explicit provision is required.
<P>

<a name="50628-13_para12"></a>Amendment No. 93 inserts a new paragraph in Schedule 2, which gives a transporter or a supplier a right of entry to consumers' premises to check whether a disconnected supply has been reconnected without the "relevant consent". The "relevant consent" is the consent of the transporter who disconnected the premises or of the supplier who cut off the premises or of a supplier who is or is about to become the relevant gas supplier for the premises.
<P>

<a name="50628-13_para13"></a>It is important that companies have the right to enter premises to check that the supply has not been illegally reconnected&#151;for example, where they have disconnected as a result of a theft of gas or non-payment. In the past, that has been done under the power to inspect gas fittings. But for the sake of clarity, we consider it appropriate to provide an explicit power in this case.

<a name="50628-14_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: These amendments were spoken to with Amendment No. 70. With the leave of the Committee I shall move them en bloc. I beg to move.

<a name="50628-14_para5"></a>On Question, amendments agreed to.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-14_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Haskel </B>   moved Amendment No. 90:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 26, line 39, after ("him") insert ("or another transporter").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50628-14_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 90, with the permission of the Committee I shall speak also to Amendment No. 91. Both amendments deal with notification of escapes of gas.
<P>

<a name="50628-14_para7"></a>Under the present proposals, if there is an escape of gas the transporter will only carry out simple repairs or make appliances safe by turning them off or disconnecting them. It is then the job of the gas supplier to come along and put the equipment into working order. The amendment seeks to allow the transporter to carry out repairs in cases of hardship, where there are elderly people, sick people, or people with children.
<P>

<a name="50628-14_para8"></a>If other transporters are in the market and the wrong transporter turns up to an emergency, as the Bill is presently drafted the wrong transporter cannot fix the leak and must wait until the correct transporter turns up and takes over. As most of these jobs require a lot of travelling time, it seems sensible to allow more complicated repairs to be carried out by the engineers on the spot, particularly in the case of people who are elderly, sick or who have children. It smacks of the old days of demarcation and, more importantly, it saves a second visit. People waste a great deal of time waiting at home for the gas engineer to come, and that too would be avoided. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-14_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   The amendment faces difficulties on the age question. In this case it refers to people of "pensionable age". Though the noble Lord did not mention it, that differs for men and women. For men it is 65 and for women it is still 60, though over the years it will slowly move to 65. If we are to legislate and give serious protection and privilege to people on the basis of age, I suggest that we do so at the same age for both men and women.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-14_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   We have had an interesting afternoon so far, or at least I have. We have established a clear split on the official Opposition Front Bench, at least as far as the payment of gas bills is concerned. My noble friend Lord Ferrers and the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, formed an interesting comity of view in deciding that I am untrainable, while so far being unable to agree on anything else. But the night is young and we shall see.
<P>

<a name="50628-14_para9"></a>In relation to Amendment No. 91, it is clear that the first person on the scene to halt a gas escape is the most important, for safety reasons. But let us assume that the gas escape is due to some malfunctioning of a gas cooker or boiler. In that case the transporter may not be properly trained to cope with the situation. He would certainly be trained to cut off the gas but in that situation it would be up to another person&#151;probably the supplier or someone contracted-out out by the supplier of gas&#151;to mend the fault. Though I see the need in those circumstances for that operation to be carried out as quickly as possible, the transporter is not necessarily the right person to do it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-14_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   I support the amendment because it ties in with a point I raised at Second Reading; namely, my understanding is that in the case of British Gas, when there is an escape of gas and the fault can relatively easily be put right, the person who deals with the escape also puts the matter right. If there is a possible long delay between cutting off the gas and getting hold of a supplier or a maintenance firm&#151;perhaps over a weekend&#151;hardship may be caused to the consumer.
<P>

<a name="50628-14_para10"></a>I should like to see the provision as an omnibus clause rather than just applying to disabled and elderly people. But if it is to be limited to disabled and elderly people, so be it. There is a strong case and once again we should have regard to what happens now. Is it a fact, as I believe it is, that British Gas can carry out these operations on the spot? If so, let us continue that service.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-14_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   Perhaps I may intervene for a moment to say, first, to the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, that there is a real split because I think he would make an excellent gas meter reader.
<P>

<a name="50628-14_para11"></a>The main point which troubles me&#151;perhaps the Minister can address himself to this question&#151;follows on from what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Ezra. We do not want there to be any disincentive for a consumer to report a possible leak or anything else which may give rise to an emergency. If the customer believes that if he rings the gas company someone will come and cut off the supply and say, "It is up to you" or "It will take time to sort this out", the customer may err on the side of risk.
<P>

<a name="50628-14_para12"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, said, it may be a Friday evening and the consumer does not want to spend the weekend without a cooker or central heating. Therefore he may well take the kind of risk that one does not want him to take. The noble Lord, Lord Ezra, is quite right and echoes what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter. It is nothing much to do with people who are elderly and disabled; it is a general question to which we must address ourselves.
<P>

<a name="50628-14_para13"></a>Speaking as someone who strongly supported the competition elements of this Bill, as the Minister is well aware, I believe it would be absurd to move into a state of affairs where, British Gas having set a high standard, the market led consumers to take risks simply because they could not afford to be without gas. Undoubtedly the Minister's advisers must have addressed themselves to this matter and perhaps he can share his thoughts on it with us.

<P>
<A NAME="50628-14_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   I am most grateful for the various remarks that noble Lords have made in this important area. I should like to deal with the two amendments together. I hope that by the time I reach the end of my remarks I will have covered all the points that have been raised.
<P>

<a name="50628-14_para14"></a>As we have explained on a whole variety of occasions, the Government give the highest priority to matters of safety. Therefore I welcome this debate as to the obligations on a public gas transporter to take steps to avert danger where he suspects an escape. Perhaps I may ask Members of the Committee, in response to the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Peston, to think back to <P>


<a name="column_793"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 793</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the debate we had on the previous Committee day about the emergency number, which was important in terms of clarifying what people do when they suspect there is a problem of this kind.
<P>

<a name="50628-14_para15"></a>In the context of Amendment No. 90, it is important, I think, to distinguish the obligation to make safe from the power to do so. Our position is that it is appropriate for the power to make safe, and the associated rights of entry, to be granted on a non-exclusive basis. That means that a public gas transporter is empowered to respond to any emergency involving his gas, or in his area, even if another transporter could also deal with the matter. It would be wrong if staff who were already on the site for some reason were unable to intervene. That touches on a point that was raised in our debate.
<P>

<a name="50628-14_para16"></a>Where we draw the line is in having overlapping obligations. It seems to us that this could lead to confusion as to who is responsible, or to several public gas transporters feeling obliged to dispatch teams to the same incident. It could well be the case that the valves on one transporter's system might be different from those on another transporter's system. It could be that the transporter whose system it was not and whose personnel were unfamiliar with it might feel in the circumstances that they had better keep off. I am advised that at the outset it is likely that most transporters will subcontract this function to British Gas and so it may well be that in reality it is not a problem.
<P>

<a name="50628-14_para17"></a>I shall now turn to the points made in respect of Amendment No. 91. Before going into the main body of my comments, perhaps I may allude to the remarks of my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter. We are providing a definition of "pensionable age" for the purposes of the Bill which is the same for men and women. The age will initially be 60. When the pension age for women is raised to 65 the Bill provides that "pensionable age" as defined will also rise to 65.
<P>

<a name="50628-14_para18"></a>We have a good deal of sympathy for the concerns behind Amendment No. 91. That is why, in standard condition 13 of the draft conditions for public gas transporters' licences, public gas transporters are required to undertake appropriate minor appliance repairs in the course of fixing a leak, so long as they can be done within half an hour and with inexpensive parts. This service must be provided free of charge to all customers, and will allow the majority of leaks to be effectively repaired on the spot at no charge. I hope that meets the point addressed by the noble Lord, Lord Ezra.
<P>

<a name="50628-14_para19"></a>To go further would increase costs significantly for public gas transporters, for very little benefit. There is a large difference between providing a service focused on fixing leaks and one focused on complex appliance repairs. My noble friend Lord Skelmersdale made the point that the skills are different and the equipment needed is different. He indicated the degree of expertise and skill he has in this regard, which must encourage him in his thoughts on these matters. The electronic controls on a gas boiler are something very different from what one might describe as the ordinary plumbing type gas activities involving turning off the supply if there is a serious leak. For public gas transporters to be obliged to <P>


<a name="column_794"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 794</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>provide a full appliance service capability would increase their costs and mean that people would end up paying more for gas.
<P>

<a name="50628-14_para20"></a>Beyond the quick fixes which can be readily done as part of an emergency service, the responsibility for arranging for appliance repairs must rest with the consumer. In such circumstances, it is right that the consumer, who is going to pay for the work, should have a choice as to who carries it out. The repair and installation of gas central heating and appliances is a competitive market and will not be the monopoly preserve of British Gas, or in the future, of any other public gas transporter. I hope that I have helped to explain the position and give reassurance.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   Will my noble friend explain a little more about pensionable age? As I understood him, there is somewhere a provision under which pensionable age will be defined as 60 although for half the population it is 65 anyhow and it will remain that for some years while the age gradually moves up under the legislation which we have already passed. It seems a somewhat misleading use of the expression "pensionable age" when at the start it applies to half the population who are not pensionable and then gradually increases to cover the whole lot.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   I do not know whether my noble friend heard me clearly when I mentioned this earlier. The place at which he ought to look is Schedule 3(3) (2B), where a definition of "pensionable age" is given for this part of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   My noble friend has been kind enough to refer me to the definition. But the definition is itself an inaccurate statement because that is not for half the population of pensionable age.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   As my noble friend knows a great deal better than I do, having so much more experience in these matters, one defines these matters, and if there is a difficulty one defines them by reference to a particular definition that is contained in the Bill. Here is the definition we have for this part of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-15_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Merlyn-Rees: </B>   Perhaps the Minister can help me on one point. I came into the Chamber to listen to this debate because for many decades as an inner city Member of Parliament I was brought into the problems that arose as a result of gas supply. Increasingly over the years those problems were dealt with very well by British Gas and any problems I had in my home were dealt with very well. Therefore, I was not surprised when the Minister said that under the new system it is very likely that much of the work would be contracted to British Gas. That answered 99 per cent. of my concerns about this.
<P>

<a name="50628-15_para0"></a>However, what will happen if by the nature of the area, or by the nature of the number of people who are chosen to take supplies from the new supplier, the work is not so subcontracted? I would be very content with British Gas looking after it. What safeguards are there that the new supplier will deal with it as well as British Gas has dealt with it?

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-15_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   The crucial point is that the procedures which are to be put in place in these circumstances are conditions of the licence. Transporters will not get the licence unless they meet the standard. I hope that I have answered the noble Lord's question.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-15_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   The finer points of difference between "obligation" and "power" would be lost on someone who was anxious to get his cooker or heater working, particularly if there were children in the house and there were people on the premises who could fix it or some advice could be obtained over the telephone as to how to fix it. To me it smacks of some of the old demarcation disputes which we used to have in the 1950s and 1960s. I understand that it is difficult for the Bill to place this obligation on the gas supplier but I feel that it is not a very satisfactory situation. We shall probably have to come back to this at Report. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="50628-15_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 92 concerns a drafting point. It simply secures that the wording of paragraph 20(1) of Schedule 2 conforms with the wording elsewhere in the schedule and the Bill, which refers to a transporter "conveying" gas and a supplier "supplying" gas. Paragraph 20(1) relates to a public gas transporter's rights of entry to a consumer's premises. It says that one purpose for which the transporter has such a right is to ascertain the quantity of gas supplied. For consistency of drafting, that should read, gas "conveyed to the premises".

<A NAME="50628-15_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Peston </B>   moved Amendment No. 94:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 29, line 25, leave out paragraph 25.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50628-15_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: I referred to paragraph 25 of this schedule rather flippantly in my Second Reading speech, but having referred to it, I felt that I had to go into the matter and seek expert legal advice. The paragraph is very strange. It replaces paragraph 19 of Schedule 5 to the Gas Act 1986, which I know is the regular reading of all Members of the Committee.
<P>

<a name="50628-15_para7"></a>There are two matters which interest me. One is that the wording has changed and I cannot find any rationale for that. Secondly, and much more seriously, having tried to get some legal advice, I do not understand what the paragraph is doing here anyway. I have asked lawyers&#151;we are here discussing distress and bankruptcy in England and Wales, but as Members of the Committee are aware, in Scotland one always refers to it as poinding and sequestration of the estate&#151;and their legal advice is that one cannot distrain on something that the bankrupt does not own. Therefore, I am advised that this paragraph either has some really deep meaning which escapes everyone, or it is completely irrelevant.
<P>

<a name="50628-15_para8"></a>The paragraph states that the gas meters or gas fittings which are owned by the public gas transporter or supplier cannot be subject to distress. My legal advice is that they cannot be subject to distress just as nothing else in the place which is not owned by the person in question can be. I simply raise the matter, having stumbled into this area hoping for an explanation on the finer points of the law. As Members of the Committee will know, I assume that since the Gas Act includes something similar there has to be something here. I shall not be surprised if there are early gas Acts which go back to the 19th century where all this started off. In my ignorant, humble and naive way of looking at it, the matter looks ridiculous. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-15_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   As the noble Lord, Lord Peston, points out, this paragraph is to do with bankruptcy and similar matters and, incidentally, landlord and tenant law. Paragraph 25 of the schedule, as has been explained, prevents meters, including meters owned by the consumer, from being seized by the bailiffs. That is necessary because if the meter is seized and taken away, the consumer, the gas supplier, or any other parties, will have no evidence of the quantity of gas consumed at the premises. If the meter is owned by the supplier or the public gas transporter, as the noble Lord intimated, he might have views on having his property removed.
<P>

<a name="50628-15_para9"></a>In reality, it may be that the risks of bailiffs and others carting off the gas meters are considered small, but in practice it would still be undesirable and we want to put it beyond peradventure. The provision which has existed in gas legislation for many years needs to be retained.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-15_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   The reality here is rather different from that theoretical explanation. If every bailiff worthy of his or her name recognises that a gas meter in these circumstances does not belong to the customer, he is not going to take it. But here we have something which is absolutely superfluous to requirements. If one has a bogus bailiff engaged in a distress process, it might be totally different. This provision is superfluous to requirements.

<P>
<A NAME="50628-15_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   I am about to demonstrate my "untrainability" as a lawyer. It seems to me that this paragraph covers only a gas meter which is actually marked or impressed. It is therefore clearly identified as being owned by a public gas transporter or supplier. But one assumes that there are other meters which are not so clearly marked and identified. In those cases it seems to me that this paragraph applies in a negative fashion and that the meter is deemed to be the property of the gas consumer and therefore could be subject to distraint.

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-15_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I do not want to delay the Committee. It is simply my desire to rid the law of ridiculous paragraphs. The fact remains that earlier today the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, announced that there was not a single meter owned, so far as he knows, by an ordinary householder. I asked him that question and he said that there are not any. Therefore, the problem does not arise in the first place.
<P>

<a name="50628-15_para10"></a>One has to ask what this is all about. I am certain that somewhere deep in Victorian history there must have been a point to all this. All that has happened is that the computer in the department which simply churns out these paragraphs feels that it might as well keep this matter going because no one has told it not to. In fact, this matter covers a case which is already met by the law of distress, bankruptcy and poinding. The fact is that the bailiff cannot distrain against something which the person does not own. That is the point I am trying to make and, so far as I can see, that it is the end of it.
<P>

<a name="50628-15_para11"></a>I accept the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, about "peradventure" and all that. The fact is that in my judgment the law should never be absurd. Here it looks as though we have an absurd carryover of something that made sense 100 years ago.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   The paragraph is absurd. It puts a case where it could not possibly be sound law that the apparatus should be taken away on distress when it does not belong to the person concerned. I agree entirely with what has been said by the noble Lord opposite. This is absolute nonsense.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-16_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   Since I sat down I have been reflecting on the matter. It occurs to me that in the case of a holiday home complex there would be sub-metering going on. In other words, the owner of the complex would pay the gas bill and the individual hirer of the accommodation for a week or a fortnight, or whatever it is, would pay the runner of the complex for the gas consumed during the period of occupation. In those circumstances, I believe most definitely that the sub-meters would belong to the owner or runner of the complex and not to the gas company.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Airedale: </B>   In view of what has been said, will the Minister take this matter back and have another look at it?

<P>
<A NAME="50628-16_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, is a trainee meter reader anyway and is not to be taken too seriously. If it is irrelevant, as has been suggested, will the noble Lord think about the matter again?

<a name="50628-16_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment was introduced in another place by my honourable friend the Member for Newham, South. I thought that we ought to go over the ground of this amendment again because it helps us to clarify what will happen in the new competitive market. I am delighted to move the amendment here because Newham, South is in East London which is where my own territorial title comes from and that, plus the fact that &#163;1 will buy me a cup of coffee in East London, leads me to have a sense of duty to that part of the world from which the gas industry hailed in the first place.
<P>

<a name="50628-16_para4"></a>The question of the supply of spare parts in a competitive market involves some interesting economics. When it had its monopoly, British Gas clearly ran a policy of making sure that it carried spare parts on a large but, one hopes, an optimal scale. On the whole, both when it was a nationalised industry and subsequently, that policy worked pretty well. Clearly, a sensible organisation will continuously scrutinise its policies on such things. It was a characteristic of British <P>


<a name="column_799"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 799</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>industry that it held far too much stock of spare parts and had far too much capital locked up in that. It is one of the benefits of industry being more concerned with efficiency that it now has a more efficient approach to the holding of stock.
<P>

<a name="50628-16_para5"></a>However, when we move away from a monopoly market to a competitive market, the question arises: will the suppliers take the provision of parts seriously? Will we not merely lose the great stock depots that British Gas used to have with not a lot replacing them? Nowadays, in the market-oriented economy, people tend to abide by the almost religious principle that "the market will provide". However, noble Lords must know that in all sorts of areas the market does not provide. Anybody whose computer is not working will discover enormous delays as they chase around trying to find the spare parts. Indeed, you are often told, "It's all obsolete now. What you really need is a new &#163;1,000 computer"&#151;as opposed to just a 5p spare part! That is the advice on spare parts in some areas of the market economy. However, one could argue that in most cases it does not matter. If my PC at home is not working, I am irritated but my life does not collapse. Failures of various other pieces of equipment similarly cause only irritation, but the issue is more important when it comes to gas because we are talking about what is usually a person's principal source of heat and cooking.
<P>

<a name="50628-16_para6"></a>The failure to provide spare parts or to take any responsibility for that can be disadvantageous to consumers. I thought that the Minister in another place took a rather frivolous view of the matter by more or less saying that he is confident that the market will provide. What I find so interesting about this is that as a result of this legislation we shall not have a "market" in the Adam Smith sense of that word; we shall have something which should be called "regulated" or "ordered competition". Therefore, I think that there are good grounds for the Secretary of State taking a direct interest. That is why I thought that I should air these thoughts to the Committee. We need to understand where we are going.
<P>

<a name="50628-16_para7"></a>I agree that the market will not fail us totally. Some suppliers will take seriously the question of providing supplies of spare parts. However, I believe that it has been necessary to place on the record my fears about this matter and my suggestion that there is a role here for the Secretary of State. I certainly think that the problem is serious enough for us to warrant a more logical and thought-out response than that given in the other place. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-16_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Peston, is a distinguished economist and is a great deal more experienced in these matters than I am; but I am a bit concerned lest his general grasp on the principles of economics may momentarily have let him down when he put his name to this amendment.
<P>

<a name="50628-16_para8"></a>The noble Lord is, I fear, confusing two different markets by suggesting that suppliers and shippers of gas should be obliged to enter the already competitive markets of appliance manufacture, spare parts and repairs. That is rather like saying a baker should be obliged to sell bread-knives or combine harvesters or <P>


<a name="column_800"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 800</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>even false teeth, or that a newsagent should sell spectacles. The trouble is that they might not be very good at it, and the practice could lead to inefficiency. If only opticians were allowed to sell newspapers, we would all have a longer walk to get a paper in the morning.
<P>

<a name="50628-16_para9"></a>The amendment could inadvertently damage competition for another reason. It creates a risk of unquantifiable costs which would be imposed on market entrants by administrative action. That is likely to deter market entrants, who may feel that the risks are lower elsewhere. This could simply put at risk the prize of self-sustaining and effective competition.
<P>

<a name="50628-16_para10"></a>Further, there has been a competitive market in the servicing and repair of gas appliances for years. I believe that that point meets many of the anxieties of the noble Lord, Lord Peston, who was concerned lest there would not be a proper market. However, we already have a market in that area. It is for the management of companies that are active in this sector to find the most efficient and effective manner to distribute parts to meet their customers' needs, and they have been doing just that. We do not see that there is any need for regulatory intervention.
<P>

<a name="50628-16_para11"></a>The noble Lord referred to great depots in connection with Newham. However, in the modern world, the business practice of having great depots has fallen out of custom because, increasingly, just-in-time deliveries are superseding that way of managing one's business.
<P>

<a name="50628-16_para12"></a>Finally, there is nothing to stop a gas supplier or shipper entering this market quite independently of other obligations if that is what they wish to do. I hope that that explains our thinking and that it will answer the noble Lord's worries.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I am indebted to the noble Lord. We could argue for quite some time about the optimum size of a storage depot for gas parts. I probably think that it should be larger than others think should be the case. However, what has also happened in the modern market economy is that the consumer has borne costs which were earlier borne by firms. Firms used to regard making parts available as one of their obligations, but they do not accept that obligation to the same degree as used to be the case.
<P>

<a name="50628-17_para0"></a>Before seeking leave to withdraw the amendment, perhaps I may ask the noble Lord about my original argument, which is that the practice to which I have referred is what British Gas used to do. British Gas used to make sure that spare parts are available. Does the noble Lord at least agree that that was the case and that British Gas took seriously the whole question of spare parts for appliances although it was principally a gas supplier? Was not that the case when it was a monopoly?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-17_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   The noble Lord has almost answered his own question. When British Gas was a monopoly, it had to take such matters seriously because there was no alternative. We believe that the privatisation of the industry and subsequently the introduction of competition is a better way of providing both an improved and a cheaper service for the customer.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   That is helpful, but as I have said many times if we are to have a private sector, I should prefer there to be competition rather than a monopoly. However, I recognise that when you abandon a monopoly, one or two things might be lost&#151;and this is one example. I am extremely interested in this experiment, but it might lead to a deterioration in service with regard to spare parts. The noble Lord says that he hopes that it will not; but I thought that someone should point out that some of the things that a monopoly does&#151;only some, because I am a great believer in getting rid of monopolies&#151;can be helpful to consumers.
<P>

<a name="50628-17_para1"></a>The point of the amendment is to try to keep an eye on that market&#151;perhaps the director will do this&#151;to ensure that consumers do not suffer and are not told, "I am sorry that you have no cooking facilities this week, but it is none of our business if the spare parts are not available. Why not buy a new cooker?" That is what happens with computers. Having said that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

</P>
<P>

<a name="50628-17_para4"></a>Schedule 3 [Other amendments of Part I of 1986 Act]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-17_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis </B>   moved Amendment No. 96A:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 30, line 35, after ("consumers") insert ("after consultation with the Council").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50628-17_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: Consultation is, in our view, something which, contrary perhaps to the Government's view, should be enshrined as a principle in an Act of Parliament, and, in particular, consultations in this context with the Gas Consumers Council, because that is the council referred to. It becomes especially clear when we recount just one instance, and that is the Railways Act 1993. There was supposed to be consultation, for example, over the Fort William line. That should have been the subject of consultation. It was not. That exemplifies the concern that many of us expressed when that Bill was going through the House: that specific consultation should be enshrined in that Act. It was not, and the Government let themselves down by not ensuring that consultation should take place. They are paying a price for that, as indeed are railway interests.
<P>

<a name="50628-17_para6"></a>It is not right that we should look merely to the courts to preserve an interest here by way of judicial review. It is something that can be inserted simply into the Bill, and that is the purpose of the amendment. The amendment, not unnaturally, is supported by the Gas Consumers Council. One has to ask why. It is supported by it because it is not confident that it will be consulted by Ofgas. Ofgas does not seem to regard the Gas Consumers Council as flavour of the month. It is unfortunate that that should be the case, because the Gas Consumers Council's role is self-evidently important so far as concerns the protection of consumers.
<P>

<a name="50628-17_para7"></a>Ofgas has certain other interests, but so long as there is that suspicion, the best way of ensuring that it disappears is to make provision in the Bill to that effect, and that is what we are seeking to do. It is right that we should insist that when the director considers it appropriate to assign a licence or modify the conditions, the circumstances in <P>


<a name="column_802"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 802</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which the director decides to do that should be expressed clearly. The Gas Consumers Council, not unnaturally, wants to have assurances that it will be consulted as part of the process leading to assignment.
<P>

<a name="50628-17_para8"></a>If there is concern as to why it is the Gas Consumers Council which is referred to in the provision, it is just that there is already effective liaison among the various other bodies, such as the National Consumer Council, the Consumers' Association, Age Concern, NACAB and the Gas Consumers Council. Under the umbrella of the Gas Consumers Council, that matter can be dealt with adequately. There should not be any problems in that regard. The responses given by the Minister of State in another place were ineffective and merely a device to avoid doing that which we and the Gas Consumers Council believe is absolutely essential. I hope the Minister will be rather more forthcoming in his reply today. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   I support the amendment so effectively moved by the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis. We are talking about protecting consumers' interests. The Gas Consumers Council exists. It is recognised as playing a major role in all these affairs. The amendment is appropriate and desirable. I hope that the Government will agree with it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-17_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I understand the concern felt by the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, about looking after consumers' needs and the need for consultation. We must guard also the words of his noble friend Lord Peston who said that we must be careful not to have unnecessary words in the statute.
<P>

<a name="50628-17_para9"></a>It is true that the provisions on the assignment of licences do not provide for a general statutory consultation which applies in respect of other licence modifications. That follows the precedent of the Railways Act 1993. It reflects two particular distinguishing features. The first is the limited scope that the director general has to impose conditions which must be incidental to, or consequential on, the assignment, or which relate to protecting the interests of consumers.
<P>

<a name="50628-17_para10"></a>The second feature is a more practical one. It is that there may well be a need to fit in with merger timescales, and a widespread formal statutory consultation could make that more difficult. I am bound to tell the Committee that our view is that no change to the legislation itself is needed. My right honourable friend the Minister for Industry and Energy said in Committee in another place that the director would obviously wish to consult as widely as is practicable in the circumstances. He also said that he would expect the director normally to consult the Gas Consumers Council as a matter of practice. That is rather different from saying that the director should have a statutory obligation to do so.
<P>

<a name="50628-17_para11"></a>The assignment of a licence would not normally be an opportunity to make other than technical changes to the conditions. Consultation with the Gas Consumers Council is something which should be welcome, if practicable, but it is not something which should be essential in all cases. We should be reluctant to place an absolute duty on the director to consult the Gas Consumers Council on every occasion. That is why I fear <P>


<a name="column_803"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 803</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that the addition of the words in the amendment would be an imposition, because in the majority of cases I should have thought that there is likely to be consultation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-17_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   I am disappointed by that reply, because I had expected much more from the Minister. It is unfortunate that he should have cited in support of his case the Railways Act 1993&#151;the very area where consultation has already fallen down, and fallen down in a demonstrably bad way because of the instance that I gave. So it strengthens our view that this is an area which should be covered by consultation. I fear that nothing the Minister has just said causes us to retract anything that we have already indicated. So I fear that on this issue we should take the opinion of the Committee.

<a name="50628-18_para5"></a>The purpose of Amendment No. 97 is to restrict the proliferation of new pipes where pipelines already exist and there is capacity within them for the conveyancing of gas to meet the needs of other gas suppliers and gas shippers. For existing or new capacity to be used only in part is wasteful, expensive and, to a considerable extent where the new works affect the environment and farming, it is disruptive.
<P>

<a name="50628-18_para6"></a>Each transporter does not need to have a complete system under his control. He should contribute as necessary to an integrated system for the shipping of gas and link up with other tranporters where necessary. The creation of a separate system will require investment, cause environmental harm and, through the duplication, conflict with the principles of sustainability, to which the Government subscribe.
<P>

<a name="50628-18_para7"></a>In another place, the Government stated that they were drafting regulations for an environmental impact assessment in such cases. Has that been done? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-18_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Haskel, said that he would speak to Amendments Nos. 97 and 110 but that he did not feel that he ought to speak to Amendment No. 111. He is very modest. I should have been entirely happy had he done so. However, as he did not do so I shall do so myself.
<P>

<a name="50628-18_para8"></a>The noble Lord said that the amendments were suggested by the Country Landowners' Association, which he thought might be of interest to some Members of the Committee on this side of the Chamber. Perhaps I should declare an interest, and also do so on behalf of my noble friend Lord Inglewood, as we both happen to be members of the Country Landowners' Association. <P>


<a name="column_806"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 806</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>However, as the noble Lord will see, that has not had too much influence on my views on the amendment, so I cannot be accused of being biased in favour of an association of which I happen to be a member.
<P>

<a name="50628-18_para9"></a>The duty on public gas transporters to develop and maintain an efficient and economical system for the conveyance of gas is carried forward (with consequential changes) from the 1986 Act. To specify certain ways in which that duty is to be performed could detract from, rather than improve, its effectiveness. We propose to enhance the duty for a public gas transporter to consult when he is proposing to construct a pipeline in another public gas transporter's authorised area. That is set out in Amendment No. 111. There are already regulatory powers to force interconnection between the pipelines of public gas transporters in certain specific cases. Those are in Section 21 of the 1986 Act.
<P>

<a name="50628-18_para10"></a>In addition, as my noble friend Lord Inglewood said on 22nd June, regulations are being brought forward which would require an environmental impact assessment to be carried out before pipes above a certain size can be built; and standard condition 6 of the public gas transporter licence puts in place procedures to deal with the routing of high pressure pipelines. The necessary steps in these important areas are therefore dealt with.
<P>

<a name="50628-18_para11"></a>Commercial pressures will in themselves ensure that pipelines will not be built unless there is a need for them. Laying a pipe is, after all, an expensive business, and a public gas transporter will not make money out of his pipe unless shippers and suppliers use it to get gas to customers. A public gas transporter will therefore have to ensure that there is a real need for a pipeline before he proceeds to lay one.
<P>

<a name="50628-18_para12"></a>In reviewing price controls, the Director General of Gas Supply may well take a dim view of pipelines built by public gas transporters but which were not properly utilised without a reasonable excuse. No further involvement by the director is called for.
<P>

<a name="50628-18_para13"></a>As for the proposal in Amendment No. 110 to insert a new Section 20, I should explain that Section 20 in the 1986 Act was designed to address the problem of a public gas supplier who sized his pipelines too small to carry gas for other people. Public gas transporters, who make their money from carrying gas for others, will never have an incentive to act in that way. That is why Section 20 serves no useful purpose in the new regime and is to be repealed.
<P>

<a name="50628-18_para14"></a>Amendment No. 111 has been drafted in response to concern expressed by some people hoping to become independent public gas transporters about the need for transporters to co-operate where pipes may be laid, for instance, in the same street. It will oblige a public gas transporter wishing to lay pipelines in the authorised area of another public gas transporter, to consult the incumbent about the precise location of the pipes.
<P>

<a name="50628-18_para15"></a>I believe that that is reasonable, and I hope that it meets the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Haskel. I hope that he will consider that that is the best way forward.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-18_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   I thank the Minister for that response. I was not sure from his response whether the regulations covering environmental impact assessment are or are not in place.

<P>

<P>

<a name="50628-18_para16"></a>I thank the Minister for pointing out that his Amendment No. 111 covers some of the points raised in my amendment. Bearing that in mind, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="50628-18_para17"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-18_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Ezra </B>   moved Amendment No. 97A:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 31, line 41, at end insert ("; and
<br>
(c) subject to paragraph (a) above and safety requirements, to minimise charges for connections to that system; and
<br>
(d) to provide on request to the Director and to the Council in pursuance of a representation under section 32 of this Act, a statement as to the costs to him to comply with any reasonable request in paragraph (b) above.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50628-18_para18"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 97A deals with the charges that can be made for gas connections. It would follow on from Section 9(1) (b) on page 31 of the Bill, which includes among the powers and duties of public gas transporters that, so far as it is economical to do so, they should comply with any reasonable request to connect their system to any premises. That does not go far enough because it is obviously necessary that such connections should be made at minimal cost. The amendment therefore makes that point.
<P>

<a name="50628-18_para19"></a>The gas transporter should not be in a position to charge prohibitively if, for whatever reason, he did not want to make a connection. That has been known to happen. We need an assurance that connections will be made at minimal cost and that the cost of such connections will be kept down as far as possible. Furthermore, it is desirable that the details of those costs should be made known to the regulator and to the Gas Consumers Council if required.
<P>

<a name="50628-18_para20"></a>I am sure that the Committee will agree that with a natural product as important as gas, which brings benefits to millions in this country, those who are unfortunate enough to live in areas not yet connected should be given every opportunity for connection and that they should not be inhibited from being connected by charges which could, in certain circumstances, be unjustified.
<P>

<a name="50628-18_para21"></a>Therefore, the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that there will be a duty to provide connections at minimal charges and that that would, if necessary, have to be demonstrated to the regulator and to the Gas Consumers Council. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-18_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   I rise to support the amendment ably moved by the noble Lord, Lord Ezra. We believe that it is conducive to the interests of consumers that the two elements that he seeks to introduce into the Bill should be properly regarded statutorily. In my judgment, the noble Lord is right to recognise that some consumers, particularly those living in remote areas where there may be no great attraction in installing gas supplies, may well be vulnerable to high charges. Consequently, a provision requiring minimal cost to be one of the considerations, and above all transparency, should be invoked and included in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50628-18_para22"></a>My landlord and tenant law is very rusty these days. But in the recesses of my mind, I believe that a landlord who imposes service charges in respect of services carried out on behalf of tenants is required to offer that degree of transparency we are now contemplating in relation to this <P>


<a name="column_808"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 808</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Bill. Certainly, so far as I can recall, a tenant is entitled to details of the service charges. I cannot recall whether that information should come from the landlord in the first instance or whether it is made available on request. However, the principle is clear. It should be clear here as well. This is a serious omission from the Bill. I hope that the Minister will say that there is absolutely no reason why the omission should not be rectified.

<P>
<A NAME="50628-18_spnew8"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, almost always asks for the impossible and I would love to grant him the impossible. However, when I explain the position to him, I believe that he will realise that my natural desire to assist him is there, even though I cannot actually accept the proposal of the noble Lord, Lord Ezra. I understand and share the desire that the costs of making connections to new customers should be as low as possible. I agree that the principles upon which the connection charges are made should be, as the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, said, clear and transparent. However, I believe that that is already provided for in the Bill, in the licences and, indeed, in the 1986 Act.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199495/ldhansrd/vo950628/text/50628-19.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-19_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   Where?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-19_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   As always, the noble Lord is a trifle impatient. Had the noble Lord contained himself for half a moment longer, I would have told him. The revised section of the 1986 Act, which is set out in paragraph 4 of Schedule 3 to the Bill, provides that the costs of making a connection to premises within 23 metres of a relevant main should be defrayed by the person requiring a connection. The phraseology "defraying of costs" means that the costs only can be defrayed. It does not allow for a profit margin by the public gas transporter.
<P>

<a name="50628-19_para0"></a>That obligation on the consumer to pay the costs of the pipe is further qualified by draft standard condition 4 of the public gas transporter's licence, which provides for the first 30 feet of pipe in the highway to be free of charge. That reflects the position in existing legislation but under the Bill we propose that it should be in the licence because it may not be appropriate in every case.
<P>

<a name="50628-19_para1"></a>Beyond the statutory connection regime the transporter is still obliged to comply with any reasonable and economic requirement for a connection, although in this case a reasonable profit margin may be charged. However, the customer still has the option of making his own connection, and that option will itself put a downward pressure on what the transporter might charge.
<P>

<a name="50628-19_para2"></a>In any event it is proposed that connection charges should be subject to regulation although certain exceptions may be approved by the director for new villages. Standard condition 4 of the draft transporter's licence provides that the transporter must prepare and publish a statement of the principles upon which charges will be made for making connections.
<P>

<a name="50628-19_para3"></a>As for a requirement to make estimates of costs in particular cases available to the director and the Gas Consumers Council, both the director and the council already have the power to require any information which they need to help them deal with complaints. That power is set out in conditions 11 and 12 of the public gas transporter licence.
<P>


<a name="column_809"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 809</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50628-19_para4"></a>I believe that the points I have made should satisfy the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, and the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, that the concerns they have&#151;and quite rightly&#151;are already met in the Bill and that therefore the prices charged will be kept within bounds, are subject to certain regulations and, indeed, are transparent.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   I thank the noble Earl for that detailed explanation. From the noble Earl's response, and after studying the part of the Bill to which he referred, it seems to me that anyone who wants a connection within 23 metres is thoroughly covered. In some other respects, I believe that the distance of 30 feet was mentioned. However, in those cases which exceed the minimal distance, it seems, as far as I understand it, to be up for grabs and that any charge can be made, any profit margin can be put in, and, if the potential consumer was not satisfied, then it would be up to him to make his own connection. Am I right in supposing that that is the situation and that, therefore, there is no transparency and no obligation to minimise cost over and above the 23 metres quoted in the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-19_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Ezra, is fairly near to being correct. However, I am not so sure that the inflexion that he put upon the position is quite right. The fact is that within 23 metres the costs of making a connection to a main can be defrayed by the person who requires the connection. The first 30 feet of a pipe in the highway must be free of charge.
<P>

<a name="50628-19_para5"></a>However, to take an absurd example, if the pipe were a quarter of a mile away, the individual concerned would get a quotation and if that quotation (which would, of course, include an element of profit) were too great or unreasonable, then he could obtain his own quotation from an independent supplier. He could run his own pipe down to the transporter's pipe and there would just be a connection charge. Therefore, the choice would be the consumer's; he could either use the services of the transporter or use the services of his own contractor.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-19_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   I thank the Minister for his further explanation. However, I find the situation slightly disconcerting. I believe that the intending consumer would find it very difficult to start looking around and obtaining tenders from companies that lay pipes and have such tender documents prepared. Indeed, he could be involved in considerable expense. It seems to me that it would be very much simpler if the minimal cost obligation and the transparency obligation mentioned in the amendments were to be accepted. That would set people's minds at rest rather than forcing them, if they felt that they were being charged unduly high prices, to set themselves up as a sort of commercial organisation and put out tenders to a number of pipe laying companies at considerable cost, difficulty and delay. I do not see why individual consumers&#151;I am not talking about firms or large enterprises&#151;should be put to that trouble through lack of the simple assurances that we have requested. Has the Minister any further comments to make?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-19_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I am not sure that I am able to comment very much more. In the normal course of events, there will be occasions when the transporter will be able to provide the pipe and make the appropriate charges which I have <P>


<a name="column_810"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 810</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>explained. However, if there are longer connections, they will be subject to the licence conditions and to the requirement to agree to any economic request. I do not believe that to be unreasonable. If longer lengths of pipe are required, it is possible for people to obtain other quotations. That is the point of having competition. As I said, I do not believe that that is unreasonable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-19_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   I find the Minister's response rather difficult to accept. However, I should like to consider the matter most carefully and return to it, if need be, on Report. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="50628-19_para6"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<a name="50628-19_para7"></a>[Amendment No. 98 not moved.]

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-19_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Haskel </B>   moved Amendment No. 99:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 32, line 4, at end insert:
<center><b>("Duties in respect of the disabled and pensioners.</B></center><br>
9A.&#151;(1) It shall be the duty of the transporter to provide special services to assist with safe use of gas appliances and fittings in the cases of consumers who are disabled or of pensionable age.
<br>
(2) It shall be the duty of the transporter to keep a register of consumers who are disabled or above pensionable age who may require assistance with the safe use of gas.
<br>
(3) It shall be the duty of the transporter, where a gas appliance has developed a fault that is known to be or could be life threatening, to mount a programme in conjunction with the manufacturer to inspect and rectify these appliances in all the consumers' property within their area."").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50628-19_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of the amendment is to try to keep some central control of safety services and apply continuity in order to look after those vulnerable customers who qualify for special services. As consumers will be able to purchase their gas from many different suppliers and change from time to time, the only way to ensure that there is an accurate register of customers who require such special services is for the transporter to keep the record and for him to supply those special services.
<P>

<a name="50628-19_para9"></a>When British Gas was an integrated company, it had the resources to trace all the rogue appliances of any particular type and make them safe or repair them. Neither the gas suppliers nor Corgi will have the ability to do that; only the transporter will have sufficient manpower and resources to undertake that task. It is important that that ability is maintained. The amendment would ensure that the task is carried out. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-19_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   This amendment, like the ones we discussed a little time ago, is based on the use of the test of pensionable age. Once again I must make clear the self-evident point that it is odd that there should be different ages for men and women&#151;65 for men, whereas on the other hand for a woman, for the time being, it is 60, although that will gradually disappear under the operation of the Pensions Bill which this Chamber carried a little time ago. I feel rather strongly that to use pensionable age as the criterion or test of whether help should be given is a mistake. It will produce anomalies of every sort and kind and I hope that it will not be persisted in.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-19_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   I am confused by this amendment for a rather different reason because in the Bill&#151;I do not have the references immediately to hand but I am sure that my noble friend Lord Ferrers will be able to help us with that&#151;the transporter is responsible <P>


<a name="column_811"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 811</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>for safety in the broadest sense and the supplier has to give free safety checks to disabled people and to pensioners. I do not quite see how they can do this without maintaining some sort of record. That said, the third subsection of the amendment is rather different. To me it is overburdensome&#151;I think that is probably the word&#151;because it suggests that if there is a fault identified anywhere in the country the transporter has,

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-20_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Cochrane of Cults: </B>   I rise to oppose the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, for the following reasons. Taking subsection (3) of the amendment first, what it is really suggesting is a very bureaucratic method of product recall. The Committee will remember that washing machines, irons, even cars of every sort, are occasionally subject to manufacturers' recall and there is a great deal of advertising in that regard. Regarding gas appliances, there is no reason to depart from that well-established and well-understood system. It may surprise a few Members of the Committee to learn that I am a pensioner. I note that subsection (2) of the amendment proposes that it is not the duty of the transporter to keep a register of consumers of pensionable age who require assistance, but rather of those who may require assistance. If I looked more doddery or were disconnected, would I get on to the list? I believe that the noble Lord, with the best of intentions, is proposing to set up a bureaucratic monster for which there is no present need.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-20_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   I find the reference to pensionable age extraordinary because there are people who need help due to some lack of tactile ability, perhaps not even to an extent where they consider themselves disabled. There are people who suffer from Alzheimer's who are way below pensionable age. To blanket all pensioners together is illogical and I do not think that part of the amendment is right.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-20_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter is nothing if not persistent as regards pensionable ages and he is supported by my noble friend behind me. From the point of view of the Bill, pensionable age is described in paragraph 49 to Schedule 3 and of course there is always the difficulty of trying to include someone in a particular group because as soon as one does that everyone says, "You ought to include or exclude someone else". For the purposes of the Bill, pensionable age is described as such. I quite agree with my noble friend that there are people who are not old but who may have other kinds of difficulties or indeed disabilities. However, they are dealt with separately.
<P>

<a name="50628-20_para0"></a>I agree with the thoughts behind the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, but I am bound to say that I have some difficulty with the means which are suggested as the amendment would cut across the proposals which we already have in place in regard to safety which is of enormous importance. Our proposals are to put the principal obligations in respect of assisting <P>


<a name="column_812"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 812</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>pensioners and disabled people on the suppliers. The draft standard conditions of gas suppliers' licences require suppliers to offer, on request and free of charge, services which include having a gas safety check once a year; providing special controls or adaptors for appliances and meters; and providing advice on the use of gas, gas appliances and other fittings. We take the view that it is for the gas supplier to carry out these duties. When they are exposed to competitive pressures, gas suppliers can be expected to seek better and more consumer-friendly ways to carry out these requirements in a way that a monopoly provider would have no incentive to do.
<P>

<a name="50628-20_para1"></a>There is a requirement&#151;this may surprise my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale&#151;in Condition 17 of a gas supplier's licence for suppliers to keep a list of domestic customers who are pensioners or who are disabled and who request to be identified as such. This requirement is placed on suppliers as they are to provide special services for those customers. However, there is also a requirement that the information on the list should be passed on to the relevant public gas transporter and this is in order that the transporter can undertake the requirement in his own licence to ensure that elderly and disabled customers are not deprived of adequate heating and cooking facilities where the conveyance of gas to those premises has been disconnected for safety reasons.
<P>

<a name="50628-20_para2"></a>The safety of gas appliances is already dealt with by a provision of the Consumer Protection Act 1987, the Gas Appliances (Safety) Regulations and by the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations. The manufacturers of gas appliances are already obliged to meet stringent conditions to ensure that these items are safe before they are sold. In practice, the present legislative and regulatory framework has proved effective in ensuring that manufacturers also respond quickly to the emergence of dangerous design faults in gas appliances. I think that the safety of these people and the concerns of the elderly and of the disabled are taken care of.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-20_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   I thank the Minister for that response. We are here concerned about those who require special services and that is not entirely limited to those who are of pensionable age or who are disabled. Special services can be relevant to people who have Alzheimer's at an earlier age. As regards the comment about product recall&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-20_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I would rather assume that if one has Alzheimer's one is disabled.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-20_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   I quite agree. As I said, on the question of product recall, one person's product recall is of course another person's preventive maintenance. It seems to me that there is a difference of principle here. We feel that it is the transporters who can provide these services because they are the only people who have the facilities to do so. The suppliers may wish to supply these services but they will not have the facilities and they will not have the ability to do it because they are naturally dealing with a much narrower area. As there is a difference of principle here I feel I ought to take the opinion of the Committee.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50628-21_para7"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment concerns the mechanism of imposing an obligation on suppliers to supply gas for those who wish to be supplied. I regret that I shall not be present to speak to Amendment No. 106. However, the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, will speak to it.
<P>

<a name="50628-21_para8"></a>The issue is, should the obligations to supply and in Amendment No. 106 to publish, be in the licence conditions which are subject to change by the director general, with the approval of the Secretary of State, or should they remain within the Act where they are subject to change only with the agreement of Parliament. The Minister of State, when explaining why the obligations should be in the licence and not in the Bill, frequently used the word "flexibility". In the case of the obligation to supply, the Minister said that the relevant provisions are all encompassed by the standard conditions in the licence. He went on to say, "We believe strongly that we need the flexibility that would be afforded by keeping them in the licence".
<P>

<a name="50628-21_para9"></a>I point out that the Gas Consumers Council asked me to table this amendment and the later amendments, Amendments Nos. 106 and 149. One is from the Gas Consumers Council and the other from the National Consumer Council. The single underlying object of the Bill is to benefit consumers by introducing competition into the provision of gas. There is general support for the legislation because of the likely benefits in price and standards of service. But the general good depends on the benefits being made available so far as possible to all users of gas. A consumer's opportunity to choose his supplier depends on there being an obligation on the part of that supplier to supply and on the public knowledge of the prices and other terms of supply on offer from each and every supplier in a given area. The prospect at any time in the future of the obligations being put aside is a charter for selective marketing of gas in which those less economically active or aware could be seriously disadvantaged.
<P>

<a name="50628-21_para10"></a>Flexibility at the discretion of the Secretary of State and the director general may be attractive to their organisations and may be attractive to some potential suppliers, but so far not one realistic example has been put forward as to why such flexibility might actually be needed. Indeed, one is concerned that the need for flexibility signals an intention to put the obligations aside.
<P>

<a name="50628-21_para11"></a>References have been made to the industrial market which is tiny by comparison with the 18 million domestic consumers. In the industrial market, consumers have welcomed the likely removal of British Gas's unilateral obligations to supply and to publish prices. But this is a sector inhabited by the professional buyer. Confusing it with the domestic market shows a misunderstanding of the gas market. The idea of 18 million consumers negotiating individually with one or more than one supplier is not realistic.
<P>


<a name="column_817"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50628-21_para12"></a>"Flexibility" may seem to be a good word, but we must be sure that it does not simply present the opportunity to remove two important obligations which are cornerstones of protection for the consumer. Such artificial flexibility is not in the interests of consumers and would be prevented by Amendments Nos. 100 and 106.
<P>

<a name="50628-21_para13"></a>More information has been made available in the licences. The first version of the licence defined the obligation to supply as to make it available. That has now been amended and the Gas Consumers Council is pleased that the amendment uses the wording,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to continue to supply gas".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50628-21_para14"></a>However, it believes that it would be better still if the licence repeated the words of the 1986 Gas Act,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to give and continue to give a supply of gas".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50628-21_para15"></a>The first version of the licence only requires the supplier to process an application without "undue preference". An application could therefore have been processed with undue discrimination. That again has been changed and suppliers must now process applications without undue preference or undue discrimination. The Gas Consumers Council feels that progress has been made in that respect. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   I support the amendment. In our Second Reading debate a number of us expressed anxiety about the relatively large amount that is written into licences and the relatively small amount that is written into the Bill. This is a good example of that situation. The obligation to supply must surely be fundamental in regard to such an important product as natural gas. People are entitled to have it supplied to them under fair and reasonable conditions. That should be written into the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50628-22_para0"></a>The argument that there should be flexibility as a result of retaining in the licence the obligation to supply creates misgivings to my mind, as it did to the noble Baroness's mind. Would it be the intention of the Government or the regulator in due course to remove the obligation from licences? That would be the only meaning of the word "flexibility". It is included now, but could it be out at some future date? If so, that is a serious possible development. We would need firm assurances, and I cannot understand the case for not putting an issue as fundamental as the obligation to supply on the face of the Bill. If, nevertheless, the Government insist on keeping it in the licence then they ought to define clearly to us what they mean by "flexibility". If they mean what we think they mean, then we are justified in having serious apprehensions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-22_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I find it difficult to deal with this. I understand the concern of my noble friend and the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, in which there is considerable merit. At the same time, in bringing forward the Bill we must look to the future and consider the possibilities. It would be quite easy to give a concession like this because I do not believe that there is anything between us, on our present view of the market, in recognising that the obligation to supply is important. We all agree with that. However, I must resist that temptation. Although it is difficult for us now to foresee circumstances when the obligation to supply might become obsolete, none of us can totally rule out the possibility that one day gas will become like food, capable of being left wholly to the market. One goes down <P>


<a name="column_818"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 818</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to the supermarket and food is important, but one chooses and buys where one wishes. It is not inconceivable that that could come in the future.
<P>

<a name="50628-22_para1"></a>However, our main concern is a much more practical one: whether we have got the form of the obligation to supply right. It is a dilemma. If we have too tight an obligation to supply, as the Consumers' Association said, it could become a barrier to entry into the market, denying the customer the benefits of vigorous competition. On the other hand, if we have too weak an obligation, it would be ineffective. The appropriate form of the obligation could change with time or conceivably from one type of supplier to another. For example, Standard Condition 7 contains an important provision that will tackle the situation where taking on new customers could prejudice a gas supplier's ability to continue supplying his existing customers. There is, I think, agreement that there must be a provision to deal with that. In a competitive market, not all suppliers can, for example, have enough gas available to supply all 18 million consumers. But this provision might well need adjustment in the light of experience in order to avoid the risk of harm to either existing or potential future customers.
<P>

<a name="50628-22_para2"></a>I am conscious of the concern that the obligation to supply might somehow be abolished without proper consultation or debate. That was the concern of the noble Lord, Lord Ezra. I do not believe that it is likely and we would not let it happen. The statute provides that no amendment can be made to licence conditions without a public consultation lasting for at least a month. Any variation in the standard conditions or any reference to the monopolies commission aimed at varying the standard conditions is subject to the veto of the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State should be accountable to Parliament for any use of that veto or failure to use the veto. It is inconceivable that the Secretary of State should allow the obligation to supply to be abolished behind Parliament's back.
<P>

<a name="50628-22_para3"></a>However, for those reasons I do not believe that we could take the risk of putting ourselves in what one might describe as a legislative straitjacket, possibly putting at risk the objective of a lively and effective competitive market. We must have flexibility, with safeguards, and that is what occurs in the Bill. I am happy to reiterate that the Government consider it important, at least in the early stages of the market, that there should be published prices. That is why price schedules are provided for in draft standard condition 3 of the supply licence. That is just as binding on the suppliers as if it were in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50628-22_para4"></a>There is, however, a real risk that publishing prices may not work to the benefit of consumers in the longer term. In the industrial market schedules are not considered to be beneficial by many customers, as they would like to negotiate with British Gas. That wish is now to be granted with the suspension of schedules coming into effect at the end of the week. The general point here is not necessarily that all domestic consumers will want to negotiate their own prices but that in mature markets formal price schedules can tend on occasion to inhibit rather than promote competition&#151;not least by the fact that they can encourage informal price matching.
<P>


<a name="column_819"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 819</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50628-22_para5"></a>It has been suggested that domestic consumers would be unlikely to have the time or the information to negotiate separate deals. There is no evidence for that. People may not have got used to it yet, and they may not have done it yet, but that does not mean to say that they will not want to do it in the future. People are, after all, quite used to negotiating when they buy second-hand cars or when they go to a market. Some people rather enjoy it. There is no reason why a consumer who may take, let us say, 2,000 therms of gas a year should be considered incapable of negotiating, when one who takes 3,000 therms a year is presumed to be capable. There could well come a time&#151;I do not say that that time has arrived&#151;when the requirement for price schedules should be removed, either for the whole domestic market or for part of it.
<P>

<a name="50628-22_para6"></a>It is possible that customers could benefit from different forms of marketing that did not include suppliers publishing and sticking to a list of prices. I give an example for the Committee to consider. Direct Line insurance has been very successful in giving customers individual price quotations by telephone. The important point is that we do not rule out those alternatives at this stage. At present they do not happen, but it is not impossible that in the future they might. We do not know how the market will develop. It would be much better to provide the flexibility for the future. I hope that the Committee will agree.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-22_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   The noble Earl's points are very important, as are all the points that he makes. However, we are primarily concerned with having an orderly transition from one sort of market to another. The developments to which he refers could, if they ever occurred, take many years to come about. In the meantime, what is needed for the 18 million consumers of gas is to be assured that certain fundamental safeguards will be preserved. One of those is the obligation to supply in areas in which suppliers have indicated their intent and for which they have licences. Another, to which we shall turn later, is the publication of prices so that consumers can see that they are being fairly treated&#151;just as one can make up one's mind, for example, in a petrol filling station where the prices are clearly shown, and a choice can be made between the different suppliers. It is essential that those fundamental safeguards should be in the Bill. No legislation lasts for ever. If some of the changes that the noble Earl envisages were to occur in the next decade, or in two or three decades, then at some future sitting of this House the provisions could be revised. I urge the Government to consider the need for a proper and effective transfer from one form of market to another, and for clear safeguards to be indicated on the face of the Bill.

<A NAME="50628-22_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, for his support. I am very interested in what my noble friend the Minister said. He seemed a little torn in that perhaps he does think that there is in part a case for the obligation for supply to be on the face of the Bill. Certainly, as to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, in the time that I have been in this House this is the second gas Bill that we have dealt with. <P>


<a name="column_820"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 820</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>If that requirement were to be put on the face of the Bill, and the day comes, as my noble friend described, when life has changed for everyone, there can be another Bill then. We spend our lives amending legislation relating to matters that have changed over a period of time.
<P>

<a name="50628-22_para7"></a>The point that my noble friend made about people becoming sophisticated is right. When I was on the board of a building society, it was quite remarkable how a 0.1 per cent. change in the interest rate meant millions or billions of pounds moving around in the financial world. That was quite unknown years ago. On the other hand, there are all those other people, those whom we want to protect, who write, saying, "My granny has had her account for 25 years and she has been left behind by all these changes." People have not kept up to date. As to the price strategy to which the Minister referred, people need information in order to be able to make comparisons. Even those sophisticates who, as he said, might get together in groups to organise their own gas supply will have to have a basis for comparison.
<P>

<a name="50628-22_para8"></a>The fact that the obligation to supply was a very important feature of the previous Act leads me to think that, given the noble Earl's remarks, he may be able to think of some form of words that he could bring forward which would still retain the obligation of supply and put in the protection, and even (to use that horrid word) the flexibility that he believes is essential. Therefore, in withdrawing the amendment, I ask my noble friend to see whether the Government can find a way to get round this. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="50628-22_para9"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

The Earl of Lindsay </B>   rose to move, That the draft regulations laid before the House on 19th June be approved [23rd Report from the Joint Committee].
<P>

<a name="50628-23_para8"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, these regulations contain three technical amendments to the non-domestic rating transition scheme which phases in the effects of the 1995 revaluation. There is also a minor change to correct an erroneous cross-reference in the principal regulations. These regulations were passed in another place earlier this afternoon.
<P>

<a name="50628-23_para9"></a>The transitional phasing scheme, which we debated in this House last December, operates by limiting year on year rate increases to 7&#189; per cent. in real terms for small properties&#151;those with a rateable value for 1st April 1995 of under &#163;15,000 in London or &#163;10,000 elsewhere&#151;and 10 per cent. for larger ones. For small mixed-use property, the limit is 5 per cent. For those who gained from the revaluation, rate reductions are also limited.
<P>

<a name="50628-23_para10"></a>Perhaps the most important amendment we wish to make concerns the rating of police property following the creation of the new police authorities on 1st April. In case law dating back to the last century, hereditaments which are provided or maintained for purposes connected with the administration of justice, police purposes or other Crown purposes are treated as Crown properties, and so are exempt from rates and other taxes unless the legislation includes express provision to the contrary. Section 64 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 included just such a provision to remove the Crown exemption from hereditaments provided or maintained by local authorities and the old police authorities for such purposes. However, this provision was not amended by the Police and Magistrates' Courts Act 1994 to reflect the creation of the new police authorities. As a result, police hereditaments became Crown exempt from rates from 1st April.
<P>

<a name="50628-23_para11"></a>Although rates are not payable on Crown property, voluntary contributions in lieu of rates are payable in certain cases. However, there would be a number of practical difficulties in setting up arrangements to collect contributions from police authorities even if they had the power to pay them, which is by no means clear. For that reason, we have decided to bring police authority property back into rating as soon as possible. We have the power to do this by overriding the Crown exemption by order under Section 64.
<P>

<a name="50628-23_para12"></a>However, there is a problem with bringing police property back into rating at this time. In our transitional scheme, property qualifies for phasing of its rate bill only <P>


<a name="column_822"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 822</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>if it was subject to rating on 31st March 1995 and has remained in rating since. That does not, as I have explained, apply to police property. However, we do not believe it would be fair to deny police authorities the benefits of phasing once their properties come back into rating: we want to put them on the same footing as other ratepayers. That is what the first amendment made by these regulations does. It has the effect that periods during which police hereditaments are subject to Crown exemption will be treated as though they were periods during which they were subject to rating. The amendment will also allow phasing to apply, from the date these regulations come into force, to any former police properties which may have been acquired by a non-police body since 1st April 1995.
<P>

<a name="50628-23_para13"></a>One effect of the Crown exemption from 1st April is that local authorities will not be able to collect all the rates that they expected to be able to pay into the non-domestic rating pool this year. My department has written to local authorities to remind them that they can re-calculate their contributions to the non-domestic rating pool if those losses are significant.
<P>

<a name="50628-23_para14"></a>The second amendment deals with the transitional phasing arrangement for certain properties which are shown in central rating lists. The central lists for England and Wales include those industries whose rateable values are set by the Secretary of State&#151;gas, electricity distribution, water and so on&#151;together with other extensive properties, such as the national telecommunications networks and long-distance pipelines. The main regulations governing the transitional arrangements were intended to apply phasing to those industries in a similar way as for other ratepayers. However, we have found that certain long-distance pipelines fall outside the arrangements because they have been switched into the central rating list from 1st April 1995, having previously been shown in local rating lists. That possibility was not envisaged when the regulations were drafted. As a result, the companies to whom the pipelines belong are being treated less favourably than other ratepayers.
<P>

<a name="50628-23_para15"></a>The amendment deals with the problem by changing the qualifying conditions for phasing. Hereditaments will now be able to qualify if they were shown for 31st March 1995 in either a central list or a local list. If they were shown in a local list for 31st March, their transition bill will be calculated by reference to the rateable value shown in the list for that day.
<P>

<a name="50628-23_para16"></a>The third change that we wish to make concerns the calculation of transitional bills for property which has been divided into two or more separate rating assessments, or where separate assessments have been merged into one, since 1st April. As currently worded, the rules require the phased bill in the year after the year in which the split or merger takes place to be calculated by reference to the amount payable on the day of the split or merger. But we now realise that this would give the wrong result if the newly created hereditament is eligible for certain rate reliefs on that day. These are taken into account later in the calculation and so would be double-counted. The amendment has the effect that reliefs are ignored when carrying out the calculation. No harm <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-23_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Graham of Edmonton: </B>   My Lords, we on these Benches certainly do not oppose the measure that is before us. There are only one or two points on which I should like clarification. Quite clearly, from what the Minister said, a great deal of thought has been given to this matter in some quarters. I had the impression from what the Minister said that the regulations were important to certain groups of people.
<P>

<a name="50628-23_para18"></a>As always in these matters, we hear the argument for the case in the abstract. Can the Minister give us some idea of the size of the problem? In other words, arising from these regulations, what amounts of money are concerned? What sum would now be paid which would not have been available if the measure had not been before us? Are we talking about large or small sums of money? Any moneys that will be put into or back into the coffers of local authorities to enable them to carry out their functions are welcomed from these Benches.
<P>

<a name="50628-23_para19"></a>Can the Minister say whether there is an esoteric element involved in the sense that someone in Marsham Street, civil servants or officers reviewing or revising the formula, have simply said, "Perhaps we have got it wrong"? Or was there pressure from either police authorities or local authorities? Was the matter raised as a burden? I should like to know whether there was a problem which has been examined and to which this measure is the solution. Or has there merely been a second look at the manner in which the Acts have applied and, on mature reflection, what we now have is the product of how things could be done better?
<P>

<a name="50628-23_para20"></a>I can well imagine that the Minister does not have to hand the precise answers to those questions. I should be happy to hear from him later. In the meantime, I recognise that I am dealing with the fine print of much greater issues. I am sure that the Minister feels that this measure is the better way.
<P>

<a name="50628-23_para21"></a>Perhaps the Minister can tell me whether these matters have been the subject of previous consultation. Were the local authorities consulted? Were the police authorities consulted? Were requests received from those bodies? Did they have no objection to the measure? If those bodies are consulted on proposals which they consider sensible and benign rather than malignant, I can well imagine that there would be no objection. The AMA body is meeting downstairs at this moment and there are many people in the building tonight who understand local government. On their behalf, I should like to make sure that they have been party, by consultation or agreement, to what the Minister has put before us. Otherwise, I am very happy indeed to see progress made.

<P>
<A NAME="50628-24_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the broad welcome that the noble Lord, Lord Graham, has given. The changes effected by these regulations were not brought about by pressure so much as by a realisation that <P>


<a name="column_824"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 824</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>technical drafting errors had crept in. Indeed, with such fairly complex rating regulations, it is not unusual for such errors to occur.
<P>

<a name="50628-24_para0"></a>On the subject of consultation, I can reassure the noble Lord that local authorities were consulted. There have been good consultations and communication with all involved.
<P>

<a name="50628-24_para1"></a>Obviously, the billing authorities have been losing some rateable values from those properties which had a brief exempt period. We estimate that there may be some 3,000 properties involved with rates of liability last year of around &#163;30 million. The loss of rates revenue up to the end of June is therefore estimated to be about &#163;7.5 million over 40 authorities.
<P>

<a name="50628-24_para2"></a>In the general scheme of things those are relatively small sums and the benefit that the regulation tonight brings is that we shall be saving any further losses in that matter. If we disaggregate down into individual properties and individual police authorities, we are talking of losses of a few thousand pounds and no more in most cases.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Graham of Edmonton: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister. The exchange has allowed me to see the size of the benefit. The Minister is quite right that when we are talking of tens of billions of pounds raised by rates and distributed, it is a minuscule amount. Nevertheless, as I understand it from the Minister, this was a mature reflection on the manner in which the original legislation had been drawn. It has been improved and is beneficial and therefore a great many people should be grateful, as I am, to the Minister and his colleagues.

<FONT SIZE=2>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50628-24_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment is about transparency and the need for consumers to be given the information that is necessary to enable them to make informed choices. In order to make those informed choices it is essential that there should be statutory protection to require each company's prices to be published. There was an obligation on the part of British Gas to do that under the 1986 Act and I can see no reason why that requirement should not be imposed on the companies that are involved in this market. After all, it seems self-evident almost that the ability to be able to compare services and prices that may be available to consumers when they are choosing a supplier is of paramount importance. Coupled with that there is not only the question of prices and services but a whole range of packages that are also in need of publication. I refer to gas fittings, supply incentives that might be available to customers if they adhere to their relationship with the gas company, and so on.
<P>

<a name="50628-24_para8"></a>Despite the arguments to the contrary adduced by the Minister in Committee in another place, we believe that there remains a clear need for this provision. We are not content that the matter should be left to the discretion of the director general, albeit that she would perform her duty together with the Secretary of State. After all, if that situation were to remain, it is not beyond the bounds of possibility&#151;even probability&#151;that the standard supply conditions could be altered. There would be no real parliamentary accountability. Although it is true that there would have to be consultation, as set out in the Bill, before a modification of the standard licence conditions, there is no guarantee that the results of the consultation would be other than a denial really of the complaints that might have been made on behalf of consumers. Consumers might be waylaid. There is no protection.
<P>

<a name="50628-24_para9"></a>Unless the Minister can come forward with some rather better arguments than those adduced by Mr. Eggar in another place, we shall not be convinced. Perhaps the Minister and his colleagues have had time to reflect on this point. The amendment seeks to arm the consumer, in the interests of the consumer, with the necessary information to enable him to make an informed choice. In a nutshell, that is what the amendment is all about. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-24_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   We are back on the fundamental issue, which has been raised many times during the consideration of this Bill, of safeguarding the interests of consumers. It is the opinion of noble Lords on this side of the Committee, and, I hope, a number on the other side, that this an issue of fundamental importance. There are certain safeguards which it is not sufficient to put in the licence and which should be in the Bill itself. The publication of prices and conditions of sale are among those safeguards.
<P>

<a name="50628-24_para10"></a>It is not satisfactory to say that at some future point in time the consumer would perhaps be able to shop around. Shopping around for gas supplies is totally different from shopping around from one supermarket and another. Until it can be proved beyond any shadow of doubt that the publication of prices and conditions of sale are not necessary to safeguard consumers, that should be done by obligations written into the Bill itself and not left to the licence. This is an issue of very great importance. It would <P>


<a name="column_826"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 826</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>demonstrate whether the Government are seriously interested in safeguarding the interests of consumers in this change in the market situation or whether that is purely incidental.
<P>

<a name="50628-24_para11"></a>We had the argument about whether the protection of the interests of consumers should be put among the prime responsibilities of the Secretary of State and director general. The Government argued against that. We divided, and we lost. It is still our opinion, however, that not sufficient emphasis has been given on the face of the Bill to the overriding consideration of safeguarding the interests of consumers. The publication of prices is paramount in that respect.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-24_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   Before the Minister replies, perhaps I may put myself in order. For the convenience of the Committee I note that we are debating not only Amendment No. 105A but also Amendments Nos. 106 and 149. I apologise.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-24_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   As noble Lords will remember, I was one of those who zeroed in on this problem at Second Reading. I asked where the liberalisation of the telecommunications market would be without the publication of prices. I am absolutely certain that that applies equally well to the liberalisation of the gas supply market and in exactly the same way. Since then I have been doing a little research. I have discovered&#151;the point has already been made&#151;that there is sufficient emphasis in the draft supply licence to make certain that this will happen in the way that I and other Members of the Committee would like it to happen and, I am sure, the Government would like it to happen too.
<P>

<a name="50628-24_para12"></a>I have heard the remarks, particularly of the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, and to some extent those of the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis. They feel that the licence can be varied in such a way that, because this matter is so important, it should be fully statutory and therefore written into the Bill. The safeguards on the changes of licences are perfectly adequate. I am very happy that they should continue to be in the licence.
<P>

<a name="50628-24_time0"></a><H5>8 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-24_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I know that the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, is very adept at these matters. I congratulate him for writing such an amendment for the Committee's consideration. My guess is that it might have emanated from the Gas Consumers Council. It is curious that, within two days of Ofgas setting 400,000 large and medium-sized customers free to negotiate prices with British Gas, the Gas Consumers Council, via the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, invites us to write into the Bill the requirement to price only according to schedules.
<P>

<a name="50628-24_para13"></a>I understand the concerns of the noble Lords, Lord Clinton-Davis and Lord Ezra. I am happy to reiterate that the Government consider that it is important, at least in the early stages of the market, that there should be published prices. That is why price schedules are provided for in draft standard condition 3 of the supply licence. That is just as binding on suppliers as if it were in the Bill. I made some remarks about that in relation to the amendment we were discussing before dinner, proposed by my noble friend Lady Gardner of Parkes.
<P>


<a name="column_827"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 827</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50628-24_para14"></a>But I believe that there is a real risk that publishing prices in the long term&#151;we are asking the Committee to look to the future and not only to the immediate stage&#151;could work against the consumers' benefit. In the same way in the industrial market, schedules are not considered to be beneficial. That could also apply to the domestic market. People may want to negotiate their own prices. That does not mean that they will do so immediately. We want to leave flexibility for that to happen. Obviously, not all domestic consumers will want to do that.
<P>

<a name="50628-24_para15"></a>Sometimes formal price schedules can operate to the disadvantage of the consumer. For example, if everyone knows a certain price level has been published, every competitor is almost certainly to be invited to go up to or very near that price. That means that that provision militates against the consumer. Some will say that consumers will not want to haggle, and that may be true. I do not believe that many will. However, it is not impossible and in future they may wish to do so. We ought to leave the arrangements as they are. Certainly in the immediate future prices will be published, but we want to leave the possibility open that when conditions change&#151;I am not suggesting that they are changing or that they are going to change, but they may&#151;it should be open to suppliers and consumers to make their own arrangements if that is in the interests of both.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-25_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   With great respect, that answer is founded on a great deal of conjecture. The consumer is entitled to something better. We are not talking about people going into a shop to buy a bag of sweets or even a consumer item which is rather more valuable. We are talking about something which will relate to them for a very long time. It will be a very important contractual operation in their lives. I respect the argument which the noble Earl has put forward, but I do not find the answer a compelling one.
<P>

<a name="50628-25_para0"></a>The Minister said that it may be important in the early stages for prices to be published. I do not know what he means by "early stages". How long will that last? The noble Earl is against publication in the long term, but what is the "long term" in this regard? No definition has been given at all. Probably the Minister does not know and I do not believe that the department has thought this out. We have a pig in a poke. I do not believe that it is in the consumers' interests to go down the route suggested by the Minister.
<P>

<a name="50628-25_para1"></a>He seemed to convey the view that publication of prices was important. I believe that he said that more than once. If that is right in the early stages&#151;and I ask him to be a little more precise about that&#151;why should it not remain important in the longer term?
<P>

<a name="50628-25_para2"></a>As regards flexibility, if there were some provision that this matter could be invoked by way of statutory instrument I would be reasonably happy. On behalf of this side of the Committee I want some form of parliamentary control and accountability. We do not want the regulator deciding these matters, perhaps in a capricious manner. I said before in an earlier debate that the relationship between the regulator and the Gas Consumers Council could be better. I do not know who is to blame for it and neither do I want to suggest an indictment here. The reality is that the relationship is not as good as it should be.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50628-25_para3"></a>Consequently, I return to the argument that what the Minister is suggesting is far from revealing the transparency that is required. I ask the Minister to reflect further on this matter. I do not believe that I can ask him to do more than that tonight. It is a perfectly reasonable request.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-25_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, has asked me to reflect on this and I shall do so. I ask him to reflect, possibly back 15 or 20 years. When one went to buy petrol it was at a constant price wherever one went. Eventually petrol companies were allowed to adopt a flexible market and to place prices where they wanted. I remember that time well. It seemed tremendously avant-garde and almost disreputable. The whole market would go to glory, but it did not. Now we are used to paying different prices at petrol stations and one tends to shop around.
<P>

<a name="50628-25_para4"></a>I am not saying that that is a direct comparison. However, at the moment I agree with the noble Lords, Lord Clinton-Davis and Lord Ezra, that there is a need for stability. People want to know where they are going. If it is said that, for the purposes of consumer benefit, "There shall be published a list of prices which will not be movable or negotiable", that is quite a static position.
<P>

<a name="50628-25_para5"></a>While in the near future, and as long as is necessary, these prices will be fixed, I do not believe that in the longer term that may necessarily hold. Just before the dinner break I gave the example of people who use 3,000 therms who are entitled to negotiate. What about someone who uses 2,000 therms? Why should not that person be allowed to negotiate? I ask the Committee to look at this issue not from the point of view of the immediate future&#151;because I agree with noble Lords that we now want to know what the prices are&#151;but we should look further ahead and allow for flexibility. That is all I am asking. I shall certainly consider the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, and indeed all that Members of the Committee have said.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-25_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   Over what period?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-25_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   Perhaps I may make it clear that I was asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, to speak on her behalf as regards Amendment No. 106, which is being taken at the same time. She cannot be here.
<P>

<a name="50628-25_para6"></a>Perhaps I may answer two of the points which the noble Earl has just made. As regards the petrol stations, I made a point in support of the opposite argument. I said that they publish their prices in the sense that they display them. We can then make a choice and drive around and select on the basis of the published prices. The petrol stations are now obliged by law to show the prices.
<P>

<a name="50628-25_para7"></a>To say that the price schedules will be immutable is totally wrong. Publication does not mean that they are published for ever and a day. In my time in the coal industry, I was used to the coal trade and all merchants published their prices. How could you deal with a merchant if you did not know his prices? Indeed, how could you use a supermarket unless it showed you its prices? I do not see why prices should be concealed from consumers. It is such an obvious matter for the requirement for transparency that I cannot understand why we are having this argument. It is so fundamental <P>


<a name="column_829"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 829</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that, in our opinion, this provision should certainly be in the Bill. Unless domestic consumers know what prices they are to be charged, how can they do business? It is different for ICI or a large industrial concern. They have purchasing departments and staff who can go out, look around and negotiate until the cows come home. That is what they have to do, but the ordinary domestic consumer needs to know prices. Suppliers have complete freedom to change their price schedules as often as they like so long as they publish them, just as a filling station can change its petrol prices as often as it likes. As long as people know what the prices are, they can make a choice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-25_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   I am obliged to the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, and to the Minister who has indicated that he is prepared to look again at this matter, without of course any commitment. That is fair enough. However, the argument about resale price maintenance is very different. As the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, said, there is nothing immutable about the situation. In relation to the example that he gave, there are frequent changes&#151;sometimes justified and sometimes not, but the fact is that there are frequent changes. In this instance, there is no reason why indicative prices could not be suggested. One could cite many examples of goods on the market to which that applies. It is not simply a question of petrol; there are many other instances. We are talking about a long-term transaction but, with respect, I think that the principle remains the same whether we are talking about the short or the long term. However, the Minister has clarified the position to some extent and is to reconsider the matter. In those circumstances, I am obliged to him and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="50628-27_para9"></a>If the Minister were to say that it is not in the interests of business to engage in sharp practice, I would say that the trouble is that there are too many instances of businesses succeeding while adopting plainly immoral standards.
<P>

<a name="50628-27_para10"></a>There are too many instances also of customers, after a sale has been promoted, being forgotten about or neglected. We believe therefore that it is right that that obligation should be assumed by the Gas Consumers Council. It would enable codes to be distributed relating to manufacturers and the supply of spare parts, which is an important issue, and to cover the other points that I have made. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-27_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   The question of industry codes of practice overseen by the Director-General of Fair Trading is an interesting one. To date, the gas appliance industry has not produced such a code of practice, perhaps because the nature of the market allows consumers to choose effectively and because of the large numbers of small firms in the repair sector. The decision is, however, one for the gas appliance industry, and we are happy to leave it to it.
<P>

<a name="50628-27_para11"></a>Where government do accept a role is in enforcing safety-related standards for installation, maintenance and repair of gas appliances. The Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1994 already require that only competent persons may do work on any gas fitting. That includes all service and repair work on gas appliances. The regulations further specify that all companies and self-employed persons doing work on gas fittings must be members of an approved class of persons. At present, that means that they must be members of CORGI. The performance of installers is routinely monitored to help ensure standards are maintained.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50628-27_para12"></a>In any event, we believe that the Gas Consumers Council has adequate powers under Section 33 of the Act to investigate any matter relating to the gas appliances and their servicing and that a specific duty in that area is unnecessary. It would be wrong for the council to be required to give priority to codes of practice over other matters which it is empowered to consider.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-27_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   I do not understand that brief at all. It is as though somehow or other this kind of thing does not happen. We know, as a matter of practice, that codes of practice are imposed on all sorts of goods. We know, for example, when it comes to double glazing, holidays, vehicle repairs and so forth, provisions are made for trade associations to impose a code of discipline on those who fall short of the requirements of the code of practice.
<P>

<a name="50628-27_para13"></a>The purpose of the requirement is not to be bureaucratic; it is to ensure that there is available a constantly enhanced standard. Again, it is a question of customers having the right to know what is going on and to feel that someone is there to protect them in relation to these issues. Perhaps the Minister will deal with that point rather more clearly than I think he did. It might be my fault. It is getting late. One is getting tired. One had to cancel one's so-called dinner to be back in time. All those things have an effect on one's mental capacity. I do not believe that those points were met sufficiently by the Minister. Perhaps he will help me on them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-27_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   As I hope I had made clear in my remarks, it is not as though this is a market where the cowboys operate indiscriminately. I explained that the Government accept a role in enforcing safety-related standards for installation, maintenance and repair of gas appliances. As we have always said, safety is the paramount consideration when looking at these matters.
<P>

<a name="50628-27_para14"></a>So far as concerns the wider issues, this is currently an unregulated and competitive market. Levels of customer service are a matter for competition between companies. Retailers cannot hope to win business by treating customers badly, and dissatisfied customers can always turn to alternative suppliers.
<P>

<a name="50628-27_para15"></a>The noble Lord referred to codes of practice which have been imposed in other sectors of the economy. Just because they apply in one sector it does not follow automatically that it is the right thing to do in a different sector. Of course it is always open to the director-general to recommend to the relevant trade association that some form of voluntary code of conduct would be appropriate. We believe that is the appropriate situation for the industry to be in.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-27_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   I find that argument less than convincing. The Minister says that it is not a market in which the cowboys will operate indiscriminately. How does he know? The market is, in many respects, a new market. Opportunities will exist which are different from those existing today. How does he know? Because the situation is unknown at present, the consumer is entitled to know why the burden which, as I understand it, the Gas Consumers Council is happy to pick up&#151;I hope that I am not wrong about that; I believe it to be the case&#151;should not be imposed upon it.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50628-27_para16"></a>The Minister says that this situation is different from all the other instances I cited. Why? He did not explain that. He just asserted it. One is concerned to ensure that the consumer should have the information that he requires so as to have the security in his mind that his interests are being looked after, and that if a supplier departs from the standards expected of him, that will, if necessary, be looked after appropriately by disciplinary procedures, by the trade association or, in this instance, the Gas Consumers Council.
<P>

<a name="50628-27_para17"></a>It is absurd to say that one can just leave things to the market in the absolute knowledge that everything will go well because it is in the supplier's interests to play according to the rules. That is to defy what happens in the real world.
<P>

<a name="50628-27_para18"></a>Many people apply high standards and obtain advantages from doing so. But surely the Minister knows from his own experience that that is not always the case. When we are dealing with issues of such importance to consumers, surely he will reflect on the matter again. I invite him to do what the noble Earl did on a previous occasion. This is another issue that affects the interests of consumers and I ask him to reflect further upon it.

<A NAME="50628-28_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, for expanding his comments. I wish to take up only two points. I found a certain degree of contradiction in his comments about this being a new market. I recall that before the dinner break the noble Lord, Lord Peston, referred to a depot not far from where he comes from that carries spare parts for the very market that we are describing. There appears to be an internal contradiction in their comments.
<P>

<a name="50628-28_para0"></a>Of course, we will reflect on what has been said. Indeed, we always reflect on the comments that are made in the Chamber. We will consider the matter further but I can give no commitment that anything will follow from that.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50628-28_para2"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 141 I shall speak also to amendments Nos. 142 to 146A. The amendments in the group relate to energy efficiency and affordable warmth. There is a strong argument in favour of encouraging energy efficiency, affordable warmth and lower fuel bills, especially for the poorest and least energy efficient pensioner households. The argument is distinct from the environmental arguments relating to CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions and the Rio commitments.
<P>


<a name="column_837"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 837</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50628-28_para3"></a>There is enormous scope for this improvement. Poorer pensioner households cannot fund the energy efficiency improvements which achieve affordable warmth and lower fuel bills. The 1994 Budget contained a measure to provide basic insulation. That was estimated by the building research energy conservation support unit to save an average of only &#163;9 per year on the annual fuel bills of those households which improved under this scheme. That is not very much.
<P>

<a name="50628-28_para4"></a>The duty to promote efficiency and economy on the part of the licence holders refers to the efficient use of gas conveyed through pipes. Does that mean that the duty to be efficient applies only to gas that is conveyed through pipes? What about energy efficiency in the home when the gas is being burnt in heaters and cookers?
<P>

<a name="50628-28_para5"></a>Obviously, it is being left to the market to deliver such energy efficiency improvements. But can the market be relied on to deliver them? We must remember that the competition is based on the price per unit and not on the total cost. I do not believe that that does very much to promote efficient use. Perhaps I may also remind the Minister that, in contrast to the director general of the gas company, the director general of electricity supply has fixed targets for reductions in consumption. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-28_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Haskel, has raised an important issue and I support the thrust of the amendments. We are talking about promoting energy efficiency, in particular among those who cannot afford to spend the necessary money. The noble Lord referred to the extra sums made available for basic insulation. I am involved in the organisation Neighbourhood Energy Action which handles those sums. Indeed, the homes of almost 2 million people on low incomes have been insulated.
<P>

<a name="50628-28_para6"></a>However, as the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, pointed out, they are basic forms of energy saving and much more could be done. The legislation provides us with a unique opportunity to ensure that such further action is taken. We have the framework by which that can be done. The director general is in a position to create the necessary conditions. We also have the Energy Savings Trust, which was intended to do much more than it is presently financed to do. The mechanisms, the need and the opportunity exist. We ask the Government to bring all those together and to do something that is highly desirable not only as regards helping people on low incomes and the elderly but also as regards saving energy.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-28_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Cochrane of Cults: </B>   I believe that this group of amendments is somewhat misguided. Amendment No. 146 refers to the means by which certain people can be helped to improve the efficiency with which gas is consumed. The difficulty is that gas is consumed at the moment it is burnt. What happens afterwards is different and has nothing to do with the consumption of gas. The noble Lord, Lord Haskel, referred to the necessity for insulation. To some extent, that is a red herring, although not a total red herring. If one wants to make a house warmer one must adopt a practical method of stopping the draughts. That will improve fuel efficiency. The whole tenor of the campaign to achieve that should first be dictated by the necessity to reduce the draughts in a house <P>


<a name="column_838"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 838</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>before one deals with anything more elaborate. It is an educational problem and to that extent I have sympathy with the noble Lord's amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-28_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Cochrane, with whom I almost always entirely agree, suggested that there are no ways in which one can improve the efficiency with which gas is burnt. But, of course, there are vast numbers of appliances and some are more efficient than others. There are many ways of burning gas with an efficiency that could rise to 70 per cent. or to 90 and 95 per cent. I believe that all those areas need investigating. Insulation is important but the way in which gas is consumed is equally important.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-28_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Cochrane of Cults: </B>   I willingly accept the noble Lord's gentle reprimand. Of course, he is right, but the majority of appliances have a fairly standard level of efficiency. I do not propose to pursue the matter further.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-28_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   I understand and very much support the need to promote cost effective energy efficiency. I suspect that few Members of the Committee would disagree with that general proposition. I must begin by explaining that in general terms I agree with the approach of my noble friend Lord Cochrane of Cults. The Bill will, I believe, do a great deal for energy efficiency by harnessing the forces of competition to work in favour of, rather than against, energy efficiency.
<P>

<a name="50628-28_para7"></a>A monopolist in an energy market will very rarely have any commercial benefit from energy efficiency; all he would be doing is shrinking the size of his market. In a competitive market, individual players can use energy efficiency to differentiate their product and win business, although the total size of the market may fall.
<P>

<a name="50628-28_para8"></a>I see energy efficiency playing a key role in two ways. First, suppliers will tend to compete in selling warm houses and not just gas. The Bill enables suppliers to bundle gas and, say, a high efficiency boiler on a long-term contract, which is protected from the normal termination provisions in the licence. Secondly, suppliers may offer home energy audits as a benefit for switching supplier. For example, "Come to us and we'll show you how to cut your bill by 10 per cent." might be the message.
<P>

<a name="50628-28_para9"></a>However, I do not believe that the amendments here proposed would be an effective way of building on these positive incentives. In fact, they could distort the market and perhaps work to undermine those very principles of the Bill which will, in the way I have described, work to harness the profit motive to the benefit of energy efficiency.
<P>

<a name="50628-28_para10"></a>I turn briefly to Amendments Nos. 141 and 142, which seek by regulatory means to secure energy efficiency by consumers. We have previously discussed the promotion as opposed to the achievement of energy efficiency. The director is not in a position&#151;I return to the points made by my noble friend Lord Cochrane&#151;to ensure that customers use energy efficiently. Nor is a gas supplier entitled to enter premises for the purpose of closing windows and turning down thermostats. The very idea seems comical. All that either of them can do is to make sure that the incentives and the means are in place to encourage consumers to use gas efficiently.
<P>


<a name="column_839"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 839</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50628-28_para11"></a>Turning to Amendments Nos. 144 and 146, the Government are well aware of the importance of gas to pensioners and disabled customers. That is why we propose in the standard conditions of licences to provide for special services to them. However, we need to ask whether the provision of help to such persons with energy efficiency is properly a matter for the economic regulation of the gas market or whether it is a job better discharged by groups such as Neighbourhood Energy Action, to which the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, referred. The Government have a very high view of that organisation, which is an example to other similar non-governmental organisations. It is through funding such groups and organisations like the Energy Savings Trust that real gains can be made. If we over-regulate so that pensioners and disabled people are unreasonably expensive to serve there is a risk that they will not benefit from competition as much as they should.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-28_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   I thank the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, for his support for the amendment and the Minister for his response. Obviously we all support energy efficiency, as the Minister said. Where we disagree is on whether the market will or will not deliver efficiency. If one is to have pricing and competition based on costs per therm or costs per unit rather than on the total cost, I cannot see how there is any incentive to gas suppliers to improve the efficiency of the use of gas. There may be home audits and other offers to persuade customers to change, but at the end of the day that will not provide more energy efficiency.
<P>

<a name="50628-28_para12"></a>This is an important matter. Obviously I shall not divide the Committee. However, we shall probably return to the matter at Report stage. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 55, line 42, at end insert:
<br>
("( ) After subsection (2) of that section there shall be inserted the following subsection&#151;
<br>
"(2A) When taking any decision or action in the exercise of the functions assigned to him by or under this Act, the Director shall specify to persons materially affected the reasons for that decision or action in sufficient detail to enable such persons to plan for the future with a reasonable degree of assurance; and this subsection shall be construed to cover decisions to take no action."").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50628-29_para2"></a>The noble Earl said: Throughout our discussion of the Bill it has been clear that the role and functions of the gas industry regulator are greatly increased. Moreover, the regulator is given wide discretion to decide a range of issues, in many cases with no need to consult Ministers <P>


<a name="column_840"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 840</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and with no requirement to give reasons for decisions, even to those directly affected. Some of those powers are no doubt necessary to provide the flexibility and timely decision-making required in a competitive market. For that reason they are supported. However, a balance needs to be struck. I put it to my noble friend that the Bill has not got it right yet.
<P>

<a name="50628-29_para3"></a>My amendment seeks to balance the increases in discretionary decision-making powers with a duty to give reasons in sufficient detail to enable persons materially affected to plan for the future with a degree of assurance. As well as providing a more open system it would also introduce an element of continuity and consistency in decision-making.
<P>

<a name="50628-29_para4"></a>Before looking at the effect of the amendment it is worth reminding ourselves of a few of the new powers being transferred to the regulator to demonstrate the need for some checks and balances. The responsibility for granting the licences passes to the regulator, together with a power to attach conditions to those licences. The regulator is also given powers to make regulations&#151;for example, statutory instruments&#151;subject only to negative resolution. The regulator is able to initiate prosecutions, a function previously reserved for the Secretary of State and the Director of Public Prosecutions. There is also a new power for the regulator not only to impose fines but also to decide their level.
<P>

<a name="50628-29_para5"></a>Those are a few but, I believe, sufficient examples to make the point that powers have been increased. My amendment seeks to make sure that they do not go completely unchecked. I am supported by the fact that the Government have recognised in the past that the uncertainty created by the regulatory regime could have a discouraging effect on those thinking of entering the new market. I do not believe that that is a situation that my noble friends on the Front Bench want. It is not what I want. Indeed, all the comments of my noble friend Lord Ferrers indicate that that is the case. My noble friend Lord Inglewood said a moment ago in connection with Amendment No. 141 that customers would not benefit from competition as much as they should. If we do not get competition into the market they will not receive the benefits that are available.
<P>

<a name="50628-29_para6"></a>I am encouraged by that well-known and well-respected Act, the Railways Act 1993. I remember it quite well. We saw a need there to make some provision in legislation. I draw my noble friend's attention to Section 4(1) (d) which requires the Secretary of State and the regulator to promote competition in the provision of railway services. That is exactly the same point as I am trying to make now. However, I do not find a similar subsection in this Bill.
<P>

<a name="50628-29_para7"></a>I believe that my amendment would reassure all players that regulatory decisions will not be arbitrary, will not be unreasonably inconsistent over time, and will ensure that explanations of decisions would be given. The wording of the amendment also recognises that consumers and their representatives, as well as industry participants, have a legitimate interest in reasonable transparency and consistency of regulatory decision-making.
<P>

<a name="50628-29_para8"></a>In passing, it would not be fair if I did not stress that the current regulator publishes a considerable amount of information. That is to be welcomed. However, it should <P>


<a name="column_841"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 841</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not be left to the personal discretion of the regulator. I recall that a previous regulator did not behave in such a way, and often delivered a fait accompli with little explanation. I believe that this piece of transparency will help to promote the market that my noble friends so much want to see. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-29_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   This is an extremely important amendment, and one which the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, has put clearly and cogently. I keep referring to what the Bill does as an experiment. It is an experiment in regulated competition. The new entrants, and for that matter British Gas in situ, are faced with big enough risks without also having to cope with regulatory risk. We have seen in other regulated industries that occasionally some regulators' decisions have appeared to be capricious and not to have been thought through. In my judgment on at least one occasion a regulator has managed to damage the firms, the consumer and the taxpayer. That is intolerable, even if we say that in regulation it is still early days.
<P>

<a name="50628-29_para9"></a>It seems to me that the new entrants to this market and British Gas will have enough problems without also having to invest in staff who will have to predict what the regulator is likely to do. I hope that the Government will accept the amendment. In all my years in this Chamber I have never been able to work out what determines whether or not an amendment is accepted. Certainly, its correctness seems to have no bearing. If the Government cannot accept the amendment I hope that at the very least the noble Earl will say that the matter is so important that he will come back with an amendment of his own which covers exactly the same ground.
<P>

<a name="50628-29_para10"></a>As someone who in many ways now accepts regulation as the path to dealing with what were the public utilities, I cannot emphasise too strongly that we must look very carefully at what regulators do. We must learn from past experience. Regulators are meant to help; they are not meant to impose costs with no recognisable benefit. I support the amendment most strongly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-29_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   I, too, should like to support the amendment so ably moved by the noble Earl, Lord Caithness. He is absolutely right in saying that under the proposed legislation the discretionary powers of the regulator are enormously increased. The decisions taken could substantially affect those who are either operating in the market or who wish to come into the market. In my Second Reading speech I drew attention to the need for greater transparency in the activities of the regulator; and, indeed, I even said that attention should be given to some sort of appeals procedure in certain circumstances. The need for transparency is something that applies right through the Bill&#151;that is, as regards transparency in conditions, in prices and in the actions of the regulator. I hope that we may hear from the Minister in this instance that he agrees with his noble friend.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-29_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   Unless my noble friend should think that this is a tripartite cabal, perhaps I may say that that is most certainly not the case. I do not find such a very ably drafted and moved amendment extreme in the least. After all, the director can still act as before. The only difference is that the amendment would make him or her say why. I should like such a consideration to apply not only to the gas regulator but to all regulators.
<P>


<a name="column_842"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-29_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Cochrane of Cults: </B>   I rise to speak with a degree of diffidence because we are now dealing with matters which are somewhat outside my main field of interest in the gas industry. However, I must point out that I am possibly the only person in the Chamber who, as chairman or director of a company, was threatened with prosecution by the then director for complaining that he exercised his powers in a disgracefully arbitrary manner. Eventually a letter conceded that perhaps I had a point, although it did so grudgingly.
<P>

<a name="50628-29_para11"></a>However, to pick up a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, I believe that there must be an obvious route of appeal. When I complained bitterly about that director's appalling behaviour&#151;and Members of the Committee will note that I use the word "his"&#151;I was told, "Well you can have a judicial appeal". At that time we had 141 customers and the minimum charge at that time for such an appeal was, according to my lawyers, about &#163;15,000 in this country and somewhat less on the other side of Hadrian's Wall. The point is that, if we are to establish generalised competition in the industry, some of the suppliers will be small. They cannot afford to be treated in such a way. Indeed, it would be disgraceful, underhand and would inhibit competition and initiative. For that reason, I support the amendment in general terms.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-29_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Peston, expressed bewilderment as to the reasons why any amendment would or would not be acceptable to the Government. However, I should tell the noble Lord that there is one fairly good reason; namely, that they are always acceptable to the Government if they are good amendments. Therefore, I would certainly be only too willing to consider and, if possible, accept any amendment which is a good one.
<P>

<a name="50628-29_para12"></a>However, I must agree with the noble Lord that what we are discussing is, up to a point, an experiment. The noble Lord is quite right in that respect. I do not believe that anyone has a monopoly of wisdom in such matters. When my noble friend Lord Caithness moves such an amendment, obviously one takes it most seriously. Of course, the amendment is most attractive in principle. We all believe in regulation being as open as possible. However, despite what my noble friend said, I believe that regulators are, on the whole, responsible people.
<P>

<a name="50628-29_para13"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ezra, said that the discretionary powers of regulators are being increased. Of course, the noble Lord is quite right. That has been done for a purpose; namely, that it is important not to let suppliers and others tread all over consumers. Therefore, in order to prevent that from happening we give the regulators some fairly hefty powers. I do not believe that that is wrong, provided that the regulator carries out his powers in the correct way.
<P>

<a name="50628-29_para14"></a>As my noble friend Lord Caithness said, there is a balance to be struck. No one can say that the balance is absolutely right. Indeed, my noble friend believes that the balance is too far the other way. I actually think that the amendment would tilt the balance too far in favour of the regulated company. It would allow regulated companies to hire hosts of lawyers to cross-examine the director with the aim, I believe, of forcing her to give statements which <P>


<a name="column_843"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 843</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would tie her hands in the future. I do not believe that that would be in the public interest. That is why I believe that we have the balance right.
<P>

<a name="50628-29_para15"></a>As I said, no one has a monopoly of wisdom in the matter. Indeed, some Members of the Committee might think that it goes too far in one direction. However, we believe that we have got it about right. My noble friend Lord Cochrane said that there should be an appeals procedure. But, of course, one could go on having appeals. One says that there ought to be a commercial market; so a regulator is set up in order to ensure that those involved with commerce do not ride roughshod over consumers. But then one says, "If that happens, then we must have an appeal procedure". One can go on and on in that respect.
<P>

<a name="50628-29_para16"></a>In fact, my noble friend Lord Cochrane gave the answer that I would have given him. He said that if people are concerned that the director has gone over the top&#151;to use a colloquialism&#151;there is always the possibility of going to judicial review if it is thought that the director has not exercised her powers correctly. I do not believe that that is an unreasonable course to take. However, I shall certainly reflect upon what has been said. I should like to be able to tell my noble friend that he has a simply smashing amendment and that I would love to accept it. However, I cannot say that because it would not be quite right for me to do so. But, as I said, I shall certainly consider what has been said.

<A NAME="50628-30_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   When the Minister reflects further on the matter, perhaps the principle of natural justice will appeal to him. It should not always be a question of having to opt for judicial review in order to remedy a situation. There should be the possibility of being able to negotiate the solution to a problem with the director. However, one cannot do so unless one knows the reasons for a decision that has been made. That is an additional argument that I hope will appeal to the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, in persuading the Minister to accept the amendment. The Minister has been most generous by saying that he will reflect on the matter, and Members of the Committee are grateful to him for that. However, I merely wanted to put forward that additional argument into the scale.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-30_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Brightman: </B>   I had not intended to speak on the amendment, but, reflecting upon it, it seems to me that it seeks nothing except to require a person who makes a decision to give his reasons for it. In my experience, it is very seldom that it can be wrong to require a person who reaches a decision to state why.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-30_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   The noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, always has the capacity to put things very simply. When he puts the case like that, I am bound to admit that I would find it very difficult to say that it is unreasonable for a person to stipulate his reasons. However, the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, really hit the nail on the head, although he did not mean to do so. He said that what we need to do is negotiate. In other words, the director says, "I think that is wrong and therefore this should happen", and along come all the batteries of lawyers, and so on, who say, "No, we want to negotiate. We do not want to accept the director's <P>


<a name="column_844"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 844</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>explanation, we want to ask questions". Thus they would push the director into a corner. I do not believe that that would be right. It is one thing to give a reason but it is another thing, having given your reasons, to say, "Now boys, come on, we want to argue about it so that we can get you to change your mind". That is where the difficulty would arise. However, as I said, I shall certainly reflect on what has been said.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-30_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   With respect to the Minister, I believe that he misinterpreted what I said. It is possible that I did not express my arguments sufficiently well. I entirely adopt the point made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman. Indeed, it is quintessentially right that people who make decisions should give reasons for them. In talking about negotiating, what I really mean is, for example, that if one knows the reasons underlying a decision, one should be able to go to the director and say, "With respect I think you have the wrong end of the stick. You have made an error here." We are not always talking about lawyers. I am a lawyer myself. Lawyers frequently like to achieve settlements rather than engage in litigation, curiously enough. I think the noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, would confirm that. I do not believe that it would be right to interpret what I said in the way the Minister did. As I said, I hope that the arguments that have been adduced will appeal to him and that he will reflect further. Indeed I hope that he will come forward with his own amendment.

<A NAME="50628-30_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   I wish that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, had moved the amendment instead of me: he would have been much more concise and punchier and would have taken up a great deal less time. I am grateful for his support, as indeed I am grateful to all Members of the Committee who have spoken and who have supported me, except for my noble friend on the Front Bench. That is a little sad. I thought that the noble and learned Lord had almost persuaded my noble friend. He concluded by saying that he would look again at this matter. I believe that it merits careful consideration. This is a good and valid point. There surely can be no harm in giving reasons. What is and has been damaging to our privatisation process, which is such a good idea and has worked so well in many cases&#151;to such an extent that we have the noble Lord, Lord Peston, supporting it&#151;is the arbitrary decisions of the regulator taken for no apparent reason. My noble friend Lord Cochrane of Cults has suffered at first hand. It is unacceptable.
<P>

<a name="50628-30_para0"></a>It would be to the great credit of the Government if we added to the Bill the few words of my amendment.

This wording is intended to allow the director's report to cover both the extent of competition&#151;the number of companies competing and their market shares, and so on&#151;but also wider developments, including, for example, the impact of this competition on prices. The amendment will also, I believe, provide an appropriate means by which the director could report annually to the Secretary of State and Parliament on the progress of the transitional phases.

I must admit that I did not expect such a rapid response from the noble Earl. I believe that the amendment will be of benefit to the regulator. It will focus the mind of the regulator on what I regard as the essence of the Bill; namely, competition. The regulator will be asked to provide a judgment on what has been happening as regards competition. The noble Earl is aware that I did not like the term, "her view of effectiveness". However, this measure is all to the good and I thank the noble Earl for it. I shall say "Content" when the Question is put.

<P>

<a name="50628-31_para24"></a>The question that I wish to put to the noble Earl is this. Why, so soon after the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994, have the Government inserted this clause into the Gas Bill when it was expressly stated that the former Bill was not for subsequent legislation?

<P>

<a name="50628-31_para25"></a>If noble Lords will cast their minds back to when we debated the Deregulation and Contracting Out Bill (as it then was) I specifically raised the point: could the Bill be used in a forward looking way?

<a name="column_849"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 849</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>told; I was told categorically that it could not. I set out all the dangers. I was discontented enough with that Bill, but the thought that it might reach forward appalled me because it meant that no legislation passed in Parliament would be safe from the ad hoc procedures of that Bill, now an Act.
<P>

<a name="50628-31_para26"></a>I must admit&#151;and I do so parenthetically&#151;that I had not noticed paragraph 20 on page 69 of the Bill until the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, put down his amendment. If I had noticed it, I would have had a tremendous row at Second Reading because I regard this as an act of bad faith on the part of the Government. I have to put it as bluntly as I can. The Government said in terms that this could not possibly happen. In replying to the Second Reading debate, the Minister stated that it could not happen.
<P>

<a name="50628-31_para27"></a>I have endeavoured to treat the Gas Bill as a Bill which needs amending but with which I agree in principle. However, unless the Government take out this paragraph, I shall feel obliged to raise the matter on Report, not simply as an issue relating to the Bill but with regard to the whole of the Government's approach. In other words, I shall find it impossible to have a normal Report stage and will simply demand that we have further time. I can only hope that the noble Earl will tell me that it is simply a mistake. I cannot emphasise how serious the matter is. If the Committee lets the clause go through, we have no protection against a similar clause in any other Bill which comes before your Lordships.
<P>

<a name="50628-31_para28"></a>It is absurd in an empty Chamber at 9.15 at night that I have to speak so strongly. It is my fault that I did not spot the matter early enough to raise it when I should have done on Second Reading. I regard the proposal as disgraceful, quite unacceptable and not something I could accept for the future of the Bill. Since it is not my desire to sabotage the Bill, I hope that the Government will say that it is a mistake, that they cannot go against what they said before, and that they are taking the proposal out of the Bill.

<P>

<a name="50628-31_para29"></a>When, with the Deregulation and Contracting Out Bill, as it was then, we were told that the Bill was retrospective but was not prospective, it was absolutely accurate and remains accurate. That is why we need paragraph 20 in Schedule 4. We are talking about this Bill. I am sure my noble friend will explain why the Government see the need to make the Bill, as a special exercise, subject to the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act. If Members of the Committee do not like it, they can take the usual course of disagreeing with the Government in a Division. However, I cannot accept the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Peston, that categoric assurances which he received&#151;and I was there when he received them&#151;on the Deregulation and Contracting Out Bill were invalid and should never have been given. I cannot accept it.

<P>
<A NAME="50628-32_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   Before we proceed, is the Bill taking place in the 1995 Session of Parliament? The answer must be yes. When we were dealing with the legislation in <P>


<a name="column_850"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 850</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>1994, my question was: could it apply to any Bill coming forward later? The answer was no. Therefore, although I am always willing to accept that I missed some subtle point, I cannot see how the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, can remotely argue that, having been told that that legislation could not apply to a later Bill, it applies to this. It is not a matter of saying, "Amend it or divide on it". I regard it as a deeper issue than that.
<P>

<a name="50628-32_para0"></a>The Minister may say in reply: "I don't understand, this has nothing to do with what I think the Bill concerns". However, if the clause treats the Bill as if it had been passed last year, then I repeat my point that it is not a matter of amendment but of bad faith, going against the word of a Minister given to me and other noble Lords in the House. That is unacceptable in any circumstances. It is not a matter of divide or argue. I shall not take part in proceedings that are conducted in that way. I shall not do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-32_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   It is not for me to defend my noble friend on the Front Bench; but since, by imputation, I have been attacked for the speech that I have just made, I should like to respond. My understanding of the assurance given at that time in the context of the previous Bill is that that Bill was not prospective. Given that it was not, if we wish to bring any future Bill which subsequently becomes an Act of Parliament within the ambit of the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act, we have to do it in the future Bill. That is what is being done now.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-32_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   It is difficult to reconcile what the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, has just said with what is written in the report of the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee in relation to the Bill. The report says in black print on page 3:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"This would appear to be a departure from the principles of the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act; and the Committee accordingly draws this power to the attention of the House as the House may wish to consider why, so soon after the passing of the Act, it is now necessary to extend its deregulation provisions in this way."</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-32_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   Perhaps I may try to help the noble Lord, Lord Peston. I believe I understand his main anxiety and I do not like him to feel that there has been ill-faith or bad faith on behalf of the Government. He is quite right. When the Deregulation and Contracting Out Bill was introduced last year it referred to any Bills that existed then and to previous Bills. It is right that the deregulation order-making power did not apply to future legislation because Section 1(5) defined the legislation to which it applied as being all the existing legislation up to and including the 1994 Session. That was the position and the noble Lord is quite right about it.
<P>

<a name="50628-32_para1"></a>I shall go into this in more detail later. Here we are asking Parliament to approve the fact that the principle could be used for this legislation as well. That is not the same as saying that the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act refers to all Bills in the future. It does not. It referred to those Bills and Acts of Parliament up to and including 1994.
<P>

<a name="50628-32_para2"></a>The order-making power in the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act was limited to the application of Acts of Parliament that had been passed up to and including the last Session, because we realised that Parliament would not know whether it would apply to future legislation. It <P>


<a name="column_851"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 851</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>did not mean that the Government thought that the principles of deregulation were in some way inappropriate to future legislation&#151;but rather that each case of future legislation should be considered on its individual merits. The purpose of this clause in the Bill is to give Parliament an opportunity to consider whether the deregulation power would be appropriate in this case.
<P>

<a name="50628-32_para3"></a>This Bill is full of regulations and detail, and we took the view that, as in other areas, circumstances could well change in the future in such a way that there may be a need for a simplified procedure to repeal or amend legislative provisions where they become outdated or where, for example, technological advances mean that legislative provisions introduced in an earlier age (which is now) and overtaken by events or by technology, might no longer be appropriate. For example, remote meter reading by electronic means might become universal in future, such that provisions allowing for rights of entry to read meters would no longer be needed. Another example might be the provision for regulating the assessment of calorific value, which might become redundant if, for instance, devices for measurement in individual homes were to be available cheaply.
<P>

<a name="50628-32_para4"></a>Parliament has already accepted that the provisions of the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act are appropriate for the 1986 Gas Act. The noble Lord's amendment, were it to be accepted, would have a very strange effect. It would mean that the deregulation provisions could apply to certain parts of the 1986 Act but not to those parts which are amended by this Act. The Deregulation and Contracting Out Act provides for such a power. However, the power is subject to stringent checks and balances. These include, as the noble Lord, Lord Peston, knows only too well, a requirement that the use of the order-making power must not remove any necessary protection; a requirement for special scrutiny of interested parties; and a requirement for consideration of any proposal by Select Committee in each House for 60 parliamentary days, and then by affirmative resolution of both Houses. These are very strong safeguards, and they were recognised as such by your Lordships when we approved this power a year ago and the very wide application that it has.
<P>

<a name="50628-32_para5"></a>The point that I would make to the noble Lord&#151;and this is where there could be a misunderstanding&#151;is that he was right that that Act referred to what happened in 1994, and to what happened previously. What we are doing in this Act is not to abuse that, but to put it for Parliament to approve that there could be circumstances in the future where the application of that Act in this Bill would not be inappropriate. I do not think that that is bad faith. It is straightforward, one might say, honesty, in bringing to Parliament the suggestion that that Act has a purpose in this Bill, subject to your Lordships' approval.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-32_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I am sure that the noble Earl is doing the best that he can, and we have conducted our proceedings most amicably. But it will not do. I went through the whole of that Act. I know exactly how it was argued. I raised the fears. I said that it was a constitutional outrage, and I made other remarks of that sort. I said that I thought it was wrong. But in particular I warned about the phenomenon that we have before us at the moment. I <P>


<a name="column_852"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 852</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>expressed my fear as to what would happen, and I repeat my point. I said that no Act would then be safe from these ad hoc powers. I was told that I was wrong. And I was not just mildly told, I was strongly told that I was wrong. If any Members of the Committee were present, they will remember how strongly I was told.
<P>

<a name="50628-32_para6"></a>I must tell the noble Earl that if he is unhappy about some of the developments his duty is to bring before this Chamber an amendment to the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act. It should not be done in this manner. I will not have it. I repeat that I did not fight that Bill on constitutional grounds so strongly as I did fight it only for this provision to be slipped into this Bill and for anybody to accept the argument here that that clause can be put into any other Bill that ever comes before Parliament. That is just not acceptable.
<P>

<a name="50628-32_para7"></a>I do not believe that the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, will divide the Chamber tonight on the amendment. I hope that he does not do so. But between now and Report stage this matter has to be dealt with at the highest possible level. Never mind everything else that we have done&#151;we have argued in terms of whether we do or do not agree and I can live with defeat there&#151;I cannot accept that this amendment is in any way other than crucial. I cannot understand how the noble Earl even remotely let his officials proceed in that manner. It is beyond me, given the Government's commitment and the commitment of other Ministers, the noble Earl's friends, in the debates. It simply must not be allowed to go ahead.
<P>

<a name="50628-32_para8"></a>Half past nine on a summer evening is not the time to go into the issue. But between now and Report I intend to have this whole subject debated, either within the Gas Bill for a whole day or as a separate debate. On constitutional grounds this provision must not be allowed to go ahead. Those are the warnings that I place on the record. I wait to hear what the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, has to say.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-32_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   Certainly this has turned out to be a most serious issue. The wording of the paragraph definitely gives cause for concern. The wording that is used could be used in any subsequent Act to get away from what was very clearly agreed. It says that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The provisions of this Act shall be treated for the purposes of sections 1 and 5 of the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act ... as if they were contained in an Act passed in the same Session as that Act".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50628-32_para9"></a>Every single subsequent Bill that comes before this Chamber could have that same pretence: put the clock back, put the calendar back and pretend that the measure was passed in the same Session, so that the undertaking that was then given would be met.
<P>

<a name="50628-32_para10"></a>I do not believe that that is a subterfuge that can easily be accepted. As the noble Lord, Lord Peston, said, the hour is late. Certainly, we cannot divide on this issue now. It is an issue that has to be debated in much more depth. It raises a very serious constitutional issue. Therefore, on the assumption that we shall come back to this matter in a big way at the next stage of the Bill, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-33_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   It may help the Committee if my noble friend explains the substantial changes that the Government are making to this schedule. It will then be easier for the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, to respond.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-33_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Brightman: </B>   I shall deal with this matter as briefly as I can. The point is that if British Gas enters into a contract to purchase gas from a gas field and then transfers the contract to another company, under the ordinary law British Gas would remain liable to the gas field in the event of default by the transferee company.
<P>

<a name="50628-33_para1"></a>Schedule 5 appears to me to disregard that principle by enabling British Gas to hive off contracts without remaining liable in the event of default by the transferee company. What is more, Schedule 5 enables British Gas to transfer contracts to either of two companies of its own choice. British Gas is in theory therefore in a position to pass good contracts over to company A and unprofitable contracts to company B. If it wished it could then walk away from company B. Amendment No. 155 is designed to meet that risk by providing that nothing in the schedule should relieve British Gas of its liability under a transferred contract in the event of default by one of the two nominated associates, as the transferee companies are called.
<P>

<a name="50628-33_para2"></a>Amendment No. 154C, which has been tabled but not yet moved by the Government, only permits contracts by British Gas to be assigned to a single trading entity. The result is that the risk that worried me seems to have been reduced and perhaps eliminated altogether. If there is only one associated nominated company, only one trading entity, then it is almost inconceivable that British Gas would allow that company to go bankrupt.
<P>

<a name="50628-33_para3"></a>Amendment No. 154C, which is the amendment which allays my anxiety, arrived somewhat late in the day, although I was greatly helped by an explanatory letter which I received from the noble Earl this afternoon. However, I have not had time to consider it in the depth I should have liked. I expect to find that my worries are over. In the circumstances, it is not my present intention to move Amendment No. 155. I express my grateful <P>


<a name="column_854"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 854</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>thanks to the noble Earl for considering my Amendment No. 155 and for making many amendments to Schedule 5 which go so far to meet my point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-33_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Gisborough: </B>   Two or three years ago, certain companies entered into long-term agreements with British Gas to buy its gas. On the back of those contracts those companies entered further contracts to sell the gas and had arrangements with their customers. The Bill, which is retrospective, seriously interferes with, if not negates, those contracts for purchasing gas and leaves those companies with outstanding contracts to sell the gas. It is a dangerous situation because it sets a precedent which may make future companies buying contracts wonder whether the rules will be changed during the tenure of those contracts. However, I am extremely grateful to my noble friend the Minister for agreeing, as he did, to see the company representatives concerned. I know that he understands the matter a great deal better than I do and I hope that when he comes to speak he will be able to give some comfort and perhaps put forward proposals for dealing with the damage that would appear to have been done to those companies.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-33_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   Before the noble Earl outlines his view of all these matters, I really would like to change my mood and congratulate the Government on what they seem to have done. The noble Lord, Lord Gisborough, raised the matter at Second Reading. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, has been very concerned about contracts. The Government have had the rather difficult task of providing a balance as regards the interests of British Gas, bearing in mind, in particular, that when it was a public utility it was obliged to sign long-term contracts for supply at what now are very uneconomic prices.
<P>

<a name="50628-33_para4"></a>I cannot believe that it is the Government's desire to bankrupt British Gas as a result of the Bill. But, equally, a contract is a contract. Other concerns are getting into this business and some degree of fairness must apply to them. In looking at the amendment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, I thought that this was an impossible state of affairs. I have to congratulate the noble Earl. In so far as anything could possibly be done, it looks as though his amendment just about does it, within the imperfections of the world in which we live. As I understand it, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, has said that he is content. I have been subject to pressures from all sides and I can only say that I am content. I hope, therefore, that the amendment in the noble Earl's name will work. I assume it will and I wish it good speed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-33_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   It is my feeling that my noble friend and his department have squared the circle in a most elegant way. I congratulate them on it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-33_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   Having raised this matter at Second Reading, I, too, would like to congratulate my noble friend on what he has done. With his agility of mind I am sure that he can do it with the same ease as regards some of the amendments that we have already discussed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50628-33_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   Such a bouquet of flowers coming from all round the Chamber is most unusual. I think that I must probably have got it wrong to have received all that. I am <P>


<a name="column_855"></a>

<B>28 Jun 1995 : Column 855</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>deeply grateful to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, who was courteous enough to write to me some time ago and tell me of the amendments that he proposed to put down. That enabled me to consider the matter in some detail. I am bound to say that I did have a certain amount of advice and help over that consideration, without which, of course, I would have been completely incapacitated. The result was that he alerted us to a problem.
<P>

<a name="50628-33_para5"></a>It is not an easy issue. The difficulty we have is in meeting the two principles of separation, that is, making sure that the operation of the common pipeline network which is owned by British Gas is not distorted by the company's trading position, and avoiding undue detriment to the position of British Gas's counterparties. It would not in our judgment be possible to meet the first of those objectives if we sought to deal with the second in the manner which the noble and learned Lord suggested in his amendment. Requiring the pipeline to guarantee the gas purchase contracts of one supplier among many could be seen to compromise its neutrality. If those guarantees were ever called, that could raise the prospect of pipeline tariffs for the whole industry being raised in order to support British Gas's counterparties.
<P>

<a name="50628-33_para6"></a>We came to the conclusion that more work needed to be done to the Bill about this. There is a concern that the present provisions of the Bill might allow one of the supply subsidiaries to be, as it were, a man of straw. That would obviously not be right. We propose that the Bill should limit British Gas to a single supply subsidiary rather than allowing the company to have two. That would guarantee that all the contracts were vested in a substantial business with a turnover of several billion pounds a year. Since British Gas will continue to have a monopoly in the domestic market in most of the country until some time in 1998 and the sheer number of customers in that market will limit the speed at which the company's market share can fall after that time, we think that this change will effectively meet the anxieties which have been expressed.
<P>

<a name="50628-33_para7"></a>That is why I tabled the amendments. I understand that the noble and learned Lord has not had time to consider either of these amendments or&#151;I was going to say more importantly&#151;my letter. It would be extravagance on my part to suggest that my letter was more important. I wrote to him as soon as I could but, as he will realise, the matter took some consideration. I am sorry that he was unable to have the letter earlier than he did.
<P>

<a name="50628-33_para8"></a>If the noble and learned Lord will withdraw his amendment, and if the Committee considers that it would be appropriate to accept my amendments, I would find that helpful. If the noble and learned Lord is agitated between now and Report stage, I shall be more than delighted to try to help him and meet any points of concern. I do not just say that to my noble friend Lord Gisborough. He expressed concerns to me earlier when he came to see me. We are continuing to consider, with the affected parties, whether there is an appropriate solution which will allow the network code to proceed in a fair way. I understand his position about having entered into contracts which might have untoward <P>

<A NAME="50628w01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   Her Majesty's Government continue to work actively for the conclusion of the negotiations for a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty by the end of 1996. We have made clear that our aim is to establish a comprehensive ban on nuclear-weapon test explosions in the atmosphere, underwater and underground. At the same time we consider that the treaty should not prohibit the UK, in common with the other nuclear-weapon states, from fulfilling its responsibilities to maintain the safety and reliability of its nuclear weapons. The question of the scope of the treaty is yet to be resolved. We are in touch with the US and other member states of the conference on disarmament on a wide range of issues relevant to the CTBT negotiations.

<A NAME="50628w01_spmin3"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security   (Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish): </B>  From the launch of the agency in April 1993 to the end of April this year, the agency has recorded over 18,000 reduced benefit directions (RBD) as being issued to the Benefits Agency for them to consider implementing a reduction in benefit. Information on the number of RBDs implemented by the Benefits Agency has been collected since the beginning of last April. This shows that 2,361 RBDs were implemented during that month.
<P>

<a name="50628w01_para3"></a>The more specific information requested is not available. However, since launch to the end of April this year, the Child Support Agency considered whether there was good cause not to co-operate with the agency in almost 162,000 cases. The parent with care (PWC) named the absent parent in over 25,800 of those cases. Good cause not to co-operate with the agency was accepted in 73,400 cases and was rejected in 60,500 cases. (These figures do not quite sum to the total as they have been drawn from a variety of sources.)

<a name="50628w01_para4"></a>Although figures are not collected, the majority of PWCs subject to a RBD will not be in employment, but a small number of Family Credit and Disability Working Allowance claimants may be affected.

In their joint report of May 1995 (a copy of which has been placed in the Library) the Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE) and the Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee (RWMAC) indicate that the 1977 explosion was the probable source of radioactive metallic particles <P>

Since 1977, as a result of monitoring, only one radioactive metallic particle has been found on the public beach at Sandside Bay in 1984 and a number of radioactive metallic particles on the Dounreay site and the Dounreay foreshore, to which the public does not have ready access. COMARE concluded in the recent joint report that the chance of an individual member of the public encountering the particles was extremely small. Because of the very low probability of encountering such particles, COMARE was of the opinion, based on the evidence currently available, that while the most active particles could cause acute effects, the metallic particles are most unlikely to explain the observed excess of childhood leukaemia in the Dounreay area.
