<a name="60424-01_star0"></a><h3 align=center>Railways: Driver-only Trains</h3>

<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="60424-01_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Berkeley </b></b> </font> asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>How considerations of passenger safety and security and cost influenced their decision not to include an option for driver-only operation in the new South West Trains franchise inquiry.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="60424-01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the South Western franchise does not contain an option for driver-only operation. Bidders have been asked to submit proposals that meet the franchise objectives, and the Government expect the market to determine the most appropriate method for achieving these goals. Should bidders recommend changes to current operational practices, they must demonstrate that the proposal represents value for money and ensure that passenger safety and security is not compromised.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="60424-01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   My Lords, I am very grateful to my noble friend for that Answer, but he will be aware that more than 800 guards are employed on South West trains and many of them are sitting in their cabs doing absolutely nothing to help passenger security. I know that my noble friend is very concerned about that, especially in the inner suburban areas. Would it not be good to get those guards patrolling up and down the coaches to give passengers more of an element of security&#151;and perhaps to save a little bit of money, if you do not need a guard on every train?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="60424-01_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, those are obviously factors that the bidders for the franchise will <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_2"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 2</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

take into account. They will want to run their trains in the most economic way to provide the best service and to position themselves best for the bid, but they will also be aware of the fact that we are concerned for the security of passengers and train staff on the railway, so they will take that point into account, too.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="60424-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   My Lords, is not the Minister being a little disingenuous? The franchisees are bidding by means of a specification to submit the most competitive bids to the Government. The Government, in their specification, apparently do not go for the efficient option of driver-only operation, but neither do they specify that stations should have adequate staff at night to secure the safety of passengers. So the bids come in at the lowest possible price, security and economy are not achieved, and the Government blame the franchisees. Is it not the Government&#039;s fault?
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="60424-01_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, franchisees know the basis on which the franchise will be awarded. Of course, the Government ensure in the criteria for the franchise that value for money is achieved, but also the security of the railway and its effective operation. It would be very odd if we identified one particular issue of railway management and put that into the franchise requirement. The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, would just pick on another specification that he thought should be in there and we would have a franchise that would be extraordinarily detailed and specific and not give franchisees an appropriate way in which to approach the issue.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="60424-01_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that one ingredient which must be in the new franchise for South West Trains is the creation of facilities to allow people to use the Oyster card so that they can interchange between the London Underground and the mainline at places such as Richmond and Wimbledon? Does he not agree that the way in which South West Trains has hitherto <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_3"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 3</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

dragged its feet on the introduction of the Oyster card is causing great unhappiness among passengers and that this must be put right in the new franchise?
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="60424-01_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend makes a constructive point. He will know that there is considerable pressure, not least from those concerned with passenger facilities in the London area, that the Oyster card should have wider currency. Certainly that would facilitate the movement of travellers coming into London from the south-west and, indeed, from other parts. We all recognise that the Oyster card brings potential benefits in operating efficiency, but, of course, the train companies have to sign up to it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="60424-01_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   My Lords, before undertaking or looking again at railway franchises, have the Government undertaken any research on the safety of driver-only trains in comparison with trains with guards who are able to wander up and down, and on passenger reaction to driver-only trains?
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="60424-01_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I thought that question would be appropriately asked. I have asked for a full briefing on the matter. No serious incident or major security factor has been related to driver-only trains. However, passengers&#039; feelings regarding security may be a slightly different matter. Noble Lords will recognise that railway staff, even when mobile on a train, are not expected to intervene in very distressing circumstances of real difficulty with passengers. There is a limit on what they are expected to do. Therefore, I do not think that passengers are more anxious on driver-only trains. Certainly, no incident has occurred that should increase that insecurity.

<a name="time_0"></a>
<a name="60424-01_time0"></a><h5>2.42 pm</h5>
<p><a name="qn_1"></a>
<a name="60424-01_spopq1"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Llandudno </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>Whether the 69 new passport interview offices will be fully operational by the deadline of the last quarter of 2006.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="60424-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </b>  My Lords, preparations are well in hand to begin interviews late this year. We want to introduce them as soon as is practicable because of the improvement in confirming identity and fighting passport fraud they will bring, but there is no deadline. It is very important to minimise any risk to the smooth running of passport issuing. Therefore, the new offices will be brought into operation in a controlled phased programme over about three months.
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="60424-01_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Llandudno: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for her Answer although I am surprised that the last quarter deadline is not being adhered to. Many of us are concerned about continual bureaucracy and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_4"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 4</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

erosion of civil liberties. First, what will be recorded at personal interviews at the 69 new offices&#151;will it be fingerprints or iris scans? Secondly, will the Minister please inform us of the addresses of the 69 new offices, their staffing and the costs? And&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="60424-01_spnew10"></a><b> Noble Lords: </b>   Oh!
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="60424-01_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Llandudno: </b>   This is part of my second question, with your Lordships&#039; indulgence. Given the location of the new offices, many people will have to travel great distances. Will any assistance be given to those needing to travel from, say, the Isle of Lewis to Aberdeen or from Aberdaron to Wrexham?
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="60424-01_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I hope that the noble Lord will be pleased to hear that the locations have all been identified. The roll-out will take place by January/February so there has not been great slippage. Fingerprints and iris recognition will not form part of the interview process. Noble Lords will be aware that the whole issue of facial recognition is ongoing. The addresses of the 69 offices are available. They have been provided. Indeed, I have a map that I am sure the noble Lord would love to see. I hope that I had given great delight to him today.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="60424-01_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Dholakia: </b>   My Lords, has the Minister taken into account the need for additional resources to deal with applicants who may apply for passports in anticipation of ID cards being introduced soon?
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="60424-01_spnew14"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, we have a clear understanding of the sorts of applications that are likely to be made. We have made appropriate provision. We will still have the check-and-send service that noble Lords will know is available from post offices across the country, so we will be able to check the biographical footprint first. The processes that we are now adopting will be appropriate, quick and speedy. No applicant should have to travel for more than about one hour. If they do, special provisions will be made available for remote communities. All the planning is well in place.

<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="60424-02_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   My Lords, when the Government carried out a cost benefit analysis of their proposals, what was their estimate of the additional costs that would be imposed on people who wish to have a passport?
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="60424-02_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, we produced an estimate of the costs of this new service last year. Noble Lords will know that that has been included in the estimates. The current programme of face-to-face recognition will enable us to take advantage of a more secure process to help with fraud. Those issues were canvassed long before our debates on identity cards.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="60424-02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Mackenzie of Framwellgate: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that as evidence suggests terrorists tend to use multiple passports, the use <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_5"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 5</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of biometric passports, which is a European requirement&#151;in some senses, an international one&#151;should reduce that use dramatically?
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="60424-02_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I agree with my noble friend. Passport interviews are fully justified by the need to tackle identity fraud through attempts to obtain passports in false or stolen identities. That is the main use we found where the difficulty lies. Passports containing a facial biometric are necessary to meet international standards, as my noble friend has indicated. In due course, as we have discussed, fingerprint records in British passports will be needed to keep up with the security standards of passports issued by other EU member states.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="60424-02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Crickhowell: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister place in the Library, if she has not already done so, the map that is giving her so much pleasure?
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="60424-02_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I should be delighted to do so. I have a funny feeling that it might already be there, but if not, rest assured that it will be.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="60424-02_spmin0"></a><b>The Countess of Mar:</b>  My Lords, will the Minister tell the House which computer company has the contract for connecting all the 69 offices? Is it the same company that provides computer services to the National Health Service?
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="60424-02_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, the company that has succeeded is Mapeley. I think that it is a different company. The contract was put out to proper tender, which it won on a competitive basis.
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="60424-02_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Seccombe: </b>   My Lords, the Minister seems to be setting great store on facial recognition. I have an example concerning the parents of young twins. A passport application has to be made for each twin at a cost of &#163;50 each, and this very morning, a photograph of one of the twins was returned because the child&#039;s mouth was open. Can the Minister help the House by explaining how one can get a child of that age to keep its mouth closed?
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="60424-02_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, if any of us knew that we would be very wealthy indeed. In introducing biometric photographs, we will be able to check that the photograph taken meets the required standard. That will make the process easier. The wonderful thing about a digital photograph is that we can keep it still until just the right moment so that the image can be captured correctly.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="60424-02_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   My Lords, will it be possible to obtain a passport from now on without an interview?
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="60424-02_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, it may be because of the roll-out process. We are trying to have face-to-face interviews in relation to new passports. We shall be doing that on a regional basis, and an opportunity will be given to all those obtaining new <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_6"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 6</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

passports. That will happen on the reissue of passports as fingerprints and other requirements come in. That will be rolled out, but we are talking about the first issue of passports at the moment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="60424-02_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Dixon-Smith: </b>   My Lords, will the noble Baroness give an assurance that the computer company running the identity cards contract is not the same as that running the computers for the Rural Payments Agency?
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="60424-02_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, we will issue all contracts with the greatest of care and make sure that the best possible supplier is chosen to meet the needs.
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="60424-02_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Llandudno: </b>   My Lords, if the irises and fingerprints are not to be recorded, why does it say on the United Kingdom Passport Service internet site that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>&quot;the public will be able to have their irises and fingerprints recorded&quot;?</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60424-02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>Why does it say that if the Minister is contradicting it?
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="60424-02_spnew14"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, people will be able to have irises and fingerprints recorded in due course. We have already identified what the roll-out programme will be and indicated that it is unlikely to take place before 2008. First, it will be the biometric photograph. Subsequently, noble Lords should also know that the offices that we have identified for the face-to-face interviews are likely to be similar to those taking fingerprints in due course, when that falls to be considered.

<a name="time_1"></a>
<a name="60424-02_time0"></a><h5>2.51 pm</h5>
<p><a name="qn_2"></a>
<a name="60424-02_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_2"></a>What is their response to the new guidelines being proposed for the supply of sensitive nuclear materials by the Nuclear Suppliers Group.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="60424-02_spnew15"></a><b> Baroness Royall of Blaisdon: </b>   My Lords, Her Majesty&#039;s Government warmly welcomed the US-India civil nuclear co-operation initiative and subsequent proposal for an exemption to the Nuclear Suppliers Group guidelines, which would allow nuclear transfers to IAEA-safeguarded civil nuclear facilities in India. We believe that it will allow for a significant contribution to energy security, development, economic and environmental objectives for India and the international community. It represents a gain for the nuclear non-proliferation regime, which is underpinned by the non-proliferation treaty.
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="60424-02_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for her reply and glad that she warmly welcomes the US-India deal. Does she agree <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_7"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 7</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that, since India is not even a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty, the supply of new nuclear materials to it raises some important questions for the whole non-proliferation regime and, possibly, about the India-Pakistan nuclear balance? In the light of the new realities&#151;including Israeli ownership of nuclear weapons and the dangerous pretensions of both Iran and, even more so, North Korea&#151;is it the Government&#039;s view that the time has come to look at an enlargement and strengthening of the NPT regime, to take account of the realities that the world now faces?
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="60424-02_spnew17"></a><b> Baroness Royall of Blaisdon: </b>   My Lords, the NPT continues to be the cornerstone of our nuclear disarmament work; it is under constant review. Clearly, as the noble Lord says, the new development&#151;the potential agreement between India and the US&#151;raises important issues. It is something that the UK will continue to monitor, together with our NPT partners, and I am sure it will develop accordingly.
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="60424-02_spnew18"></a><b> Lord Redesdale: </b>   My Lords, can the Minister say whether the Government are having talks with the Russian authorities about their distribution of nuclear materials? It was, of course, the Russian deal with India that led to the setting-up of the NPT regime in the first place.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="60424-02_spnew19"></a><b> Baroness Royall of Blaisdon: </b>   Yes, my Lords, the UK is having dialogue with the Russian authorities about nuclear issues, both within Russia and globally. Noble Lords may indeed be interested to note that Russia has been very supportive of the new agreement between India and the US.
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="60424-02_spnew20"></a><b> Lord Hannay of Chiswick: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister not feel that, with the non-proliferation treaty regime under considerable strain, it is a rather odd moment to reward&#151;by relaxing the guidelines&#151;a country which has never accepted the disciplines of that treaty? Would she not think it better to reward those who have accepted those disciplines by ensuring an internationally guaranteed supply of low-enriched uranium for their civil nuclear plants?
</p>




<p><a name="st_38"></a>
<a name="60424-02_spnew21"></a><b> Baroness Royall of Blaisdon: </b>   My Lords, this is an important, strategic time in our discussions with India. It is not, as such, a reward for India; it is a development of our policy towards India, which we believe will have, as do many of our partners, very many important international repercussions. We believe that this is a good time to grasp the nettle of negotiations with India, but that does not mean that we are diminishing in any way our intentions to achieve agreement with our other partners on elements of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
</p>

<p><a name="st_39"></a>
<a name="60424-03_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Archer of Sandwell: </b>   My Lords, if the nuclear weapon states complied with their obligations under the treaty, which were repeated two years ago, would <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_8"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 8</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that not be an important contribution to solving the problem? Would that not be a very useful lead in encouraging other powers to comply with the treaty?
</p>




<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="60424-03_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Royall of Blaisdon: </b>   My Lords, indeed that would be a very important element, but we believe that we must grasp every opportunity that we can to ensure that the nuclear non-proliferation treaty goes forward. At the moment, supporting the discussion and the proposal between India and the US is an element, but that does not mean that we should not pursue all those other avenues at the same time.
</p>




<p><a name="st_41"></a>
<a name="60424-03_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that despite the assurances of the Russians now, it was the Russians who gave India the cryogenic rocket motors, despite its promises not to do so some years ago? I hope that the Government will be wary of any Russian assurances on this issue.
</p>




<p><a name="st_42"></a>
<a name="60424-03_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Royall of Blaisdon: </b>   Yes, my Lords, the noble Baroness is absolutely correct. It is important to be vigilant in our discussions not only with Russia but also with our other partners. We shall continue to be vigilant on that matter.
</p>




<p><a name="st_43"></a>
<a name="60424-03_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   My Lords, I risk asking my noble friend a rather naive question. Perhaps she could put herself in the situation of Iran, which is surrounded by new nuclear countries such as Israel, Pakistan and India. Would she not agree that an Iranian Government might think it reasonable for them to develop their nuclear facilities to balance the countries by which they are surrounded?
</p>




<p><a name="st_44"></a>
<a name="60424-03_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Royall of Blaisdon: </b>   My Lords, it is not credible to compare India with Iran, although I understand where the noble Lord is coming from. While Iran is violating its existing IAEA obligations, India will be making new ones by allowing the IAEA oversight of parts of the Indian programme and seeking peaceful international co-operation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_45"></a>
<a name="60424-03_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that while undoubtedly India is a very close friend of this country, and one that many of us admire, it is a rather unfortunate lesson for other countries to learn that there are rewards for those who do not accept the existing international regime to control nuclear proliferation? Can she bear in mind that the repercussions for countries like Iran of applauding and approving the kind of development that we have just seen between the United States and India can be extremely serious?
</p>




<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="60424-03_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Royall of Blaisdon: </b>   My Lords, Her Majesty&#039;s Government are aware of the importance of the repercussions, as the noble Baroness puts it. However, I must emphasise that the potential agreement between the US and India&#151;and whether there is agreement within the Nuclear Suppliers Group&#151;is not just a bilateral agreement. It would have to be agreed by all members of the Nuclear <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_9"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 9</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Suppliers Group. Therefore, it is not just the UK taking a position on this; it will be an internationally agreed solution to a problem, and I believe we are going about it in the correct way.
</p>




<p><a name="st_47"></a>
<a name="60424-03_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </b>   My Lords, given the nuclear special relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States, can the Minister assure us that the United States consulted the British fully before the bilateral offer was made to India, or were we merely informed afterwards?
</p>




<p><a name="st_48"></a>
<a name="60424-03_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Royall of Blaisdon: </b>   My Lords, the UK has been in constant dialogue with the United States on this issue, but so have France and Russia. It is not solely a matter of discussions between the UK and the US. We are engaged in a multilateral decision-making process.

<a name="60424-03_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Baroness Andrews): </b>  My Lords, a timeline showing the key events and milestones leading to the introduction of home information packs on 1 June 2007 was published on 7 April. We have made it clear that all aspects of the pack need to be tried and tested through a dry run before the mandatory scheme is introduced. That will include an evaluation of each of the three phases of the dry run.
</p>




<p><a name="st_50"></a>
<a name="60424-03_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that Answer. Exactly how many inspectors&#151;that is those people with a special qualification to issue the home information pack&#151;are to be trained? How many have been trained? If the numbers trained are just right for when the housing market is booming, what else will these people be able to do when the housing market is quiet?
</p>




<p><a name="st_51"></a>
<a name="60424-03_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, at the moment about 4,000 home inspectors are already trained or are being trained, which is a good figure. The last time I reported to the House, before Christmas, the figure was 1,750. When we published the timeline and the date for implementation, people started coming forward in great numbers, particularly chartered surveyors. We are monitoring the situation, and we are confident that we can meet the required numbers, which are probably of the order of 7,000. We have reviewed that with our stakeholders recently, and we thought that the number should be in the range <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_10"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 10</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of 5,000 to 7,000. What will they do? I am sure that once they are established they will be more than occupied.
</p>




<p><a name="st_52"></a>
<a name="60424-03_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Sharples: </b>   My Lords, what will be the cost?
</p>




<p><a name="st_53"></a>
<a name="60424-03_spnew13"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, each training course costs about &#163;2,000, which is borne by the people choosing to train. The majority coming forward are chartered surveyors; behind them is a cohort of people with qualifications, for example, as estate agents. However, some people will choose to develop it as a new profession, and that will take a little more time.
</p>




<p><a name="st_54"></a>
<a name="60424-03_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Campbell-Savours: </b>   My Lords, what is happening with building-society acceptance of the survey report?
</p>




<p><a name="st_55"></a>
<a name="60424-03_spnew15"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, that is an important question. It is very important that this new procedure, which will make the business of buying and selling so much fairer and easier, particularly for first-time buyers, is understood by the consumer. The consumer organisations pressed us to do this. We have already started a campaign of talking to the stakeholders. A website has been established, and information is going out. As we move through the year, that campaign will be concentrated on consumers, with media advertisements and information to make sure that they have the fullest, most complete and most helpful information available.
</p>




<p><a name="st_56"></a>
<a name="60424-03_spnew16"></a><b> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that the Council of Mortgage Lenders has said that the ODPM has not done enough to assess the impact on the market that the home information packs will have? Does she not think that with a year to go that is something of a glaring oversight?
</p>




<p><a name="st_57"></a>
<a name="60424-03_spnew17"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, we have talked to stakeholders about how they think the market will react. There is no sense that there will be any massive disruptions. We are going to undertake a detailed market study in June and will monitor it in 18 months&#039; time. As I said, we are discussing possible impacts with stakeholders. We expect the packs to have a very positive effect overall, because of the improvement that they will make to the business of buying and selling.
</p>




<p><a name="st_58"></a>
<a name="60424-03_spnew18"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, if the Government discover, when they analyse the results of the pilot scheme, that this scheme will, all in all, substantially increase the costs of transferring properties, confirming the predictions that are currently being made, will they be prepared to abandon the scheme?
</p>




<p><a name="st_59"></a>
<a name="60424-03_spnew19"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, the notion that this will increase costs is not in line with what we, stakeholders or consumers believe. There are no new costs. There is a redistribution of costs from the buyer <br>&nbsp;<br>

to the seller, but people like first-time buyers will get the pack for free. Most sellers are buyers and will benefit in that way. In the course of the dry run, we are going to look at all aspects, from all points of view of all stakeholders, and we will make sure that we get continuous, iterative feedback. We will ensure that any changes that are sensible and necessary will be made.

<a name="60424-04_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   My Lords, on new costs, is the answer to the question that the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, asked not crucial? What is the position on building societies accepting the survey reports?
</p>




<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="60424-04_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, the Council of Mortgage Lenders has worked very closely with us at each stage. It is very important that we are on-side with them. We have never denied that there will be a need for a valuation, because valuations, particularly for higher loans, are important. We have said that the home condition report, with its solid information in an electronic format, with new ratings and an energy certificate, will make it easier for mortgage lenders to do the sorts of surveys that do not always require a site visit but can be done from the desktop or drive-by, which they are increasingly doing. That will make the business of evaluation swifter and, hopefully, less costly.
</p>




<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="60424-04_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Alton of Liverpool: </b>   My Lords, has the Minister seen the suggestion in today&#039;s newspapers that the cost of housing is likely to double again in the next decade? What hope does she hold out for first-time buyers, especially young people, who are desperately trying to get onto the home ownership ladder?
</p>




<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="60424-04_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, the first-time buyer is obviously in the most vulnerable position in the market. With 30 per cent of transactions falling through, we are wasting &#163;1 million a day. First-time buyers are right in the line for that. Having a system that enables them to discover the condition of the house that they are buying&#151;not down the line, but right up front&#151;will help them a lot. In our plans for expanding home building, we have in mind the first-time buyer&#151;the 30-year-old who will not be able to afford to buy a house in five years&#039; time unless we address those market inequalities.
</p>




<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="60424-04_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   My Lords, in the Minister&#039;s experience so far, who is drawing the packs together? Is it the estate agents who are trying to sell the house, or the legal advisors or solicitors involved in the sale or purchase? If it is independent bodies, who are they? Do they all charge fees?
</p>




<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="60424-04_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   My Lords, the home information pack providers&#151;essentially the estate agents&#151;will be responsible for bringing the packs together, and there is currently an association set up to provide that.

<a name="60424-04_head1"></a><h3 align=center>Procedure of the House: Select Committee Report</h3>



<p><a name="st_67"></a>
<a name="60424-04_spmin0"></a><b>The Chairman of Committees  (Lord Brabazon of Tara): </b>  My Lords, I beg to move the Motion standing in my name on the Order Paper. This report is mainly concerned with the Speakership of the House, and I will say a few words about that important matter. The report implements the House&#039;s decision, on 31 January this year, to approve the report of the second Select Committee on the Speakership, chaired by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick. It covers two main issues.
</p>

<a name="60424-04_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>First, on the process of election, your Lordships will see that what we propose follows very closely the now-familiar process for by-elections involving the whole House. The main difference is that candidates will require a proposer and a seconder. I should draw attention to the proposed timetable: polling day on Wednesday 28 June, with the result announced on Tuesday 4 July.
</p>

<a name="60424-04_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>Secondly, on the central issue of the Speaker&#039;s role in the Chamber, the Committee has done no more than to set out in the language of the <i>Companion</i> what the Select Committee recommended. In the proposed text on page 6 of the report, I draw attention to paragraph 2:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;The Speaker has no power to act in the House without the consent of the House&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60424-04_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>This is based on Standing Order 19, which the Select Committee recommended should be repealed. It makes it as clear as possible that the change in our Speakership will have no effect on self-regulation.
</p>

<a name="60424-04_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>The report also deals with the Speaker&#039;s role in Private Notice Questions. As it says, the House has already decided, on the basis of the Lloyd report, that the preliminary decision whether to allow a PNQ will be taken by the Speaker rather than the Leader. I beg to move.
</p>

<a name="60424-04_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>Moved, That the 3rd Report from the Select Committee be agreed to.&#151;(<i>The Chairman of Committees</i>.)
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_68"></a>
<a name="60424-04_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </b>   My Lords, I repeat that we regret that the Lord Chancellor of the day will no longer preside&#151;indeed, not even this afternoon&#151;over your Lordships&#039; House. It is entirely at his own request, however, and not our wish that that should happen. In this country we have never yet believed in the absolute separation of powers, otherwise Ministers would not sit in this House at all. We believe in accountability instead.
</p>

<a name="60424-04_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>However, the noble and learned Lord is not going to sit on the Woolsack and we are told that his successor may not be a Member of this House. So we must make alternative arrangements. We will have to have a number of debates over the next few weeks on various aspects of the change. Today&#039;s report deals with the least controversial matters and we support the Procedure Committee&#039;s recommendations.
</p>

<a name="60424-04_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>The electoral arrangements are similar to those that have operated satisfactorily for recent elections of hereditary Peers, as the Chairman of Committees has set out.
</p>

<a name="60424-04_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>The changes proposed to the Standing Orders and the <i>Companion</i> reflect decisions your Lordships&#039; House has already made about the future role of the Lord Speaker and follow the recommendations of the Selection Committee.
</p>

<a name="60424-04_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>As the noble Lord has just said, the position remains that, in future, the Lord Speaker on the Woolsack will do nothing without the consent of the House. Up until now this has been laid down both in Standing Order 19&#151;to which the noble Lord referred&#151;and is spelt out more fully in the <i>Companion</i> in paragraph 4.01.
</p>

<a name="60424-04_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>The Procedure Committee report does not refer specifically to Standing Order 19 but we regret its disappearance. It would be best to retain the Standing Order, suitably altered. But in any case the crucial paragraph 4.01 will remain in the <i>Companion</i>, as well as the new passage from the Procedure Committee report. So it will be very clear that the House remains self-regulating.
</p>

<a name="60424-04_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>The other proposal in the report is about introductions. The current arrangements do not allow introductions on Thursdays and that reflects our former practice of meeting at 3 pm on Thursdays. Now that we meet at 3 pm on Wednesdays and 11 am on Thursdays, it looks right to swap those two days over. Introductions will now take place normally on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays and not normally on Wednesdays. Now that we are&#151;at last&#151;to have some more introductions, this change is timely.
</p>

<a name="60424-04_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>I commend the Procedure Committee report to the House.

</p>

<a name="60424-04_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>Like my noble friend Lord Cope, I welcome the fact that the House is to remain self-regulating. That has been agreed and it is a very good thing.
</p>

<a name="60424-04_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>I welcome the change to Private Notice Questions&#151;a small matter at the end of the Procedure Committee report. There was much discussion on that matter in the Select Committee and it is a useful change.
</p>

<a name="60424-04_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>I would like to see many more Private Notice Questions in your Lordships&#039; House. They are very rare and generally occur only when a similar Question is being taken in the other place. I cannot remember the last time that a Private Notice Question unique to this House was accepted by the Leader of the day and duly asked and answered. I plan to table one or two once the new arrangements are in place. Let us hope that they become more frequent.
</p>

<a name="60424-04_para18"></a>

<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>Both the noble Lords, Lord Cope and Lord Trefgarne, not unnaturally regret the departure of the Lord Chancellor but, sadly, that is something that we have to get used to. It has been decided by the House on more than one occasion that we should proceed down the route of having a Speaker. We will remain self-regulating as we are now.
</p>

<a name="60424-05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Cope, said, there are at least two more debates to come on the issue of the Speakership. Some interesting amendments have already been tabled for the debate next Tuesday on the Speaker&#039;s salary and it will probably be a more lively debate than today&#039;s. However, that is for next Tuesday, not today, so I do not intend to say anything more about it.
</p>

<a name="60424-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>I did not mention introductions in my little speech but, as the noble Lord, Lord Cope, said it is a sensible move, and it will enable Peers to be introduced at eleven o&#039;clock on a Thursday morning, which they will be able to follow with lunch instead of having a curtailed lunch before their introduction. I hope that will be popular.
</p>

<a name="60424-05_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>On PNQs, I disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, when he hopes that there will be many more. In fact, the noble Lord is wrong because a PNQ was recently allowed by the Leader of the House. It was asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, on some aspect of a Home Office Bill within the past few months. I hope that reassures the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne. I commend the Motion.

<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>Clause 7 [<i>National Lottery Distribution Fund: apportionment</i>]:
</p>


<p><a name="st_71"></a>
<a name="60424-05_spnew0"></a><b> Viscount Astor </b>   moved Amendment No. 1:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>Page 5, line 13, leave out &quot;prescribed&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60424-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>The noble Viscount said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 1, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 3 and 14. The main aim of these amendments is to ensure that the Big Lottery Fund is officially established on the same footing as the other distributing bodies with the same amount of prescription by the Secretary of State. Amendment No. 1 removes the description of Big Lottery Fund expenditure as &quot;prescribed&quot;. Amendment No. 3 takes out Clause 7(3), which describes what prescribed expenditure is. That subsection states that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;&#039;prescribed expenditure&#039; means expenditure of a description prescribed by order of the Secretary of State&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60424-05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>which means that the whole of the 50 per cent of lottery distribution going to the Big Lottery Fund should be prescribed by the Secretary of State. That subsection also allows for the prescription of devolved expenditure. Amendment No. 14 attempts to establish the Big Lottery Fund on the same footing as other distributors.
</p>

<a name="60424-05_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>We debated these issues in Committee and at Second Reading. As your Lordships will remember, the original lottery distributing bodies were set up to comply with directions on matters to be taken account of when distributing lottery funds. The funds had to comply with directions relating to their management in terms of accounting, the delegation of powers, and so on. That was also how the Community Fund was set up by the Government when they changed from four original good causes, and how the Millennium Fund, which has come to an end, was set up. But when the New Opportunities Fund was set up by the Government, there was a greatly increased level of prescription. The New Opportunities Fund had to comply with directions from the Secretary of State on all matters including the distribution of grants. We always felt that it was entirely reasonable that the Secretary of State could tell distributing bodies what to consider when awarding grants, and intervene directly to correct mismanagement or unacceptable accounting practices. That was part of the original Act when it went through this House creating the National Lottery.
</p>

<a name="60424-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>The Government gave themselves a lot more powers over the New Opportunities Fund, however. The Minister has said on a number of occasions that they are backstop powers that will not be used, but when we make other suggestions, he says that there must be entire flexibility in these matters. Unfortunately, the Government cannot have it all ways on the Bill at the same time. The logic of their arguments does not stand up to scrutiny. It worries us because we know that when they originally looked at introducing the Bill, the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_16"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 16</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Government planned to create one distributing body&#151;a vast Big Lottery Fund, which would distribute all the lottery money. Luckily, that plan has been shelved, but it may have been shelved only for the moment&#151;who knows?
</p>

<a name="60424-05_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>The Government have, as we have heard before, broken their own rules on additionality. Indeed, almost everyone involved in the lottery has admitted that that has happened&#151;the only people who have not admitted it are the Government, but it is clear that it has happened. We know that from a recent reply to a Written Question from my noble friend Lord Howe about how money was awarded for projects affecting the health service. Until quite recently, the DCMS website used to highlight that the Government were investing &#163;2 billion of public and National Lottery money in sport by 2006. That has now been changed. It now says that &#163;3 billion is being invested in sport by 2006, coming from both the Government and the National Lottery. That is an improvement.
</p>

<a name="60424-05_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>The Government have given themselves much greater powers over the distributing body. They cannot argue that they need those powers over one distributing body rather than over the other two. The argument that they need it because it is bigger is not good enough. We ought to be talking in this Bill about principles. The principle should be that National Lottery expenditure should be additional. The Government should not be involved. We all know that there are problems when the Government are not involved&#151;that there are National Lottery projects that are turned down that we would individually like to support, and that some go through that we find somewhat objectionable. That is the nature of the system and we have to accept that that will always happen. At the same time, some projects are more successful than others. However, if we are to create an independent body which is independent of government, we will have to accept those aspects as being part and parcel of the process.
</p>

<a name="60424-05_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>I am afraid that the Government do not have a good record. They have interfered. They have encouraged the use of National Lottery money in ways that are clearly not additional. We find that there is no good excuse for the Government giving themselves these powers, which are over and above what was ever considered when the original National Lottery was established. They are powers that are greater than for the other distributing bodies. They are not necessary and it is not good enough for the Government to say that they are a backstop and a reserve. If the Government really felt that 50 per cent of the lottery funds in this country were being misspent, they ought to come back to Parliament with a new lottery Bill. That is why my amendments are necessary. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_72"></a>
<a name="60424-05_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   My Lords, we on these Benches agree with the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, that the Bill in its current form constitutes an unacceptable level of government control over funding from the Big Lottery. In Committee, the Minister talked of broad categories, high-level themes and a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_17"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 17</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

broad strategy, not detailed prescription. His final throw was a framework for the devolved administrations. However, we are not actually talking about the Government&#039;s intentions in the Bill but about the Government&#039;s powers in it and the possible exercise of those powers. That is the right way to look at the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60424-05_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>The concordance makes it absolutely clear that these are additional powers to prescribe in greater detail within the broad categories set out in Clause 22 as it would be amended. That is the big problem. Why does moving from some 33.3 per cent of the lottery proceeds to 50 per cent justify these increased powers? Nowhere, certainly not in Committee, has the Minister justified why that should be the case, so he has not explained the position properly. He has talked about the need for such powers of prescription in view of the money involved and so on. But in the previous 1993 Act, as amended, those powers do not exist for the New Opportunities Fund.
</p>

<a name="60424-05_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>I recognise that the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, who I am sorry is not in her place today, said that a light touch was in practice exercised by the Government. I do not believe that that is necessarily relevant in this case. Governments then did not have the powers they are giving to themselves in the Bill. That is essentially the concern of the voluntary sector, which is so well reflected in the amendment put before the House today.

<a name="60424-06_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to both noble Lords who have contributed to the debate, although I must say that I have not heard arguments today which are very different from those presented in Committee. Therefore, I am sure noble Lords will not be surprised that my response is very much along the lines of the response I made in Committee, if only for the purpose of consistency.
</p>

<a name="60424-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>Amendments Nos. 1 and 3, as the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, pointed out, seek to remove the Secretary of State&#039;s power to prescribe expenditure regarding the new Big Lottery Fund good cause; and Amendment No. 14, which I am pleased to see included in the group, would provide that the Big Lottery Fund must take into account rather than comply with any direction given to it by the Secretary of State.
</p>

<a name="60424-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>It was not just in Committee that these issues were discussed; there was intensive discussion in the other place. I recognise the strength of feeling on the other side of the House on these matters, but we also feel strongly that the concerns that have been expressed are unfounded. We have had a considerable time to consider these arguments since they were first voiced in the other place some time ago.
</p>

<a name="60424-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>Noble Lords are speculating on the powers in Clauses 7 and 14 and how they will be used. We think that we have taken out the issue of speculation because we have published an illustrative draft order and directions. We sent these out to all noble Lords interested in the Bill and of course placed them in the Library. It is open to noble Lords to be suspicious <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_18"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 18</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

about the Government&#039;s intentions, but suspicion is usually based on the fact that information is being withheld. I do not think that the Government could have been more open than they have been about how they intend to interpret this Bill if it becomes an Act in terms of the order and directions which we will employ.
</p>

<a name="60424-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>Every commitment that we have given, even those where the commitments are firmly on the record in this House or another place, are largely being disregarded. Therefore, I do not think it is for me to make a very long speech today against these amendments. Without the power to prescribe expenditure, the Big Lottery Fund would be given 50 per cent of all the lottery good-cause money to spend on anything that is charitable or connected with health, education or the environment without any further recourse to Parliament. I understand that the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, views this with complete equanimity. The Government disagree with him. We do not think that it makes sense.
</p>

<a name="60424-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>The large new spending area of health, education and the environment, which we created in 1998, has of course proved popular and successful. It has enabled thousands of worthwhile projects to be funded, including ones which have benefited more than 30,000 World War II veterans, war widows and carers. It has helped to provide more than 2,100 village halls and community buildings. The new Big Lottery Fund good-cause funding brings these areas and the charitable expenditure distributed by the Community Fund together, allowing an enormous range of projects to be encompassed. This is a good thing, and it is one of the main reasons why we wanted to bring the Community Fund and the New Opportunities Fund together. But it creates a very different kind of good cause from the existing arts, sport and heritage good causes. Arts, sport and heritage are much narrower areas, and the existing legislation narrows things further by prescribing sums to be distributed by different distributors. As I said in Committee, this not only limits who can spend the money, but restricts what the money can be spent on. For example, prescribing the percentage to be distributed by the UK Film Council in effect prescribes the percentage of money for the arts good cause that must be spent on film.
<a name="time_5"></a>
<a name="60424-06_time0"></a><h5>3.30 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60424-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>In 1993, Parliament took the view that such arrangements were necessary to ensure the effective distribution of lottery money. That degree of prescription has obtained in the lottery since its inauguration. The powers we are proposing in the Bill have a similar effect, and we believe that they are just as necessary now as they were in 1993. We need to be able to set out at the highest level the types of expenditure that the Big Lottery Fund should focus on. I emphasise that we are obviously talking about broad areas of expenditure. We are not talking about programmes or projects, or about the split between the four parts of the good-cause funding or between the four countries of the United Kingdom, and we are <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_19"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 19</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

certainly not talking about specific grants. We have made an illustrative order demonstrating how the power to prescribe expenditure will be used in practice.
</p>

<a name="60424-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>We could not be clearer about our intentions, and I fail to see what more we could do to assure noble Lords on the opposition Benches. Yet, to my knowledge, no one has found anything concrete to object to. I take that as evidence that the concerns we have heard so much about do not have much basis in fact. It was suggested in Committee that the Bill would give the Government more power over the Big Lottery Fund than was afforded over the New Opportunities Fund in the 1998 Act. I contend that that is simply not so. The 1998 Act limited the New Opportunities Fund&#039;s spending to initiatives specified by order by the Secretary of State. Those initiatives tended to be much more narrowly focused than the broad themes we are proposing for the Big Lottery Fund.
</p>

<a name="60424-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>I am in no way saying that the approach towards the New Opportunities Fund was wrong. Indeed, it was very successful. It provided a strategic focus for lottery funding, and had a much more prescriptive approach than the one we are proposing in the Bill for the Big Lottery Fund. The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, mentioned that my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley was not here; I regret that too. Oh! I am glad that she is present. She has considerable experience of these issues, and she made it quite clear in Committee that the New Opportunities Fund experienced no government interference in specific expenditure. I should also make it clear that the ability to prescribe devolved expenditure is central to devolving more decision-making to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which is the aim of the Bill. I am afraid that Amendments Nos. 1 and 3 would mean that the devolution arrangements in the Bill would not work. They would retain power for the Secretary of State just where the Government intend to devolve it. That seems somewhat ironic, given the Opposition&#039;s perceptions, which we have all heard, of the Secretary of State&#039;s excessive control. We cannot accept Amendments Nos. 1 and 3, and I ask noble Lords to consider not pressing them to a vote.
</p>

<a name="60424-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>Amendment No. 14 would require the Big Lottery Fund to take into account, rather than comply with, any direction given to it by the Secretary of State. All lottery distributors are required to comply with directions about financial and operational matters, which are set out in new Section 36E(3). Such financial directions incorporate financial controls designed to protect public money by insuring that distributors comply with basic financial and operational good practice. The requirements placed on the Big Lottery Fund by new Section 36E(3) are exactly the same as those placed on other distributors in Section 26 of the original 1993 Act, which set up the lottery. We do not see any reason for change.
</p>

<a name="60424-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>Section 36E(2) sets out the powers to issue policy directions. I emphasise that the powers have been drafted in the way that they have in order to bring together the different regimes of control that existed over the Big Lottery Fund&#039;s prior bodies, and to bring <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_20"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 20</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

them together in a coherent way. Both the Community Fund and the New Opportunities Fund had to comply with policy directions. The Community Fund, like other lottery distributors, was required to comply with any directions given to it by the Secretary of State as to the matters to be taken into account and to determine the persons to whom, the purposes for which, and the conditions subject to which it distributed the money.
</p>

<a name="60424-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>The key difference between that requirement and those set out in the present Bill is in the matters to be taken into account. A statutory requirement to comply with directions as to the matters to be taken into account is a real legal obligation. The Community Fund could not pick and choose which direction it complied with; it had to take all the policy directions into account and could decide to ignore them only under exceptional circumstances.
</p>

<a name="60424-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>This debate has therefore become overly focused on a narrow point, when the real issue is how the powers of directions will be exercised. We have given repeated commitments that we will adopt a light touch on direction of the Big Lottery Fund&#151;we said so in stages of the Bill in the other place, I said so in Committee in your Lordships&#039; House, and I reiterate the point today. We demonstrated our integrity with the issue of new interim policy directions for the New Opportunities Fund and the Community Fund. These directions are, as far as possible under the existing legislation, the same as those we will issue in due course to the Big Lottery Fund, and our intention is set out clearly in the illustrative directions that we have made available to the House and which we propose to introduce after Royal Assent.
</p>

<a name="60424-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>Both the interim and illustrative directions are very different from the type of directions issued in the past to the New Opportunities Fund, although those were also applied with sensitivity and consideration. They provide the means by which the funding outcomes and priorities agreed with the Government and supported in the Big Lottery Fund&#039;s consultation will be delivered. But they do not&#151;and I emphasise this point again&#151;prescribe how they should be delivered, or preclude other worthwhile priorities being funded. They will allow the fund full scope to make decisions on programmes, choose delivery mechanisms, identify partners and select projects informed by intensive public consultation.
</p>

<a name="60424-06_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>In conclusion, I hope we can focus on the real issue and put this matter to bed now once and for all. I hope that noble Lords will recognise that we are not being overly prescriptive; we are making it quite clear how these powers will be exercised and I hope that with that level of reassurance the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<a name="60424-07_spnew0"></a><b> Viscount Astor: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Davies, said that he was not being overprescriptive. In that case, he will not have much of a problem in accepting my amendment. But, of course, that will not be the case. He said that there would be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_21"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 21</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

no new arguments from the Government: I think that the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, and I can agree that we did not hear any new arguments.
</p>

<a name="60424-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>During the passage of this Bill, we on this side of the House have been grateful to the Minister for providing draft directions and draft orders. It has been enormously helpful for us to understand the Government&#039;s thinking. If we could have more of them, more Bills would have a smoother transition through your Lordships&#039; House. However, I am still trying to get myself around the interpretation of a &quot;transformational grant&quot;, as outlined in the directions, but I am sure that I will finally understand it.
</p>

<a name="60424-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>The Minister&#039;s defence against my amendment is simple: namely, that the Secretary of State&#039;s powers will set out at the highest level how expenditure will be made by the distributing bodies. The answer is that Clause 7 already does that. It sets out expenditure at the highest level. My amendment does not change that. It would delete &quot;prescribed&quot;. It leaves in,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;charitable, or      (ii) connected with health, or      (iii) connected with education, or      (iv) connected with the environment&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60424-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>The Minister said that this would not allow the Secretary of State to prescribe expenditure as it related to the devolved assemblies&#151;Scotland and Wales. The argument works both ways. Perhaps we should have an amendment to say how the Big Lottery Fund should hand out the money to devolved areas. Under this amendment, the Secretary of State would be allowed to say to Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland or wherever, &quot;Well, I am very sorry. You have had too much. We will not give you so much this year&quot;. I do not think that the Minister&#039;s argument can work for and against him. It works equally both ways. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, and I will discuss the issue before Third Reading.
</p>

<a name="60424-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>Whatever the arguments, the Minister cannot claim with any validity that this Bill does not give the Government greater powers. It is a matter on which we disagree. I must ask the opinion of the House.

<p><a name="st_75"></a>
<a name="60424-07_spnew1"></a><b> Viscount Astor </b>   moved Amendment No. 2:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>Page 5, line 18, at end insert &quot;, or</p>
</ul>
<p>

(v)   for the purpose of national acquisitions, as defined by the rules of the National Heritage Memorial Fund, such expenditure to be managed by the National Heritage Memorial Fund.&quot;&quot;

<p><a name="st_76"></a>The noble Viscount said: My Lords, this amendment concerns the possibility of a fund to support national acquisitions. Your Lordships will remember that in Committee I moved an unsuccessful amendment to return the lottery to supporting the original four good causes, which would have increased the amount of money going to the National Heritage Memorial Lottery Fund to 25 per cent. I also moved an amendment which would have enabled a fund to be set up for national acquisitions. That is a problem that the Government occasionally make noises about but have failed to come up with any form of policy on. This is my attempt to tease out of them some form of commitment that they will do something either now or in the future.
</p>

<a name="60424-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>The problem is that over time the government grant to the National Heritage Memorial Fund&#151;not the lottery part of it, but the memorial fund&#151;has declined from its highest level of &#163;20 million to &#163;5 million a year. That is the fund that enables the National Gallery, or institutions like that, to get a grant to fund or part-fund when objects may go abroad which the Export Reviewing Committee, which was set up by the Government, has recommended should stay in this <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_24"></a>

country. That happens more and more. Just last week the Culture Minister, Mr Lammy, placed a two-month export ban on a large silver plateau marking a British victory in the Anglo-American war of 1812. The ban provides the last chance to raise &#163;696,000 required to save that important antique. However, two months is a very short time to save that object or, indeed, any object. There is a problem.
</p>

<a name="60424-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>The lottery part of the National Heritage Memorial Lottery Fund is not able easily to fund acquisitions. It has already been criticised by the Government for having too much unspent capital. The Government say that lottery distributors should cut unspent funds. In many cases that is a good thing, but if you are trying to build up a reserve or an emergency fund, it is not terribly helpful.
</p>

<a name="60424-07_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>My proposal is simple: to allow money to be allocated from the Big Lottery Fund&#151;which, after all, is now taking the majority, the 50 per cent&#151;for the purposes of national acquisitions, as defined by the rules of the National Heritage Memorial Fund. The matter would be managed by the National Heritage Memorial Fund, so there would be no question of involving the Big Lottery Fund on a project by project basis in deciding who should get a grant. Under the rules of the National Heritage Memorial Fund it is clear that the measure would be applied only for objects of outstanding national importance, as defined by the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art, which is a government committee. My amendment seeks to set up a fund that is, in effect, ring-fenced for that purpose. Under the amendment, balances could be built up to enable the fund to be prepared to make acquisitions as we all know that certain collections in this country will be in danger in the future. The Treasury accepts works of art in lieu of taxes, but that measure is also cash-limited. Should a large number of objects come on to the market in any one year, either due to owners&#039; deaths or owners who wish to sell, the low ceiling of the Treasury&#039;s measure would be gone through very quickly.
</p>

<a name="60424-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>I hope that the Government will be sympathetic to the amendment in principle and will tell us how they seek to solve the problem. I accept that my amendment might not be the right way to do so or that it might not be well drafted. However, I hope that the Government will address the principles of the concerns that I have outlined. I beg to move.

<a name="60424-08_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Bonham-Carter of Yarnbury: </b>   My Lords, the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, has spoken rather modestly. We on the Liberal Democrat Benches fully agree with what he is trying to do. At present the funding of acquisitions seems to be a low, if not marginal, priority of the Government. Collections must not, and cannot, remain static. Back at the turn of the previous century, I believe that John Maynard Keynes, who then worked at the Treasury, recognised that it would be useful if money was allocated to buy paintings from the Degas sale that was taking place. Those paintings have formed an incredibly useful and essential part of the National Gallery&#039;s collection. At present it is difficult for bodies to find the money to <br>&nbsp;<br>

buy the paintings and so on that they need to build up their collections. Therefore, I fully support the amendment proposed by the noble Viscount, Lord Astor.
</p>




<p><a name="st_78"></a>
<a name="60424-08_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, on that last point I shall not dispute with the noble Baroness that there are extremely worthwhile possibilities in terms of the effects of the resources that are available for ensuring that we increase our very extensive art collections in this country. But the issue is not whether there are desirable forms on which expenditure should be made, but whether this is the right way to go about it. We had an interesting discussion in Committee on the desirability of making grants to purchase and conserve items for our national collection, and to preserve historic buildings. It is not the burden of the case that the Government disregard such important priorities; that is why the heritage fund is there. We recognise the importance of those elements in the cultural life of the nation, and I pay tribute to the way in which challenges have been responded to in that area.
</p>

<a name="60424-08_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>The Heritage Lottery Fund has made 451 awards for the acquisition of works of art and cultural objects by museums and galleries to a total value of &#163;135 million, and the overall success rate has been 86 per cent. It has awarded more than &#163;1 billion to the conservation of 9,500 historic buildings. The range of what has been supported is a checklist of a great deal of what is of value and interest to the cultural heritage of this country, ranging from Raphael&#039;s &quot;Madonna of the Pinks&quot; to the &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot; locomotive.
</p>

<a name="60424-08_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>Those are some of the big items, of course&#151;and very costly. But there have been many smaller ones, benefiting visitors to regional and local museums and galleries. It bears repeating for those who still feel that a new initiative, or a special fund, is required, that the Heritage Lottery Fund has given more than &#163;590 million, which includes conservation of cultural objects of national importance, such as 42 historic steam, diesel and electric locomotives and 58 ships and boats. We also need to bear in mind that even this wealth of grants from the lottery is not the whole picture. Grants made by the National Heritage Memorial Fund, which is supervised by the same trustees but funded by the taxpayer, have also contributed strongly in this field. Most of the &#163;220 million that that fund has provided in the past 26 years has gone in that direction, saving 1,200 iconic objects and places for the nation, including Tyntesfield House. Its annual budget will soon rise from &#163;5 million to &#163;10 million, which we all welcome.
</p>

<a name="60424-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>I recognise that the amendment is different from that tabled by the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, in Committee. He is to be applauded for his ingenuity and persistence on what we recognise as a good cause in terms of desirable expenditure. The amendment does not fix a percentage of funds. Indeed, it attempts not to take money from the Heritage Lottery Fund at all. It is still unnecessary, given the track record of grant giving that I have just described. The amendment is not only unnecessary; I am afraid that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_26"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 26</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I still find the concept objectionable. It brings the Big Lottery Fund into the equation, and tries to change the overall remit of the BLF to extend it to cover the heritage fund.
</p>

<a name="60424-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>The remit that we propose for the Big Lottery Fund is essentially about grants for community groups. More specifically, it is about health, education, the environment and charities. Of course there is bound to be overlap in, say, education and the environment, but it makes no sense at all to try to duplicate complete responsibility for supporting our heritage between two lottery distributors instead of one. If the aim of the amendment is to take money from charities, health and education to boost the money for acquiring works of art, the appropriate way to do that would be to propose a change in the percentage shares each cause will receive. We do not think that there is any need to change the shares.
</p>

<a name="60424-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>The Heritage Lottery Fund is already well able to assess competing needs and the opportunities out there to which they can respond; they are doing an excellent job. It may help your Lordships to know that the Heritage Lottery Fund recently brought together a preliminary meeting of the museums sector to discuss the existing mechanisms for providing financial support for acquisitions and whether additional support is needed. Another meeting is planned for June, and I understand that there is every likelihood that further improvements can be made to what are already good arrangements in the national heritage fund.
</p>

<a name="60424-08_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>What this amendment seeks to achieve does not help the situation at all. It would blur the lines, by creating difficulties in accountability, and it would require judgments outside the expertise of the national heritage fund, when it is surely better to recognise the excellent job done there and ensure that it has the resources to do that job. I am as one with the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, and the noble Baroness, Lady Bonham-Carter, in emphasising the desirability of expenditure on our national heritage. That is what the heritage fund is there for. Trying to create an acquisitions fund through the back door, by tackling the Big Lottery, is not the way to do it. I therefore ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_79"></a>
<a name="60424-08_spnew2"></a><b> Viscount Astor: </b>   My Lords, the Minister said that this would require judgments to be made outside the Heritage Lottery Fund. If the Minister looks at my amendment with care, he will see that is not the case. It enables the Big Lottery Fund to fund an acquisitions fund, and I clearly said in moving the amendment that all decisions on individual applications would of course remain with the Heritage Lottery Fund and not involve the Big Lottery Fund. I am sorry that the Minister did not take that into account in seeking to address my concerns.
</p>

<a name="60424-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>I can see that I will not make much progress with this amendment, which is a pity because with one hand the Government are encouraging distributing bodies to wind down their balances, meaning&#151;particularly when it comes to the National Heritage Memorial Fund, with its many long-term commitments&#151;that <br>&nbsp;<br>

they sometimes do not have money available to make quite large and rapid grants. As I have explained, there is often only an eight-week opportunity to buy something; it is then quite difficult to get through the application process. The Government are on the whole not addressing this problem, which is disappointing. At some point the Government will be forced to do so, when a major national collection runs the risk of going abroad and they will not have done enough to safeguard those interests. They will have to address the issue in the future.

<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="60424-09_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, in Committee, we had a debate closely related to this one. I said then that I thought the amendments reflect unwarranted concern about the Government&#039;s intention in respect of the proposed reserved power to reallocate an excessive National Lottery Distribution Fund balance from one lottery distributing body to another body. Amendment No. 4 would sabotage the concept behind the issue that we are tackling on balances. I emphasise again the assurance that I gave in Committee, which had been given repeatedly by ministerial colleagues in another place: the power will be used only as a last <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_28"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 28</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

resort against the distributor which stubbornly and persistently failed to manage its balance to a reasonable level.
</p>

<a name="60424-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>In Committee, both the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee of another place have concluded that the public benefit of lottery money is fully delivered only when that money is spent on projects in the community. There is no value to the community in large balances. Distributors have already made great progress in reducing balances. The overall balance has fallen from a peak of more than &#163;3.7 billion to less than &#163;2.2 billion now. Distributors which manage and set clear targets for balances, as all the main ones are now doing, will have nothing to fear from this power. The existence of the power will represent a discipline to ensure that this progress continues and will provide an added safeguard against a return to the days of very high balances which, as I maintain, are of no value to the community.
</p>

<a name="60424-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>We need a reserved power in case any distributor should, in future, build up an excessive balance and fail to tackle it. Noble Lords have expressed concern that were the Government to propose using the reallocation power to transfer a balance from, say, the Heritage Lottery Fund, there would be no other body suitable to accept the transfer. I remind the House that when the Government first introduced the National Lottery Bill in another place in the autumn of 2004, it included a reallocation power that would have enabled an excessive NLDF balance to be transferred not just from one distributor to another but from one good cause to another. Such a power would have enabled funds to be transferred, for example, from the heritage good cause to sport and the arts. It is because the Government were prepared to listen to the concerns expressed assiduously at that time by, among others, the heritage lobby, that Clause 8 of the Bill proposes a reallocation power that could be used to make transfers only within individual good causes. I hope that gives some reassurance to the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, as he was eyeing the power as a possibility for coping with the Olympic Games costs. I can assure the House again, as I have done within the framework of other debates, that of course the Government have fully costed the Olympic Games and are making provision to ensure that those costs are met through well identified routes. It is certainly not the intention that this power is used in those terms.
<a name="time_8"></a>
<a name="60424-09_time0"></a><h5>4.15 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60424-09_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>For some good causes, including heritage, there is only one distributing body. That does not provide a good reason to exclude these good causes from the reallocation power entirely. In the unlikely event that the sole distributing body for a good cause allowed an excessive balance to build up in the future, and that body failed to tackle it, the existence of the reallocation power would be justified.
</p>

<a name="60424-09_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>The proposed reallocation power provides a better solution than any that have otherwise been proposed, and better certainly than the powers in the 1993 Act, <br>&nbsp;<br>

which could reduce a body&#039;s long-term income stream as well as its balance. In our view, we have a better approach than existed in the previous legislation.
</p>

<a name="60424-09_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>The whole point of using the power would be to find another body to accept such a transfer and to use the funds more quickly than the transferring body, without sacrificing public value from the expenditure. If such a recipient body could not be found, the Government would not propose using the power.
</p>

<a name="60424-09_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>I want to emphasise those points and also to contend against the argument of the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, on Amendment No. 6, which would build in a specific requirement for the Secretary of State to consider the effects on a distributor&#039;s longer term commitments before exercising the reallocation power. We had this debate in Committee and I gave assurances that the Government would not use the proposed reallocation power in a way that would threaten any existing commitment.
</p>

<a name="60424-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>The burden of the noble Viscount&#039;s contention was that because the National Heritage Fund has existing long-term commitments, for reasons that we all fully understand, it needs that reassurance&#151;as does the noble Viscount, Lord Astor. I repeat that assurance now. The Government fully recognise the great public benefit derived for many long-term lottery projects in the past.
</p>

<a name="60424-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>I also pointed out the difficulty of interpretation that the amendment would create&#151;about what would constitute a threat to a distributor&#039;s long-term commitments. The Government would not, for example, accept that in every case a distributor needs to hold funds in its balance now to meet a commitment that is likely to fall due for payment in five years&#039; time. However, in the unlikely event that we ever propose using the reallocation power, the Government would take into account the distributor&#039;s existing NLDF balance, its likely future income from the lottery and all its forward commitments.
</p>

<a name="60424-09_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>I would like to reassure the noble Viscount on forward commitments. In other words, the Government would look at a distributor&#039;s in-principle commitments as well as its contractually binding, hard commitments. Depending on the interpretation of &quot;commitment&quot; in the amendment before us, it might have the effect of compelling the Government to take fewer factors into account if they ever proposed to use the reallocation power. I am sure that the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, would not want that result, which, I believe, would be the opposite of what he is seeking to achieve.
</p>

<a name="60424-09_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>I will repeat, because of its pertinence, what I said in Committee about the National Audit Office report on NLDF balance management, published in July 2004. The National Audit Office suggested that distributors should increase their forward commitments as the most effective means of reducing their balances in the long term. The Government are hardly likely to propose using the reallocation power against a distributor that had followed exactly that advice by making longer term commitments.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_30"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 30</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60424-09_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>I rest the Government&#039;s case on this matter. We only regard this as a reserve power, against a background that we want to emphasise clearly: balances are necessary to meet longer term commitments&#151;that goes without saying&#151;but balances as such are of no value to the community. It is right that we should have this reserve power where a balance might be excessive.

<a name="60424-10_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   My Lords, in the face of such an excellent team of right reverend Prelates here this afternoon, I hesitate to say that I was not as persuaded as the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones. The amendment is to add the phrase, &quot;such other persons as he&quot;&#151;the Secretary of State&#151;&quot;thinks appropriate&quot;, to the list of people that he shall consult on the reallocation of funds. If this had been expressed in objective terms, I might have seen that it had a point. Given that the amendment is expressed as simply adding that phrase, and that&#151;I think I am right in saying&#151;the Secretary of State, under this clause and any other such powers, is always entitled to consult whom he thinks fit, what does this add to the normal procedure? On the argument of the right reverend Prelate and the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, it would mean that we have to add that rather pointless subsection to every Bill.

<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>I owe the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Sheffield, a response to his amendment. He will recognise that at our preceding stage his colleague the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham, had pointed out that were the Government ever to seek to use the proposed allocation power, there might be other interested parties apart from the distributing body from which the funds were being transferred, the body or bodies intending to receive the transfer and the administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="60424-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>We accepted that there might be a wider range of interests. For example, Ministers for arts, sports and heritage would have a legitimate interest in the proposed use of reallocation power in their sectors. As I said in Committee, the wider sectors would have ample opportunity to make representation without this amendment. It is intended that any use of the proposed reallocation power would be subject to affirmative resolution, meaning that these matters would have to be debated subject to approval both in your Lordships&#039; House and in another place. The proposed use of the power would be fully within the public domain well before it could be implemented and consequently it would be possible for all to comment upon it. I hear what my noble friend Lord Borrie says when he regards this as otiose because the Secretary of State has powers to consult but it is at times important that we identify specific interests that need to be taken into account.

They are subject to parliamentary debate and approval. That should allay anxieties. It particularly allays the anxiety that any Secretary of State might have Pharaoh-like powers. Secretaries of State change over time, as we have noticed, and it may be that they do not have all have excellent memories or that they are not briefed on what their predecessors said. But there is a world of difference between Pharaoh&#039;s Egypt, where arbitrary decisions could be taken by the powers that be, and a parliamentary democracy where we have built into the legislation the understanding that there must be public debate about this issue before the power can be used. I am not sure that Pharaoh could have tackled Joseph on the basis of these procedures.

When one tables an amendment in your Lordships&#039; House, it is always interesting to see what happens and what lobbying one gets from outside. One is always quite surprised by what happens.

<p>

It is saying that because it spends its money quicker and faster than anybody else, it ought to be able, if necessary, to have a larger share of the interest. I find that bizarre. It seems to me that the CCPR ought to be seeking its fair share of the interest, not a larger share.
</p>

<a name="60424-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>We are not entirely clear why the Government need the power given by this clause to change where the interest goes. It is an issue that we discussed briefly in Committee.

<p><a name="st_98"></a>
<a name="60424-10_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Viscount for the terms in which he has moved the amendment. He will recognise that Clause 9 changes the way that income earned from the investment of the National Lottery Distribution Fund is divided between lottery distributors. We proposed changes to the method of allocating investment income because we considered that the existing method created an unintended advantage for distributors which hold high balances. Thus, potentially, communities were deprived of realising the benefits of lottery spending on the ground as fully and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_34"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 34</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

as soon as they might otherwise because of those high balances. The proposed changes will remedy that problem. They will mean that investment income on the NLDF balance will be shared out between distributors in the same fixed percentages as proceeds from the lottery operator, Camelot.
</p>

<a name="60424-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>As I pointed out in Committee, the new arrangements brought about by Clause 9 are consistent with our overall policy that there should not be a build-up of large balances, but that lottery proceeds should be delivering benefits on the ground as quickly as possible. That was the conclusion of the Public Accounts Committee of the other place in its report last October. The committee made it quite clear that the public benefit of lottery money is delivered when the money is spent in the community. I also repeat what I said in Committee about the proposed new arrangements being fairer and more transparent for all distributors. Under the new arrangements, distributors will have greater clarity about their share of the potential future income from the lottery.
</p>

<a name="60424-10_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>I recognise the concern that has been expressed about the impact on income to the heritage good cause. I recognise that it is possible to argue that there might be winners and losers in these arrangements. It is true that at present, the Heritage Lottery Fund holds a higher share of the overall NLDF balance than its share of operator-related proceeds to the fund. However, as the overall NLDF balance and distributors&#039; individual balances continue to fall, the new arrangements that we have proposed here will have less and less effect over time.
</p>

<a name="60424-10_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>The NLDF was never intended to be an investment fund built up of huge balances. Lottery money does good when it is spent in the community. It is unfair that good causes and distributors who spend lottery income more quickly&#151;for example in the sports and arts sectors&#151;should in effect be penalised by receiving a lower share of investment income because they have spent their income.
</p>

<a name="60424-10_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>I recognise that a balance must be struck here&#151;if I can use that term in this context. I understand the noble Viscount&#039;s anxieties. However, he will recognise that the concept behind Clause 9 is a worthy one. It is to ensure that money is spent most effectively. On the basis of that reassurance, I hope that the noble Viscount will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>&quot;Clause 11 will ensure that all lottery distributors can take part fully in the activities of the National Lottery Promotions Unit, which seeks to raise positive awareness of, and support for, the benefits of National Lottery good cause funding across the country&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 13/3/06; col. 1043.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60424-11_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>I do not think that anybody would disagree with that. It is only when you turn to the provisions of the Bill that any doubt arises. Clause 11(c) mentions,

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;encouraging participation in activities relating to the National Lottery in general&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60424-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>That is when doubts begin to creep in. Those words are very broad. It does not say &quot;encouraging participation in projects funded by the National Lottery in general&quot; or something more specific. It really does not reflect the Minister&#039;s assurance.
</p>

<a name="60424-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>Clause 11(c) makes it looks as though the National Lottery distributors could encourage participation in the National Lottery itself. That is what voluntary organisations are concerned about. They do not believe that this wording is sufficiently concise or precise to set out what the Government&#039;s real intentions are. This amendment clearly is a blunt amendment. It would be very helpful if the Minister could indicate whether, as the Bill proceeds to Third Reading, the Government will come back with a more concise amendment to that particular paragraph. There really is a great deal of ambiguity about the provision and it does not reflect the assurances that the Minister gave in Committee. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_101"></a>
<a name="60424-11_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, as the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, indicated, we had an extensive debate on this in Committee, and I appreciate his concern that this paragraph could be interpreted as empowering lottery distributors with the opportunity to encourage people to gamble. That is not the intention behind the paragraph. The promotion of lottery games is the business of the lottery licence holder. The reason we have the paragraph is to make it clear without any doubt that lottery distributors have the power to encourage people to get involved in wider events that promote the lottery good causes and spending on them, such as National Lottery Day and the National Lottery awards.
</p>

<a name="60424-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>The National Lottery Day is not designed to encourage participation in the lottery&#151;although I recall on two occasions the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, indicating that was how he conceived of it.

research that the public believe that they should be much better informed about where National Lottery money has gone. There is a substantial task to be fulfilled in informing people about how they approach the lottery for causes which they would want to see possibly supported by it and they want reassurance that the very substantial sums involved are well spent.
</p>

<a name="60424-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>The public are very pleased when they hear not only where the lottery money has been spent but also the reasons behind the expenditure.

We may be treated to that later this afternoon. We had that&#151;the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, will not mind me chiding him gently on this point&#151;when we were talking about funding for international expenditure. The only interest that the media managed to produce across this very wide range of international expenditure was for a tiny amount&#151;a few thousand pounds&#151;which was spent on an unsuccessful attempt to establish a guinea pig culture in a series of Peruvian villages. A fractional amount was spent on that project, to say nothing of it being a tiny amount of the overall expenditure on international matters.

<a name="60424-11_spnew3"></a><b> Viscount Astor: </b>   My Lords, the Minister is very kind, but he has tempted me to my feet and I am afraid that I cannot resist. I quite understand what he said, but perhaps he could deal with a point of principle that relates to what the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, said. A grant of almost &#163;30,000 was recently made to Manchester United, which has just been sold for, I think, almost &#163;2 billion, to keep its staff fit. I am sure that that is a thoroughly laudable thing to do. When the Sport England spokesman was asked about it, he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>&quot;We cannot and should not discriminate against a firm based on whether it is perceived to be wealthy&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60424-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>That rather confuses because, in light of what Ministers have been saying about who should receive lottery grants, surely distributing bodies should consider the assets of the institutions which are to receive the money before they simply hand it out.
</p>




<p><a name="st_103"></a>
<a name="60424-11_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the noble Viscount will realise that I was waxing rather more happily about the problems of Peruvian guinea pigs than about expenditure on Manchester United. It is an illustration of bad news driving out good&#151;an all-too-frequent experience, as we all know. Quite frankly, 3 per cent of the money which the regional sports board is spending in the north-west was directed to that project, so we are talking about some fairly minimal amounts. Sport England, not the Government, was responsible for that decision. I must say that the Opposition have used most of our debates at all stages of the Bill to tell the Government to stay out of these matters. It is a little ill for the Government to have to respond to a decision about Manchester United, which is always highly newsworthy.

<a name="60424-11_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>The intention was of course that employees should benefit from the drive towards an improvement in the health and fitness of employees at work&#151;objectives that I think we would all share. The problem is clearly whether lottery money should be spent on the employees of a company that should be able to provide for such an improvement in abundance. That is an entirely legitimate question, although it was not legitimately addressed to me for the reasons that I just gave. It has caused some reasonable concern, but I simply want to put it into context. Other employers, of course, are not as extraordinarily endowed as Manchester United. The project was to get employers involved in an area in which a very large number are shamefully neglectful.
</p>

<a name="60424-11_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>The criteria required the employers to make a submission. It might have been said subsequently that the criteria should have included the kind of resources commanded by the employers, but in fact they covered the numbers of people involved, their participation in such programmes and what would be done with the money. Manchester United made a convincing case. Sport England has assured us&#151;and we have looked into this as a consequence of this discussion&#151;that all 41 awards were made according to the relative merits of the applications received, and that the prominence of the applicants had nothing to do with the decisions. The noble Viscount may be asking why the Government did not intervene in a matter of public concern, but I am sure he would recognise that that would not be our line.

<a name="60424-11_spnew5"></a><b> Viscount Astor: </b>   My Lords, may I correct the Minister? I hope that he will not go away with the wrong impression. I would never get involved in any project or ask the Government to comment on any project. My question concerns the principle of Sport England saying that it should not take into account the relative wealth of those who were to receive the grants. It is a question of principle, really.

<p><a name="st_105"></a>
<a name="60424-11_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I hear what the noble Viscount has said.

This current short debate on what I regard as a trivial point&#151;although I recognise that the noble Lord has used an element of it to illustrate general principles&#151;is part of the public debate on how the various distributors go about their task.

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>I would like to reassure the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones.

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>What is interesting about the Minister&#039;s reply, which he clearly took great care in putting forward, is that by and large it is completely irrelevant. It relates to subsection (b) of that particular clause, almost entirely:

<br>
(c) the proportion of funding that has been allocated to bodies (other than public bodies or local authorities) whose activities are carried out not for profit.&quot;&quot;

<p><a name="st_108"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, at each stage of this Bill, one of the main areas of concern right across these Benches and the Conservative Benches has been the preservation of the principle of additionality and the best method by which this can be achieved. I do not intend to rehearse the arguments that have taken place both in this House and in the other place at various stages of the Bill, trying to elucidate what we mean by additionality.
</p>

<a name="60424-12_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>The Committee stage demonstrated that there is broad cross-party agreement on the need to adhere to this principle, even though, we must confess, there remains dispute over how it is best defined. Our concern on these Benches has consistently been that the Bill in its current form fails to safeguard the principle of additionality. We have been disappointed by the Government&#039;s resistance to all attempts to do so, both in the other place and in this House. Amendment No. 9 is a neat, convenient and practical way to ensure that attention is given by lottery distributors to the principle, yet it avoids the much-debated pitfalls involved in trying precisely to define the principle. For that reason, the word &quot;additionality&quot; does not appear in the amendment.
</p>

<a name="60424-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>In essence, the Government have reached agreement with the lottery distributors to report annually on additionality. We welcome the commitment from the Big Lottery Fund and the other lottery distributors to determine a policy and report on how they uphold the additionality principle. In the light of that, what were the reasons given by the Minister in Committee for refusing to enshrine those commitments in legislation?
</p>

<a name="60424-12_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>First, in Committee, the Minister stated that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>&quot;there is no need to require in the legislation that distributors report on how their decisions are independent of government. Distributors have always had that policy&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60424-12_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>But that is as far as it goes. There is no statutory obligation to ensure continuation of such a policy. The principle of additionality is of such importance as to warrant that it is safeguarded through statute.
</p>

<a name="60424-12_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>Secondly, the Minister said that it is,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;bad regulatory practice to increase the volume of legislation on the statute book by putting into legislation something that can be achieved by other means such as, in this case, a voluntary agreement&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60424-12_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>On these Benches, we are all in favour of avoiding unnecessary bureaucracy, but that is no answer to ensuring at least a degree of protection of future lottery funds from the politics of the day. A voluntary agreement is simply not enough. All sides agree on the central importance of the principle, which we should see enshrined in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60424-12_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>Thirdly, in Committee the Minister stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a>&quot;The wording, &#039;the distinction between core government expenditure and lottery funding&#039;, does not allow the flexibility for changes in ideas over time on what the Government should be funding&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 13/3/06; col. 1077.]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>But this amendment allows for flexibility. That is precisely the advantage of this practical approach compared with a definitional approach. As I said in Committee, this is not a straitjacket. In view of those arguments, I urge the Minister to rethink and include this vital amendment in the Bill. I beg to move.

</p>




<p><a name="st_109"></a>
<a name="60424-12_spnew2"></a><b> Viscount Astor: </b>   My Lords, my name is added to this amendment, which is the result of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, and myself considering carefully what the Minister said in Committee and trying to come up with a sensible compromise amendment. The Minister will remember that in Committee we moved an amendment asking the Government, in effect, to define additionality, which was resisted by the Minister, as it had been in another place, on the basis that to do so in legislation might create a lawyers&#039; paradise for arguments on how to define core government spending. A second amendment asked the Government to report on additionality. The Government resisted that on the basis that it was not their job and that they would end up having to define it again and that, again, we would be in a form of legal minefield.
</p>

<a name="60424-12_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>So we moved on. Very helpfully, the Minister said that the distributing bodies would report. As a result, we have received a helpful letter from the Big Lottery Fund, from which I shall quote because it is important. It states that it has,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>&quot;broadly agreed:</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>A common framework for reporting on additionality, which will comprise each Lottery Distributor&#039;s policy on additionality, including a common definition; how this informs the design of funding programmes and streams and how the concept is operationalised&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60424-12_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>not a very nice word&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>&quot;at grant giving level.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a>A common definition of additionality [is] as follows &#039;Lottery funding is distinct from Government funding and adds value. Although it does not substitute for Exchequer expenditure, where appropriate it complements Government and other programmes, policies and funding&#039;.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>Our Annual Reports should be the main vehicle for reporting on additionality&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60424-12_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>We agree with that and I think it is a very helpful statement from the Big Lottery Fund, supported by all other distributing bodies. As the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, said, we need a safeguard in the Bill. As the noble Lord said, it allows for flexibility in the definition. It leaves it up to the distributing bodies to report; we are not asking the Government to do anything, so I hope that the Government will, this time around, be able to accept our amendment. We have listened to the concerns put forward by the Government and I think we have addressed them. I think the Government ought to be able to accept these amendments. The Minister knows that there are concerns over additionality; this amendment would go a long way towards solving those problems.

<a name="60424-13_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Pitkeathley: </b>   My Lords, I really cannot see the necessity for this amendment, although I congratulate the noble Lords on bringing an amendment to address the dreaded question of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_41"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 41</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

additionality without mentioning the word. They are to be very warmly congratulated on that. The amendment also seems to aim to check what proportion of money will go the voluntary and community sector. It also seems to have another crack at limiting what is already, in my view, very limited government influence. It is, in other words, something of a catch-all amendment in trying to do all those things.
</p>

<a name="60424-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>It is unnecessary because there are already safeguards in place. We have discussed the independence of decisions about funding at length and have, I hope, established that those decisions are always taken independently by lottery distributors, including the Big Lottery Fund. As we have heard, the Big Lottery Fund and the other distributors are already pledged to monitor and report regularly on the question of additionality, as they are pledged to report on how they will carry out their publicly stated commitment to ensuring that the voluntary sector receives between 60 and 70 per cent of the total sum. If they did not do that we can be assured that NCBO and other voluntary organisations would soon shout loudly about it. There are very heavy requirements for reporting already on lottery distributors, especially the Big Lottery Fund; they are very willing to meet and extend these requirements. To require them to do any further reporting would, in my view, risk their spending too much time reporting and not enough doing what they were set up to do: distribute lottery money to disadvantaged individuals and communities.
</p>




<p><a name="st_111"></a>
<a name="60424-13_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Joffe: </b>   My Lords, this a rather gentle compromise amendment, imposing nothing on the Government, other than what it has already agreed to. It is just a question of reporting. This additional reporting would, I submit, bring transparency and clarity to the Bill, and has the potential to prevent misuse. For the reasons outlined by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, and the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, I support the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_112"></a>
<a name="60424-13_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful for the way in which the noble Lords who have pressed this amendment have addressed the issue. I agree that there is not a great deal between us. We have agreed that additionality should, in principle, be reported on. It will be recognised, as my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley so eloquently made clear, that the lottery distributors are prepared to ensure that they comment on this issue in their annual reports. I accept that the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, and the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, have produced an amendment without some of the more obvious parts to which I objected last time, particularly the word &quot;core&quot; in relation to government expenditure. Therefore I am much closer to them in the terms of the amendment.
</p>

<a name="60424-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a> I recognise the point that the noble Lord, Lord Joffe, makes. He is right to identify that there is not a great deal at stake at this present time, but it is still the case that we would be putting into the Bill a requirement to report. We continue to remain of the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_42"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 42</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

view that it is inappropriate to include a requirement for distributors to report on the amount of lottery funding that they award to not-for-profit bodies. The issue of not-for-profit is quite difficult, and it will not be easy for distributors to define it. For example, there is the problem of any grants that are made to social enterprises, because these often make profits but reinvest them in their services. Our policy directions to the other distributors all include that they should take into account the need to ensure that money is distributed for projects which promote public good or promote charitable purposes and which are not intended primarily for private gain.
</p>

<a name="60424-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>So we still think that this amendment has weaknesses, and we cannot accept it. With the existing measures that we have in place, to which my noble friend accurately referred, it is not necessary. But I recognise that the noble Lord feels so strongly about what I think is a marginal difference between us that he might press the matter. I do not think that that is necessary. If he will give me time to look at the matter further before Third Reading we shall do so. I cannot give him the assurance that I shall accept an amendment constructed in his terms, but we shall look at it and see if we can come out with a formula that bridges what I think is regarded in the House as a fairly narrow gap between the Government&#039;s position and his.
</p>




<p><a name="st_113"></a>
<a name="60424-13_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   My Lords, can I ask the Minister a direct question? Will he give an assurance that he will seek to bring back on Third Reading wording that reflects the undertaking that has been given by the Big Lottery Fund and the other lottery distributors about their reporting practices?
</p>




<p><a name="st_114"></a>
<a name="60424-13_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, that is a fair question. I can answer it categorically, yes&#151;and I shall look at the matter in the context of that framework.
</p>




<p><a name="st_115"></a>
<a name="60424-13_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that very constructive reply. Indeed, he was entirely correct that we would have pressed the amendment to a Division without that assurance. But the assurance that he has given us is very solid and points the way forward to the voluntary sector in particular being very satisfied that that will be in the Bill when we come to the end of the Third Reading in a few weeks&#039; time. With that assurance from the Minister, for which I thank him, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_116"></a>
<a name="60424-13_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Shutt of Greetland </b>   moved Amendment No. 10:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>Page 19, line 8, leave out &quot;12&quot; and insert &quot;20&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60424-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this series of amendments addresses the regional dimension. I referred to this at Second Reading and again in Committee and I return to it today. Why? Well, first, regionalism worked with the Community Fund, and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_43"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 43</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

this is going backwards. It is even part of the strapline of the Community Fund, which is a decentralised organisation working in every part of the UK.
</p>

<a name="60424-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>Secondly, administrative devolution is to remain. We have been told that there are to be regional offices all over England, but regional governance is missing. Thirdly, there is no evidence that there has been any failure with the Community Fund under the existing structure. Fourthly, there is a concentration of power concerning well over &#163;600 million. I believe that it is wrong to have such concentration of power in so few hands and that we should devolve that power within England. Fifthly, if the system is good enough for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and, indeed, for the Isle of Man, Guernsey and Jersey, it is good enough for the English regions.
</p>

<a name="60424-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>I listened at the time and have had a chance to reflect on what the Minister said to me. At Second Reading I referred to the committee of the Big Lottery Fund being out of balance. Of its 17 members, three are from Northern Ireland, three are from Wales, three are from Scotland&#151;indeed, one of the English members arrived from Scotland only in 2004&#151;and all but two of the English members represent London and the south-east. At Second Reading the Minister said to me:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>&quot;The noble Lord also mentioned the issue of representation. We are in an interim stage at the present time. The current arrangement is a temporary measure, and we intend to provide for the final Big Lottery Fund board to have 12 members: one member each to represent England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the other members general UK members. I think that addresses what he regarded as somewhat over-representation of the communities of the United Kingdom and the under-representation of the regions of England&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 6/2/06; col. 500.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60424-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>But the more I ponder that, the more I think that is the problem. Normally, when you get temps in, you do not make principles and policies. We have been told that the 17 are temps and that eventually we are to have 12 members, yet they are laying the plans. I am afraid that that has been the problem.
</p>

<a name="60424-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>In Committee I considered the regional dimension again. The Minister said to me:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;Devolution to the regions of England is of course a different matter. While it is often a good thing for policy reasons, as the noble Lord will recognise, because he knows how much we have enthused about aspects of regional policy in this Government, there is no statutory framework&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60424-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>But that is why we are here. This is a Humpty-Dumpty Bill in that the Big Lottery was set up in 2004 and we are only now legislating for it, but legislation can make a statutory framework.
</p>

<a name="60424-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>The Minister continued:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>&quot;We believe that decisions on how best to ensure that there is an English regional dimension to its work are best made by the Big Lottery Fund itself&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60424-13_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>But that Big Lottery Fund has been set up so that that does not happen. The Minister further said that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>&quot;the fund has decided it will not have general English regional committees. English programmes will be national&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 13/3/06; col. 1091.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_44"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 44</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60424-13_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>My view is that it should be for Parliament and not the fund to decide that. I shall refer later in detail to the fund and its decision-making, but in my view it is for Parliament to decide whether that should be the case.
</p>

<a name="60424-13_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>The Minister further stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>&quot;I hope the noble Lord will recognise that we have not ignored the regional element with regard to the structure of the fund, but we think a small focused fund concerned with strategy is right&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 13/3/06; col. 1092.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60424-13_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>But this is not a small, focused fund; it is a huge fund. It has huge sums of money with a variety of programmes. Of course, committees are lined up for Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland.
</p>

<a name="60424-13_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>It is easy to give crumbs to the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey. Perhaps the civil servants assisting the board do not mind too much because it involves only a tiny sum of money relative to the whole, which would be excluded from their powers.
</p>

<a name="60424-13_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>I shall now consider the temporary board and its work. It these days of openness, the temporary board has placed some of its minutes and agendas on the internet. For example, five of the board agendas from October 2004 to May 2005 and eight of the minutes are on the internet. For some reason October 2004 is missing, but they go up to January 2006. March 2006 has not yet arrived on the internet, but I am not complaining particularly about that.
</p>

<a name="60424-13_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>I have no idea how many meetings were held prior to October 2004. There is reference to a meeting in September 2004, so clearly the board met earlier. The Minister said in Committee that the fund had decided that it would not have regional committees. I have been through all the minutes and see no reference other than one at minute 19.4 of 16 November 2004, which states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>&quot;It was commented that, during discussions, very little mention has been made of the English regions and their needs&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60424-13_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>So it remained. There is no information at the next or any other meeting. I have looked carefully through the minutes. In March 2005, minute 24.8(d) states


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>&quot;that the Board should debate the role of the Country Committees in the context of the Big Lottery Fund as a UK-wide organisation before the re-introduction of any draft legislation&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60424-13_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>The board was clearly interested in the legislation&#151;and the issue was picked up again on 17 May, but there was still no reference to the English regions. It then decided to look at the committee structure. It got three from Northern Ireland, three from Wales, three from Scotland, one from England and the chairman and the vice-chairman to look at the structure. Is it any wonder that discussions got nowhere when there is no vested interest for the regions of England?
</p>

<a name="60424-13_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>On 19 July 2005 the chair highlighted the considerable officer time and effort involved in preparing the Committee stage of the Bill. There may have been officer time, but there is no reference in the minutes to the board considering the Bill or anything about the regions of England. The board was asked to note the report. One concludes that any work that has been done in this area has been done by lottery servants, not the board.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_45"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 45</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60424-13_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>Eventually on 15 November 2005 the board considered the country committees, and decided that it will have a committee of five in Northern Ireland, a committee of 12 in Scotland and a committee of six in Wales. England awaits. It clearly struggled with England, but eventually it decided on 17 January 2006 that there would be a committee of 10 in England. The board then scratched its head and thought that it had better have a committee of 10 in Scotland as well, as it could not have 12.
</p>

<a name="60424-13_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>It has placed eight separate sets of minutes on the internet, and it is clear that there has been no consideration of the English regions. It seems to me that that temporary committee has not been suitable for the purpose of looking at what is right for the regions of England. Indeed, it is not surprising in those circumstances&#151;seeing that the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, is present&#151;that they had a splendid Barnett formula carve-up of resources which, at a later stage, they reaffirmed.
</p>

<a name="60424-13_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>To conclude, the Minister says that it is not in the legislation. But that is why we have come; to make legislation. The Minister says to me, &quot;It&#039;s up to the Big Lottery Fund. They can make their own arrangements&quot;. Well, they have not done so, not being set up or equipped to look at the English regions. We can and we should. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_117"></a>
<a name="60424-14_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Pitkeathley: </b>   My Lords, I must disagree with the noble Lord about the Big Lottery Fund not considering the English regions. It is clear that they will have a strong regional presence with offices in nine English regions, whose primary role will be outreach work, and a national committee for the Reaching Communities programmes. Generally, the needs of the English regions will be looked at in considering all of the different programmes&#151;some of them wide and strategic&#151;that the fund is going to pull together. It also, for example, has ring-fenced funding for certain areas.
</p>

<a name="60424-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>So, while it may not be apparent from the minutes, I know from my dealings with colleagues in the Big Lottery Fund that they have given quite strong consideration to regional elements. No one would dispute that that is entirely right; there should be a strong regional presence. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, is actually talking about regional decision-making on funding. I suggest that that has problems, though it is a beguiling thought. The Community Fund had many problems with it in practice, in terms of costs and inconsistent decision-making, and the dissatisfaction with that. I submit that the arrangements that the BLF is making to consider the needs of English regions are adequate and will become even stronger as their programmes roll out.
</p>




<p><a name="st_118"></a>
<a name="60424-14_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, for the way in which he presented this amendment&#151;although it is expressed in similar terms to the amendment that we had in Committee and the debate that we had then. I appreciate that he raises some interesting questions about the way devolution is reflected in the plans for <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_46"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 46</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the Big Lottery Fund, about the dynamics of the board and about the way in which grants will be distributed. I am also grateful to my noble friend Baroness Pitkeathley for identifying to him some of the difficulties which might occur if his amendment were to become part of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60424-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>I listened to the noble Lord&#039;s arguments carefully but I have not changed my position, which I have no doubt that he will regret. The Bill currently provides for 12 board members, four of whom are appointed to represent the interests of parts of the United Kingdom. Those representatives will have an important part to play in chairing committees that will oversee devolved expenditure in the four parts of the United Kingdom. The National Lottery is, of course, a reserved matter; however, the areas covered by the Big Lottery Fund good causes&#151;health, education, the environment and charities&#151;have all been devolved. We have reflected that in the Bill. By creating the concept of devolved expenditure and providing for the committees to oversee spending, it ensures that decisions will be taken by those best placed to make them.
</p>

<a name="60424-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>As I said in Committee, devolution to the regions of England is a rather different matter. It raises the difficulties to which my noble friend Baroness Pitkeathley gave voice. Desirable as it might be for a whole host of reasons&#151;and nobody is better equipped to identify them than the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, or to make the case for them with his usual forceful clarity&#151;there is no statutory framework as there is with devolution to the countries of the UK. He will recognise that factor and, because of it, there is no specific provision within the Bill to reflect it. We believe that decisions on how best to ensure that there is an English regional dimension to its work are best made by the Big Lottery Fund itself. Why should the Government force a particular model on the fund? How would that sit with the concerns expressed today, and even more intensely in Committee, about the overall degree of government control of the lottery?
</p>

<a name="60424-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>I have concerns about increasing the size of the Big Lottery Fund board so drastically. It is a fairly substantial change that noble Lord, Lord Shutt, is recommending. The fund needs a UK board that is small and focused enough to provide a real strategic focus to its work. Having nine English regional appointees, as well as the four national-interest appointees, would risk creating a sort of mini-parliament rather than a coherent board.
</p>

<a name="60424-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>When the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, spoke equally forcefully in Committee, he made the point that the Community Fund had English regional committees, whereas the New Opportunities Fund did not. He reiterated that point today. He saw that as evidence of a New Opportunities Fund takeover. I do not accept that at all. The Community Fund had no statutory duty to set up English regional committees; it chose to do so as the most effective way to operate. It is entirely open to the Big Lottery Fund to act similarly. We believe that that is a decision for the fund itself; it is not a decision for the Government to make and to put on the face of the Bill. The Big Lottery Fund, of course, will operate in a somewhat different way from the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_47"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 47</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Community Fund and the New Opportunities Fund. Sometimes the focus will be at national strategic level and sometimes at regional or even local level.
</p>

<a name="60424-14_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>Against that background, I understand that the Community Fund and the New Opportunities Fund, operating as the Big Lottery Fund, have decided against general English regional committees. They are in that position at present. The fund has said that it will have English regional representation on the national committees for individual funding programmes where that is appropriate. For example, its Reaching Communities programme will have representatives from each of the nine English regions because it is seeking to be in close contact with the regions. That will allow for regional perspectives to be brought into the decision-making process. The noble Lord will recognise that decisions are being taken that increase the regional dimension. The fund will also have a regional office in each of the English regions, whose primary role will be outreach work. The offices will spend time gathering regional intelligence, which will be fed into the assessment process.
</p>

<a name="60424-14_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>I hope that the noble Lord will recognise that the regional dimension is not being ignored. Where appropriate, arrangements will be made. We should leave the Big Lottery Fund to take up the decisions as appropriate, which has been the case in the past, but we cannot agree that we should put on the face of the Bill a rigid structure that, as the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, indicated, would in his terms advance the regional dimension, but might be crucially at the cost of the effectiveness of the overall strategic role which the fund has to fulfil. Of course, we have met the devolution dimension as regards the four countries of the United Kingdom. That is as far as we can reasonably be expected to go in legislation. I hope the noble Lord will consider that an adequate reply.

She said that there were problems with the Community Fund, and that is the first time that those words have been uttered in this House. In Committee, I invited the Minister to say whether there had been any problems and none was offered. In Yorkshire, all I have heard is tremendous respect and support for what that regional committee, which was responsible for the Community Fund, did in Yorkshire.

<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>If it is the Big Lottery, it can have a big board. I do not believe that a board of 17 or 20 makes any difference; it is still on the large side. Plenty of organisations have a board of that size; a board of 20 is not overwhelming. The problem is that the 17 have been chosen&#151;no doubt chosen for good motives regarding representation from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland&#151;but, bearing in mind the metropolitan nature of the English people who were chosen, only two could be said to be provincial in English terms. Therefore, there is not a sense that that <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60424-14_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>The other important point is that the Minister says that the board have decided against, but there is no evidence whatever that proper consideration has been given. The only minute is that which says:

<a name="60424-15_spnew0"></a><b> Viscount Astor </b>   moved Amendment No. 15:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a>After Clause 19, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_3"></a><br>
 &quot;REPORT OF INTERNATIONAL EXPENDITURE

<br>
 In section 34 of the National Lottery etc. Act 1993 (c. 39) (annual reports by distributing bodies other than Millennium Commission) after subsection (2) insert&#151;


<br>
&quot;(2A) The report shall set out any awards made during that year for projects outside the United Kingdom.&quot;&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_121"></a>The noble Viscount said: My Lords, in Committee I moved a similar amendment, because I was unable to discover by looking at the Community Fund website the nature of its grants to international projects. The information that I did discover was confusing and contradictory.
</p>

<a name="60424-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>The Minister has been very helpful since and has sent me an accurate summary of the grants that have been handed out from 1997&#150;98 until last year. Indeed, in his letter he wrote that he would like to clarify that the Community Fund already includes details of its international grants programme in its annual report and that the Big Lottery Fund will continue to include it in future reports.
</p>

<a name="60424-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>I have also had a letter from the Big Lottery Fund, saying:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a>&quot;I can assure you that we will report clearly&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>


</p>

<a name="60424-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>I am grateful for that, because the report that came out of the Community Fund was far from satisfactory. I am going to move this amendment to allow the Minister to repeat that assurance, and I assure the <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="60424-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>I confess that I am sorry about the difficulties of the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, with the figures and that he has identified some inconsistency. I am afraid that the annual report can only provide a snapshot at the time of expenditure. The amounts paid out may vary slightly from the awards made, for reasons that all of us would recognise with such grants. There are some minor difficulties with the accounts, but, as the noble Lord, Lord Joffe, indicated, not such as to occasion great anxiety about the way in which these programmes are managed.
</p>

<a name="60424-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>I want to give the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, the assurance that he seeks&#151;these figures will be carried in the annual report as accurately as they can be made at the time. We have nothing to hide. The lottery has nothing to hide. The one case of some anxiety that we discussed in Committee did not have too much substance. With that, I hope that the noble Viscount will think that I have given him the reassurance required.

<a name="60424-15_spopq0"></a><b> Viscount Montgomery of Alamein </b>  rose to ask Her Majesty&#039;s Government whether the new European regime for the import of bananas is in the best interests of the United Kingdom.
</p>

<a name="60424-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>The noble Viscount said: My Lords, we move to the vexed question of bananas. I am extremely grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Grocott, the government Chief Whip, for allowing me time for this debate in a crowded programme; and to the noble Lord, Lord Bach for making himself available to answer it.

<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>As this is an Unstarred Question, I have no right of reply, so I thank the various noble Lords who will speak in this short debate. Not all of them are quite here at the moment because it is taking place rather earlier than expected, but no doubt they will turn up. Some of the key figures are here, however. I have taken a few soundings in advance, and know that all the speakers will disagree entirely with what I am going to <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 50</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

say. That is not an unusual state of affairs. I have been interested in the issue of bananas for a long time, and have always irritated the Front Bench of the day about it. I am returning to an issue which I used to pursue in the 1980s and 1990s.
</p>

<a name="60424-15_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>The dispute over the tariff for banana imports into the EU has not yet really been resolved. It goes back 13 years to the early 1990s, when the EU decided to regulate the market for imports. This regulation comprised a complex system of quotas, tariffs and licences designed to protect former colonies in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific&#151;known as the ACP territories&#151;against the Latin American bananas coming from what the Americans call the most favoured nations, or MFNs, referring to the Latin American producers in central and south America.
</p>

<a name="60424-15_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>Following a great deal of agitation from Latin America, led by Ecuador for south America and Costa Rica for central America, the WTO decided, quite rightly, that the EU system went against the principles of free trade. As part of the solution, it was agreed in 2001 that a tariff-only system of import controls should be put into effect from 1 January this year. Meanwhile, various interim measures were introduced which allowed the ACP countries to continue with a zero tariff for 750,000 tonnes per annum, and for Latin American bananas&#151;which account for 60 per cent of EU imports&#151;to pay &#8364;230 per tonne, as against the &#8364;75 originally agreed. Not surprisingly, as I am sure noble Lords will appreciate, the Latin American countries objected and, last year, a series of arbitrations ensued which tended to agree with the Latin American view. This has so far merely had the effect of reducing the Latin American tariff to &#8364;176 per tonne, while maintaining the zero tariff for the ACP quota. I have to admit that that does not seem fair, and I do not see how anybody could argue that it is.
</p>

<a name="60424-15_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>At the WTO summit in Hong Kong last December, the EU appointed the Norwegian ambassador to use his best endeavours to resolve the problem. There, as far as I know, the matter more or less rests, although I believe that there have been various interim measures in an attempt to protect the ACP countries&#039; trade. So, once again, we have the EU, principally led by France, operating in a protectionist mode against the interests of consumers in general and, of course, Latin American producers in particular. &quot;Free trade&quot; means&#151;or should mean&#151;what it says. Indeed, the main purpose of the World Trade Organisation is to ensure that this happens. Unfortunately, so far it has not.
</p>

<a name="60424-15_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>The case for the ACP subsidy is usually based on the notion that if the small islands cannot produce bananas competitively they will turn to drugs. This is a specious and ridiculous argument at any time, since the production and illegal trading of drugs will always be infinitely more profitable than almost any other crop in the world. That is not a substitute for bananas. It would be the wrong kind of substitute. I am sure that there are other things that can be done in the Caribbean if necessary to support their industries and <br>&nbsp;<br>

people. That is up to the individual countries concerned, but it should not be imposed on the world in general.
</p>

<a name="60424-15_para13"></a>

<a name="60424-15_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </b>   My Lords, I apologise to the noble Viscount for missing the first few seconds of his speech. The House got on to this debate very early and I was in Committee a little way away. I hope he will forgive me. However, I did hear the main part of his speech.
</p>

<a name="60424-15_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>It is over 15 months since we last debated this subject on a similar Unstarred Question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Newby. I am delighted to see him in his place. I was going to say that I was the only person to have spoken in both debates, but I assume that the noble Lord is standing in for the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, so he and I will be veterans of both campaigns.
</p>

<a name="60424-15_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>I declare the same interest that I did on that occasion. I was vice-chairman of the All-Party British-Caribbean Group, and an adviser over 25 years to the Fyffes Group in my business life before I joined your Lordships&#039; House seven years ago. It is also relevant to report that I paid a visit to the banana growers of St Lucia in the Windward Islands under the auspices of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in May last year.
</p>

<a name="60424-15_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>The noble Viscount said that he would probably be a lone voice putting forward his point of view. I cannot speak for anyone else who will take part in this debate, but his surmise about what I am going to say is absolutely right. I speak as a friend of the Caribbean, which has been treated shamefully by the World Trade Organisation, the multinational Latin American banana exporters, and particularly the United States Administration.
</p>

<a name="60424-15_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>To some extent I exempt from this criticism the EU Commission, which has attempted to maintain a tariff structure which would give some protection to the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries which supply bananas to the European market. It was not its fault that the United States mounted trade sanctions against Europe at the behest of its multinational companies, which have substantial interests in Latin and south America even though not a single banana is grown commercially on the US mainland. As a result of attempting to accommodate the multinationals&#039; bullying, the EU has tried to compromise with a new banana import regime, which&#151;as often happens with so many compromises&#151;satisfies virtually no banana-exporting country, whether Latin American or ACP.
</p>

<a name="60424-15_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>What we are stuck with now is a flat-rate tariff with no limit on import volumes, and preferential access for 775,000 tonnes of ACP imports. The EU had to agree to a tariff-only system as the price of ending the dispute in the WTO. But it said at the time that the new single <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_52"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 52</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

tariff was intended to have the same effect on the market as the system of tariff quotas that it would replace. The system could have worked if the level of tariffs on imports from Latin America&#151;the so-called most favoured nation suppliers&#151;was set high enough to prevent the European market being flooded by bananas priced at such low levels that the ACP exporters could not compete with them.
</p>

<a name="60424-15_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>Originally the Commission said that the single tariff should be &#8364;230 on all MFN imports with no quota limit. This was thrown out in arbitration and a second proposal of &#8364;187 was put forward. The arbitrator refused to agree to that, saying that the Commission had not demonstrated that &#8364;187 would meet the required criteria. The Commission off its own bat then fixed the level at the still lower amount of &#8364;176.
</p>

<a name="60424-15_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>When I was in St Lucia last year, I asked the banana farmers and their representatives whether they agreed that the original figure of &#8364;230 would have been of sufficient value to keep them in business. Not one of them did. The banana growers who I met believed that a significantly higher level of tariff, perhaps as much as &#8364;300 per tonne, was required to prevent retail prices for bananas in Britain falling to levels that would make it uneconomic for them to continue to supply the market. Therefore, we can imagine how far &#8364;176 falls short of what is required. The farmers told me that their return has been falling steadily over recent years, not least because the cost of their inputs, particularly fertiliser derived from oil, has risen but the retail price of bananas in Britain has been falling steadily. It has fallen by 25 per cent in the past three years as a natural consequence of a world over-supply of bananas. The Windwards are, of course, treated less favourably than their immediate neighbours, Martinique and Guadeloupe, which, as overseas <i>depart&#233;ments</i> of France, qualify for deficiency payments from the EU. Often they amount to over half their total returns.
</p>

<a name="60424-15_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>In the debate in your Lordships&#039; House on 14 January last year, my noble friend Lord Evans of Temple Guiting, replying for the Government, suggested that diversification could be part of the solution for the Windward Islands. I discussed that with a number of the people I met, and it was clear that the scope is pretty limited. St Lucia operates a zero-tolerance policy towards drug production and trafficking, but there is worrying evidence elsewhere in the region that the ease of growing ganja creates just too great a temptation for some poor, previously banana-dependent island economies. I take issue with the noble Viscount, who said that that is just tough and they must try to do something else. I should say that the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, who cannot take part in this debate, was particularly keen that I should make this point about the risk of drug-growing as the alternative to bananas if the banana industry is damaged.
</p>

<a name="60424-15_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>It is clear that the islands&#039; economies face catastrophe if any new EU banana regime effectively excludes or severely reduces fruit from traditional ACP sources. This is not scaremongering or crystal-ball gazing. There are already worrying signs that since the new EU banana regime started on 1 January, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_53"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 53</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

imports from Latin America are up by over 6 per cent, despite some supply problems caused by bad weather. Only last week the online news service for the fruit and vegetable trade&#151;freshinfo&#151;reported that the new regime had brought Guatemala back into the EU trade after several years&#039; absence with the arrival of 113,712 boxes of Lola-branded fruit into Rotterdam. That was the first instalment of 8 million cartons of bananas which will come to the EU this year. Not surprisingly, this is upsetting exporters from Ecuador as Guatemala and, indeed, Brazil are undercutting their prices by some &#8364;3.50.
</p>

<a name="60424-15_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>Faced with this, it is hard to see the traditional Caribbean growers even getting to the starting line, and the situation would be even worse if the lobbying from Latin America to get the tariff even lower were to succeed. To go back to the terms of the noble Viscount&#039;s Question, how can the new European regime for the import of bananas be in the best interests of the United Kingdom if it produces the destruction of the banana-growing industry in Commonwealth countries&#151;with which we have the closest ties&#151;the exclusion of the exquisitely tasty, conveniently-sized fruit from the Caribbean in favour of what my wife and I regard as the large, cheap and nasty bananas from Latin America, and yet more price wars between British supermarkets to the further detriment of the smaller greengrocers and convenience stores? If ever there were a <i>num</i> question&#151;one that expects the answer &quot;no&quot;&#151;this is it.
</p>

<a name="60424-15_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>I hope at the very least that we shall receive an assurance from my noble friend that the Government will follow the example of their predecessors and fight to keep alive the Caribbean banana industry, specifically in the first instance by doing all that they can to obtain a satisfactory level for the single tariff and ensuring that there is no change in the way in which the quota is administered, at least before 2008.

<a name="60424-16_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Foulkes of Cumnock: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend Lord Montgomery and I usually agree on almost everything&#151;strangely, considering our different backgrounds and the other differences that we have. However, I am afraid that I do not agree with him today. Like my noble friend Lord Faulkner, I have interests to declare, but on both sides. I am president of the Caribbean-Britain Business Council, vice chairman of the Caribbean group in Parliament, vice-chairman of the Central American group and chairman of the Dominican Republic group, so I see both sides of the argument&#151;a fatal thing for a politician sometimes.
</p>

<a name="60424-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>I see the argument that we should be moving towards free trade, but I must say to the noble Viscount that, at the same time, we must protect vulnerable countries, especially the small Caribbean islands whose economies have been so dependent&#151;and remain so dependent&#151;on bananas. There need to be helpful transitional arrangements. That is what the European Union has been trying to achieve. Like my noble friend Lord Faulkner, I commend what the Commission has been doing. It has been working <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_54"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 54</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

extremely hard to try to square the circle in this very difficult situation where we must try to resolve genuine interests from Latin America as well as from the Caribbean.
</p>

<a name="60424-16_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>The European Union thought that it had found an acceptable solution, but it was challenged by the Latin American countries&#151;the Central American countries in particular, as my noble friend Lord Faulkner pointed out. According to reports, Honduras, Panama and Nicaragua are threatening further legal action at the World Trade Organisation. Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Ecuador have been trying to establish a monitoring framework within the European Union with the object of demonstrating that their interests have been hurt. I hope that I will show today that they have not been hurt. However, Latin American bananas are mostly produced and marketed by big American companies such as Del Monte. The noble Viscount shakes his head, but I am not going to be critical&#151;quite the reverse. Among Latin producers, marketers and distributors, Del Monte has made it clear that it supports the EU tariff-only regime at the &#8364;176  per tonne level. On 30 November 2005, its chairman noted that Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc was,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a>&quot;well-positioned to take advantage of its vertically-integrated production, outstanding quality, a shipping, distribution, sales and marketing network to more effectively compete in the EU banana market with an open-market, tariff-only system&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60424-16_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>If it is good enough for Del Monte, I do not understand why it is not good enough for the governments of Central American countries.
</p>

<a name="60424-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>Let us look briefly at the market share. In Europe&#039;s original 15 member states, 18 per cent of bananas are produced domestically&#151;which is a little misleading because we include the <i>D&#233;partments d&#039;Outre-Mer</i> in that. Some 63 per cent come from Latin America and only 19 per cent from the ACP in the traditional 15 countries. Of course, with the new member states, about 98 per cent come from Latin America so even more come from Latin America in those countries. Latin America is doing pretty well.
</p>

<a name="60424-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>Overall, Caribbean banana exports to Europe have been falling. In the four years to 2003, EC figures indicate that Caribbean banana exports fell by 7.6 per cent, so that they now account for only 36 per cent of total imports from ACP countries. The decrease has been especially marked in the case of the Windward Islands&#151;very small vulnerable economies that we, as the main country in the Commonwealth, should have some concern for&#151;with exports in the Windward Islands falling by as much as 50 per cent. That is in contrast to those of the Dominican Republic. I welcome what has been happening in the DR, which, over the same period, increased its exports to the EU by 159 per cent, so that it now accounts for around 14 per cent of all ACP banana exports to Europe.
</p>

<a name="60424-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>Perhaps I may touch on the implications of the new regime for ACP producers in the Caribbean. They pay once they have sold 775,000 tonnes&#151;the tariff-free quota. They then pay the full duty rate beyond that. Some lower cost ACP countries, particularly in Africa, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_55"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 55</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

can afford to incur duty payments on part of their exports and still secure a remunerative return overall. But, without certainty of duty-free entry on their exports, there is concern in the Windward Islands and Jamaica that their trade will collapse. If it were to collapse the economic consequences would be dire. There is deep concern in those countries over suggestions that the whole of the ACP quota should be allocated on a first-come first-served basis. Someone has described what will happen as a boat race, with boats racing each other to get to the European Union markets first. That may be to some extent an exaggeration, but I think it indicates what could happen.
</p>

<a name="60424-16_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>As part of the negotiation of economic partnership agreements, European Commission negotiators are quietly urging Caribbean negotiators to seek quota-free entry for bananas and, indeed, for sugar in order to achieve something close to the equivalent of the &quot;Everything But Arms&quot; arrangements for the world&#039;s least developed nations. If that were to happen, it would effectively end the all-ACP banana protocol. It would also enshrine within a Caribbean EPA any new arrangement on bananas that some senior EC trade negotiators believe will be immune from any challenge. That certainly would be welcomed in the Caribbean.
</p>

<a name="60424-16_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>What happens now is far from clear. Lots of studies and options indicate different patterns of what might happen if we move forward on various scenarios. However, what unfortunately seems certain is that the losers will be the most vulnerable producer countries in the Caribbean. In contrast, the survivors, assuming some form of tariff protection of quota remains, will be those that have been able to enhance competitiveness, to diversify and to find higher-value market niches in fair trade bananas and organic bananas. All credit to them, because some of the Caribbean countries have been doing that effectively. But countries like Jamaica and Belize, where bananas and sugar grow side by side, will struggle to maintain a stable rural economy in the face of any new banana tariff regime, as envisaged by my noble friend Viscount Montgomery. The 36 per cent cut in the price paid by Europe to ACP sugar producers over the next three years will make it even worse: I do not like this phrase&#151;a double whammy on these vulnerable economies.
</p>

<a name="60424-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>The Caribbean is in the process of restructuring&#151;I know that well and I will turn to one aspect of that in conclusion&#151;so that the newer economy of tourism and services can be better integrated. But that will take time. I think that, and I hope the Minister will agree, Europe and particularly the British Government have a responsibility in ensuring Caribbean stability. Without that the levels of narcotics and gun-related crime&#151;and, I say to my noble friend Viscount Montgomery, that is not an idle threat&#151;on British streets will rise. That will happen.

<a name="60424-16_para9"></a>

<p><a name="st_128"></a>
<a name="60424-16_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hooper: </b>   My Lords, I am most grateful for being permitted to speak in the gap. I am in the happy position of being able to speak as the debate has been brought forward; the time originally envisaged for it would have made that impossible.
</p>

<a name="60424-16_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>I have listened with interest to the concerns expressed about the effects of the European Union regime on the producers of bananas. Having spoken up for the interests of Latin American producers in the past, and having spent a postgraduate year in Ecuador, I can assure the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner of Worcester, that the bananas produced there are great in variety and absolutely delicious. Noble Lords must go there and try them out on the spot. More recently, I visited St Lucia, Grenada and Antigua under the auspices of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, and I want to make a rather more general point. This is a question not only of the European regime or of bananas as a fruit, although I believe they are the most eaten fruit in the world and have all the qualities that the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner of Worcester, listed, but of finding ways to diversify the consumption of the banana and its by-products in order to provide a greater market for the producers wherever they produce this commodity.
</p>

<a name="60424-16_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>Small producers everywhere, but particularly in the Caribbean, have a special case. Many of them used to produce sugar, but the effects of the sugar prices and, indeed, the European Union sugar regime, among other things, meant that they chose to diversity into bananas. They have a particular problem because of the climate&#151;we are all aware of the hurricanes that caused havoc in some of those tiny islands last year&#151;so they need to be able to produce a crop that can be planted and reproduced within a short time if it is destroyed one year. Both sugar and bananas fall into that category. There is a special case to be made, which is why I urge consideration of further ways of using the banana. Like sugar, which is now finding another market in ethanol production as an energy source, bananas as a fruit could certainly produce some kind of energy source. A use could presumably be found even for the by-products of the banana&#151;the foliage and the fibre, which is currently simply burnt and wasted and adds to environmental problems&#151;as a biomass source of fuel. I therefore ask the Minister to say, when he replies, whether the Government can in any way urge the European Commission&#039;s Research Directorate, not its Agricultural Directorate, to set up some form of research into alternative uses for the banana and its by-products.
</p>

<a name="60424-16_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>At a recent CPA meeting here&#151;perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes of Cumnock, will come across this when he attends his meetings in the Caribbean <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_57"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 57</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

tomorrow&#151;there was a suggestion that a research committee or research council should be set up in the Commonwealth, and particularly in the Caribbean, to look into this issue.

<p><a name="st_129"></a>
<a name="60424-17_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Newby: </b>   My Lords, I should begin by apologising on behalf of my noble friend Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, who I understand is, as we speak, pulling into Paddington Station, believing that this debate was going to take place somewhat later in the evening. However, I am delighted to be able to step metaphorically into her shoes in that I initiated the previous debate on this issue a while ago. I also declare an interest as a former adviser to the Caribbean Banana Exporters Association. Therefore, the noble Viscount will not be surprised to know that I, too, disagree with his basic thesis on bananas.
</p>

<a name="60424-17_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>The debate raises a number of general issues and I am grateful to the noble Lords, Lord Faulkner and Lord Foulkes, for having filled in many of the details, unsurprisingly none of which I have to my fingertips just at the moment. It seems to me that the issues are as follows. First, will the new proposed banana regime have a serious, deleterious effect on the Caribbean banana market? It seems to me, that for all the reasons that have been given, the answer is unambiguously, yes, it will.
</p>

<a name="60424-17_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>Secondly, does that matter to any significant extent to either those Caribbean economies affected or to the UK? We have already heard why it matters to those economies. The islands that we are talking about&#151;particularly the Windward Islands&#151;are very small. Their population is barely the size of a London borough. They have been encouraged by this country over a long period to grow bananas. Interestingly enough, the Caribbean banana business was begun by a subsidy from Joe Chamberlain when he was in one of his more exuberant pro-Empire modes. It is funny how things change. But there is no doubt that for those countries which still grow bananas, the effect on the economy will be very serious indeed. The choices open to them are, in the short term, relatively small. Take a country like St Lucia. It cannot grow any other commercial crop, virtually at all, and never will be able to, for reasons which have been given. The terrain and the regular hurricanes mean that most crops are impossible to grow.
</p>

<a name="60424-17_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>While St Lucia is doing a tremendous amount in terms of developing its tourist industry, this takes a long time and it is by no means clear that a monoculture of tourism is going to be an entirely satisfactory outcome for the island either, given that most of the income generated by tourism rapidly leaves the island and does not filter down to people who are not working in the tourist industry. The effect on the economy will be serious.
</p>

<a name="60424-17_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>Another effect which has been mentioned is what will happen to people who are now growing bananas? Will they turn to growing drugs? The noble Viscount, Lord Montgomery, observed that they could have been growing drugs anyway because it is more <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_58"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 58</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

profitable. That assumes that the banana growers are amoral and that they would equally grow drugs as grow bananas. That is grossly unfair to the population of the Caribbean, who are not amoral and who do not want to be growing drugs&#151;they know the effects of drugs just as well as we do. But some of these people will be desperate. They are poor people already; they will become poorer and will turn to desperate measures&#151;both in my view and in the view of many other independent commentators, not just here but from the US.
</p>

<a name="60424-17_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>The effect therefore on the Caribbean economies will be serious and the social effects, both there and here, will be serious. Does that matter to us? It matters on two grounds. First, there is the question of moral obligation, which has already been mentioned, and which we cannot wash away. But it also raises a broader issue about the way the WTO acts, particularly in relation to small, vulnerable states. Whatever we do for Caribbean bananas, in terms of their access to the EU market, will have a marginal effect on the overall, global banana market. As we have already heard, the percentage of the European market that in any foreseeable future will be taken up by Caribbean bananas will be small&#151;single digits and reducing. The key issue that the WTO should address and has not addressed and our Government could urge it to address, is whether&#151;in cases where there are small states who are not wealthy and which, for various historical reasons, have a special monoculture or a small group of products which form a small part of the market, the withdrawal of which would form a collapse in the economies&#151;there is room for a waiver of normal WTO rules, at least on a limited basis and possibly on a diminishing basis, over an agreed period of years.
</p>

<a name="60424-17_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>Undoubtedly, the complainants in the WTO case, who have won their case and in doing so will destroy the Caribbean banana trade, have played by the book. I am sorry to say to the noble Viscount that they are immensely wealthy, extraordinarily effective and unscrupulous lobbyists in the States and elsewhere, which is, in one sense, neither here nor there. They have played, and won, by the book. The trouble is that the book is wrong in that respect. We should look at the book to see whether it can be amended, because we are now going into the ludicrous situation which noble Lords have mentioned.
</p>

<a name="60424-17_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>I am not sure how readily the geography comes to mind. But, thinking of the Windward Islands as a string of pearls, they are a French colony, a former British colony, a French colony and a former British colony. The French colonies get continuing protection: the British colonies get virtually none. Even going down the Windward Islands, the effect is discriminatory, bizarre or irrational and defies all logic. The one slight glimmer of hope, which the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, said, is that some of these countries are growing organic and fair trade bananas. They are not the only ones who are doing it, and they should possibly have done that rather earlier. It was <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_59"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 59</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

considered, but it did not happen. As we are always telling ourselves we must do, it gives them the chance to go up the value chain slightly.
</p>

<a name="60424-17_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>The real problem is that, without a more or less guaranteed volume of trade, particularly from the smaller islands, there will simply not be the shipping to deal with a slowly declining volume. The whole thing tends to fall off the edge, probably at a level of exports which is not much less than we have today. This is an important issue, which bears heavily on our responsibilities. It raises broader issues on how world trade will be carried forward. I look forward, as do other noble Lords, to the Minister&#039;s reply.

<p><a name="st_130"></a>
<a name="60424-17_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Viscount, Lord Montgomery of Alamein, for introducing this debate. I believe that he will find that there are not many noble Lords who support his point of view, but it is good to debate it. For once, I have no interests to declare, which for me on agricultural matters is wonderful. In fact, I do not eat bananas either&#151;when I was a little girl, they did not agree with me. As a sports person, I was told that I should eat them. Unfortunately, that was not possible.
</p>

<a name="60424-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>I do not propose to go over the ground which has been so well covered today. I have all the facts and figures, but it would be foolish for me to waste the time of the House going over what has been clearly put by noble Lords who have spoken already. I echo the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, in his comment that the ACP countries have been treated shamefully. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, has underlined that it is even more unfair because of the position with the French colonies.
</p>

<a name="60424-17_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>I should like to take us further on. This debate has been going on for a long time and I want to raise several issues with the Minister. In January 2006, the organisers of the Second International Banana Conference proposed that the EU use the tariff revenue help fund to act and give more sustainable practices in all banana exporting countries. It made the following proposals: first, that the EU undertake a comprehensive evaluation of the existing EU banana import regime and its impact on poverty, income, wages, the environment and levels of development in all exporting countries, incorporating a gender analysis of these. Secondly, it proposed that the EU should support public programmes in producing countries to enforce international and national labour standards. Thirdly, the EU should fund and implement research and development programmes to improve occupational health and safety and environmental impact in banana production&#151;something to which my noble friend Lady Hooper referred. Fourthly, the EU should fund and implement research and development programmes to find effective measures for preventing occupational and environmental risk in banana production. At this stage I began to wonder what on earth was meant by this, so I shall listen to the Minister with great interest. Fifthly, the EU should implement education and empowerment programmes in health and safety and environmental issues for workers.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_60"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 60</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60424-17_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>Sixthly, it proposed that the EU should fund and support initiatives promoted by not-for-profit, fair trade organisations, which facilitate small and disadvantaged producers&#039; market access. Intervention programmes could include expertise or technical support; structural investments for improvements in production capacity; and the promotion of cultural initiatives to increase the awareness of consumers in northern countries. Seventhly, the EU should support and promote programmes ensuring fair contract and access credit for all producers. Eighthly, the EU should support and promote producer-led programmes that aim to help small farmers increase their productivity, cut their costs and engage in environmentally friendly production. Ninthly, the EU should initiate and financially support consumer education campaigns in order to increase consumer understanding that prices should promote sustainability. In other words, the EU should ensure that the social and environmental costs of banana production are covered, including living wages and decent livelihoods for workers and small producers.
</p>

<a name="60424-17_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>The conference&#039;s tenth proposal was that the EU should support financially and politically the creation of an international multi-stakeholder forum on bananas in order to tackle social, economic and environmental issues within the industry. Eleventhly, the EU should develop a proposal for differentiating tariffs on the basis of social and environmental criteria put forward by the conference organisers and look into trade barrier elimination and trade incentives for social compliance. Twelfthly, the EU should fund compensatory financial mechanisms for producers to help them meet the short-term price shocks and declining incomes which may result from EU market liberalisation. Finally, the EU should fund and support diversification programmes and initiatives of producer and/or worker groups which aim to replace current production and/or development of new markets or outlets for products, including where the workers have taken over production on plantations abandoned by companies.
</p>

<a name="60424-17_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>That is a big list. This conference was held in January. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us a little more about it, because we need to move on. I have some questions on the above. How much money has been put aside to take some of these proposals forward? Has a separate body been established to manage these initiatives? If so, what timetable is in place? What input do the Government have into these discussions and the actions that I hope will result from them? Obviously, the Conservative Party&#039;s position is to believe in free trade in preference to barriers. However, I personally believe that we have a responsibility to former ACP countries and we should look at some of these proposals to see what we can do to move this agenda forward. My noble friend quite rightly raised the question of change in the sugar regime. It is a double whammy and it will be a very serious one for these countries.
</p>

<a name="60424-17_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>So although I have not agreed with the noble Viscount, Lord Montgomery, I thank him most sincerely, because this debate has given us a chance not <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_131"></a>
<a name="60424-18_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Lord Bach): </b>  My Lords, I begin by thanking the noble Viscount, Lord Montgomery of Alamein, for initiating and introducing this debate on the new European regime for the import of third country bananas. I also thank other noble Lords who have contributed so knowledgeably to the debate and, if I may say so, spoken with so much passion on this topic. I thank particularly the noble Lord, Lord Newby, who stood in at such short notice and spoke with such skill, which is not something easily done without a moment&#039;s preparation. But we are lucky that he is such an expert in this field. He opened a debate on this topic last January.
</p>

<a name="60424-18_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>As one could feel tonight, in this debate, in WTO terms the banana trade has had a troubled history. As has rightly been acknowledged, one cannot meaningfully assess the new regime for imports and its significance to suppliers, traders and consumers, without looking back, particularly at the legal framework. The EU regime for bananas did not come into being until 1993, individual member states having often had very different trading histories. Even after 1993 there followed years of well publicised and damaging international trade disputes, as first one import regime and then another was challenged and found wanting in WTO. It was not until 2001 that an understanding was reached at the Doha ministerial conference. That understanding provided for a phased transition away from the quota system, which had attracted so much criticism from exporters in countries with, in this case rather inappropriately named, most favoured nation status, to a tariff-only regime, which the EU was obliged to introduce by 1 January 2006.
</p>

<a name="60424-18_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>Under the interim arrangements which applied from 2001 to last year, bananas from the ACP producing countries could be imported free of duty up to a quota limit of 750,000 tonnes each year. Bananas from elsewhere were subject to a tariff rate of &#8364;75 per tonne against a quota limit of 2.65 million tonnes; over-quota bananas were subject to higher tariffs&#151;&#8364;680&#151;which were generally prohibitive.
</p>

<a name="60424-18_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>Last year saw important developments as the EU sought to honour its obligations arising from the 2001 understanding&#151;in other words, to end the MFN quota and move to a tariff-only system. The EU secured a broad negotiating mandate from the Council, such that its aim was to maintain existing levels of protection and preferences for ACP countries, while respecting the Community&#039;s obligations and commitments to other trading partners, EU producers and EU consumers. Acting on that negotiating mandate, the EU Commission notified the WTO in January 2005 that it intended to replace its concessionary tariff quotas on MFN bananas with a bound duty of &#8364;230 per tonne.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_62"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 62</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60424-18_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>After limited negotiations, the MFNs invoked arbitration. In August, the arbitrator ruled that the Commission&#039;s proposals would not maintain MFN market access. Further attempts at negotiation were fruitless and, in the absence of agreement, the Commission itself invoked a second round of arbitration in late September on a revised proposal for a tariff level of &#8364;187 per tonne, together with a duty free quota for imports from ACP producer countries. Late October, the arbitrator ruled again that the EU had failed to rectify the matter, thus exhausting the procedures agreed in 2001. So we were in uncharted WTO waters, and it then fell to the Community to decide how to meet its tariff-only commitment. Please remember that it had to have a new arrangement in place by 1 January 2006.

</p>

<a name="60424-18_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a> On 29 November last year, under our presidency, the EU agreed&#151;by a narrow qualified majority&#151;a new import tariff of &#8364;176 per tonne to apply to imports of bananas from most favoured nation countries. It was also agreed that the new import regime would include a duty free annual import quota of 775,000 tonnes for ACP bananas, also to apply from 1 January.
</p>

<a name="60424-18_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>Of course, I am well aware that ACP suppliers would have favoured a higher tariff than &#8364;176 or even an extension of existing arrangements. However, most favoured nations have equivalent weight on the other end of the rope calling for a lower tariff. Given the EU&#039;s obligations in WTO and after two arbitration decisions found against the EU, we believe that this was the best achievable result. Frankly, a result was needed&#151;1 January 2006 loomed.
</p>

<a name="60424-18_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>Hitherto the ACP quota had been managed through the complex allocation of licences to traditional and non-traditional operators. As we have always imported the largest quantity of ACP bananas into the EU, its operators held the biggest share of the licences. However, as part of last November&#039;s agreement to move to a tariff-only regime, the Council of Ministers decided that the licence system for the ACP quota should be changed to provide access on a &quot;first come first served&quot; basis for at least 50 per cent of ACP imports. That change followed lobbying from production and trading interests based in West African and Caribbean countries with a less established history of exporting to the EU, from accession countries and from some longer established member states which favour freer trade mechanisms.
</p>

<a name="60424-18_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>In February this year, the bananas management committee adopted new rules for quota management. Sixty per cent of the quota will be made available on a &quot;first come first served&quot; basis. The remaining 40 per cent of the quota is still reserved for operators who previously held a licence. Importantly, those operators, mostly in this country, that hold such licences will also be able to take advantage of the &quot;first come first served&quot; share of the quota. Moreover, they should be able to manage their licences in such a way that they can use them at the end of each two month tranche of &quot;first come first served&quot; to offset the duty which would otherwise be payable. This is an option which is not available to non-traditional operators. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_63"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 63</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I believe that it was a significant concession to the UK on the part of the Commission, as all other member states generally favoured a larger share for &quot;first come first served&quot;, or, indeed, wanted to do away with historical licences altogether.
</p>

<a name="60424-18_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>It is also worth noting that the original proposal would have required UK operators to pay huge securities as deposits for quantities of licences which they stood no chance of obtaining. I do not hide from the fact that we anticipate further pressure for the licences allocated to traders on a historical basis to be further reduced in 2007. But there is still a reasonable prospect that some preference can be maintained for those traders until the ACP waiver expires at the end of 2007 and the new economic partnership agreements are expected to come into effect. Similarly, I do not hide from the fact that high-cost Caribbean producers face threats of competition both from MFN supplies and from cheaper West African bananas. It will be important that they can maintain a critical mass of production of sufficiently high quality to keep supply chains open. We will continue to defend the Caribbean interest as best we can within a World Trade Organisation compatible framework and as part of the EU.
</p>

<a name="60424-18_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>Assistance through the EU has been mentioned, in particular by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford. As regards the recommendations of the conference that she mentioned, we believe that several very sensible suggestions were made. We had no direct input into that but we hope that the Commission will consider those remarks carefully when looking at what can be done.
</p>

<a name="60424-18_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>Through the EU we have provided funding to the special framework of assistance&#151;SFA&#151;the European aid instrument to Caribbean banana exporting countries to help improve their competitiveness, and when that it is not possible, to assist with diversification into other economic activities. The implementation performance and release of SFA funds has been disappointing. DfID has been engaging with the Commission in Brussels and in the Caribbean itself to try to improve its performance.
</p>

<a name="60424-18_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>Through the UK&#039;s bilateral aid programme and contributions to multilateral organisations working in the Caribbean region, we are helping to create the conditions necessary to enable job opportunities. In regard to that, my noble friend Lord Foulkes and the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, mentioned the double whammy. It is indeed a double whammy for Jamaica and Belize, but the EU is committed to paying traditional aid for sugar, learning the lessons from the arrangements earlier agreed for bananas.
</p>

<a name="60424-18_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>The new tariff-only arrangement came into effect in January and the new arrangements for access to the ACP quota only fully from March. Frankly, it is too early to judge the impact on trade volumes and prices in what is a dynamic market, although the Commission is closely monitoring the situation, having accepted the offer that we heard about from the WTO from the good offices of the Norwegian Foreign Minister. This is important and helpful as the governments of several Latin American countries <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_64"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column 64</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

continue actively to oppose the adoption of the new tariff of $176 per tonne on most favoured nations&#039; supplies.
</p>

<a name="60424-18_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>One cannot rule out further challenges or changes to the new import agreements, but it is key that the European Community can point to the fact that it has met its earlier commitment to introduce a tariff-only system by 2006.
</p>

<a name="60424-18_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>Turning to the consumer interest, our market will continue to enjoy bananas from a wide range of supplying countries. The discerning shopper can purchase according to label, country of origin, price, size and other factors, such as fair trade and organic, to suit individual tastes and ethical choice. As I am aware from reading the debate in the House in January last, several noble Lords&#151;and we have heard it today&#151;have a strong preference for the smaller, sweeter fruit from the Caribbean. I share their view that the slightly higher price that they command in retail outlets is one well worth paying. As consumers we can all have a big say in the marketplace through exercising choice.
</p>

<a name="60424-18_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>I shall conclude on the external arrangements. Against the backdrop of earlier disputes, and the Doha understanding reached in 2001, the new arrangements for imports of bananas to the EU was, and is, in the best interests of the UK. Failure to have met our WTO obligation would, first, put the EU in breach of international trade law, and on the back foot of any future negotiations. Secondly, it would place bananas back on the international agenda. Thirdly, it would risk damaging retaliation from trading partners. Lastly, it would risk loss of the very WTO waivers that continue to allow a duty-free preference for ACP exports to the UK and other member states.
</p>

<a name="60424-18_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>Finally, I shall deal with three points that were raised. First, the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, in an intervention, asked about research for alternative use of banana by-products. We are sure that producers will look at all alternatives. That would be a legitimate use of transitional assistance, but the EU Commission would have to agree it with the countries concerned.
</p>

<a name="60424-18_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, made a point about arrangements discriminating in favour of French overseas territories. As he well knows, the difference is that those French territories are part of the EU. I should point out that the ACP benefits from a substantial degree of preference still at this time. Thirdly, I commend my noble friend Lord Foulkes&#151;to whom we wish a safe journey tomorrow, while wishing that we could all go with him&#151;on his balanced analysis. I agree that the Commission has worked hard to square the circle.
</p>

<a name="60424-18_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>We believe that the outcome which was achieved under our presidency at the end of 2005 was the best which could be obtained in what the whole House will understand were, and still remain, difficult circumstances.

</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_1"></a>
<a name="60424-19_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Naseby: </b>   Before my noble friend moves the first amendment, perhaps I may raise one small technical matter on groupings. I should like Amendment No. 35 to be taken separately from Clause 6 stand part. I have informed the relevant parties.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_0"></a>Clause 2 [<i>Smoke-free premises</i>]:

<p><a name="gc_st_2"></a>
<a name="60424-19_spnew2"></a><b> Earl Howe </b>   moved Amendment No. 7:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_0"></a>Page 2, line 25, leave out subsection (5).</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_3"></a>The noble Earl said: In moving Amendment No. 7, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 9 and 103, which are grouped with it.
</p>

<a name="60424-19_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_1"></a>As we discussed last week, premises and workplaces are to be smoke-free only in those areas that are enclosed or substantially enclosed, but Clause 2(5) leaves it to regulations to define what &quot;enclosed&quot; and &quot;substantially enclosed&quot; will mean. I do not believe that this is fair or satisfactory and I shall explain why.
</p>

<a name="60424-19_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_2"></a>In essence, the pub trade needs to be able to plan ahead and to do so with complete certainty. A good many pubs may well wish to accommodate their smoking customers by constructing external smoking areas that do not fall foul of the definitions of what is &quot;enclosed&quot; or &quot;substantially enclosed&quot;. Until those definitions are published, they cannot take the risk of applying for the necessary planning permissions to create such facilities. Even making educated assumptions about what the definitions will be carries with it a considerable commercial risk. Many pubs and clubs will not want to take that kind of risk, quite understandably. My suggestion is that the definitions of &quot;enclosed&quot; and &quot;substantially enclosed&quot; should be modelled on those being applied in Scotland; I have poached the wording direct from the relevant Scottish regulations.
</p>

<a name="60424-19_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_3"></a>The lack of definitions would be less of a problem if it were not the Government&#039;s intention to bring this part of the Bill into force so rapidly, but the uncertainty factor, combined with the tight timescale, is likely to result in considerable difficulties for businesses. If the process of approving the relevant definitions and regulations proves to be at all complicated, it may be impossible for pubs and clubs <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC2"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column GC2</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to submit any planning applications until the beginning of next year at the earliest. The planning process itself, as we all know, can be extremely slow. That is why I suggested earlier that the commencement for these provisions should be later than is currently proposed. I did so not because I am soft on smoking but because I do not think that it is right to come down so hard on the pub and club trade by allowing it so little time to make preparations.
</p>

<a name="60424-19_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_4"></a>Until the middle of February, when the crucial vote was taken in the other place, a large number of pubs&#151;and, indeed, all private membership clubs&#151;believed that they would be exempt from the smoking ban. They were therefore making no preliminary plans whatever. They cannot be blamed for harbouring that belief because, until a few weeks ago, it was government policy to exempt them.
</p>

<a name="60424-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_5"></a>This may be a health Bill and the primary concern of most of us taking part in the debate is public health, but I do not think that we can claim to be legislating responsibly on banning smoking in pubs and clubs if we do not also take account of the business case. With all due respect to the other place, this is not something that it did to any meaningful extent.
</p>

<a name="60424-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_6"></a>Reducing the incidence of smoking and ill health may be a great crusade for many in both Houses of Parliament, but pubs and clubs are not the bad guys. We need to remind ourselves of that. They are innocent parties in all this, and there is no doubt that many of them will suffer acutely when the effect of this legislation hits them. I believe that we have a duty to listen very hard to the concerns that they are voicing about how their trade is likely to be affected by the ban on smoking, and that, as far as we reasonably can, we should make appropriate provision for them. The way to do that is to give the trade two things: certainty at the earliest possible opportunity about where they stand, and time to make appropriate preparations for protecting their businesses.
</p>

<a name="60424-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_7"></a>I know that not all noble Lords will be sympathetic to the case that I have tried to make, but I hope that the Government will be. I therefore beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_4"></a>
<a name="60424-19_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Naseby: </b>   I will speak to Amendment No. 8, which goes further than that of the noble Earl. As he said, Chapter 1 of Part 1 makes provisions for the prohibition of smoking in certain places, premises and vehicles. The problem is that the Bill does not define &quot;premises&quot;. Premises are to be smoke-free only in those areas that are enclosed or substantially enclosed. The meanings of &quot;enclosed&quot; and &quot;substantially enclosed&quot; are to be specified in the regulations. As the noble Earl has said, until those meanings are made available, the situation is not just difficult, but impossible. No property owner or operator can be absolutely confident about being able to do or commence work to provide facilities for smokers that fall outside those meanings.
</p>

<a name="60424-19_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_8"></a>I speak from some experience: until relatively recently I was a non-executive director of a construction company. There is no way that any client of ours would go ahead on the basis of what they <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC3"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column GC3</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

thought might be in regulations. That is a crazy way forward. So nothing can happen until those regulations set out the specifications.
</p>

<a name="60424-19_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_9"></a>One might hope for some guidance from the Department of Health. There was a public consultation document last June, as the Minister informed us on other amendments: <i>Consultation on the Smokefree Elements of the Health Improvement and Protection Bill</i>. In paragraphs 11 to 13, the document said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_1"></a>&quot;It is proposed to put the definition of enclosed on the face of the Bill, and to provide a power so that the definition may be modified by regulations. After reviewing a range of definitions used in other jurisdictions, it is proposed to use the following:</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_2"></a>a place is to be regarded as &#039;enclosed&#039; if it is fully enclosed (completely enclosed on all sides by solid floor-to-ceiling walls, windows, or solid floor-to-ceiling partitions with an exception for doors and passageways), or is substantially enclosed, that is at least partially covered by a roof and has walls such that the total area of the roof and wall surfaces exceeds 70 per cent of the total notional roof and wall area.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_3"></a>It is proposed that both &#039;roof&#039; and &#039;wall&#039; will include any structure, whether fixed or movable, permanent or temporary.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_4"></a>It is proposed that the &#039;total notional roof and wall area&#039; will be the sum of what would be the total area of the wall surfaces if the walls were continuous (any gap in the walls being filled by a surface of the minimum area required for the purpose) and the walls were of a uniform height equal to the lowest height of the roof&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60424-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_10"></a>If I were to examine noble Lords on the detailed interpretation of that in about five minutes&#039; time, I suspect that none of them would be able to give the correct answers. The point that I am making is that this is extremely complicated, and not simply something that your average rural publican is the least bit capable of doing. It would have required professional advice, as it stood at that stage. But when the Health Bill was published in December 2005, the definitions of &quot;enclosed&quot; and &quot;substantially enclosed&quot; were not in the Bill, as we know; instead, they were left to be defined in regulations.
</p>

<a name="60424-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_11"></a>But then, in Standing Committee, the Minister in another place indicated that the Government had again changed their minds and that they were leaning towards defining &quot;substantially enclosed&quot; as being when openings in the walls had an area less than half the area that constituted the perimeter. I say to the Committee that a definition of 50 per cent of the perimeter wall area is unnecessarily restrictive. It would make such places entirely inhospitable and useless for a large part of the year. Both our amendment and that in the name of my noble friend would permit the definitions to be modified by regulations, as originally intended by the Department of Health.
</p>

<a name="60424-19_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_12"></a>This is an important point, in that not a single licensed premise can do any planning. In contrast to what the Minister suggested on Thursday, no one can do any planning until this matter is clearly settled and people know exactly what they are about. Of the two amendments, I prefer the one in our name, but <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC4"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column GC4</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

certainly the one in the name of my noble friend Lord Howe has merit, and I hope very much that they will find sympathy with the Minister when he replies.

<a name="60424-20_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Department of Health  (Lord Warner): </b>  Before I reply to the amendments, I draw the Committee&#039;s attention to the fact that on the table over there are copies of letters that I have put in everyone&#039;s pigeon-holes, including copies of the three papers relating to herbal cigarettes. They respond to points that have been raised and people may wish to take copies.
</p>

<a name="60424-20_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_13"></a>I am grateful to noble Lords for tabling these amendments, as they give me the opportunity to explain the Government&#039;s intentions regarding the definitions of &quot;enclosed&quot; and &quot;substantially enclosed&quot;. I hope that I can give some reassurance but, before I do so, given that the noble Earl, Lord Howe&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_6"></a>
<a name="60424-20_spmin1"></a><b>The Deputy Chairman of Committees:</b>  I apologise for interrupting the Minister. A Division has been called, and we shall resume at 3.52 pm.
</p>

<a name="60424-20_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_14"></a>[<i>The Sitting was suspended for a Division in the House from 3.42 to 3.52 pm.</i>]
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_7"></a>
<a name="60424-20_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   Before turning to the amendment, perhaps I may draw the attention of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, to some information about the Scottish trade. He encouraged us to feel extremely sorry for publicans in Scotland. The <i>Morning Advertiser </i>of 20 April showed that almost half of the 50 Scottish licensees whom it surveyed had reported an increase in trade since the smoking ban came into force. In a poll of pubs across Scotland, 24 said that trade had improved following the introduction of the ban; 21 said that business remained unchanged; and only five reported sales as being down. So we should not be too discouraged by the effect of the ban on the licensed trade in Scotland.
</p>

<a name="60424-20_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_15"></a>Amendment No. 7 would remove the power for the Government to define what &quot;enclosed&quot; and &quot;substantially enclosed&quot; mean in regulations. We propose using regulations for a number of reasons, but particularly because the definition is likely to be technical in nature. Moreover, it is important to maintain the flexibility to be able to amend the definition in future in the unlikely event that problems arise with the initial definition. This will be much easier if these definitions are in secondary legislation.
</p>

<a name="60424-20_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_16"></a>Furthermore, the Bill allows for regulations pertaining to &quot;enclosed&quot; and &quot;substantially enclosed&quot; to be specified by the appropriate national authority. By including a definition in the Bill, we would preclude Wales from being able to define &quot;enclosed&quot; and &quot;substantially enclosed&quot; in a way that best suits its own circumstances. I note that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee was content with this approach.
</p>

<a name="60424-20_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_17"></a>The definition used by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, in Amendment No. 9 is, as he said, the same definition as is used in regulations&#151;I stress &quot;regulations&quot;&#151;that were made under Scotland&#039;s smoke-free legislation. I reassure noble Lords that the Government&#039;s <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC5"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column GC5</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

intention is that definitions of &quot;enclosed&quot; and &quot;substantially enclosed&quot; under this Bill in general will follow those used in Scottish legislation. It is desirable to be consistent with Scotland in this respect, but, as I have said, it is more appropriate to do this in regulations rather than in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60424-20_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_18"></a>The noble Earl spoke about uncertainty in the licensed trade. My officials have met representatives of the pub trade on a regular basis. My understanding is that people in the licensed premises trade are aware of the Government&#039;s intentions in relation to definitions of &quot;enclosed&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60424-20_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_19"></a>I accept that Amendment No. 8 includes important elements required to define &quot;enclosed&quot; and &quot;substantially enclosed&quot;. However, I do not agree with the amendment in terms of the area of walls that would be necessary for premises to be considered to be substantially enclosed. The amendment proposes that a place should be considered substantially enclosed if it has a roof or ceiling and an opening, or aggregate openings, of less than 30 per cent of the area of the walls. I have explained that the Government intend to follow the Scottish model for this definition, which refers to less than 50 per cent of the area of the walls being open. I believe that this is preferable to ensure consistency with Scottish legislation. It also takes into account the comments that we received during the public consultation exercise that was undertaken last year, prior to the publication of the Health Bill. In addition, the 50 per cent measure is likely to be more easily understood than 30 per cent or any other percentage.
</p>

<a name="60424-20_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_20"></a>Through Amendment No. 103, the noble Earl, Lord Howe, proposes that the first set of regulations to be made with respect to these definitions should be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. I wish to reassure the noble Earl that the Government will undertake a full public consultation on the draft regulations to be made under this Bill. These definitions will be part of that consultation. The definition will be technical in nature, and it is usual for such technical regulations to be subject to negative resolution procedure. Again, I note that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee was content with this approach.
</p>

<a name="60424-20_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_21"></a>I hope that, given these reassurances, the noble Earl and noble Lords will not wish to pursue the amendments.

</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_8"></a>
<a name="60424-20_spnew1"></a><b> Earl Howe: </b>   That was a very helpful reply, for which I thank the Minister. I am sure he will realise that a good deal of my purpose in tabling the amendments was to have a debate and to elicit the kind of answer that we have just heard. I accept that technical issues such as the definition of &quot;enclosed&quot; and &quot;substantially enclosed&quot; are more appropriately dealt with in regulations. I had anticipated the Minister&#039;s comment on the need to retain flexibility in the future. I do not seek to argue with that principle. However, he seemed to brush aside the trade&#039;s concerns rather lightly. I have been lobbied quite heavily by the British Beer and Pub Association and the Association of Licensed <br>&nbsp;<br>

Multiple Retailers about, as they see it, the lack of time to prepare for the new regulations. I had, and still have, a great deal of sympathy with them.
</p>

<a name="60424-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_22"></a>Perhaps the Scottish experience is a pointer to what may occur south of the Border, but trading conditions in Scotland are somewhat different from those in the south of England, for example. I simply do not think that we can predict with complete confidence the effect of the regulations in the south when they come into force. I am, however, encouraged to hear that the Government are in active discussion with representatives of the trade. I welcome that, but I hope that the draft regulations will be available for all to see before too long. While it is helpful for the trade to know what the Government&#039;s broad intentions are, there is nothing like seeing a set of draft regulations in black and white.
</p>

<a name="60424-20_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_23"></a>That is probably as far as we can go on this issue today. I will consider what, if anything, we need to do at Report.

<a name="60424-20_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Wakeham: </b>   I wish to make a comment before the noble Earl seeks to withdraw the amendment. I have listened to what has been a constructive debate on both sides. Can the Minister say whether he thinks that the draft regulations will be published before the Bill receives Royal Assent&#151;that is, before the deliberations on it finish in this House? It seems to me that that would meet many noble Lords&#039; requirements.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_10"></a>
<a name="60424-20_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </b>   Before the Minister replies, will the results of the consultation and, if possible, the draft regulations be available by the time we reach Report? It would be very useful to the Committee if that information were available.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_11"></a>
<a name="60424-20_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   I do not think that I can go any further than to repeat what I said before&#151;that the draft regulations will be produced as soon as possible. Much depends on how quickly we get through the Bill and how quickly we get on to the next stage. I cannot go further than that and make a categorical promise. But I can say that we are always ready to meet representatives from the trade whenever they wish to do so. If they wish to have a more extensive discussion, we shall be delighted to meet them and to try to thrash out some of these issues.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_12"></a>
<a name="60424-20_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Naseby: </b>   Can I go a bit further with regard to the Scottish similarities? It seems to me that there will be a problem if we mirror the Scottish Bill all the way through. To start with, the weather is different in Scotland; secondly, social customs are different in Scotland; and, thirdly, drinking customs and the relationship of drinking to smoking are different in Scotland. So I should be grateful if, in a minute, the Minister would make it clear whether we are going to follow the Scottish model. After all, Scotland&#039;s Parliament is secondary to the national Parliament, and I would hope that we would not just follow what a secondary Parliament had done. In addition, I was not clear what the Minister said in relation to Wales as I did not quite catch it.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_24"></a>I also want to press the Minister on the Government&#039;s attitude to smokers, remembering that about a third of the nation&#039;s population are smokers. They will not be inside the licensed premises; they will be outside, and they will want to smoke. I happened to go to my son&#039;s stag do on Saturday in Richmond. As Members of the Committee will know, I do not smoke, but it is clear that the influence factor is permeating to Richmond. While some of the smokers were inside, it seemed to me that the majority were outside. So far as concerns the external structures, will the Government be as kind to the smokers as is reasonable or will we freeze them to death in an attempt to control and improve their health? I should be grateful if the Minister would clarify those two issues.

I think that we all know that anecdotally there are differences in different parts of the United Kingdom, but I wondered whether the noble Lord had an evidential base for what he said about those differences. If so, I should be very interested to hear the quoted sources.

Perhaps that is not the case but, if she wants the evidence, we will ring up the Met Office to find out for her.

<a name="60424-21_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Naseby: </b>   Yes, I do have some evidence. It is anecdotal evidence, as one has worked in Scotland for periods of one&#039;s life.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_25"></a>There is one crucial difference: population does matter. The population of Scotland is some 5.9 million, I think, and that of Wales some 2.9 million, while the people of England represent 50 million of the total population of 60 million.

experience, or any other experience, foisted upon it. Those remarks are not meant to be derogatory in any way to the Scots, who are decent and clever people. But there are 50 million of us in England and we really must decide our own policies and not simply slavishly follow those policies that have been imposed on the Scottish people by their own Parliament. Perhaps the Scots are a little more dour than the English and a little more extreme in what they are doing. I hope that our Bill will be less extreme than that imposed in Scotland.

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column GC9</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Committee, who probably know already, that I am married to a retired general practitioner, so I know a little about the world of medicine. Under the headline, &quot;Mothers got wrong advice for 40 years&quot;, the article said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_5"></a>&quot;Breast-feeding mothers have been given potentially harmful advice on infant nutrition for the past 40 years, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has admitted . . . Charts used in Britain for decades to advise mothers on a baby&#039;s optimum size have been based on the growth rate of infants fed on formula milk . . . The organisation&quot;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="gc_stpa_31"></a>the WHO&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_6"></a>&quot;now says the advice given to millions of breast-feeding mothers was distorted because babies fed on formula milk put on weight far faster . . . These breast-feeding mothers were wrongly told that their babies were underweight and were advised, or felt pressured, to fatten them up by giving them formula milk or extra solids&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60424-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_32"></a>If the WHO can give the wrong advice for 40 years about something so important, which affects babies throughout the world, Members of the Committee will understand why some of us have a degree of scepticism about some of the science to do with passive smoking. I am most grateful to the Minister for the tables that he has produced, but some of these data are pretty old. Evidence from 1990 is not exactly up to date.
</p>

<a name="60424-21_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_33"></a>I am sorry to be sceptical, but that is a classic example of why we in this House must continue to question science. If it is clearly proven, as it is now for smokers, then one can readily accept it, but when it is not clearly proven, then we are right to continue questioning.
</p>

<a name="60424-21_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_34"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for answering the question that I asked on Second Reading about the estimated cost. That is carefully defined in the letter, and varies from between &#163;4.5 million and &#163;13.3 million. I am not quite sure why there is such a variation&#151;perhaps the Minister can tell us. If it had been &#163;4.5 million to &#163;5.5 million that would seem reasonable, but I am not sure why the cost should vary between &#163;4.5 million and three times that amount.
</p>

<a name="60424-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_35"></a>Since our debate on Thursday, we now know that the NHS had its most successful year last year. Hundreds of nurses have been made redundant, thousands of workers have been fired and losses of more than &#163;750 million have been declared. That figure is probably &#163;1 billion, because you can bet your bottom dollar that every conceivable loss that can be kept out of the loss section has been removed. But none of those costs&#151;between &#163;4.5 million and &#163;13.3 million&#151;takes any account of the cost for the adaptation of licensed premises. If those changes are not made, custom will undoubtedly be lost.
</p>

<a name="60424-21_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_36"></a>On Thursday, I asked the Minister about Scandinavia. Since he has been kind enough to give us these research data, I should have hoped that on Friday somebody would have checked the files on Scandinavia or made some phone calls to Scandinavia to establish what the situation is there. I do not have a great office back-up with which to do this, but I have made contact with a restaurateur in the middle of Oslo in Norway and I asked him about the impact of the smoking ban there. His view was that general bar takings are down 10 per cent to 15 per cent and that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC10"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column GC10</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

some barmen have been made redundant. He said that the media have a lot of issues about the barmen being fired because the unions are up in arms about it, and the public are complaining about the noise associated with the people outside the licensed premises. There are even suggestions in Norway of having different hours for drinking if you are inside the licensed premises or outside the licensed premises.
</p>

<a name="60424-21_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_37"></a>This is an example of what is happening. Admittedly, it is just one sample, but as the person I spoke to is a leading restaurateur, I think that it is in general terms true. It just seems to me on Clause 2 stand part that the Government should recognise that they must make reasonable provision for smokers. That is the key issue. If the Minister were to say, &quot;Yes, we recognise that we must do that&quot;, much of our difficulty with the Bill would melt away. If the Government do not, I fear that the problems will continue.

<a name="60424-22_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Russell-Johnston: </b>   Circumstances prevented me from attending Committee last Thursday. Indeed, I must confess to Members of the Committee that I have never attended Committee before. As one of my colleagues in the Church of England once remarked to an incoming vicar, &quot;The agnostics here are pretty terrible&quot;. I am referring to the sound, of course, rather than to the religious attitude, but I was still able to hear a large part of what the previous speaker said.
</p>

<a name="60424-22_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_38"></a>I place on record quite firmly, as someone who has been a liberal for half a century, my view that this is a profoundly illiberal measure and interferes in an unjustified way with the rights of the individual. My noble friend Lord Steel of Aikwood said on Thursday:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_7"></a>&quot;The ethics behind the Bill are those of the nanny state rather than anything else. I find that quite offensive&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 20/04/06; col. GC587.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60424-22_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_39"></a>I find it deeply offensive. This is a country that prides itself on its tolerance, but the attitudes displayed by the advocates of the Bill have been those of the zealot, from which, in my experience, no fair legislation flows. Coupled with the zealotry, there has been an awful smugness as, inevitably, they get their way.
</p>

<a name="60424-22_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_40"></a>What right has the state to tell individuals what to do in private? As a liberal, to me the state has no right. Of course, it may advise; it may cajole; it may do all sorts of things. But it may not dictate. No, it must not dictate. At the root of the Bill is the denial of choice. For a liberal, that is deeply unacceptable. Of course, I do not deny the right of non-smokers to claim completely smoke-free areas, however you define them, as we have talked about during discussion of the previous amendments. My noble friend Lord Steel spoke of separate provision. Like the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, I think that the evidence on passive smoking is thin and poorly substantiated, but I shall not go into that. I do not want to make a long speech anyway. I simply wanted on clause stand part&#151;despite <br>&nbsp;<br>

the fact that, I am told, we do not vote on these matters&#151;to register my position and to state that this is the wrong way to go forward and is not fair.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_22"></a>
<a name="60424-22_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </b>   Following on from what the noble Lord, Lord Russell-Johnston, said, I think that he realises that many Members of this Committee agree with him entirely. The Bill is not a good Bill for the freedom of the individual, especially when, as we noted at our last Sitting, there are alternatives. In fact, it is possible to have complete separation, which, I should have thought, would satisfy everyone.
</p>

<a name="60424-22_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_41"></a>I follow the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, in mentioning the statistics that are so often quoted in favour not only of a ban on smoking in public places, but of an outright ban. That is the endgame; it is what I am sure organisations such as ASH want. I have just received a Written Answer from the Government about how much subsidy ASH and other organisations have received during the past five years. It states that ASH in England has been granted &#163;796,840, that ASH in Wales has been granted &#163;590,008, that no-smoking day has been granted &#163;1.25 million, and that QUIT has been awarded &#163;55,000. That amounts to &#163;2,691,848 over the past five years, or a yearly average of &#163;538,369. So the anti-smoking lobby has received a great amount of subsidy from the Government. In the interests of fairness, the Government might have put some money on the other side as well, but they have not and they do not intend to do so in the future.
</p>

<a name="60424-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_42"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Warner, said in our previous Sitting:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_8"></a>&quot;We know that tobacco smoke contains more than 4,000 chemicals in the form of particles and gases. Some of these have marked irritant properties and some 50 are known or suspected human carcinogens&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 20/4/06; col. GC598.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60424-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_43"></a>It is quite true that smoke contains 4,000 chemicals, but most of them are measurable only in very small units such as picogrammes. A single grain of salt, for example, weighs 100 million picogrammes, so we are talking about very small amounts of these chemicals. A lot of these chemicals are present only in a few single picogrammes or fewer. Our diet yields 10,000 such chemicals, which is two and half times more than is contained in second-hand smoke. So we need to take some of the figures that are bandied about with a pinch a salt.
</p>

<a name="60424-22_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_44"></a>I was sorry that the Minister was unable say what harmful chemicals are in vehicle exhaust fumes. I confess that I do not know, but it would be interesting for the Committee to have the answer. Will the Minister find out so that we can compare the harmful chemicals and substances that people breathe in when they are in the vicinity of a smoker and those that they breathe in when they are in the vicinity of a car or a diesel-fume-pumping lorry? If we are going to ban people from smoking in public places, we ought to know whether the damage caused by smoking in public places is proportionate to the damage caused by other activities. I would hope that the Committee could be given those figures, and I am sure that the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC12"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column GC12</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Minister would want to know them, so that he and the Government can make a proper assessment of what is being done.
</p>

<a name="60424-22_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_45"></a>We are also told that smoking costs the National Health Service some &#163;1.5 billion, which I accept is a lot of money. On the other hand, smokers pay some &#163;9.5 billion in additional tax, so the health service is not doing too badly out of the bargain. But, as with all these things, you can blame practically anything for costs to the National Health Service. I have here a cutting from the <i>Daily Express</i> of Wednesday 16 November 2005, which states in a bold headline: &quot;Bad eating habits cost the NHS &#163;6 billion a year&quot;. That is four times as much as smokers cost the NHS. Again, we must put things in perspective. It is a great pity that the noble Lord, Lord Harris, is not here, because he wrote a book about the statistical evidence, but perhaps he will be present at the next stage and we may have his expertise.
</p>

<a name="60424-22_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_46"></a>I understand that the statistics are worked out on the following lines. I am not a statistician, but the United States Environmental Protection Agency started all this with an examination of the additional risk that a woman had of getting lung cancer as a result of living with her husband. The agency found that, in the case of a man who did not smoke, the risk of his wife dying from lung cancer was two per 100,000, whereas risk of death from lung cancer in the wife of a man who smoked was three per 100,000. That is one additional death per 100,000. As I understand it, that represents a 30 per cent additional risk. One in 100,000 looks quite different from a 30 per cent increase in risk. I am right about that, but those figures are exploited by anti-smoking lobbies as meaning something quite different.
</p>

<a name="60424-22_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_47"></a>I have just received a letter about this. The correspondent states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_9"></a>&quot;The British Heart Foundation recently released press statements which clearly show that they have no understanding of their own figures by stating that if four non-smokers worked in a smoky bar, at least one of them will die prematurely because of second-hand smoke&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60424-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_48"></a>That kind of claim simply cannot be sustained. It is based on the ETS study which shows that the real risk is only one additional death per 100,000&#151;in which case, the British Heart Foundation is either very mistaken or is misleading the public. To judge by the EPA study, very few bar attendants would die from second-hand smoke.
</p>

<a name="60424-22_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_49"></a>People who have studied this issue over a long period could quote a good many other figures. I do not intend to do so, but I hope that I have shown that many exaggerations are made about the whole question. Figures are bandied about and manipulated in such a way as to frighten and mislead people, and, in some cases, to frighten learned doctors and scientists away from writing in learned newspapers. It would be far better if we got down to the truth about the real danger&#151;if any&#151;from second-hand smoke, rather than bandying about figures which very few people can really understand and which some people can manipulate.

</p>

<a name="60424-22_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_50"></a>When I was in the Army in the 1940s, as second-in-command of a hospital ship, I used to buy a 50-can of Senior Service every couple of days and get through it in two days&#151;it cost 1/8d for 50 cigarettes. I smoked steadily for some years. I then began to read the evidence relating to the effects of smoking, not only on the lungs but on the cardiovascular system, and as that evidence accumulated I gave up smoking cigarettes. I then went on to smoking a pipe because I believed that it was safer, but then the information began to emerge about pipe smoking.
</p>

<a name="60424-22_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_51"></a>I hope that I will be forgiven for saying so, but what the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, has said, frankly, does not hold water. The amount of money that the Government have put into support for organisations such as ASH simply does not compare with the amount of money that the Tobacco Manufacturers&#039; Association has put into the propaganda supporting smoking. For years it refused to admit that there were any ill effects from smoking. Eventually, and with the greatest possible reluctance, it came to the conclusion that perhaps smoking might cause lung cancer and might have an adverse effect on the cardiovascular system. The evidence is totally incontrovertible: smoking is the greatest health hazard of our age. Cigarette smoke at a high temperature includes a substantial component of carcinogenic hydrocarbons, which have been shown by experimental work to produce cancer in animals and so on.
</p>

<a name="60424-22_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_52"></a>I could go on and on to try to convince the noble Lord that the evidence against smoking as a health hazard is enormous and continues to grow&#151;not only in respect of lung cancer and cardiovascular disease but in respect of cancer of the bladder and cancer of many other organs. The statistics are absolutely clear cut: in people who smoke, the incidence of these conditions has been hugely increased. Quite contrary to what the noble Lords, Lord Naseby and Lord Stoddart, have said, there have now been published some 71 convincing pieces of research indicating the risks of passive smoking.
</p>

<a name="60424-22_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_53"></a>I do not want to go into great detail except to say&#151;as I said last Thursday&#151;that I would defend to the ultimate the right of any individual to smoke if he or she so wishes, recognising the devastating effect that it can have on their personal health and well-being. But I would totally disagree with the possibility of allowing an individual who smokes to have the effect, through the smoke that he or she produces, of causing damage to the health of another individual. That is why I support the Bill, which is so clearly designed to protect human health. I do not believe that it would be right for the Committee to modify the Bill that has come to us from another place. Obviously, the Bill should be debated, but the fact remains that convincing evidence in favour of the health risks of <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="gc_stpa_54"></a>I have to say&#151;and I might as well say it again at the beginning of this Sitting&#151;that we have set out our views on the science and the health risks of smoking and second-hand smoke and I do not intend to repeat that science on every clause stand part. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Walton, but I do not intend to join other noble Lords in a kind of confessional as to what they may or may not have done in the past.
</p>

<a name="60424-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_55"></a>As to the issue of choice, which was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Russell-Johnston, the Government believe in choice and set out clearly in <i>Choosing Health </i>that,

<p>


</p>

<a name="60424-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_56"></a>This includes whether to smoke. Often, however, people do not have a choice whether the enclosed public places that they visit or the places that they work in are smoke-free. That is why we are bringing forward the legislation. If people want to smoke in their own homes, that is up to them. The Bill deals with the communal issues around enclosed public spaces and workplaces. That is the basis of the Government&#039;s policy in the Bill and that is the way in which we are proceeding.
</p>

<a name="60424-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_57"></a>I shall respond, very briefly, to the perfectly fair questions asked by the noble Lord, Lord Naseby. The variation in costs reflects the different estimates that were provided to us by the different enforcement authorities. That is why a range of costs is shown. As to the cost of adaptations of licensed premises, I am struggling to think of anything other than the no-smoking notices that are required. I do not think that that is an overly demanding cost for people in this area.
</p>

<a name="60424-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_58"></a>Norway is very interesting. We shall try to find out something about it for the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, but I would suggest, with all due humility, that the Scottish experience may be more relevant to what is going on in England.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_59"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, keeps asking me to find out all kinds of terribly interesting facts to do with car exhausts and exhaust fumes. I remind him that exhaust fumes contain carbon monoxide and are dangerous in enclosed or substantially enclosed places. However, if he wishes to research this subject, it is down to him to use the Library and his own sources. We have made our position clear on the science but he <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_39"></a>
<a name="60424-23_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Naseby: </b>   I did not quite understand the point about the variation, which is huge. Is the Minister saying that a number of different departments have put in different figures and that is how it is to be left for the moment? I am not at all clear how he came to make the statement that he did. Commercial premises will incur costs because they will have to make some provision for smokers outside the pub; that is where the costs will come in. But until they get the regulations, they will not know what the proposals or the costs associated with them will be.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_40"></a>
<a name="60424-23_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   The point that I am trying to make on costs is that the enforcement authorities&#151;we shall come to this later today, if we ever get there&#151;are effectively the local authorities. They will put in different costs for operating this legislation and we have reflected that in the range of figures that I have given to the noble Lord and other Members of the Committee.

<a name="60424-23_spnew18"></a><b> Baroness Barker: </b>   I rise to speak to Amendment No. 12. As a Scot, I was sorely tempted to intervene earlier this afternoon, but I did not do so. I shall confine my remarks solely to the business in front of us.
</p>

<a name="60424-23_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_65"></a>The purpose of Amendment No. 12, which stands in my name and that of my noble friend&#151;who, sadly for me, is off on DCMS duty in the main Chamber&#151;is to probe the Government&#039;s intentions on the definitions of how the Bill will apply, especially to care homes, prisons and places of detention. It is no secret that organisations such as ASH want such premises to become fully smoke-free as soon as possible.
</p>

<a name="60424-23_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_66"></a>We expect the Government to say that they are working with the relevant authorities to pursue that end within a given time. We want to know what time limit they expect for such places to become smoke-free.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_67"></a>The other point that I want to make relates to care homes. I happen to go into care homes quite frequently; I do not live in one, but I go to one quite frequently. The majority of care homes now operate no-smoking policies, especially in relation to common parts. I would say that that is the norm. However, some still permit smoking rooms for individuals, because they are the homes of individuals. Again, I should like the Minister to place on record the department&#039;s intention behind the Bill in relation to such places.

<p><a name="gc_st_43"></a>
<a name="60424-24_spnew0"></a><b> Earl Howe: </b>   I have a clutch of four quite disparate amendments grouped here and, if I may, I shall take each in turn, beginning with Amendment No. 13, which refers to hospitals. On the face of it, it may seem very strange to be suggesting that hospitals should be exempt from the provisions of Clause 2 because, as a generality, hospitals are not places in which people have their home. Indeed, they are perhaps the very last place where we want to encourage smoking. I raise the issue simply because, in certain situations and for certain people, hospitals become the equivalent of home. I am thinking in particular of special hospitals and in-patient units of mental health trusts.
</p>

<a name="60424-24_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_68"></a>In those sorts of environment, it could well be a good idea therapeutically to allow smoking&#151;perhaps not in communal areas but in individual patients&#039; rooms&#151;because not to do so could impose unnecessary additional stress on the patient and, indeed, on the staff. If, all of a sudden, you interrupt the ability to smoke of a person who has mental health problems that he is trying to overcome, you can make the process of recovery doubly difficult. Clearly, it would have to be up to the hospital management and clinicians to define precisely the circumstances in which smoking was to be allowed, but I suggest that if there were to be an exemption of this sort&#151;I hope that the Minister will be sympathetic to the idea, even if it is not written into the Bill&#151;it should not matter whether an individual was being detained forcibly or being treated under his own volition. In both situations, the hospital is every bit as much the equivalent of home and, in both situations, denying the patient the ability to smoke could have an equally adverse impact.
</p>

<a name="60424-24_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_69"></a>Amendment No. 15 would exempt specialist tobacconists from the scope of the ban on smoking in the workplace and in premises open to the public. Specialist tobacconists are retail shops that specialise in selling cigars, pipe tobaccos, snuff and smokers&#039; accessories. There are very few of them; the estimate I have is that there are 46 in the entire country&#151;that is to say, England and Wales. Almost always, they are small, family-owned businesses that have been established for very many years. When a customer comes into a specialist tobacconist&#039;s&#151;I speak not at first hand, but following a description that was given to me&#151;he will often want to try out a particular cigar or pipe tobacco to see whether it is to his taste. Therefore, smoking not infrequently takes place in the shop itself. Equally, the shopkeeper needs to be able to smoke on the premises, so as to be able to speak authoritatively about the products that he is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC18"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column GC18</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

selling and to communicate effectively with the customer. One example of this is in the blending of pipe tobaccos into new mixtures, which must inevitably involve the tobacconist trying out the taste of each kind of tobacco that the blend comprises.
</p>

<a name="60424-24_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_70"></a>The stock in the shop has to be kept fresh and saleable. Not infrequently, there are quality control checks on cigars, for example, which have to be kept in controlled conditions of temperature and humidity. Once again, these checks involve actually smoking the product. Smoking, in other words, is an integral part of the way in which these tobacconists conduct their business. The customers who frequent them are predominantly mature, adult men who smoke. Children and young people are not drawn to these establishments.
</p>

<a name="60424-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_71"></a>There are therefore two main reasons why I believe an exemption for these specialist businesses is warranted. The first is that, as small businesses, they would be disproportionately affected by a smoking ban, because smoking on the premises is part and parcel of the way in which they operate. The second is that an exemption would have no significant public health consequences, because specialist tobacconists are so few in number. We already have an exemption for them under the Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act 2002, so it would be quite simple to implement and enforce a similar exemption under this Bill. I hope that the Minister will look favourably on that proposal.
</p>

<a name="60424-24_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_72"></a>Let us move on to Amendment No. 16. Developing new brands of tobacco product, modifying existing brands and assessing competitors&#039; brands are essential components of a tobacco business. Adult smokers need to be able to evaluate new tobacco blends, and tobacco companies, or consumer research companies acting for them, need to be able to obtain input from adult smokers about their taste preferences and their perceptions of different cigarette brands.
</p>

<a name="60424-24_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_73"></a>Against that background, I am proposing in this amendment that a tobacco company or a market research company working on its behalf should be allowed to permit smoking indoors for the purpose of evaluating and testing tobacco products in designated areas or rooms. In addition to consumer research, scientific research involving tobacco products is important. The organisations that conduct this type of research need to be able to do so with informed adult smokers who have agreed to participate in certain kinds of evaluation&#151;for example, to gain understanding of how, by varying the behaviour in smokers, one can affect their exposure to the constituents of smoke. In those sorts of case, a controlled indoor environment is necessary for an objective and valid evaluation. Tobacco companies&#151;love them or loathe them&#151;are legitimate commercial enterprises and we should not put unfair or unreasonable restraints on them or their trade.
</p>

<a name="60424-24_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_74"></a>That is why I believe that the Government should agree to make an exception to the ban on smoking in the workplace for the purpose of limited and carefully defined tobacco research, whether such research is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC19"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column GC19</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

carried out by tobacco companies themselves or whether it is done for them by independent agencies. An exemption of exactly this kind is included in the regulations governing the smoking ban in workplaces in Scotland. I believe that it would be consistent, as well as right in principle, to allow for an equivalent exemption in England.
</p>

<a name="60424-24_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_75"></a>Finally, and very briefly, I have tabled Amendment No. 21 as a probing amendment in order to seek the Minister&#039;s confirmation about what is intended as regards Clause 3(4). My reading of the subsection is that any living accommodation occupied by the manager of a set of licensed premises could be exempt from the provisions of Clause 2. As we all know, it is not uncommon for a pub to have a private flat above it where the landlord lives. Can the Minister confirm that the Government will definitely exempt that kind of living accommodation and that where the accommodation is occupied communally by a number of people&#151;who are all, let us say, employees of the pub or club&#151;the exemption will apply?
</p>

<a name="60424-24_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_76"></a>During pub opening hours, will someone who lives in a flat above a pub be free to allow into it any pub customers who smoke? If he does so, will he have to make it clear that this is a purely private arrangement, or will he be legally free to treat the flat as an extension of the pub in this sense? Anecdotally&#151;and I stress &quot;anecdotally&quot;&#151;I understand that some pub managers in the Republic of Ireland have done exactly this in order to accommodate their smoking customers. Will there be anything to stop pub managers doing the same here if they want to?
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_44"></a>
<a name="60424-24_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Monson: </b>   The arguments advanced by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, in support of his Amendment No. 13 apply with even greater force to care homes and prisons, as, on average, people spend longer in care homes and prisons than they do in hospital. So Amendment No. 12, spoken to by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, represents a serious challenge to human rights. Once again we can see a major split opening up between the liberal wing of the Liberal Democrats, as represented by the noble Lords, Lord Russell-Johnston and Lord Steel, and the illiberal wing of that party. It seems to put the splits in other parties totally into the shade.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_45"></a>
<a name="60424-24_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   This group of amendments deals with exemptions from smoke-free legislation. I remind noble Lords that the Bill will give the Secretary of State for Health the power to make regulations to provide for exemptions from smoke-free legislation and that any regulations made will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.
</p>

<a name="60424-24_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_77"></a>Clause 3 takes the general power to make such exemptions. This power will primarily be used to exempt premises that act as an individual&#039;s dwelling or are clearly similar private space, whether this is on a permanent or temporary basis. Our intention is that these kinds of establishments should have designated rooms where smoking will be permitted and otherwise <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC20"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column GC20</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

have common areas smoke-free. Subsection (5) gives the power to specify in regulations conditions for any designated smoking rooms.
</p>

<a name="60424-24_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_78"></a>It will also be necessary to use this power to make a small number of specific exemptions for other, what one might call unusual premises, such as tobacco testing facilities to test the harmful effects of tobacco smoke. This general power ensures that we can make provision for these kinds of special cases, although subsection (2) sets out the principal areas where we intend to make such exemptions.
<a name="gc_time_3"></a>
<a name="60424-24_time0"></a><h5>5 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60424-24_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_79"></a>Subsection (3) specifically precludes any exemption being made for licensed premises and qualifying clubs licensed under the Licensing Act 2003 and operating under a club premises certificate. In other words, it means that all membership clubs and places such as pubs, bars and nightclubs will be entirely smoke-free. We are deliberately not listing all the places that will be exempt from smoke-free legislation in the Bill. It is important that we retain flexibility to change the exemptions in the future if, for example, we find that a place that ought to be exempted under the European Convention on Human Rights has not been included. If we needed to amend primary legislation to do that, there could be lengthy delays while we waited for parliamentary time.
</p>

<a name="60424-24_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_80"></a>I reiterate, however, that any exemptions made under Clause 3 will be tightly defined in regulations, and all exemptions will be set out in detail in draft regulations, on which we will consult. The Government are committed to conducting a full public consultation on regulatory proposals for exemptions, in addition to requiring draft regulations on exemptions to be passed through the affirmative parliamentary route.
</p>

<a name="60424-24_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_81"></a>I turn now to the specific amendments in this group. Amendment No. 11 seeks to remove Clause 3(2), which provides the power to make exemptions for premises where a person has his home or is living, whether permanently or temporarily. I have to say that I was rather surprised by this amendment, given the other amendments tabled in the noble Lords&#039; names. I do not believe that this amendment is desirable, however keen we may be to limit exposure to the harmful effects of second-hand smoke. Smoking remains a legal activity, and we are not seeking to legislate against people smoking in their own private space. Not only do we believe that that is the right approach, but we are also mindful of our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights on the right to respect for private life.
</p>

<a name="60424-24_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_82"></a>Amendment No. 12, in the names of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, and the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, would change the list of examples in the subsection, so that it specifically excluded hotels, care homes, prisons and other places where persons may be detained. These are all areas whether the Government believe limited exemptions should be allowed, as they act as a person&#039;s permanent or temporary home.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC21"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column GC21</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60424-24_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_83"></a>I appreciate that there are concerns about how workers and non-smoking residents in these places can be protected. I assure noble Lords that conditions and limitations will be linked to any exemptions provided primarily to best protect others from second-hand smoke exposure, whether they are other people who also call the premises home or people for whom the premises is their workplace. Those conditions are likely to limit smoking to specific rooms within a premises that have been designated for smoking by management, together with other conditions, which are likely to be similar to those contained in Scotland&#039;s smoke-free legislation, including that, first, any room for smoking is to have a ceiling, solid floor-to-ceiling walls and a closing door; secondly, that any room for smoking is to be clearly marked as such; and thirdly, that any room for smoking is not to have a ventilation system that ventilates from the room where smoking may occur to any smoke-free parts of the premises.
</p>

<a name="60424-24_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_84"></a>Clause 3(5) provides the powers to provide exemptions only when certain conditions are satisfied. Apart from specifically designated rooms, premises such as hotels, adult care homes, adult hospices and prisons will be required to be smoke-free in all common areas in order to protect people from exposure to second-hand smoke.
</p>

<a name="60424-24_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_85"></a>With regard to Amendment No. 13 in the name of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, we have no intention of making exemptions for hospitals. Indeed, the Government committed, in the <i>Choosing Health</i> White Paper, that all NHS hospitals and other buildings would be smoke-free by the end of this year. However, we are considering the specific issue of smoking in mental health units. If smoking is allowed to continue in these places, we envisage imposing conditions that would limit smoking to specific rooms designated by management, as described in relation to the previous amendment. We will certainly reflect on the points made by the noble Earl in his remarks.
</p>

<a name="60424-24_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_86"></a>Amendment No. 15 looks to include an exemption for specialist tobacconists on the face of the Bill. I have already explained that we do not wish to include every one-off exemption in the Bill, which already allows us to make such an exemption through regulations. The Government are still considering the issue of specialist tobacconists in consultation with the relevant trade body. Decisions about an exemption for this specific retail segment will be made after consideration of the full range of issues.
</p>

<a name="60424-24_para19"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_87"></a>Amendment No. 16 adds a specific exemption for tobacco testing facilities. As my honourable friend the public health Minister, Caroline Flint, said in the other place, the Government are likely to make exemptions for premises used for the statutory testing of tobacco products as well as for medical research purposes on the basis that smoking is integral to the research being conducted.
</p>

<a name="60424-24_para20"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_88"></a>On Amendment No. 21, we recognise that a potential contradiction exists in that some premises may be both licensed premises and someone&#039;s home, whether permanently or temporarily. Clause3(4) therefore makes it clear that where premises operate <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC22"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column GC22</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

under a licence or a club premises certificate, only the section of the premises that is private residential space can be exempted from the smoke-free legislation. On the specific point raised by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, my understanding is that pub managers can invite whomever they like into their own home, and that remains the position.
</p>

<a name="60424-24_para21"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_89"></a>Clause 3(4) is simply an enabling measure that will ensure that premises such as hotels retain the option to allow smoking in some or all of their bedrooms if it is also a licensed premises&#151;for example, because it has a bar, or because it has mini-bars in the hotel bedrooms. It also means that a publican who lives in his pub will be able to smoke in the areas that are clearly his private residential space. I hope that this provides reassurance about subsection (4). Premises that are to be exempt will remain exempt indefinitely, but we will review the legislation, including exemptions, after three years.

That is excellent news, and it shows that the Government are less than wholly draconian. Why, therefore, can there not be separate, sealed-off smoking rooms in office blocks, factories, and so on? There is no logic in applying something to one group of people and not to others.
</p>

<a name="60424-25_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_90"></a>Secondly, the Minister said that smoking should be banned altogether in hospitals, even for long-stay patients.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_91"></a>Finally, the Minister said that people will be allowed to smoke in the bedrooms of licensed hotels, but he said nothing about unlicensed hotels.

Bearing in mind the Government&#039;s view on this, one can have no quarrel with that. But I wonder whether he ought to advise hospitals not to extend bans to hospital grounds, so that there is a certain amount of safety, particularly for nurses who work in them.

Unless the Minister feels crystal clear about how he wishes to respond, he may wish to take it away for consideration. Unless an appropriate exemption is provided for the type of smoking to which the amendment refers, the proposed comprehensive ban on smoking will have a discriminatory effect on certain ethnic and religious cultures. The smoking of shisha or hookah pipes is a part of certain cultures, particularly the Middle Eastern and Muslim communities, and it takes place in an increasing number of recreational places such as restaurants and cafes. While tobacco is not generally smoked in such pipes, the Bill seems to make no distinction between the smoking of tobacco <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60424-25_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   As the noble Lord said, the amendment proposes that places where pipe smoking is part of an established ethnic or religious culture should be exempted. I do not support it for reasons that I will explain. In this Bill, we are looking to provide protection from the harmful effects of second-hand smoke, regardless of its source. That point is made perfectly clear in Clause 1, which we debated at some length in the previous Sitting.
</p>

<a name="60424-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_95"></a>On the issue of pipes used for smoking, including those sometimes known as shisha and hookah pipes, the World Health Organisation has published research that suggests:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_13"></a>&quot;Using a waterpipe to smoke tobacco poses a serious potential health hazard to smokers and others to the smoke emitted&quot;,</p>

<p><a name="gc_stpa_96"></a>It also says that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_14"></a>&quot;secondhand smoke from waterpipes is a mixture of tobacco smoke in addition to smoke from the fuel, and therefore poses a serious health risk for non-smokers&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60424-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_97"></a>On this basis, the World Health Organisation issued the following specific advice:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_15"></a>&quot;Water pipes should be prohibited in enclosed public places consistent with bans on cigarette and other forms of tobacco smoking&quot;.</p>

<p><a name="gc_stpa_98"></a>I am not aware that there have been any specific representations from any cultural or ethnic groups about this issue, but I will check and write to the noble Lord. The legislation does not ban smoking of particular types of pipes or of any specific type of tobacco. It will simply ensure that, for health reasons, smoking, of any nature, does not take place in enclosed or substantially enclosed public places or workplaces.

The issue is not whether any representations have been made, but I doubt that the communities that smoke these particular pipes are fully aware that they will be banned. As the Government are always telling us how much they consult numerous people up and down the country, I should have thought that, rather than waiting for someone to make a representation, they would have communicated with these communities saying, &quot;This is what is going to happen. Do you have any views?&quot; I am rather alarmed to hear that the Government have not done that but are waiting for someone in one of those communities to come forward. I just hope that some publicity will arise from this Committee stage to ensure that they make proper representations. I will certainly raise this again at Report because significant numbers of people will be affected. At the very least, they must be given the chance to make representations and to be listened to. I hope, from the Government&#039;s point of view, that they will understand the reasons. I wonder whether they will. With that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

(b) a place is being used as a studio or set for the purpose of recording (whether cinematically or by video) or rehearsing such a performance; and

<br>
the place in question shall not be treated as smoke-free during and for the purpose of such a performance or rehearsal.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="gc_st_60"></a>The noble Earl said: Whether we are in favour of smoking restrictions or whether we are against them, I hope that most of us would agree that in terms of long-term health risks there is such a thing as a <i>de minimis</i> level of environmental tobacco smoke about which we do not need to become greatly exercised. That is so even within the terms of the Bill itself. Clause 8, for example, says that where someone in charge of smoke-free premises becomes aware of a person who is smoking, he must take steps to get that person to stop smoking. It does not say that if someone in a smoke-free place is found to be smoking, everyone should be evacuated from the room and allowed back only when there has been a complete change of air.
</p>

<a name="60424-25_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_101"></a>The Bill is not designed or intended to protect us from exposure to smoke in any quantity, however tiny; it is intended only to protect us from smoke in significant quantities. We therefore have to keep a sense of proportion in looking at the Bill&#039;s provisions. One important area where a sense of proportion should apply is that of theatrical productions.
</p>

<a name="60424-25_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_102"></a>Many plays in the standard theatrical repertoire would be rendered artistically impossible&#151;indeed, risible&#151;if the actors were prevented by law from smoking when performing in them. In some plays, smoking is required by the text: for example, in all plays by Ibsen, except one; in almost all plays by No&#235;l Coward; in all plays by Simon Gray; and, perhaps most notably, in John Osborne&#039;s &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;. That seminal British post-war play simply could not be performed without Jimmy Porter being able to smoke a pipe.
</p>

<a name="60424-25_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_103"></a>The same principle applies to any drama involving a historical character for whom smoking was such a well-known characteristic as to be almost inseparable from the person. A recent example of this was the Royal Shakespeare Company production of &quot;Tynan&quot;, a one-man show with Corin Redgrave about Kenneth Tynan.
</p>

<a name="60424-25_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_104"></a>It is worth saying that there is a legal issue here: in the case of any play in copyright&#151;that is, any play whose author is alive or died less than 75 years ago&#151;the text cannot be changed without express <br>&nbsp;<br>

authorisation of the playwright or his estate. The amendment that I have tabled attempts to address this issue, along with that of cinema and television productions, which are analogous. It also says that rehearsals of a production, as well as actual performances, should be subject to the exemption. The professional advice that I have received is that it is extremely important for rehearsals to be fully exempted as much as the actual performances. If anyone here is worried about that, I say again that we need to keep a sense of proportion about what we are trying to achieve in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60424-25_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_105"></a>I am not saying that there should be a free-for-all in this area. There are many plays in which it would be wilfully perverse for the actors to smoke: the plays of Shakespeare, for example, or Greek drama. If a director were to make a case for the actors to smoke in a production of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#039;s Dream&quot;, the case would have to be exceptionally good, and personally I cannot imagine what it might be. I am not suggesting that the Bill should allow for maverick or perverse artistic direction.
</p>

<a name="60424-25_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_106"></a>At the same time, there are plays in which smoking is commonly implied by the text and is routinely included in the production. I am distinguishing here between those plays that I mentioned earlier where smoking is actually required by the text and plays where it is perhaps implied. The opening scene of the opera &quot;Carmen&quot; is set outside a cigarette factory, and in every production that I have seen at least some of the female chorus, who are the factory working girls, are seen to smoke, including Carmen herself. That is a particular and rather obvious case, but one could also point to almost any play set in a contemporary social setting and written between 1900 and 1970&#151;plays by Bernard Shaw, perhaps, but also by many others, including Harold Pinter.
</p>

<a name="60424-25_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_107"></a>Current examples of smoking on the London stage include &quot;Who&#039;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; and, notably, &quot;Billy Elliott&quot;. From an artistic and social perspective, &quot;Billy Elliott&quot; is extremely relevant, because the striking miner&#039;s family from which Billy comes continues to smoke despite everything that happens, and that fact tells the audience something that it needs to know about life in a Durham mining village.
</p>

<a name="60424-25_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_108"></a>I simply do not think that we should be in the business of making life difficult or impossible for those who, for perfectly good and genuine reasons, want to perform drama authentically and well. It does not matter whether a production is professional or amateur, or whether it is performed at the National Theatre or in the local village hall; the principle, to my mind, is the same. I hope that the Minister will be sympathetic to the case that I have tried to make. I genuinely believe that it is important. I beg to move.

<a name="60424-26_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness McIntosh of Hudnall: </b>   As I have spent my entire professional life in the theatre, it will be no great surprise to anyone, particularly in view of what I had to say on Second Reading, to see my name on this amendment.

than to take slight issue with him over his reference to &quot;maverick&quot; and &quot;perverse&quot; productions. It is fair to say that the history of theatre, certainly in the time that I have been involved in it, shows that there are many ways of presenting, for instance, the plays of Shakespeare; occasionally, they are presented in a way that is neither maverick nor perverse but does involve dress and habits that relate to a time that is not Shakespeare&#039;s. On those occasions, therefore, there are reasons why smoking might be appropriate.
</p>

<a name="60424-26_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_109"></a>I say that not in order to make further special cases, but to point out that the exercise of artistic judgment and licence is part of what necessarily has to happen for theatre and other forms of dramatic presentation to remain alive and not to become fixed in any particular time or style. I would therefore not like the assumption to be made that some kind of policing of whether it is appropriate to smoke on stage based on artistic judgment should fall to either the law or those enforcing the regulations that flow from the law.
</p>

<a name="60424-26_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_110"></a>The issue was raised on Second Reading by the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, who unfortunately is not in her place, of the possibility of glamorising smoking through presentation in theatre, television and film. We cannot ignore that issue, because there are circumstances in which the presentation of an image of smoking can affect the way in which people see it. That said, it is rare these days for performance to do that. It is much more damaging when performers, in their ordinary lives, allow themselves to be seen and photographed smoking. I find that that has a far greater impact on the way in which smoking is perceived than anything that they might do on stage or on screen. With that, I simply add my voice in support of this amendment, in the hope that the Government, having thought about this issue, will be able to say something hopeful on the subject.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_62"></a>
<a name="60424-26_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Monson: </b>   I added my name to this amendment because the issue here is surely one of proportionality. Even if one accepts the most exaggerated and absurd claims of the anti-smoking lobby&#151;such as the one that I have seen published at least twice, to the effect that 3,000 people a year died in Scotland from passive smoking before the passing of the new Act, which of course was not the case&#151;it cannot seriously be claimed that people smoking on stage for valid artistic reasons leads to members of the audience or other actors dying like flies all around them.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_112"></a>My second question is to the noble Baroness. Theatre is about illusion. That is at the heart of much of what it does. Is this exemption necessary? I was thinking while she was speaking about something that I discovered recently when reading about the famous scene in &quot;Singin&#039; in the Rain&quot;: it was not water that was poured on Fred Astaire, but milk, because water did not show up on the screen. It was a dilution of milk and water, which was apparently profoundly unpleasant by the end of filming, as one can imagine, because the studio was very hot.
</p>

<a name="60424-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_113"></a>This is a subject on which many of my colleagues have differences. The noble Lord, Lord Monson, may poke fun at differences in this party.

I was rude enough to comment on the Minister&#039;s misery at the beginning but that totally changed and he had a smile on his face. He, too, enjoyed it.

</p>

<a name="60424-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_114"></a>As I was thinking about this not being allowed, I imagined a future historic drama depicting Harold Wilson, a former Member of this House and a distinguished member of the Minister&#039;s party. The idea that someone could portray him on stage without a pipe is unrealistic. I should not have thought that enforcing this proposal would be too difficult. On the contrary, enforcing the ban is a job for the local authorities, and I think that one can rely on local authorities&#039; discretion in deciding whether the exemption is being used unrealistically. I do not think that there is a great problem in dealing with this matter, and, in view of my noble friend&#039;s speech, I think that it deserves a commendable reply.

<p><a name="gc_st_65"></a>
<a name="60424-26_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Palmer: </b>   The noble Baroness, Lady McIntosh, made an impassioned plea for this amendment at Second Reading. As a result, as I live in Scotland I tried to discover what had happened there within the theatrical world. Not surprisingly, all those involved in this sphere of the arts totally abhor the fact that there is a total ban in Scotland. This afternoon much has been said about the fact that we must learn from, and be in harmony with, Scotland and so on, but I very much hope that we can learn from the mistake that Scotland made, and that is why I fully support the amendment.

people who it would be very difficult to depict without the actor smoking. Winston Churchill is one example. I always remember Winston Churchill having a cigar in one hand and giving the victory sign with the other. He was never without a cigar. In addition, Franklin D Roosevelt was never without a cigarette, and Groucho Marx was another fellow who always had a cigar in his hand and often in his mouth. One could go on with a long list of people. How would you depict a mining community&#151;for example, the one in &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot;&#151;without the miners smoking? They smoked&#151;God help them&#151;because they had such an awful job and it gave them some comfort. People do not realise what comfort it can give to people who work or exist in stressful circumstances. So I welcome the amendment and I sincerely hope that, on this occasion at least, the Minister will be sympathetic and forthcoming.

<p><a name="gc_st_68"></a>
<a name="60424-26_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness McIntosh of Hudnall: </b>   As the question was addressed directly to me, perhaps I may say to the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, that there is proportion in these matters, as there is on the question of how much smoke we may or may not inhale. In the years that I have been in the theatre, smoking has become less and less frequent an activity, both on and off the stage. A large number of actors do not smoke&#151;and do not want to smoke&#151;but there are circumstances, many of which we have heard about today, in which it is very difficult to find a viable alternative for the authentic representation of a habit which we may all reprehend but which nevertheless was extremely common until recently. One viable alternative was the use of non-tobacco materials, such as herbal cigarettes, but a problem that we have already discussed in this Committee is the fact that, as presently drafted, the Bill would not allow that. So there are alternatives but they are alternative methods of smoking and not something entirely different.
</p>

<a name="60424-26_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_115"></a>As I mentioned in connection with a much earlier Bill on this subject that came before the House last summer, on occasion there is a necessity for the real thing to happen in front of an audience and not an illusion. Illusion is, indeed, the stuff of theatre and sometimes it is what makes theatre powerful, but if someone on stage had a twopenny stick of sugar in his mouth, like the pretend cigarettes that we all used to have as kids, the audience would almost certainly laugh and it would not add to the dramatic weight of the event. The intention of most practitioners now is to limit the use of materials that have to be smoked to the absolute minimum necessary in order authentically to portray what needs to be portrayed, but there are occasions when that has to happen.

She rightly spoke about the artistic judgment and discretion of theatrical producers or directors, and not for a second would I wish to have such discretion and judgment diluted by any amendment to the Bill or by any regulations. Indeed, I do not know whether she has seen, as I did the other day, the Jonathan Miller production of &quot;Rigoletto&quot; at the Coliseum, which very successfully translates the setting of &quot;Rigoletto&quot; into 1950s Bronx, New York, with many of the characters smoking on stage.

I should not have thought that enforcement would be any more difficult in this area than it would be in regard to any other type of exemption. I would hope that ways and means could be found to address that issue successfully.
</p>

<a name="60424-27_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_120"></a>However, in concluding, I make a further plea to the Minister on an issue that he did not directly address&#151;that is, the issue of rehearsals. As I said earlier, the point has been made to me very strongly that if actors are not allowed to rehearse using the real thing in terms of smoking materials, then it is difficult to go on stage for a live performance and do it successfully, or as successfully as they would wish. This matter does need to be looked at and I hope that the Minister and his colleagues in the department will do so sympathetically. For the time being, I thank the Minister again and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_123"></a>The noble Lord said: One feature of any Committee stage is that the shortest amendments always hide behind them or in them some of the key issues of a Bill, and that is the case with this amendment. It is primarily about membership clubs and reflects one of the major disappointments of the vacillation and change that took place on the government side in another place. I am going to use copious notes to assist me through this amendment because it is important that Members of the Committee understand the background to this situation and what we are really talking about.
</p>

<a name="60424-27_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_124"></a>Many organisations and businesses are clubs. Some are proprietary membership clubs, run for profit by the owner or operator; others are what were previously called under the former licensing regime &quot;registered membership clubs&quot; and under the Licensing Act 2003 are now premises requiring a club premises certificate for the provision of alcohol or public entertainment.

I shall deal only with England because apparently Wales is going to settle its own issues. I notice that the noble Baroness who was covering Wales on Thursday is probably unavoidably detained in Wales today. So I will stick to England, the figures for which are as follows: pubs, nightclubs, bars, wine bars and cafes, 75,972; restaurants, 19,910; residential hotels and so on, 3,686; combined residential premises and restaurants, 2,539; proprietary membership clubs of <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60424-27_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_126"></a>Just over 12,000 on-licensed premises and registered members&#039; clubs also held public entertainment licences&#151;or certificates of suitability, as they were called, for registered clubs&#151;to enable them to obtain special hours certificates and sell alcohol up to 2 am or 3 am in the West End of London.
</p>

<a name="60424-27_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_127"></a>Premises requiring a club premises certificate under the 2003 Act are probably best described as genuine membership clubs. Essentially, they are non-profit making organisations, run by the members for the benefit of the membership. Under their rules, there is accountability to the members of the club, who determine how the club is managed and operated. They are clubs that are quite separate and distinct from other licensed premises that may also be called &quot;clubs&quot;, as is well recognised by the Licensing Act 2003. They are organisations whose members choose freely to associate with each other&#151;indeed, some of them seem to treat the club as home from home&#151;and they collectively set their own rules as to how the club operates. The relationship between the members and staff is generally very close and quite unlike that of a commercial operator.
</p>

<a name="60424-27_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_128"></a>In character, the clubs span a wide range: from the Whites and Boodles of St James&#039;s (neither of which am I a member of) to the many working men&#039;s clubs (of which I was a long-term member until I lost my seat in Northampton in 1997), ex-servicemen&#039;s clubs and other clubs countrywide. It is estimated that those clubs across the UK number some 20,000. They vary greatly in size&#151;from clubs with just a few hundred or fewer members to those with several thousand members.
</p>

<a name="60424-27_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_129"></a>I have carried out a little research. I inquired about the size of the average Conservative Club, where, as of last week, the average membership was 590. I attempted to find out figures from the working men&#039;s clubs but I could ascertain only that they are bigger than the Conservative Clubs. However, it is probably not an exaggeration to say that we are talking about 10 million members. The figure might be 9 million or 11 million but my guess is that it is somewhere around 10 million.
</p>

<a name="60424-27_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_130"></a>Some clubs are financially strong but many are not, not least because of the size of their membership. I think, in particular, of those in rural areas in my former constituency. The big ones close to the Saints rugby team are huge&#151;they have thousands of members&#151;but in some of the little villages such as Yardley or Harpole, the clubs are really quite small. None the less, they all have a great deal in common and play an important social role, wherever they may be. One thing that they have in common is that, in order to qualify for a club premises certificate, they must all comply with the stringent conditions laid down in the Licensing Act 2003. That Act recognises, as did the previous licensing regime, that they are quite distinct from other licensed premises.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_131"></a>is a licensable activity under the Licensing Act 2003, as are certain other qualifying club activities. Part 4 of the Act makes extensive provisions regarding the licensing of qualifying clubs. They require a club premises certificate, which relates to the premises occupied by and habitually used by the club, to certify that the club fulfils the conditions laid down in the Act&#151;that is, the general conditions at Section 62 and additional conditions at Section 64.
</p>

<a name="60424-27_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_132"></a>In the absence of any obligation to impose an absolute prohibition of smoking in order to protect non-smokers, it is for the members of a club with a club premises certificate to determine the smoking policy of the club. A very great many clubs already have smoking policies, either banning smoking or restricting smoking to designated rooms. That was confirmed by the Minister in another place in the Committee stage of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60424-27_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_133"></a>In their consultation during 2005 on the proposed smoke-free provisions of the Health Bill, the Government suggested that, in exempting clubs, the regulations made under the Bill might require an annual vote or ballot of the membership on the smoking policy of the club. That seems to me a perfectly sensible suggestion, and it is certainly one that I would support. Alas, it was not followed up, and it is relevant to ask: why not? It would seem that it was because of the opposition expressed by pub and bar owners and operators. Today, that sector is dominated by large companies that, frankly, are now run and regarded more as property companies than committed pub operators. Their objections were that exempting genuine membership clubs from the smoke-free provisions of the Bill would create an uneven playing field. That was also those companies&#039; objections to exempting licensed premises that did not serve food&#151;then also a proposal of the Government.
</p>

<a name="60424-27_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_134"></a>There is not a single organisation that represents the hospitality sector and, within and between the trade organisations representing those in licensed businesses, there were differences of views about the Government&#039;s proposals. Often those differences lay between independent and corporate operators, and between small and large operators. None the less, the two principal criticisms most frequently made of the Government&#039;s proposals at that time were that they were unworkable and anti-competitive.
</p>

<a name="60424-27_para19"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_135"></a>The proposals to exempt certain pubs were certainly not unworkable or impossible to implement. Indeed, one merit of the Government&#039;s original proposals was their simplicity and the ease with which they could be implemented and enforced. The proposal that licensed premises that do not serve food would be able to choose whether or not to be smoke-free could not be easier to implement and enforce. There was absolute clarity in the proposals as to what class of clubs would be exempted from the smoke-free provisions of the Act, and that exemption could easily be implemented.
</p>

<a name="60424-27_para20"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_136"></a>There were two grounds for the accusation that the proposals were anti-competitive: that they would exempt membership clubs, which would then be at a <br>&nbsp;<br>

competitive advantage <i>vis-&#224;-vis</i> other licensed premises subject to the smoke-free provisions of the Bill; and that they would also create a non-level playing field between licensed premises that serve food and those that do not.
</p>

<a name="60424-27_para21"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_137"></a>This afternoon, we are concerned only with the proposal to exempt genuine membership clubs. The principal reason why they should be exempted is that they are, as the conditions of the Licensing Act recognise and lay down, distinct from pubs and bars and commercial for-profit operations. They are free associations of members, who, just as in other respects, should be able to determine their own rules regarding smoking.
</p>

<a name="60424-27_para22"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_138"></a>Is it not frankly astounding and hypocritical that health Ministers, who for so long argued for the exemption of genuine membership clubs from the smoke-free provisions of the Bill, should then be the very people who in the new Clause 3 prohibit the exemption of the clubs? Ministers cannot hide behind the free vote in the House of Commons. There were two votes on amendments: the first, to prohibit the exemption of any licensed premises or clubs; the second, to delete the prohibition in respect of clubs. A reading of those proceedings makes it abundantly clear how the occasion was managed, with health Ministers&#039; full support, to ensure that the second amendment failed.
</p>

<a name="60424-27_para23"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_139"></a>Yet, just a few weeks earlier in Committee in the Commons, the relevant Minister said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_19"></a>&quot;As for membership clubs, we believe that they should be able to choose whether to allow smoking or be smoke-free in recognition of the fact that they are private establishments run by the members for the members. Those clubs have always been treated differently from other licensed premises because they are non-profit-making organisations in which, ultimately, the members make the decisions&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons Standing Committee E, 6/12/05; col. 74.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60424-27_para24"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_140"></a>However, now, as sure as day follows night, the Minister is going to say that continuing to permit genuine membership clubs to make their own rules on smoking could jeopardise the health of staff. That was not previously considered by Ministers to be a cause for concern&#151;perhaps because they know that the risk to health has been very greatly exaggerated There are conditions that could, none the less, be included in regulations for the purpose of specifically protecting staff, and staff could not be required to work in a smoking area if they did not wish to do so.
</p>

<a name="60424-27_para25"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_141"></a>As we know, Part 1 represents a considerable infringement of liberty, for which I suggest that the Government may well have to pay a price. In my judgment, they would be misguided to compound their error by standing fast by the prohibition of a possible exemption from the smoke-free provisions for genuine membership clubs.
</p>

<a name="60424-27_para26"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_142"></a>In Committee last week it was confirmed by the Government that any votes in this House on matters on which there had been free votes in the other place would be free votes in this House. There was a free vote on the exemption of clubs and I trust that the same will happen at Report in this House. The House is surely entitled to express its own view at Report. If it differs <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC35"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column GC35</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

from the other place, so be it. There is no sanctity about a free vote in the other place and it should not be a bar on this House taking a contrary view, if that turns out to be the case.
</p>

<a name="60424-27_para27"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_143"></a>I believe that the more because, in voting as did the other place on this matter, a decisive number of those on the Government side of the House voted against the very manifesto commitment on which they were elected. We heard about that on Thursday last. To add insult to injury, the votes in the other place were not even in accord with public opinion. The public has clearly shown that it wants more non-smoking accommodation, but not to the exclusion of facilities for smokers. Even if that choice is not going to be made generally available, free associations of people in membership clubs should continue to be able to make their own decisions and not have it forced upon them, just as they may individually decide about smoking in their own private space in the home. I beg to move.

<a name="60424-28_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Tebbit: </b>   I support my noble friend. The provisions of the Bill as they are written, and would be amended by my noble friend&#039;s amendment, bite particularly hard on ex-servicemen&#039;s clubs. It sticks in my mind very clearly that last summer, when the committee of which I had the privilege to be chairman was raising the funds&#151;to which Her Majesty&#039;s Government did not contribute, I might add, although other governments did&#151;for the building of the memorial to the Battle of Britain, which is on the Embankment now, just by Westminster pier, we had a meeting to show people the work that was being done at the foundry where the bronzes were being cast. We wanted to show that work, not least to some of the Battle of Britain pilots. There are not many left now&#151;80 odd, I think, world-wide. We owe them something.
</p>

<a name="60424-28_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_144"></a>After we had seen the work going on, we went down to the pub for a drink and a sandwich. The chairman of the Battle of Britain Fighter Association sat with his pint and his sandwich&#151;and he lit his cigar. I said to him, &quot;Make the most of it. You won&#039;t be able to do that for much longer&quot;. He said, &quot;It&#039;s not what they bloody told me in 1940&quot;. We know that he will not be able to light his cigar in the pub, but it is absolutely scandalous and outrageous that we turn to men of that kind and say, &quot;You are not sufficiently grown up, in a private club of your own, among your friends, to smoke a cigar&quot;. I think that stinks far more than the smoke from the tobacco.

There was a statement that they got on extremely well with the members but the reason for my opposing the amendment is that it seems to ignore the position of employees. I think it was said&#151;I may have got the figure wrong&#151;that the number of members ran into many millions.

<p><a name="gc_st_77"></a>
<a name="60424-28_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Rosser: </b>   Yes. So presumably quite a few people must be employed overall if we are talking about clubs with a membership running into many millions. We have had fairly clear evidence&#151;I know that others will contest it but, to me, it is fairly clear&#151;of the effects of exposure to second-hand smoke. One source that is often cited is the Scientific Committee on Tobacco and Health, which advises the Government and has said that exposure to second-hand smoke increases the risk of lung cancer and heart disease to non-smokers by about one quarter. That exposure in the workplace in total&#151;we are certainly not talking just about clubs&#151;has led to about 600 deaths a year, three times the number killed in industrial accidents. It also causes illness, not least asthma attacks, at work.
</p>

<a name="60424-28_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_145"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, referred to the position of ex-servicemen. As always, he spoke very movingly about their situation. I think he said that we owe them something. We owe employees something as well. We certainly owe them something in the sense of not leaving them exposed to what most&#151;I appreciate that some will argue against the evidence&#151;now accept to be very clear evidence of the potentially lethal effects of exposure to second-hand smoke. I come to this looking from the position of staff&#151;employees. I say to myself: &quot;Why should people employed in such clubs not have the same protection as people employed elsewhere?&quot; I can think of no acceptable reason for that.
</p>

<a name="60424-28_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_146"></a>The argument has been made that members of such clubs make their own rules. I certainly do not profess to know all the details. What I am saying may be wrong, but presumably they do not make the rules concerning statutory employment law provision for those whom they employ. For example, I do not know what the provision is concerning fire regulations, but I am sure that there must be many areas of activity in which members of those clubs are not able to make their own rules and decide what should happen.
</p>

<a name="60424-28_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_147"></a>As I say, I am coming at this from a totally different point of view from that of the noble Lord who moved the amendment&#151;he did so with some feeling. I look at it from the point of view of those who are employed in such clubs and I see no reason why they should not have the same protection as applies to people who work elsewhere, especially in the light of the fact that the evidence of the effects of exposure to second-hand smoke seems to me quite conclusive.

<a name="60424-28_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Naseby: </b>   We had agreement in the Committee that when we cited sources, we gave the true source. In keeping with that, I wonder whether the two clubs could be mentioned. Obviously, the noble Lord has consulted the membership in some depth, otherwise he would not be speaking as he is, and it would be nice to know to which two clubs he is referring.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_80"></a>
<a name="60424-28_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Walton of Detchant: </b>   One of them was Bamburgh Castle Golf Club, in north Northumberland; another was Close House Golf Club, also in Northumberland. The first London club was the Athenaeum; the other was the Oxford and Cambridge Club. I talked to a number of members of staff and found that a majority view was in favour of a smoking ban. The most important thing is that exemptions for private members&#039; clubs would undermine the health benefits of the Bill, increase health inequalities and create unfair competition. Hence, I shall not go on at length, except to say that I strongly support this provision.

<p><a name="gc_st_81"></a>
<a name="60424-28_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Palmer: </b>   This is the most emotive amendment that we have discussed today or, indeed, last Thursday. I fully support it. It has not sunk in that clubs will now come within the compass of the Bill. For the 10 million people who use men&#039;s clubs, it will be a dramatic shock. It is the users of working men&#039;s clubs whom I particularly feel for, especially as they are often the poorest members of our society. It is further unjust discrimination, as the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, eloquently argued, and I very much hope that the noble Lord, Lord Warner, will take on board the moving words of the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, about servicemen&#039;s clubs.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_82"></a>
<a name="60424-28_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Tebbit: </b>   A couple of points of interest have come up in this debate. First, if noble Lords will excuse me, I will put on one of my old hats&#151;that of a trades union official. When there was a change of conditions of employment, it was always established that you had to consider whether there was any detriment to those involved. The amendment would not cause any detriment to the interests of the staff members. They have been working&#151;and, indeed, are working&#151;in clubs where smoking is allowed. If the amendment were passed, they would continue to work in such clubs. Other employees in other places would have what is held to be an improvement in their conditions. Nothing on earth prevents the employees in those private clubs, either individually or collectively, seeking to negotiate for the club to become a smoke-free area. They are not slaves; they are free to take their services anywhere and sell their services anywhere. Their conditions would not be made worse if the amendment were passed&#151;not at all. There is no detriment whatever.
</p>

<a name="60424-28_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_149"></a>Secondly, I do not want to mention Second Reading points but I must say that, as a lifelong non-smoker, I recently wrote to the Chief Medical Officer to suggest that, as some of the data on the dangers of so-called <br>&nbsp;<br>

passive smoking have been disputed from time to time, a simple, straightforward, inexpensive, desktop exercise could be conducted that would shed light on the matter. I spent 17 years of my life on the flight decks of heavy transport aircraft. I was frequently the only non-smoker in the crew. Sometimes there were a couple of us, but it was rare that we did not have at least one smoker. We were confined in a relatively small space and we all breathed the same air. All our medical records over the whole of our flying careers are held by the Civil Aviation Authority. It would be simplicity itself to go back and look at those records to see whether there was a significantly worse record among the non-smokers who were passively smoking on the flight deck&#151;year in, year out; day after day; night after night&#151;than among the population in general who were not so exposed. The medical officer of health told me that he did not think it would be very useful&#151;it would be difficult and he did not propose to take up the idea. I cannot help wondering why.

<p><a name="gc_st_83"></a>
<a name="60424-29_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </b>   I am a signatory to this amendment. Someone asked why private clubs should be exempted. There is one very good reason: the Labour Party manifesto&#151;I am sorry to come back to it&#151;said that the party&#039;s policy was that private clubs should be exempted. People may very well have voted on that basis, and on the basis that they trusted that if the Labour Party regained office they would hold to that manifesto commitment. That commitment is important because it involves the freedom of the individual. The overriding reason why private clubs should not be included is that the party that is now in power promised that it would not legislate for private clubs to be debarred from deciding their own policy on smoking. That really should be reason enough. Many other grave reasons have been put before the Committee so far this afternoon and I do not want to repeat them, but I remind the Committee that the Secretary of State herself in the House of Commons recommended in the original Bill that private clubs should be exempt from the smoking ban.
</p>

<a name="60424-29_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_150"></a>I also remind the Committee that the Government believe that private clubs are such responsible bodies with responsible members that they should be enabled to decide whether women join their clubs. If they have the power to exclude women, surely to God they are responsible enough to decide whether people should be able to smoke in their clubs. After all, it will be the members&#039; decision. It will not be a decision imposed on them by the brewers or a pub chain; they will vote, in full knowledge of any dangers involved&#151;which, as the Committee knows, I believe are much exaggerated&#151;and the majority will carry. Most clubs&#151;certainly the one to which I belong&#151;will accept that. That is a perfectly reasonable thing for us to allow, even in this most illiberal Bill.

<a name="60424-29_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_152"></a>The question that worries me about this talk of workers is: how were they consulted? Were they consulted? What were the results of the consultation? I am not talking about consultations with the trade unions, which are politically correct about smoking. What consultation was made with the workers in the pubs and clubs? Last December, we had a debate about smoking in this place. We decided that we would ban smoking in all but one small place. It is true that we were liberal enough to allow people to smoke outside. I well remember that, during that debate, we were told that the workers were adamant that they wanted the ban, but when I spoke to quite a few of the workers afterwards, they said, &quot;We didn&#039;t want the ban, but our trade unions did&quot;. That is quite different.
</p>

<a name="60424-29_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_153"></a>I wonder whether the workers on the ground, in the bars, have been consulted. If they have, all well and good&#151;and I hope that they have. But it is different if only their trade unions were consulted, because, as far as I can see, their trade unions all believe that there should be a ban on smoking, although, if you are a trade union member and make contributions to it, it is duty-bound to protect your position. I fear that the trade unions are not protecting the position of many of their members who want to continue to smoke at some time during their work. It is perfectly possible for that to be done, as we heard in our discussions on Thursday, by complete separation. If I was a trade union representative&#151;and I have been, at local, regional and national levels&#151;I would have insisted that the minority of my members should have been protected and given some consideration.
</p>

<a name="60424-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_154"></a>Perhaps I have taken that a little wider than I intended, but I come back to the position that, if private clubs are considered responsible enough to regulate themselves in most ways, why on earth should they not be trusted to regulate themselves in relation to passive smoking?

<a name="60424-29_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Russell-Johnston: </b>   I intend to add only two sentences to the words of the noble Lord who just sat down. His emphasis on what was contained in the Labour Party manifesto was understandable and reasonable. But for me what is totally unacceptable in the proposals is the idea that government should legislate for what private clubs do and for what people do in private. That is wrong and illiberal.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_85"></a>
<a name="60424-29_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rosser: </b>   The point has been made that this would not worsen the conditions of the staff and employees, but the amendment would deny them the protection that is being offered to virtually every other employee.

worsened. That may not be the noble Lord&#039;s view, but some workers may feel that a right that they have previously enjoyed is being taken away from them by an officious government.

<a name="60424-29_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Rosser: </b>   I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, will correct me, but I think that it was his argument that the amendment would not worsen the conditions of the employees, and he then went on&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_88"></a>
<a name="60424-29_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Tebbit: </b>   How can the noble Lord say that? The condition of these employees at the moment is that they work in clubs where there is smoking. The Bill proposes to change that for all those people. The amendment says, &quot;No, don&#039;t change it for some of them&quot;. That is not a worsening of anyone&#039;s condition.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_89"></a>
<a name="60424-29_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Rosser: </b>   I was just saying that that was the point that the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, was making about the amendment that has been moved&#151;that it does not change the conditions, but leaves them as they were. The conditions were not changing or worsening. It was in that context that I made my statement, which was picked up by the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart. I was referring to what the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, had said. I was then going to say that, although the amendment would not change their conditions, it would deny them the protection from the effects of second-hand smoke that is being extended to everyone else.
</p>

<a name="60424-29_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_155"></a>The other argument was that employees could always go along and negotiate with their employer about an area becoming smoke-free. Presumably, if they did not get their way and were not able to achieve that, they could move on elsewhere. However, that argument could have been used over the years against any of the statutory improvements in working conditions or conditions of service that have ever been enacted.

<p><a name="gc_st_90"></a>
<a name="60424-29_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Monson: </b>   The noble Lord just said that, if the amendment were accepted, workers in clubs would be denied the protection from second-hand smoke that is being extended to everyone else. However, they will have exactly the same protection as nurses in care homes, prison warders in prisons and chambermaids in hotels.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_91"></a>
<a name="60424-29_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   As the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, has made clear, Amendment No. 19 would reinstate the possibility of exempting membership clubs from the smoke-free provisions. I certainly do not doubt the strength and sincerity of the noble Lord&#039;s views on this issue. However, as I have already said at earlier stages, the vote on Report in the other place was decisively in favour of extending smoke-free legislation to all pubs and private members&#039; clubs. The clear view by a 200 majority across all the parties was that private members&#039; clubs should be treated in the same way as other enclosed public places and workplaces.
</p>

<a name="60424-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_156"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Naseby, is quite right about there being close to 20,000 membership clubs. But those membership clubs employ many people, so there are likely to be tens of thousands of employees, all of <br>&nbsp;<br>

whom would be exposed to second-hand smoke if the amendment were passed. As the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, has made clear, those staff would be denied the protection given to other staff. The other place clearly took the view that the right of the employee not to be exposed to second-hand smoke should prevail and thereby increased their chances&#151;if I may put it to the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit&#151;of enjoying a pint at the age of 80. That was clearly the view taken in the other place.
</p>

<a name="60424-29_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_157"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, was of course not present at our last meeting when we explored at considerable length the evidence on second-hand smoke as a health hazard. To spare him the trouble of reading <i>Hansard</i>, I should say that if he goes to the Table in this Room, he will see a copy of the letter that I wrote to all noble Lords who were at the last Sitting of the Committee, at which we set out the evidence base of the health hazards of second-hand smoke. I commend it to him.

<a name="60424-30_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Tebbit: </b>   As the House will know, I occasionally see the irony of life. A few weeks back, this House voted by a large majority, quite strongly on more than one occasion, against a view that had been expressed by the other place. We were told by Ministers that this was quite unacceptable. We were threatened with a constitutional crisis because, we were told, that measure had been in the Labour Party manifesto, so we had no right to vote against it. Would it not be a beautiful irony if this House voted in favour of the Labour Party manifesto against the Labour Party? How splendid that would be.

The purpose underlying this part of the Bill is to offer the same protection to a large number of staff, in the interests of their health, who work in private members&#039; clubs&#151;of which the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, said that there are 10 million members&#151;as is now going to be available to people working in pubs, restaurants and similar places.

<p><a name="gc_st_100"></a>
<a name="60424-30_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </b>   That was not quite the point that I was making. The reason we are given, whether by the Government or the Minister, for why we should not alter this Bill is that the House of Commons has passed it by a 200 majority, and therefore we should get on with it. The fact is that the House of Lords, elected or not, is the only second chamber we have. If we are not here to scrutinise that legislation and put alternative points of view that might not have been discussed or even thought of in the House of Commons, why on earth are we sitting here? What is the point of moving amendments and speaking to them, trying to persuade the Government that we are right and to get them to adopt a different approach? If we are not here to do that, why are we wasting our time? That is my point. I have made it several times before, and I will continue to make it for as long as the Government, through the Minister, believe that the fact that the House of Commons has passed the Bill is the end of the matter, and that we can talk as much as we like and make reasonable, even unanswerable arguments, but we are still going to have the Bill as it came from the Commons.

</p>

<a name="60424-30_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_160"></a>The question of private members&#039; clubs boils down to two issues. The noble Lord, Lord Walton, said that it was a competitive issue with the big boys, but noble colleagues will know that to say that the big pub chains cannot cope with little members&#039; clubs is not the real world. They more than cope with little members&#039; clubs&#151;even with big members&#039; clubs. We can put that issue aside. However, I need to speak to two other issues in moving the amendment.
</p>

<a name="60424-30_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_161"></a>The first is the employee dimension. The noble Lords, Lord Rosser and Lord Walton, and, I sense, others are now shifting the emphasis of the anti-private members&#039; clubs argument to the undermining of employees&#039; health. That did not appear to affect Government Ministers until Report stage in the House of Commons, but, overnight, presumably as a result of a strike of lightning, it became the issue. But the noble Lords, Lord Tebbit, Lord Monson, and Lord Stoddart, were right, as anyone who thinks about it would be: nothing has changed in the conditions of those who work in our clubs. Even if the Bill becomes law in its present form, there will no change for the many clubs which already have a no-smoking policy.
</p>

<a name="60424-30_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_162"></a>Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that a club does not have a no-smoking policy. There would be annual vote on it, which, as I have made clear, is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC44"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column GC44</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

entirely acceptable. It would be quite possible for those employees who wish to do so then to opt in if they so wished. If they did not, they may have to find other employment. But, the truth is, as my experience shows, the vast majority of them will opt in. We do not know; we have not done a poll. Nobody has done a survey of the views of employees. No survey of employees in this House was done. The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, suggested that they were not consulted in any depth.
</p>

<a name="60424-30_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_163"></a>If this was the key issue, why has there not been any in-depth, quantitative research among the employees of members&#039; clubs as to what their wishes and feelings are? That would be the logical way to go forward rather than just striking-out members&#039; clubs, allegedly on the grounds of the protection of health. That seems to me to be the first issue.
</p>

<a name="60424-30_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_164"></a>The second issue concerns the clubs themselves, which were hoodwinked by the Government. I am not saying that the Government absolutely consciously hoodwinked them, because the Minister in the other place&#151;and presumably, therefore, the Government&#151;had made it clear to all clubs up and down the country that they were to be exempt. So of course they did not petition. Of course they did not make representations&#151;why should they? Why should they waste the Government&#039;s time? They trusted the Government&#151;the Government put it in their manifesto and in their speeches&#151;and yet, at the end of the day, of course, the clubs were ratted on. They were ratted on and chucked out unceremoniously.
</p>

<a name="60424-30_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_165"></a>It is important that we should debate this issue in your Lordships&#039; House. The Government may well be right that the employees of private members&#039; clubs all want them to be non-smoking, but we do not know that. Secondly, I think it is incumbent upon Members of Parliament to consult the private members&#039; clubs in their constituencies, I hope that, for their sakes, they are now doing so. I hope they will make the results of their consultations clear to your Lordships&#039; House so that when we come to debate this issue on Report&#151;and we will debate it on Report&#151;we can do so on the basis of knowing the real attitude of the clubs. The throwing out of their exemption out came as a bolt from the blue and this will be their first chance to make their position clear. When we get to Report stage, it will be an opportunity, in my judgment, for more sense to prevail.
</p>

<a name="60424-30_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_166"></a>Perhaps I may double-check something with the Minister. It is my understanding that he said that because there had been a free vote in the other place there would be a free vote in your Lordships&#039; House. Perhaps the Minister can clarify that point.

<p><a name="gc_st_113"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 20, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 49, which is in my name. My main purpose is twofold&#151;first, to ensure that the Palace of Westminster and other royal palaces are recognised as places of work, where the employers have a duty of care to everyone who visits or works there and, indeed, to set an example to the rest of the nation. I shall say more about that in a moment. My second purpose is to give my noble friend the opportunity to confirm that all premises where the freehold is owned by the Crown, but are leased or occupied by others, are covered by the provisions of the Bill.

<a name="60424-31_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_168"></a>Perhaps I may clear up any confusion about the second point first. If Crown land were to be excluded from the smoke-free provisions of the Bill, a huge loophole would be created. Much of the West End of London, including most of Regent Street, and the Royal Parks come into that category. It is surely unimaginable that the restaurants, cafes and clubs whose premises are on Crown land should not be covered by the Bill.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_171"></a>However, the same helpful person at the Department of Health also confirmed what we already know, that the Bill does not apply to the Houses of Parliament. My amendments therefore address that issue as well. That approach is in line with that followed with similar legislation and in the other place. The practice in the past has been for both Houses to choose to subject themselves voluntarily to restrictions of the same kind as those imposed on others by them. To do otherwise would be to lay us open to the charge of double standards.

<a name="60424-31_spnew3"></a><b> Earl Howe: </b>   I am very much in sympathy with the aim behind the amendments, and the noble Lord has made a powerful case. Nevertheless I am hesitant about supporting him all the way in so far as his amendments affect the Palace of Westminster, and I will explain why. The reason why Parliament itself is not currently subject to the provisions of the Bill is not because it is a royal palace or the property of the Crown, but because of something far less tangible: parliamentary privilege.
</p>

<a name="60424-31_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_177"></a>As I am sure we would all agree, parliamentary privilege is extremely precious. It is a concept that extends much wider than the application of this or that law; it provides an important protection for all who serve conscientiously as parliamentarians, and I do not believe we should attack or erode that principle unless there is an overwhelming case for doing so. In the case of disability discrimination I am prepared to accept that the case was probably overwhelming, but on balance my feeling in connection with this Bill is that however the noble Lord may feel about his views on smoking, it would probably be wrong to make an exception to parliamentary privilege. In drawing up its internal rules, there are perfectly good ways for Parliament to respect the spirit of the Bill when it becomes an Act and it would be very strange if it did not wish to do just that. I hope that at the very least we can take stock of these larger issues before we are tempted to get fully behind the noble Lord&#039;s amendment.

The implications of that are obvious.

<a name="60424-31_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </b>   We certainly need to be quite clear about what we mean. I am not absolutely sure, so perhaps the noble Lord might elucidate me. Does it mean, for example, a palace occupied by Her Majesty? If Buckingham Palace were covered by the amendment, it would create great difficulty when the Queen hosted a state visit. Many people would wish to smoke in the palace. Would Her Majesty have to get up after dinner and say, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, you may smoke outside&quot;? If that is the situation, it would be intolerable. I feel sure that the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, would not wish that on Her Majesty, even though Her Majesty is a non-smoker and does not approve of smoking. However, she is tolerant of other people. I feel sure that she would not wish to be constrained in offering her guests the opportunity to smoke after a grand dinner. Will the noble Lord clarify that point?

<p><a name="gc_stpa_178"></a>The basic facts are that we should not be in a more privileged position than those for whom we are legislating, and we should find a way of making Crown premises or royal palaces subject to exactly the same legislation. If the Bill leaves this House with exemptions in it, they should be available, appropriately, for this House. If it does not, which I hope will be the case, I hope that there will be no exemptions for royal palaces and Crown property, and no excuses such as privilege and <i>l&#232;se majest&#233;.</i> I hope that the loyal toast in future years will not have the same resonance as it has now.

I understand my noble friend&#039;s desire to see the places mentioned in his amendment covered by this important legislation.

</p>

<a name="60424-32_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_179"></a>My noble friend asked whether property on Crown land would be bound by the Bill&#039;s smoke-free provisions. I can reassure him that any property that is not of the Crown&#151;in other words, that is owned or <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="60424-32_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_180"></a>Whether the Houses of Parliament should be smoke free is not a matter for Ministers or the Government, but for the House authorities. The Houses of Parliament are not covered by the legislation as currently drafted, but it has been the long-held position that on matters of public health and safety the House applies general legislation as if it applied to the House. I draw attention to widely-copied correspondence in March from the Clerk of this House to the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon of Tara, as Chairman of Committee, which sets out plans to replicate the provisions of smoke-free legislation within the House at the same time as this smoke-free legislation is implemented. According to the Clerk&#039;s correspondence, this is likely to involve an end to smoking in single-occupancy Members&#039; offices where smoking can currently take place, as well as an end to smoking in staff smoking rooms and in the Truro Room.
</p>

<a name="60424-32_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_181"></a>General legislation on matters of public health and safety is usually followed in the other place. I would suggest that the other place is generally smoke-free already, with all catering outlets except three and staff offices being smoke free. I hope that that reassures my noble friend and he will not seek to press the amendments.
</p>

<a name="60424-32_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_182"></a>Perhaps I could briefly respond to the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, who raised the issue of prisons. This came up under an earlier amendment, when she may not have been present. We discussed our intentions regarding prisons in that previous group of amendments. The Department of Health and the Home Office have set up a steering group to work out how best to implement smoke-free measures in prisons and we are working on the principle that, since a prison acts, in effect, as a prisoner&#039;s home, limited exemptions should be permitted to allow prisoners to smoke in designated areas.

<a name="60424-32_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </b>   I am grateful to all noble Lords who have taken part in this short debate. My aim is not to spread or equalise misery, but to spread the pleasure of clean air and a smoke-free atmosphere, which we are about to bring about for the overwhelming majority of people at work. We should understand that the Bill is about providing for smoke-free workplaces. Either we legislate to cover ourselves, or we rely on the goodwill and intentions of the House authorities. I am completely reassured by what my noble friend has said about the attitude that we should be adopting in this House. It is clear that our House will follow the same practice that we are expecting others to follow and I am entirely satisfied with what he said about premises that are on Crown land.

<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_amdt_2"></a><br>
&quot;EXEMPTIONS

<br>
(1)   The appropriate national authority may make regulations providing for specified descriptions of premises, or specified areas of them, not to be smoke-free despite section 2.


<br>
(2)   Examples of descriptions of premises which may be specified are the following, or any subset of the following&#151;


<br>
(a)   premises where a person has his home, or is living whether permanently or temporarily (including hotels, care homes and prisons and other places where a person may be detained),


<br>
(b)   licensed premises,


<br>
(c)   premises in respect of which a club premises certificate is in force.


<br>
(3)   The regulations may provide that premises or areas of premises are not smoke-free in specified circumstances, if specified conditions are satisfied, or at specified times (or any combination of those).


<br>
(4)   The conditions may include&#151;


<br>
(a)   in the case of licensed premises, conditions about what else (apart from alcohol) is or is not sold, offered for consumption or consumed there,


<br>
(b)   in the case of any premises, conditions requiring the designation in accordance with the regulations, by the person in charge of the premises, of any rooms in which smoking is to be permitted.


<br>
(5)   In this section&#151;


<br>
&quot;club premises certificate&quot; has the meaning given by section 60 of the Licensing Act 2003 (c. 17) (club premises certificate),


<br>
&quot;licensed premises&quot; means premises in respect of which there is in force a premises licence under the Licensing Act 2003 authorising the consumption of alcohol on the premises.&quot;</p>

<p>
<a name="gc_stpa_186"></a>The noble Lord said: In one sense, we have exhaustively debated the exemptions.

<p><a name="gc_st_122"></a>

<p><a name="gc_st_123"></a>
<a name="60424-32_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Naseby: </b>   Well, I don&#039;t think that the noble Lord was here when we did that, so I am not sure why he should be so tired. He has been here for only half an hour and he is exhausted already.
</p>

<a name="60424-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_187"></a>Leaving that aside, I wish to make one point. The reason that the amendment was tabled was that there is a subsequent stage to the Bill, which is a very important stage: Report stage. The amendment comprises the exemption clause included in the original Bill, as introduced and supported by Ministers right up to Report stage in the House of Commons. Its insertion would, therefore, bring the possibility of exemption back to those in the original Bill to include pubs and genuine membership clubs&#151;and, dare I say, to the commitment in the Labour Party&#039;s 2005 manifesto. So it takes us back to where we were. That seems to me to be the crucial point, and I hope that noble Lords will recognise that quite probably <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC50"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column GC50</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

another amendment will be tabled on Report. Having made that statement, I do not know whether or not the Minister wishes to reply. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_124"></a>
<a name="60424-32_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   I must be wearing down the noble Lord. He clearly knows what is coming and I do not want to upset him or disappoint him in any way. I shall just repeat very briefly what I said on the earlier amendment. This matter was considered in the other place and it voted in favour of a comprehensive ban on a free vote. We see no point in this House seeking to overturn the set of changes that were passed in the other House. But, as I said earlier, if an amendment is tabled on this issue on Report or at Third Reading, as far as my party is concerned there will be a free vote.
</p>

<a name="60424-32_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_188"></a>I should like to put on record that the position we are in now has a very strong element of public support. A December 2005 YouGov opinion poll, commissioned by Cancer Research UK and the public health charity ASH, revealed that over 70 per cent of respondents supported a total ban on smoking in public places and workplaces. That suggests to me that, whatever the rights and wrongs of the decision-making process, the other place got it right in reflecting public opinion by the majority with which it passed a comprehensive ban. In my view, that was the right decision in terms of public health and public opinion. If we do have a debate on this issue on Report or on Third Reading, I will urge that this House should uphold the decision of the other place.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_125"></a>
<a name="60424-32_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </b>   I appreciate that the Minister has been very patient but he is not by any means wearing us down. It is important that if we want to say something, we should say it.
</p>

<a name="60424-32_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_189"></a>I am very impressed by the trust that the Minister puts in public opinion polls. He has cited several times the figure of 72 per cent of people being in favour of a total ban. Although we were given the question, I do not know how the poll was taken. I do not trust public opinion polls very much. I have fought too many elections to trust them. I remember that in 1959, when I was fighting the Newbury constituency, Labour was on course to win. The public opinion polls said that it was absolutely marvellous that the Labour Party was going to win. But when election day came, Harold Macmillan had a majority of 100 seats and I was defeated in Newbury by 10,500 votes. So I do not really put too much trust in public opinion polls.
</p>

<a name="60424-32_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_190"></a>I was a great believer in the abolition of capital punishment but I rather fear that if we were to put that to the people in a public opinion poll&#151;particularly at the present time&#151;and asked them whether they wished to bring back the death penalty, at least 72 per cent would say &quot;Yes please&quot; tomorrow. So we should not put too much reliance on the Minister&#039;s figure, particularly as people clearly do not know what it means. The members of the club to which I belong in Henley quite clearly did not understand at the last AGM that they might be faced with this problem of having to ban smoking throughout the club premises.

</p>

<a name="60424-32_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_191"></a>The other fearsome thing is this: people have been frightened into believing that if they have a whiff of somebody else&#039;s smoke&#151;just a whiff&#151;it will put their health at risk. Great scientists and doctors have said that there is a great risk; I do not believe them. Nevertheless, if doctors tell the public that, they are likely to believe them, even though it is complete nonsense. I remind people who put their complete trust in doctors that there are 5,000 deaths in hospitals through medical negligence. I do not think the Minister should take too much notice of public opinion polls, particularly when the public are being whipped up into hysteria about the health risk to them of having a whiff of someone else&#039;s smoke.

<a name="60424-33_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Naseby: </b>   I did the Minister a disservice. I should have recognised that he would want to bring in another of these slightly questionable surveys that seem to reappear every half hour. As I understand it, one is by ASH. We are indebted to my noble friend Lord Stoddart for providing us with the information that ASH has received &#163;796,000 in the past five years. I assume that some government money must have gone into doing this survey&#151;that is, my taxes, your taxes and everybody else&#039;s taxes. I hope that the Minister can reaffirm that there have been no consultations with the Government or anybody in the Department of Health about the survey done by ASH. The second survey was carried out by one of the cancer charities. I may be wrong, but I suspect that were it not for the Government&#039;s support, it would not have bothered to do the survey in the first place.
</p>

<a name="60424-33_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_192"></a>It would be enormously helpful in relation to this clause if a comparable survey could now be done of the nation&#039;s Labour clubs, Conservative clubs&#151;I am not sure whether we have many Liberal clubs, but I presume that there are the odd half dozen around the place&#151;and the British Legion. Those are four key areas that would make up a percentage of members&#039; clubs&#151;I am not sure how much but it would probably be well over 50 per cent. It would be very interesting, and only fair to the clubs, which have been hoodwinked and led right up the garden path up to Report stage, if they were given the resources by the Government to undertake a proper structured survey, carried out by one of the reputable market research companies, on members&#039; attitudes to the various dimensions of the Bill, particularly whether their clubs should be exempt.

substantial sum of money from the Government when this legislation is on the statute book. Other organisations seem to have been given money by the Government&#151;I suspect that even the lottery has given some.

<p><a name="gc_st_129"></a>
<a name="60424-33_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   I want to make sure that the noble Lord does not misunderstand what I said. I said that Cancer Research UK and ASH commissioned a survey, done by YouGov. I would not want YouGov, which is a reputable company, to think that anybody in this House was suggesting that it had cooked the books in terms of the results. It was commissioned to do the job; the other two charities did not, in fact, do the survey.

<a name="60424-33_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Naseby: </b>   I understand that, but the other two charities defined the questions. I have total faith in YouGov.

<a name="60424-33_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_193"></a>I was in market research in a previous incarnation, perhaps unfortunately for the Minister.

I hope that the Minister will bear that in mind and that the Government in their consultations and discussions will put forward only proposals that they will really take forward.

<a name="60424-33_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   I was unable to be present for the earlier debate and I fear that I shall not add significantly to it. I was involved in another debate in the Chamber. However, I hope that the clause will be kept largely as it is. I know that the Minister gave some idea of the Government&#039;s intentions about hotels, care homes and prisons; and a sympathetic response on, if you like, the artistic aspect proposed by the noble Earl, Lord Howe. But the basic fact is that if it were changed to allow the club exemption, that would drive a coach and horses through the clause. A great deal of opposition was building up to the legislation from the pub trade precisely on the basis that if there were a club exemption, that would create a non-level playing field. It would not be level for employees and it would not be level in terms of commercial competition. It would be bitterly opposed. The trade would have been absolutely right. There may be a free vote for all parties on the Bill&#151;and so, in a sense, I am licensed to speak for myself&#151;but I shall do everything to persuade my colleagues to keep this clause as intact as is possible.

<a name="60424-34_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Naseby </b>   moved Amendment No. 24:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_27"></a>Page 3, line 28, leave out second &quot;to&quot; and insert &quot;unavoidably and not intermittently to significant quantities of&quot;</p>

<p>


</p>

<a name="60424-34_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_201"></a>The noble Lord said: With this amendment, it may be convenient to take Amendment No. 25 in the name of my noble friend. Basically, the smoke-free provisions of Clause 2 relate to enclosed or substantially enclosed premises. Smoking may thus take place in premises that are not enclosed or substantially enclosed. However, Clause 4 enables any place or description of place not being enclosed or substantially enclosed premises to be made smoke-free by regulations. The only proviso stated in subsection (3) is that persons present in places designated would be likely to be exposed to smoke. That proviso is virtually meaningless because it gives no idea of the extent to which persons are likely to be exposed to smoke.
</p>

<a name="60424-34_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_202"></a>In Committee in the other place, the Minister stated that it is not intended to use Clause 4 in trivial situations. So either the clause needs to be more specific about the extent of the exposure to smoke or, if the Government presently intend to designate places as smoke-free which are not enclosed or substantially enclosed, Clause 2 needs to be amended to make provision for such places. Certainly, a blank cheque should not be sought through Clause 4. I beg to move.

<p><a name="gc_st_143"></a>
<a name="60424-34_spnew1"></a><b> Earl Howe: </b>   I support my noble friend in the thrust of his argument. Clause 4 allows Ministers to extend the scope of the smoke-free regulations so that they would apply to any location at all so long as they are satisfied that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_28"></a>&quot;persons present there would be likely to be exposed to smoke&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60424-34_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_203"></a>I find the wording a little worrying. We all understand the logic of making enclosed, or substantially enclosed, workplaces and licensed premises smoke-free because if they were not, there would be the potential for non-smokers present in those places to be subjected to significant amounts of tobacco smoke for prolonged periods. Clause 4, however, seems to give Ministers <i>carte blanche</i> to declare that just about anywhere you care to name poses a risk to public health because of the likely presence of smoke&#151;not significant quantities of smoke, but simply smoke.
</p>

<a name="60424-34_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_204"></a>When we were debating the amendment on theatrical productions, I suggested that there is such a thing as a <i>de minimis</i> level of environmental tobacco smoke and that where tiny quantities of smoke are present, we do not need to exercise ourselves unduly about it in a public health sense. By extension here, the presence or likely presence of small quantities of smoke should not, I believe, be enough to justify the exercise of ministerial powers under Clause 4. The odd thing about Clause 4, though, is that it strongly suggests that this is exactly what could happen. Subsection (2) says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_29"></a>&quot;The place, or places falling within the description, need not be enclosed or substantially enclosed&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60424-34_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_205"></a>In other words, it would be possible for Ministers to designate anywhere in the big outdoors as smoke-free. Where would it all end?
</p>

<a name="60424-34_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_206"></a>It is an important question, because I sometimes think that we are in danger of forgetting the basis on which SCOTH came to its conclusion about the risks and dangers of environmental tobacco smoke. The studies that it analysed were all to do with significant and prolonged exposure to ETS on the part of non-smokers living with smokers. Beyond those sorts of study, we have to be honest. None of us has any idea of how risky or safe passive smoking is. We do not know the point at which ETS ceases to be <i>de minimis</i> and becomes a hazard to long-term health. The only basis on which the Government have seen fit to legislate now is that SCOTH has been unequivocal about the risks of prolonged and significant exposure to ETS. We have to be very careful about granting Ministers the power to initiate regulatory creep without the scientific evidence to back it up. Unless and until there is such scientific evidence, it seems to me that the powers in the clause, taken literally, are unreasonably wide.

<a name="60424-34_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Monson: </b>   After studying both amendments, I decided to add my name to that of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, rather than that of the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, because I thought it was more unambiguous and to the point.

could easily be used to ban smoking in the street. If people think that that is unlikely, they have only to think of California; in one town there, people are banned not only from smoking in the street but on the porches of their own houses.
</p>

<a name="60424-34_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_207"></a>On Second Reading, the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Cathain, who is very sensitive to smoke, as she has often told me over the years, complained about Ireland nowadays. She thought it would be paradise to go back there because smoking is banned in pubs; however, in walking through the garden of a pub to get to the front door of the pub itself, she found herself overcome by the smoke in the garden, which caused her enormous distress. There are people like that, and if there were enough people like the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Cathain, we could easily find that there was a smoking ban in the street or in other open spaces.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_145"></a>
<a name="60424-34_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   I have no doubt that the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, would want me at this juncture to declare my interest as a member of the Law Society, because quite honestly both these amendments, taken together or separately, would be a lawyer&#039;s paradise. I am sure they would give a great deal of employment to my fellow solicitors. One has only to look at the use of the words the words &quot;significant&quot; and &quot;intermittent&quot; in Amendments Nos. 24 and 25. Those phrases are not capable of adequate definition in this context to support the application of the clause. In many respects, I understand the noble Lord, Lord Monson, shying away from the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, but I think he falls into equally hot water with the amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Howe. I would very much like to see the noble Earl put down in writing exactly what he means by, &quot;exposure likely to cause significant harm&quot;. It is not amenable&#151;

</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_150"></a>
<a name="60424-34_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   Clause 4 allows for regulations to be made that designate additional smoke-free places and the circumstances in which they will be smoke-free. These are places that will not be enclosed or substantially enclosed as defined by regulations under Clause 2. They will be places where there is a risk of harm from second-hand smoke due, for example, to the inevitable close grouping of people. Examples of these additional potential smoke-free places might be sports stadiums, bus shelters and entrances to public <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC57"></a>

buildings or workplaces, but I stress that no such additional places have yet been identified or considered.
</p>

<a name="60424-34_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_209"></a>I make it clear that we are talking only about places where there is a significant exposure to smoke. The option to make places smoke-free will be on the basis that specified conditions are satisfied in specified areas and circumstances or at specified times, or any combination of these. Regulations could set out criteria that would determine when a football ground, for example, is to be smoke-free. Such criteria may be based on the density of seating in the venue or the type of entertainment.
</p>

<a name="60424-34_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_210"></a>In England, we intend to regulate the smoke-free enclosed or substantially enclosed places first. Once that is in place, there may well be a demand that we consider those places where people cannot avoid second-hand smoke, but that fall outside that definition, such as entrances to buildings. We will decide whether to use the power in this clause to regulate non-enclosed places should the need ever arise. This will be a consideration when the Welsh Assembly Government consult on their specific proposals for Wales. I assure Members of the Committee that regulations will be brought forward only as and when required. Regulations to specify additional smoke-free places are unlikely to be included in the draft regulations that will be subject to consultation shortly. In addition, any regulations will also be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.
</p>

<a name="60424-34_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_211"></a>On Amendment No. 24, as I have said, we intend to use this power only where we have identified a real risk of significant exposure to second-hand smoke. However, I do not believe I can accept this amendment. I am with the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, in some of the remarks he made. I thought he was remarkably sprightly, having come along later in the proceedings after discharging his obligations in the Chamber.
</p>

<a name="60424-34_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_212"></a>I wonder how we would determine what is avoidable exposure to smoke, and what is unavoidable. If it is truly unavoidable, how would this legislation prevent it? Secondly, I am also concerned about how we would define &quot;not intermittently&quot;. Even if we were able to define it in regulations to everyone&#039;s satisfaction, how would that then be monitored, and who would be expected to do it? I fear that this could be extremely burdensome and open to confusion and even abuse by those seeking to get round the law.
</p>

<a name="60424-34_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_213"></a>Thirdly, there is a similar issue about how we define &quot;significant&quot; amounts of smoke and how that is then measured and monitored. All in all, while I understand the noble Lords&#039; aims, I do not think that adding these specifications to the Bill is practicable; it risks making this part of the legislation impossible to implement.
</p>

<a name="60424-34_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_214"></a>Amendment No. 25 proposes specifying that a place can be designated an additional smoke-free place only if there is a risk of significant harm from smoke.

<a name="60424-35_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   I think the noble Lord may need to read <i>Hansard. </i>The point I was making was that there have to be grounds for taking this forward. As I said, the regulations would be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, which is, I suggest, an adequate parliamentary safeguard.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_153"></a>
<a name="60424-35_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </b>   I thank the Minister for giving us the assurance that the regulations would be affirmative, not negative, orders. However, I really believe that this is one of the most dangerous clauses in the Bill. It will give the Government <i>carte blanche</i> to introduce by order a ban on smoking virtually everywhere except those places&#151;people&#039;s homes, prisons and what have you&#151;which have been specified in the Bill. I may be misreading this; unlike the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, I am not a lawyer. But even I, as a non-lawyer, could make very great mischief with this clause. I was not reassured when the Minister very honestly said that stadiums could be included. That could mean football and cricket stadiums. What about the Olympics in 2012?
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_154"></a>
<a name="60424-35_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </b>   It may be a little while since the noble Lord has been to a football stadium or a major sports stadium. Increasingly, the stadiums are already entirely smoke-free. Indeed, since 1 January, the Cardiff Millennium Stadium has exercised an entire prohibition on smoking on the premises, to the universal delight of the people who go there and the staff who work there. It is already happening and it is very important that sports stadiums are covered, because there is nothing worse than sitting in a seat where the person next to you is smoking, even though you are technically in the open air.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_155"></a>
<a name="60424-35_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </b>   That in no way assuages my concern about the clause. After all, those decisions are being taken freely by the owners of the stadiums. That is quite different from being told by the Government, by law, to have their stadiums smoke-free. They may not wish to do it; a poor local club wishing to attract people may not want to debar them from watching the local football match simply and solely because they cannot smoke in the not-very-well covered seats. It is completely different.
</p>

<a name="60424-35_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_215"></a>It is the Henry VIII power contained in the clause that worries me. Once people have the authority, it is surprising what they will do and what power government-subsidised organisations such as ASH have to put pressure on Ministers. Believe me, this is not the Bill to end all Bills. There will be further pressure because the end game is to ban smoking completely. This is a very dangerous clause.

<a name="60424-35_spnew5"></a><b> Earl Howe: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, sought to make an amusing, but nevertheless serious, dig at the wording of my amendment. If he listened to the Minister, as I am sure he did, he will have heard him utter the phrases &quot;a risk of harm from second-hand smoke&quot; and &quot;a significant exposure to smoke&quot;. I suggest that those phrases are very much of a piece with the wording of my Amendment No. 25, which refers to,

<p><a name="gc_stpa_218"></a>The concept of significant harm is very familiar to us from other legislation, notably child protection legislation. It is well understood by lawyers. I repudiate the suggestion that an amendment of this kind would create a lawyers&#039; paradise. I cannot comment on the wording of Amendment No. 24 but I make no apology for the wording of my amendment. It is not ridiculous in the slightest. If a formula of this type were built into Clause 4, it would be the stronger for it. I reserve the right, if I may, to come back to this matter at a later stage.

<a name="60424-35_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Naseby: </b>   The noble Earl, Lord Howe, spoke to Amendment No. 25, which is more restrictive than my amendment. I certainly have great sympathy with his amendment. I shall make three comments. First, I thought that I heard the Minister say that the Government&#039;s attitude to the regulations would be dependent on the consultations in the Welsh <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60424-35_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Naseby: </b>   He is a very versatile Minister&#151;we have learnt that already. Are the regulations dependent on the results of the consultation in the Welsh Assembly? If so, the story is becoming a little too familiar. Half of the Bill mirrors Scotland, and the other bit will mirror the Welsh Assembly.
</p>

<a name="60424-35_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_219"></a>Secondly, the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, was dead right. This is a wonderful campaigning issue for ASH and all the other interested parties. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, will not mind me saying that he will be in the vanguard. The only trouble is that he is not quite as familiar with sporting stadia as perhaps he thinks he is. Has he been into the private boxes at the vast majority of our leading Premier League football clubs and/or rugby clubs and/or other clubs? He will find that most of those allow smoking.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_220"></a>Thirdly, we have had a good debate on this topic, but this clause is crucial to the Bill.

</p>

<a name="60424-35_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>We are today launching the new Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP).
</p>

<a name="60424-35_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a>The centre is a world first and will play a decisive part, with police forces, offender managers, children&#039;s services and other stakeholders, in protecting children, young people, families and society from paedophiles and sex offenders&#151;in particular, from those who use the internet and other new technologies in the sexual exploitation of children.

</p>

<a name="60424-35_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a>The Government are committed both to protecting children and tackling the paedophiles who seek to abuse them. We also want to make the internet safe for young people to use. Today&#039;s children are sophisticated users of mobile phones and the internet and protecting them in this environment needs an effective response.
</p>

<a name="60424-35_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a>We have shown that much progress can be made by working in partnerships which involve law enforcement, the internet and communications industry, child protection organisations and government. The Home Secretary&#039;s Task Force on Child Protection on the Internet has been instrumental in forging these partnerships and in making the case for and supporting the development of CEOP. CEOP will deliver a truly multi-agency response to the sexual exploitation of children. Nowhere else in the world have the public, private and voluntary sectors come together in such a way to tackle sex offenders and protect children. The centre will be built around three core faculties: intelligence, operations and harm reduction. It will deliver a range of functions designed to: empower <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60424-36_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Control Orders</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_3"></a>
<a name="60424-36_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department (Charles Clarke) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60424-36_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a>The Administrative Court handed down its judgment on 12 April 2006 in the first review of a control order under Section 3 (10) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 (the 2005 Act). The court upheld the control order, but declared that the review procedure was incompatible with Article 6 (Right to a Fair Hearing) of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).
</p>

<a name="60424-36_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a>I do not accept this judgment. In my view the 2005 Act is fully ECHR compliant and contains rigorous safeguards to protect the rights of the individual, including judicial oversight and reporting and reviewing requirements. Accordingly, I am appealing the decision.
</p>

<a name="60424-36_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a>In the interim, the ruling does not limit the operation of the Act. I have not revoked either the control order which was the subject of this review or any of the other control orders currently in force on the back of this judgment. Nor will the judgment prevent me making control orders on suspected terrorists where I consider it necessary to do so in the interests of national security in future.
</p>

<a name="60424-36_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a>In the Government&#039;s view, control orders are the best way of addressing the continuing threat posed by suspected terrorists who cannot currently be prosecuted or, in respect of foreign nationals, removed from the UK. It is my firm belief that the 2005 Act strikes the right balance between safeguarding society and safeguarding the rights of the individual.

<a name="60424-36_head1"></a><h3 align=center>Courts: Miscarriages of Justice</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_4"></a>
<a name="60424-36_spmin1"></a><b>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department (Charles Clarke) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60424-36_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a>I have decided reform is needed to the arrangements under which state compensation is paid for miscarriages of justice. The purpose of the reforms, which include some important changes being made by the assessor, with my full support, is to modernise and simplify the system and to bring about a better balance with the treatment of victims of crime. In summary, with immediate effect:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_0"></a>I will not consider any new applications under the discretionary scheme for compensation; I will introduce time limits for all applications;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_1"></a>the assessor will assess compensation in respect of applicants&#039; legal costs by reference to the level of    fees paid for legal help pursuant to the Community Legal Service (Funding) Order 2000;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_2"></a>the assessor will take greater account of applicants&#039; convictions when deciding the level of awards for non-pecuniary loss; and

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_3"></a>the assessor will take greater account of conduct by applicants which contributed to the circumstances leading to the miscarriage of justice.

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_4"></a>I shall, when suitable legislative opportunity arises, bring forward legislation to:

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_5"></a>enable the assessor to make deductions from the pecuniary element of the award because of criminal convictions of the applicant;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_6"></a>provide for an upper limit on the overall amount of compensation and as regards compensation for loss of earnings; and

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_7"></a>enable the assessor to reduce an award of compensation to zero, in exceptional cases, on account of criminal convictions and/or contributory conduct of the applicant.

</p>
</ul>
<a name="60424-36_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><i>A single scheme</i>
</p>

<a name="60424-36_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a>Currently I pay compensation under two schemes: a statutory scheme under Section 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 and a discretionary scheme which operates on the basis of the Statement made by the then Home Secretary to the House of Commons on 29 November 1985.
</p>

<a name="60424-36_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a>The existence of the second, discretionary scheme is   confusing and anomalous. The scheme predates the    introduction of international standards and agreements in this area and addresses cases beyond the UK&#039;s international obligations. The scheme currently costs over &#163;2 million a year to operate but benefits only between five and 10 applicants. I do not believe that the discretionary scheme can continue to be justified.
</p>

<a name="60424-36_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a>Applications for compensation already received by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform will continue to be considered both under Section 133 and the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS4"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column WS4</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

discretionary scheme. However, with immediate effect I will entertain new applications for compensation only under the statutory scheme.

</p>

<a name="60424-36_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><i>Other immediate changes</i>
</p>

<a name="60424-36_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a>Claims for compensation have increased in complexity in recent years and may drag on for several years. This reflects the absence of time limits on the process, as would be expected if the case had come to court, lack of clarity about the maximum amounts payable, and the absence of limits on legal fees, which are reimbursed at private work rates. Currently, applicants are invited simply to submit their claims for compensation and to detail their financial loss. Compensation payments for miscarriages of justice have increased sharply over the past few years and are now running at an average of well over &#163;250,000, with more than 10 per cent of that amount also paid in legal fees. In contrast, no legal costs are payable under the scheme for victims of crime, and the average amount received by each victim is less than one-fiftieth of what is paid to those eligible under the miscarriages of justice scheme.
</p>

<a name="60424-36_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a>The level of compensation to be awarded to those eligible for compensation is determined by an independent assessor.
</p>

<a name="60424-36_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a>The assessor already takes some account of criminal convictions when deciding on the amount of compensation for non-pecuniary loss, and in assessing the amount of compensation he is able to take account of conduct by the applicant which contributed to the circumstances leading to the wrongful conviction. Typically, such deductions have been modest, ranging in most cases from around 5 to no more than 20 per cent. In contrast, reductions in payments to victims of crime are much higher, ranging up to 100 per cent in serious cases.
</p>

<a name="60424-36_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a>The assessor has decided that, with immediate effect, he will take greater account of the criminal convictions of applicants when determining the level of non-pecuniary compensation to be awarded. He will also, with immediate effect, take greater account of conduct by the applicant which contributed to the circumstances leading to the miscarriage of justice. These changes will apply to all existing cases (both under the statutory and discretionary scheme) which are currently awaiting a decision from the assessor on the amount of compensation, as well as to all existing cases (both under the statutory and discretionary scheme) where the question of eligibility for compensation is being considered by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform, and to all new cases for compensation under the statutory scheme received by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform.
</p>

<a name="60424-36_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a>The assessor has also decided that legal costs in relation to applications for compensation will, with immediate effect, be paid by reference to the fees for publicly funded civil cases as provided for in the legal help contained in the Community Legal Service (Funding) Order 2000. This change will apply to all existing cases (both under the statutory and discretionary scheme) which are currently awaiting a decision from the assessor on the amount of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS5"></a>

<b>24 Apr 2006 : Column WS5</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

compensation, as well as to all existing cases (both under the statutory and discretionary scheme) where the question of eligibility for compensation is being considered by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform, and to all new cases for compensation under the statutory scheme received by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform. However, in the case of applications already received by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform or already under consideration by the assessor, the change will apply only in relation to legal costs incurred after today and compensation in respect of legal costs before today will be paid on the same basis as before.
</p>

<a name="60424-36_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a>I am also asking all those dealing with applications for compensation, including my officials, to deal with them much more quickly than has been the case in the past. I propose that all supporting details of the amount of compensation being sought should be with the assessor within six months of notification of eligibility, and I welcome the assessor&#039;s decision to make final assessments within 12 months on the basis of the information to hand. I believe that the clarifications and simplifications introduced should enable that target to be met.

</p>

<a name="60424-36_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><i>Legislative plans</i>
</p>

<a name="60424-36_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a>Currently, Section 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 limits deductions from compensation awards in respect of convictions to the amount awarded to the applicant for non-pecuniary loss. I intend to bring forward legislation as soon as a suitable opportunity arises to empower the assessor in appropriate cases to make deductions because of convictions from the whole of the award&#151;including pecuniary loss&#151;and to provide that in exceptional cases the amount of compensation may be reduced to nil because of criminal convictions and/or contributory conduct by the applicant.
</p>

<a name="60424-36_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a>I also intend to bring forward legislation to provide that the maximum amount of compensation payable under the statutory scheme should be &#163;500,000 and that the maximum compensation payable in respect of loss of earnings should be one and a half times the gross average industrial earnings.
</p>

<a name="60424-36_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a>Finally, I have embarked on an urgent review, with the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney-General, of the statutory test the Court of Appeal must use in deciding whether to quash a conviction. I propose to examine whether and&#151;if so&#151;to what extent an error in the trial process necessarily means a miscarriage of justice. I will consult upon the results of this review as soon as possible. If a change in the law is needed, we will propose it.
</p>

<a name="60424-36_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has also decided, with immediate <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS6"></a>

effect, not to consider any new applications under the discretionary compensation scheme in Northern Ireland. He also intends to have the legislation I will bring forward on compensation extended to Northern Ireland. He is now raising with assessors in Northern Ireland the other changes for the treatment of claims by Lord Brennan. In association with my own review, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland will also consider the need for changes to the test for the quashing of convictions by the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland.

<a name="60424-37_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </b>  My honourable friend the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality (Tony McNulty) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60424-37_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a>I am today announcing that John Grant, the Permanent Representative to the EU, has written to the European Commission to confirm that the worker registration scheme will continue beyond 1 May 2006.
</p>

<a name="60424-37_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a>The Treaty of Accession 2003 makes provision for the member states to apply transitional arrangements restricting nationals of the new member states&#039; access to their labour markets (other than nationals from Cyprus and Malta). The worker registration scheme was established under these arrangements and has allowed the Government to monitor the impact of enlargement of the European Union on the United Kingdom&#039;s labour market.
</p>

<a name="60424-37_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a>Under the Treaty of Accession 2003, member states are required to notify the Commission by the end of April 2006 whether they intend to continue to apply transitional measures beyond that date.
</p>

<a name="60424-37_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a>The Government&#039;s decision to open their labour markets to nationals of the new member states immediately upon their accession to the EU has been vindicated. Nationals of the new member states have entered the United Kingdom to work, have helped fill vacancies in parts of the economy experiencing labour shortages and have helped to deliver public services. There is no evidence that the entry of workers from the    new member states has impacted on the unemployment rate for resident workers.
</p>

<a name="60424-37_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a>It is, however, important that the Government should continue to be able to monitor the numbers of nationals of the new member states coming here to work and their impact on the labour market. That is why I have decided that the worker registration scheme will continue beyond 1 May 2006. The need for the scheme will, however, continue to be kept under review.

<p><a name="wa_qn_8"></a>
<a name="60424w02_wqn0"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_8"></a>On what evidence the Statement by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (HC Deb, 28 March, col. 695) that &quot;we have closed the productivity gap with Germany&quot; was based.  [HL5069]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_9"></a>
<a name="60424w02_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </b>  The Government use the international productivity comparisons produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The latest ONS release on 23 February 2006 (available at www.statistics.gov.uk) showed that, on the output per worker basis, the productivity gap between the UK and Germany closed in 2002. This means that, on average, a UK worker now produces as much output as a German worker.
</p>

<a name="60424w02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_5"></a>There has been good progress from 1995 to 2004 in closing the productivity gap with France and Germany, on both the output per worker and output per hour worked bases for measuring productivity. The UK is also the only country in the G7 to have matched the impressive productivity growth rates of the US over this period.

</p>

<a name="60424w02_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_6"></a>Improving UK productivity performance still further is key to the UK&#039;s response to globalisation, as competitive pressures on UK firms intensify. Moreover, productivity gains are likely to be the main source for continued improvement in UK living standards. The Government will therefore maintain their intense focus on productivity, with policies working across the five drivers of productivity: investment, innovation, skills, enterprise and competition.

In cases where Sudanese asylum seekers from Darfur have been found both by the Home Office and the independent appeals process not to be in need of international protection, we will continue to enforce returns on a case-by-case basis.
