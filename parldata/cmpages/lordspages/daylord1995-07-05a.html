<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether, in accordance with their positive approach to the Inter-Governmental Conference (HL Deb., col. WA100, 8th June 1995), they will attempt to clarify and limit the powers of the European Court of Justice and otherwise seek a repatriation of sovereignty to the United Kingdom.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Chalker of Wallasey): </B>  My Lords, our positive approach to the IGC is governed by the belief that the Union should do less, but do it better. So far as the European Court is concerned, we need a strong Court to enforce Community rules and obligations on all member states and as a bulwark against abuse of power of Community institutions. We are concerned that some judgments may have had unforeseen consequences or resulted in disproportionate costs and we are therefore looking at likely remedies.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for that reply. Does she agree that the admirable aim of getting the European Union to do less but to do it better might start to be met if the unelected Commission were to lose its power to initiate legislation; if the doctrine of the occupied field were to be abandoned and if Article 3b of the Maastricht Treaty&#151;the controversial subsidiarity clause&#151;were to be amended to have the meaning that the British Government have always said it should have?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, I am extremely glad that my noble friend believes our aims are admirable; I shall remember that. However, his solutions to this problem are not likely to be either the most practicable or indeed the most workable since any changes must be agreed by unanimity. The most important thing is to make subsidiarity work properly. I believe that it can under the existing Article 3b because the test in that is whether the Community is doing too much or too little. Most of us want to work together at a European level when it makes sense to do so, but not when it does not.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Thomson of Monifieth: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that on these Benches we welcome what she said regarding the Government's desire to see a strong European Court of Justice? In the light of the Prime Minister's re-election as leader of his party, will the Government now discourage the sniping that goes on to encourage the United Kingdom to renege on its backing for one of the most fundamental institutions of the European Union?

<P>
<A NAME="50705-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Thomson of Monifieth, will remember that we have been over this ground many times. The position has not changed. As I have said often before in your Lordships' House, we have concerns about some ECJ judgments. We are looking at ways of addressing them. But those who wish to speak their mind, even if their opinion is different from that of the Government or of the Opposition Front Bench, must be free to do so. We live in a democracy.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone: </B>   My Lords, is not the fundamental defect of my noble friend's original Question that it starts from a false premise and is followed by a non sequitur? The false premise is that we have lost our sovereignty and therefore it needs repatriating. In fact this Parliament is the sovereign body in the United Kingdom. The non sequitur is that, if we wanted to repatriate our sovereignty, limiting the powers of the European Court would be the last way to do it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, my noble and learned friend is absolutely right. This Parliament is sovereign. Though it may be attractive to some to contemplate repatriation of policies and to speak as they do, the reality is that if we want to make the field in which we have done so well economically&#151;the European Union&#151;succeed, we must be in there making sure that we play our full part and obtaining sensible decisions for the whole of the Union, not only for Britain.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Bruce of Donington: </B>   My Lords, without wishing to disturb anything which may have happened in another place yesterday, and animated by a desire to move into calmer waters, is it possible for some of us to concur with the views expressed by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone, on this matter? In view of the Minister's encouraging reply, will she have regard to the judgment of the German Supreme Court in Karlsruhe on 12th October 1993 to the effect that, in so far as German law affects the fate of individual German citizens, it remains firmly in the hands of the German courts?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, I am certain that British law will remain firmly in the hands of the British courts just as German law remains in the hands of the German courts when cases are on an equal basis.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-01_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Seear: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Baroness agree that, in so far as there has been a loss of sovereignty&#151;inevitable in a global economy&#151;it took place to a far greater degree when currency was given freedom to move wherever it wanted under the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, and Mrs. Thatcher, than as a result of anything which is in the Treaty of Rome?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-01_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness is absolutely right. When I look back to the decisions taken in the earlier days in regard to NATO or those taken in relation to the Single European Act in both Houses, I see far more change than I see in the more recent Act we passed in your Lordships' House. The essential point is that we must work at this <P>


<a name="column_1085"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1085</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>positively. In any organisation there will be points with which we disagree. Those can be changed. If we need to change legislation within the European Union because it is not meeting the needs of the European Union and its member countries, then it must be changed on the same legal basis as that upon which it was first enacted.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>   My Lords, when there are judgments from the European Court which appear perverse or are against British interests, is it because the Treaty of Rome is wrong or because the court has interpreted the Treaty of Rome wrongly?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-01_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, I cannot comment on the European Court of Justice's interpretation&#151;I am not a lawyer and I would not deem it right to do so. I have made it perfectly clear in your Lordships' House that we do have concerns about some ECJ judgments. What we are doing is looking at ways of addressing them. But, as I made quite clear just now, whatever the treaty base, any changes to treaty articles relating to the Court of Justice have to strengthen and not weaken the rule of law in the Community. The rule of law in the Community is there in all our interests. We have to make sure that it continues to be so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that I am slightly perturbed to hear my noble friend Lord Bruce of Donington say that he agreed with what the Minister had said? I shall have to examine with great care what she said. But, on what I thought she said, I find myself in considerable agreement with her. Will she take this opportunity to refute the assumption in the question of the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, that if a judgment of the European Court of Justice is not necessarily in British interests it must be either perverse or unjust? That cannot be right, can it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-01_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, I learnt a long while ago not to tangle with my noble friend Lord Tebbit. I think it would be fair to say, in this mood of harmony and light which seems to exist a little more today than it did at this time yesterday, that we are very conscious indeed and have always been&#151;this is not something new&#151;that there are ECJ judgments which have a retrospective effect unless there is a ruling to the contrary. So we do set about changing things. But I think that the noble Lord and I work at this on the same pragmatic basis. We have to make sure that the legal niceties of our European Union meet the pragmatic needs of our peoples.

<P>
<A NAME="50705-01_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, Sir Ian MacLaurin is the chairman-designate of the United Kingdom Sports Council. Sir Ian has declined to draw a salary for this appointment, which will involve one day a month. Sir Ian will oversee the establishment of the UKSC, which will prepare and implement policies to promote and further our participation and influence in international sport. Sir Ian has considerable business experience and associations with sport.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Howell: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that interesting and revealing information. We wish Sir Ian well and we welcome this new sports council. However, it is operating in the jungle of international sports administration. The chairman who has been appointed has no experience in that direction. Nor do I believe that by working one day a month Sir Ian can possibly represent British interests abroad. Will the Minister inquire&#151;I do not think that she will have the answer to this part of my question&#151;why on earth at his first meeting of the council last week Sir Ian dispensed with the services of the chief executive of the English Sports Council and the principal officer of that body, who are the two most experienced people in international sports negotiation? That does not augur very well for the future of British interests in international sport.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord is perfectly correct. I do not have the answer to his question. I knew that they had a meeting but I did not know the result. I congratulate the noble Lord on being one step ahead of me.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dean of Beswick: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend made an important point as to whether one day a month is sufficient. With the way international sport is now structured, it has become something of a jungle. I hope that the Minister will listen with care to what my noble friend said. If there is any need to review the case, it should be referred to the new appointee, whoever it may be after today's announcement regarding the new Cabinet.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, the day-to-day management of the UKSC will fall to a chief executive, under Sir Ian's direction. We shall have a first-class government agency to represent us internationally. Sport will for the first time get the lion's share of sports council funding. The proposals represent a major push to revive young people's involvement in sport.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the new council should have up-to-date sports management skills? With the new restructuring and the idea of going for enhancing our reputation in key areas of sport, we need immediate experience. People who just know about business will not have the cultural background to enhance our position.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, Sir Ian really does have a super pedigree. He played cricket for Kent; he is a keen golfer; he is a member of the Lord's Taverners; and he is on the Committee of the MCC. You cannot do much better than that!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-02_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Dubs </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What criteria they apply in deciding which fiftieth anniversaries to commemorate.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-02_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, in view of Britain's long and distinguished history, there are not just fiftieth anniversaries, but centenaries, bicentenaries and so on, to be celebrated. The decision whether to participate is the subjective decision of the department concerned, taking into account a very wide variety of factors such as the perceived historic importance of the event, its relevance to modern times, potential public interest and, of course, cost.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   My Lords, listening to the Government's criteria for such celebrations, would the Minister agree that the fact that today is the fiftieth anniversary of the general election of 1945&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-02_spnew7"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Oh!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>  &#151;and Labour's tremendous victory on that occasion that, party politics apart, she and the Government could be a little bit more generous and indicate that that is an event worth commemorating? Is she aware that today the Fabian Society, on behalf of the Labour Party, is having a whole day of events to commemorate the occasion and the election of a government which put full employment, housing, a national health service and social security among their main aims? Is not that an event of significance?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-02_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, I am really upset that the Fabian Society did not invite me to its full day of celebrations because I would most certainly agree with the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, that we should remember the day when the Labour Party was elected. I believe that the electorate should remember that that was a mistake that should never be repeated.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, the Minister knows of course that today was polling day in 1945, which led to the election of one of the great reforming governments of this century. Noble Lords opposite may low at that, but history will bear me out rather than them. Is the Minister aware that we on this side of the House wish that the Government would now name an early polling day, which will lead to the election of another such government?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-02_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, it is very unwise even to make such a suggestion because when we do have another polling day I can assure the noble Lord that we shall win again. I have no intention of going through my list of the disasters of the last Labour Government, but I shall certainly do so if pressed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, having been elected Member for Huntingdon 50 years ago today, where I remained MP until the people were so wise as to choose a future Prime Minister 34 years later, will my noble friend remind the Fabian Society that six years after the war we were on shorter food rations as a result of socialism than we were at the end of six years of war?

<P>
<A NAME="50705-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, it did happen. Will she also remind noble Lords opposite that, although there was a sellers' market during those six years, the economy was weakened by excessive control of industry and by nationalisation, against which we voted and which is coming to an end?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-02_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, I say to my noble friend Lord Renton that I have a very long list which includes the particular item that he mentioned. I congratulate my noble friend on having achieved that victory 50 years ago today. While I am doing that, perhaps I may also congratulate the noble Earl, Lord Longford, who, 50 years ago, became the first Baron Packenham. I very much wish that that was something we could also celebrate. I do not see him in his usual place, but I hope that those remarks will be passed on.

<A NAME="50705-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   My Lords, while the Minister is being reminded by her noble friend Lord Renton of the measures which the Conservative Opposition of those days voted against, would it also be in order to remind Members opposite that they also voted, line by line, against the introduction of the National Health Service and that they still hold an unending grudge against a free health service for the people of this country?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-02_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, the National Health Service came about as a result of a commission under the coalition led by Winston Churchill. I remind the noble Lord that we have been in charge of the National Health Service twice as long as his party and that the amount of money we are spending on it puts to shame the amount of money spent on the service by a Labour Government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, moving to another approaching anniversary, will the Government consider commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the announcement of the Marshall Plan, which was an immense help to Western Europe's post-war reconstruction? Would it not be a salutary reminder, when some current rewriting of history is conveying a theory that the United States deliberately allowed British wealth and possessions to be lost or destroyed in World War II?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-02_spnew19"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, that is an excellent suggestion and I shall pass it on.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-02_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, having missed the opportunity to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the 1945 general election, will the Government start preparing in good time to celebrate the ninetieth anniversary of the landslide of 1906 in which the Tories were swept from the Government Benches? Would they not consider that the most appropriate way of celebrating that occasion would be to go to the country and give the people an opportunity to repeat that event?

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-02_spnew23"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, we do not believe that these kinds of celebrations should be used as a platform for any political purpose. No such complaint could possibly be made about the worldwide commemorations which are taking place this year.

<P>
<A NAME="50705-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that I find that a disappointing Answer to what was intended to be a helpful Question? Is he further aware that the reason why we are having such a huge argument&#151;and there has been such a huge argument over the past fortnight in the Conservative Party&#151;is that the benefits of membership are not self-evident? Therefore, would it not be wise, as any business would do, to undertake an analysis of the cost and benefit of our membership of the European Union so that not only the Government but the country as a whole can make a decision and a judgment as to whether our membership is in the country's interests and whether it is in our interests to continue to be a member of the European Union?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that the noble Lord is trying, as always, to be helpful, but I think that he will accept that conducting such an exercise would be fraught with pretty major problems. It would rely very much on hypothetical assumptions about the level of domestic UK spending in the absence of contributions to and receipts from the Community budget; on the <P>


<a name="column_1090"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1090</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>policies which replaced those in the Community; and on the performance of the UK economy outside the Community. Furthermore, as I made clear in my original Answer, there is a whole range of hidden political and economic benefits from European Union membership which I do not think that it would be possible to itemise or quantify in the manner which he suggested.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Cockfield: </B>   My Lords, is not the Question meaningless as one cannot sever the single market from membership of the European Union? Would it not be just as sensible to ask for a cost/benefit analysis of the head if it were severed from the body&#151;a state of affairs that the individual concerned would find most regrettable?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, being a kind person, I would not want to follow my noble friend in saying that the Question was totally meaningless. I was trying to say that, even if it was meaningful, it would be jolly difficult to calculate the matter in the way in which the noble Lord suggested.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bruce of Donington: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that neither he nor his Government can get away indefinitely with vague generalities about the effects of our membership of the European Community? Is he further aware that it is possible, at a fraction of the sum which the Government spend annually on employing consultants, to get the correct statistical material upon which reasonable judgments can be made? Is the Minister also aware that if he will not do that now, he will be compelled to do so sooner or later because this is something in which the British public as a whole, not merely statisticians, are vitally interested?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry that the noble Lord accuses me and the rest of the Government of uttering vague generalities. I thought that I was quite specific in my response to the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, when I explained the difficulties of conducting such an exercise. I then added that there were various political and other advantages which could not be quantified in the manner which the noble Lord suggested. I do not think that I can take the noble Lord further than the Answer that I gave.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone: </B>   My Lords, is not the defect of a cost/benefit analysis in this context that it would involve hypotheses incapable of verification?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, my noble and learned friend is absolutely correct. That was the point that I was trying to make but at slightly greater length. My noble and learned friend makes the point with greater succinctness.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Marsh: </B>   My Lords, why does the Minister think that it is so difficult to separate the single market from the political union? ASEAN and NAFTA are both very successful single markets; they do not have a political union. Without wishing to argue the merits, I cannot understand why the two cannot be separated.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, the fact is that we are members of the European Union. If the noble Lord is suggesting that we should withdraw from the Union but remain part of the European Economic Area, what he is <P>

<A NAME="50705-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister not aware that over the past year public support for membership of the European Union has fallen from 66 per cent. right down to 35 per cent. in Austria and from 52 per cent. down to 32 per cent. in Sweden? Does not that indicate that the peoples of Europe, as opposed to their establishments, are coming round to the view that membership of the European Union brings more disadvantages than benefits?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord should be wary, as I think that the party opposite is now wary, of reading too much into opinion polls. The simple fact is that those countries decided to join the Community after referenda, and they decided to join by a majority.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>   My Lords, but if all these matters are so hypothetical and if it is so difficult to make an assessment of them, how can my noble friend be so absolutely sure of in which direction the balance lies?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-03_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, as I said in my original Answer, I believe&#151;I think that a great many others also believe&#151;that the advantages of membership are self-evident. I accept that my noble friend does not share my view on such matters, but I could list a whole range of advantages that we gain from membership of the Community in terms of trade and in terms of the EU acting as a trade negotiator and giving us greater influence in the world, as well as all the inward investment that has come to this country as a result of our membership. I could go on.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Eatwell: </B>   My Lords, would the Minister care to reconsider his rejection of my noble friend's suggestion? Surely it might be useful to introduce some notion of scale into the debate; for example, in a cost/benefit analysis one could compare our annual contribution to the European Commission, which runs at an average about &#163;1 billion per year, with the &#163;14 billion of taxpayers' money which was wasted by the Tory Government on the poll tax in a single year. One could compare, could one not, the hypothetical costs which might be imposed on the UK Government by a Commission which directly controls at most 2 per cent. of UK GDP with the very real damage that was inflicted on the UK economy by the Tory Government, who control 45 per cent. of UK GDP?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-03_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I note with interest the Opposition Front Bench support for conducting such a cost/benefit analysis, which, as I explained, is severely impractical. There is no way in which one could do it with any relevance. As regards the main points of the noble Lord's question, I fail to see what they have to do with the Question on the Order Paper and I have no intention of even attempting to answer them.

<P>
<P>

<P>
<A NAME="50705-03_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, this is one of those possibly rare occasions when I can totally and utterly agree with my noble friend Lord Peyton. I am most grateful for his comments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-03_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that in his answer to my noble friend Lord Cockfield it might have been helpful if he had suggested that he read the Question before intervening? The Question is whether there should be a cost/benefit analysis split between our benefits from the Union and our access to the market. Does my noble friend further agree that the benefits, which he takes as self-evident, come to this country because of low labour costs and good labour relations, because of low inflation, because we speak English, because we have access to the market, and scarcely at all because of our ruinous membership of the Union?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-03_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, as I pointed out to the noble Lord, Lord Marsh, we not only have access to the market but, through our membership of the Union, we have the ability to influence how that market develops. That is the important point.

<A NAME="50705-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees   (Lord Boston of Faversham) </B>  rose to move that the report of the Committee for Privileges on the Barony of Farnham (HL Paper 85) be agreed to.
<P>

<a name="50705-03_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, it may be appropriate for me to give the House a very brief outline of what the Barony of Farnham case involved. The petitioner, Lord Farnham, is the holder of a distinguished Irish peerage. His grandfather was elected to represent the Peers of Ireland in your Lordships' House under the provisions of the Act of Union with Ireland 1800. Such Peers were elected for life and many of them continued to attend this House after the passing in 1922 of the legislation which set up the Irish Free State. However, there were no further elections of Irish Peers after 1922 so that their number dwindled with the passing of the years. In 1966 Lord Antrim and a number of other Irish Peers petitioned this House asking that elections should once again be held. That petition was referred to the Committee for Privileges, which reached the conclusion that the effect of the 1922 legislation had been to dismantle the electoral structure set up by the Act of Union and that no further elections could be made without further legislation. There the matter rested until Lord Farnham's petition. It was his contention that the continuation of the issuing of writs of summons to attend your Lordships' House after the passing of the 1922 legislation, together with the findings of the Committee for Privileges in 1966, meant that a barony by writ had been created in the person of his grandfather (the 11th Baron) to which he, the 12th Baron, was the rightful heir. That, very briefly, was the case which was argued before the committee.
<P>

<P>

<a name="50705-03_para1"></a>We were assisted greatly by the Attorney-General and by counsel for the petitioner, Mr. Jonathan Fisher. I should also like to record the gratitude of the committee for the written material submitted by Mr. John Lofthouse, junior counsel for the Crown. Mr. Lofthouse is, of course, an acknowledged expert in the arcane field of peerage law, and his valuable and fascinating memoranda helped the committee to understand the issues raised in this petition.
<P>

<a name="50705-03_para2"></a>As always in peerage cases, the Committee for Privileges relies heavily on the assistance of the Lords of Appeal. On this occasion the committee was immensely indebted to the noble and learned Lords, Lord Keith of Kinkel, Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle, Lord Mustill and Lord Lloyd of Berwick. With their assistance, we found ourselves able to reach the unanimous conclusion which is embodied in the committee's report. We concluded that, in spite of Mr. Fisher's eloquence, the case had not been made out for the creation of a barony by writ. The noble and learned Lords, Lord Keith and Lord Jauncey, have provided the legal reasons for the committee's decision and those opinions are included in the printed minutes of proceedings.
<P>

<a name="50705-03_para3"></a>Finally, I should like to add a personal word, although I believe that what I am about to say reflects the views of members of the committee. Although the petitioner, Lord Farnham, will no doubt have been understandably disappointed by our decision, I believe that it will be of some comfort to him to know that he performed a significant service, not only on behalf of his family but also on behalf of other members of the Irish peerage, the history of whose families is similar to that of his own. By ensuring that his petition was considered by your Lordships' House, Lord Farnham will, if your Lordships pass this Motion this afternoon, have enabled the matter to be settled once and for all and the uncertainty ended. That is a valuable service. I suspect that Lord Farnham would never have forgiven himself had he allowed the matter to go by default. I ask your Lordships to agree to the report of the Committee for Privileges. I beg to move.

<P>

<a name="50705-04_para0"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Boston of Faversham, our Chairman of Committees, for moving his Motion in such an able and succinct way. The House will be indebted to him for that. It is with some diffidence that I speak on the subject considering, as we are, a report of a committee of our House of eminent and learned colleagues. I am sustained by the knowledge that here, on the Floor of the House, we are all equal, with equal rights and duties to give our counsel. It is our duty, each of us equally, to consider this matter and to come to a judgment.
<P>


<a name="column_1094"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1094</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-04_para1"></a>It has been suggested that I am speaking for the Irish peerage. Not so. I speak for the rights and privileges of Members of your Lordships' House. By virtue of the Act of Union of 1800 between Great Britain and Ireland, as the noble Lord explained, the Irish peerage elected 28 of its number to sit here in our House of Lords. They had a seat in the House for their lifetime, with the rights and privileges of other Members of your Lordships' House. When they died, an election was held for a replacement.
<P>

<a name="50705-04_para2"></a>In 1922, the Irish Free State was set up. In 1966, the House agreed to a Privileges Committee Report (the Antrim case) which said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"That the provisions of the said Act relating to the election of Irish representative peers ceased to be effective on the passing of the Irish Free State Agreement Act, 1922, and that the right to elect Irish representative peers no longer exists".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-04_para3"></a>In that case Lord Dilhorne said in his opinion:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In one sense the 28 elected peers were representative of the Irish peers who elected them just as the four lords spiritual who sat by rotation represented the other lords spiritual but it is to my mind clear that they were only elected to sit and vote on the part of Ireland.</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>When the Free State and Northern Ireland were created, Ireland as an entity ceased to be part of the United Kingdom. It necessarily follows that there was no territory called Ireland to be represented in the United Kingdom Parliament and thereafter it was in my opinion no longer possible to elect an Irish peer to sit and vote in the House of Lords on the part of Ireland for to do so would have meant the election of peers to represent a territory which had ceased to exist as a political entity and as part of the United Kingdom.</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>For these reasons, in my opinion that part of the Union of Ireland Act which provided for the election of Irish peers to the House of Lords must be regarded as having become spent or obsolete or impliedly repealed in 1922".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-04_para4"></a>My contention is that the implication of that judgment was that there was no basis for Irish Peers to sit in this House. In effect, the Act of Union of 1800 had been torn up. But some Irish Peers continued to receive Writs of Summons and sit in the House after 1922. Since there was no other basis for their sitting in this House, they sat by virtue of a Writ of Summons, and based on the precedent that there was effectively created for each of them a barony by Writ of Summons.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Strabolgi: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry to interrupt the noble Lord, they sat after 1922 because they had been elected for life. It was agreed that they should continue to sit for their lifetime, although the right to elect further Irish Peers had ceased and was repealed in 1971.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry that the noble Lord did not listen closely to my remarks. When he reads them in Hansard tomorrow, he may consider them more fully.
<P>

<a name="50705-04_para5"></a>I believe that there are fewer than six cases that meet the criteria. The Barony of Farnham is one of them. The present Baron Farnham is the grandson of the first creation&#151;his father having died at El Alamein as a result of wounds. I believe that he should receive his Writ of Summons.
<P>

<a name="50705-04_para6"></a>I have been a little concerned about some of the things said in the committee's proceedings; in particular, the reference to Irish representative Peers. We must draw a distinction between the method of selection of Peers and their situation once they have taken their seats <P>


<a name="column_1095"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>in the House. I give the example of the Spiritual Bench in your Lordships' House. Its Members are effectively selected by the established Church (the Church of England) to sit in the House, but when they take their seats they speak for themselves. They do not speak for the Church of England.
<P>

<a name="50705-04_para7"></a>We must recognise that those Irish Peers who sat by virtue of the Act of Union 1800 did not sit in this House representing Ireland; they sat in this House representing themselves, as we are all summoned to do, to give our counsel and not represent any outside interest.
<P>

<a name="50705-04_para8"></a>Some of us sit in this House by virtue of ancient, or less ancient, titles; and some sit by virtue of statutory provision, and receive Writs of Summons by virtue of those Acts. If those Acts were repealed, the basis for the seat would be removed, but if they receive the Writ of Summons, and take their seat, there would be conferred on them a barony by Writ of Summons.
<P>

<a name="50705-04_para9"></a>In conclusion, I should like to quote the words of a counsel for James, Duke of Atholl, in 1735, who said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"They insisted likewise that when any one is called to the House of Peers and actually sits there his Blood is thereby ennobled and his Lineal Heirs will be so for ever afterwards".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-04_para10"></a>I hope that the House will uphold the ancient rights, and it is on that basis that I beg to move.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone: </B>   My Lords, I hope that we shall not take a great deal of trouble to listen to the debate on this amendment. Basically, it is nonsense.
<P>

<a name="50705-04_para12"></a>Looking around the House, in particular at the Benches behind me, I see that a few Baronies by Writ now exist. My noble friend Lord Mowbray and Stourton may be one and my noble friend Lady Strange may be another. Although they existed prior to the 17th century, they were validated in the 17th century by the Committee for Privileges because there was the anomalous practice of medieval monarchs issuing writs without Letters Patent. They are the only peerages by writ which can exist, and they exist only in the peerage of England and not in the peerages of Ireland, Scotland or the United Kingdom. There is not an ancient right, except in respect of those who already possess them and their descendants.
<P>

<a name="50705-04_para13"></a>Since the 17th century, peerages of all kinds&#151;whether in the peerages of Ireland, Scotland, England, Great Britain or the United Kingdom&#151;have been limited by Letters Patent. The descent descends only to the heirs male of the body because that is how the Letters Patent are framed. As appears from the report, the Barony of Farnham was not a peerage of the United Kingdom but of Ireland. Effectively, it no longer exists. It was established by Letters Patent and the descent, therefore, descends only to the heirs male of the body by reason of the Letters Patent and not by virtue of any writ received.
<P>

<a name="50705-04_para14"></a>The matter does not stop there. The barony from which the noble Lord's amendment descends was a barony to sit in this House for life. That is all it was. It <P>


<a name="column_1096"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1096</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>gave no right of descent per se to its successors. In fact, for reasons referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell&#151;I must not be taken to accept the context in which he put them&#151;it has been held that the habit of electing representative Peers to sit in this House arose solely by statute under the Act of Union with Ireland, which has since gone by the board and disappeared into the realms of history. There never was anything else to it.
<P>

<a name="50705-04_para15"></a>Such Peers sat for life, and that was the only right that they had. When they died no one else succeeded them. It was a barony for life created by statute, which is now obsolete and, in effect, repealed. That is all there was to it. This appeal is as near unarguable as a point of law as anything I have ever seen. I ask the House not to waste a great deal of time discussing it but to reject it out of hand.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-04_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Longford: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry to disagree with the noble Viscount. I do not believe that this is a waste of time&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-04_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Longford: </B>   My Lords, no, in no way. For a number of reasons, I wish that I could support the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell. First, he stands for a tradition of independence while preserving loyalty to the party, which is enviable and should be preserved in this House. In many years from now he may occupy the kind of position which is occupied by my noble friend Lord Bruce of Donington. But that is some way off. In the meantime, I hope that he will subordinate his independence to his loyalty in order to achieve office in the next administration.
<P>

<a name="50705-04_para16"></a>As I am wearing an Irish Rugby Union tie which was given to me by an Ulster protestant, I am prejudiced in favour of anything that would produce more Irish influence in this House. Of course, County Cavan is wonderfully well situated for that purpose. It is in Ulster and it is also in the Irish Republic. In that sense, I am on his side.
<P>

<a name="50705-04_para17"></a>It would be unwise of me to say that I am the only person but perhaps I am one of the few people who played tennis as a partner with the late Lord Farnham. I am greatly indebted to him because he helped me to reach the final of the County Cavan tennis tournament. He was what we call in England the local squire. Farnham Castle dominated the county courts and therefore we were given a colossal handicap. The late Lord Farnham was a fine man and we reached the final of the tournament. The local young men were terrified of the great Lord who presided over the whole scene at Farnham Castle and the courts at County Cavan. A couple of unimpressionable young fellows, who were Davis Cup players, came from Dublin. They had never heard of Lord Farnham or of me and so they swept us aside. However, we got as far as the final and I was in partnership with Lord Farnham. Afterwards, I apologised to him and said, "I am afraid that I let you down". He said, "You can't keep going all the time". I suppose that that was well meant but it did not console me very much. At any rate, perhaps that can be said about this case. He reached the final but he could not keep going all the time and win.

<P>

<a name="50705-04_para18"></a>I have another recollection of Lord Farnham which I must give because I believe that it will endear him to the House, whatever the result of the Motion. Every year there was a tennis dance at Farnham Castle, overlooking the courts. Every year Lord Farnham, who was a loyal Britisher, insisted on "God Save the King" being played. It was during the 1930s. Of course, a number of local nationalists would walk out and therefore there was always a question of whether the dance would take place.
<P>

<a name="50705-04_para19"></a>I hope that when we in this House think of Lord Farnham&#151;this House is the most loyal of British Chambers&#151;we shall think of him having "God Save the King" played 15 years after the signing of the treaty. That was the only place in Ireland where it was played and his memory should be happily preserved. However, I am afraid that I cannot vote for the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="50705-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle: </B>   My Lords, having delivered one of the opinions in the report, perhaps I may make a few comments. The position is very simple. What was referred to the committee was the determination of whether the 11th Baron Farnham was created a Baron of the United Kingdom. He was the 11th Baron and a hereditary Irish Peer. He was elected as one of the 28 representative Peers of Ireland prior to the separation of Ireland and the constitution of the Irish Free State. The first question before the committee was whether, when he continued to sit in your Lordships' House after 1922, when the Irish Free State was separated from Great Britain, he sat by virtue of election for life before 1922 or whether he sat by virtue of some other reason.
<P>

<a name="50705-05_para0"></a>If he sat by virtue of his election for life that was the end of the matter. The petitioner never suggested that a Barony by Writ could have been created in him if he was there by virtue of his election. The creation of a Barony by Writ could have arisen only if he ceased to have the right to sit by virtue of his election and he sat by virtue of his Writ of Summons.
<P>

<a name="50705-05_para1"></a>The committee had no difficulty in concluding that he was elected for life. He sat for life by virtue of his election and, accordingly, no possible question could have arisen as to the creation of a Barony by Writ.
<P>

<a name="50705-05_para2"></a>I should say to the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, that if any Member of this House who sat here by virtue of a Writ was automatically created a Baron by Writ it would have followed that all the 16 Scottish representative Peers who sat between 1707 and 1963 would, by their Writ of Summons at the parliament in question, have been created Baron by Writ. They would have been hereditary Peers with the right to sit in this House without regard to the election of the 16. Nobody ever suggested such an idea. In my submission, it is absolutely clear that no question of a Barony by Writ arises here, even if there were a competence, these days, to create it.
<P>

<a name="50705-05_para3"></a>The committee considered fully the matters raised by the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, and reached a unanimous conclusion on the matter. I therefore support the Motion put forward by the Chairman of Committees.

<P>
<A NAME="50705-05_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Mountgarret: </B>   My Lords, it is only fair that somebody should speak in defence of the unfortunate Irish Peers. I declare an interest to the extent that I am an Irish Peer by senior title and at one stage I was chairman of the Irish Peers Association. I recognise that it is extremely difficult to justify representing something which does not exist. However, having said that, I find that members of the Irish Peerage have rather adopted the role of the Flying Dutchman&#151;they have nowhere to go. They are not dissimilar to the late Sir Winston Churchill who at one time during his illustrious career, I think I am right in saying, found himself without a party, without a constituency and without a bottom. That situation is rather similar to that of the Irish Peers.
<P>

<a name="50705-05_para4"></a>It would be rather brave and some may think rather arrogant to take on the expert wisdom of the noble and learned Lords who are Lords of Appeal in Ordinary who were members of the Committee for Privileges, some of whom I see in their places today. They have had the benefit of extensive advice which I cannot put before the House because, as my noble and learned friend Lord Hailsham said, we do not wish to waste too much time on this matter. But I emphasise that this is the last call to supper as it were for the Irish Peers. I perceive, and the association perceives, that they have had their privileges and rights somewhat undermined.
<P>

<a name="50705-05_para5"></a>I know that my noble and learned friend Lord Hailsham is of a mind to reject most things that might be said which are contrary to the opinion reached by the Committee of Privileges. He will correct me if I am wrong but I believe that he said that a Barony by Writ exists only for life.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone: </B>   My Lords, I never said anything of the kind and I am in the recollection of the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-05_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Mountgarret: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble and learned friend. I had thought that that is what he said and, of course, that is not right. A Barony by Writ is created for the descendants and so on.
<P>

<a name="50705-05_para6"></a>The Committee for Privileges paid a great deal of attention to the provisions of the Act of 1800. The wording early on in one of the paragraphs showed that it appeared to be the intention of the Act that Peers would be elected to Westminster by their number to represent a part of Ireland.
<P>

<a name="50705-05_para7"></a>That was accepted by the Committee for Privileges and it gave due credence to that. But I must point out that the same paragraph states that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"all Peerages of Ireland created after the Union shall have Rank and Precedency with the Peerages of the United Kingdom, so created, according to the Dates of their Creations: and that all Peerages both of Great Britain and Ireland, now subsisting or hereafter to be created, shall in all other respects, from the Date of the Union, be considered as Peerages of the United Kingdom; and that the Peers of Ireland shall, as Peers of the United Kingdom, ... enjoy all Privileges of Peers as fully as the Peers of Great Britain".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-05_para8"></a>I do not believe that the Act of 1922 repealed anything in relation to that which I have just quoted. If that is so, one could raise an argument that rights and privileges of the Peers of Ireland have not so much been removed as fallen into abeyance because nobody paid a great deal of attention to that matter, which is rather sad.

<a name="50705-05_para9"></a>As my noble friend the Chairman of Committees said, we are extremely grateful to Lord Farnham for going ahead with his Petition as it gives us the opportunity to clarify the situation and at least we shall go down with all flags flying. I believe that the Irish Peers have been unfairly treated.
<P>

<a name="50705-05_para10"></a>In the fourth article, it is deemed that the Irish Peers represented part of Ireland. It has been argued with some justification that under the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922, Ireland did not exist politically and therefore it was impossible to have any representation of Ireland as it just did not exist. If that is accepted, as I am sure it is, I do not deny it; and if the Irish Peers were not representing Ireland, who were they representing? If the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, is arguing that they were representing nobody and they were representing themselves, then a continued Writ of Summons being received each time that there was a new parliament would seem to suggest that there is a strong case for arguing that a Barony by Writ has been created.
<P>

<a name="50705-05_para11"></a>On the other hand, if the Irish Peers were representing a part of Ireland and Northern Ireland is still a part of Ireland, and Ireland did not exist politically, then they had to represent someone and it could be argued that they were representing the Peerage of Ireland. There were Peers in Ireland well before 1800 and many Irish families paid great service to their country. They were of great assistance in relation to matters connected with Ireland and this country. It would be a pity if that relationship were to be removed because of a doubt about the correctness of the decision of this Committee. What will happen in the future? In 1800, it was not thought possible that the union of Ireland and Great Britain would ever come to an end. Therefore, no provision was made in the Act for the termination of that union. Similarly, under the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922, I am sure that noble Lords will agree with me, there appears to be no possibility of a union of Ireland with this country. But we do not know. That could happen. If Peers of Ireland were permitted to sit in this House by Writ, as some would be, they might be able to assist your Lordships. I shall not detain your Lordships any longer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-05_spnew4"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Hear, hear!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-05_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Mountgarret: </B>   My Lords, I believe that the Irish Peers have suffered rather badly. I do not think that their treatment has been entirely right; indeed, there are arguments on their side. However, I detect the feeling of the House and I believe that it would be wrong for us to go back to the Committee for Privileges, which consists of several noble and learned Lords. On that basis, I cannot support the amendment moved, with understanding, by the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-05_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Viscount sits down, could he read to the House the last sentence of the fourth article, following on the reference to Peers of Ireland enjoying privileges of Great Britain&#151;a sentence which he did not read to us and which I believe your Lordships may find to be relevant?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-05_spnew7"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Oh!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-05_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle: </B>   My Lords, in the circumstances, perhaps I may read it for him. It says that Peers of Ireland,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"shall enjoy all Privileges of Peers as fully as the Peers of Great Britain; the Right and Privilege of sitting in the House of Lords, and the Privileges depending thereon, and the Right of sitting on the Trial of Peers, only excepted".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-05_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Mowbray and Stourton: </B>   My Lords, I shall not detain your Lordships for long. I am slightly amazed to hear some of the speeches that have been made today. I had the honour of sitting on the Committee for Privileges where we were very well advised by the learned Attorney-General and the learned counsel, Mr. Fisher, on behalf of Lord Farnham, who I must confess is a personal friend of mine and whom I should have loved personally to see in this House. But we do not do such things in the way that the noble Earl, Lord Longford, seems to imagine, on the ground of whether we sing The King after dinner. If that is the law of the land now, God help us. If we sing "The Red Flag", do we go under Russia, or what?
<P>

<a name="50705-05_para12"></a>However, it is nothing to do with that. I do not believe that some of the people who have spoken today can really have read the report of the Committee for Privileges. My noble friend Lord Mountgarret talked about the unfair treatment of the peerage of Ireland. With all honesty&#151;and I am the first one to defend Peers of any sort&#151;I do not think that they have been unfairly treated; indeed, they have been treated fairly. If your country is abolished as part of a kingdom, it is not anyone's fault: it is the opinion of politics which has taken place.
<P>

<a name="50705-05_para13"></a>I have one further small point to make. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hailsham, addressed Mowbray and Stourton. I have to say that only Mowbray is by Writ, although Segrave is by Writ (my other one). Stourton is by Letters Patent. I believe that we owe a great debt to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Jauncey, and to the other noble and learned Lords on the committee. We were admirably advised and we were all unanimously convinced by the arguments put forward. No one goes into such matters with preconceived views. One listens to the case. The case as put in the paper of Lord Farnham was admirably argued. Like the noble Lord, Lord Strabolgi, I am totally amazed as to why people should be trying to fight the case as though there are enemies about trying to do them down. It is a matter of simple law to which we all listened with great interest and which has been admirably explained by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Jauncey.

<A NAME="50705-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Glenamara: </B>   My Lords, I was a member of the committee and should like to say just a few words. There is a small constitutional point involved which has not been mentioned. There is a theory, which has some validity in history, that an hereditary barony can be created if a Writ of Summons is issued in error; indeed, there are one or two cases in history where that has happened. After 1922, the Writs of Summons continued to be issued, although perhaps they ought not to have been. Whoever sends them out kept on doing so. But it was made absolutely clear that they were for life. Therefore, in this case, an hereditary barony could not be created because the Writ of Summons made it <P>


<a name="column_1101"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1101</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>abundantly clear that they were for life. Thus the petition must fail. I am very sorry, but I must oppose the amendment moved by my noble friend. I hope that your Lordships will do likewise.
<P>

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bruce of Donington: </B>   My Lords, in view of the fact that my noble friend Lord Longford introduced my name into the matter, perhaps I may ask the leave of the House to be exempt from the proceedings.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Strabolgi: </B>   My Lords, as a member of the Committee for Privileges, perhaps I may just say a few words. First, as my noble friend Lord Glenamara said, the Irish Peers did not sit by mistake. There was an original theory when we first began to sit that the Writs had been sent out by mistake after 1922. However, that was proved not to be so. They sat because they had been elected for life. Before 1963, the Scottish Peers were elected for the Parliament, but the 28 Irish Peers were elected for life. That was the reason that they were allowed to sit after 1922 until the last of them died&#151;namely, the Earl of Kilmorey&#151;in 1961.
<P>

<a name="50705-06_para0"></a>We relied very much on a view of the Law Officers of the Crown very shortly after Irish Independence in a document dated 1925. One of them was Sir Douglas Hogg, the father of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hailsham, and the other was Sir Thomas Inskip. They said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It may well be contended that if the effect of the Irish Free State Agreement Act is to take away the right of the Irish Peers to be represented in the House of Lords, the existing representatives have no longer any right to be there. On the whole we have come to the conclusion that this argument is not well founded. We regard the Act of Union as conferring on the Irish Peerage the right to elect 28 of their body to sit for life as their representatives in the House of Lords: but we think that each representative Peer had conferred on him by the fact of his election the right to sit for life in the House of Lords and we do not regard that right, which is nowhere expressly dealt with, as necessarily taken away from the existing representatives by the legislation of 1922".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-06_para1"></a>That is the point. They did not sit by accident which created the question of a Barony by Writ, although I may say here that, with all the precedents of Baronies by Writ which had been perhaps created by accident, there had always been an intention to create a peerage.
<P>

<a name="50705-06_para2"></a>Further, I understand that no report of the Committee for Privileges, of which I have the honour to be a member, has ever been rejected by this House since the petition in the Rhondda case which was sent back by the Lord Chancellor of the day in the early 1920s for very different legal reasons. Otherwise, there is absolutely no precedent for what my noble friend Lord Monkswell, in his inimitable way, is attempting to do. Therefore, I hope that your Lordships will reject the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-06_spmin0"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees:</B>  My Lords, I believe that the House would probably expect me to offer a few observations in reply to the amendment as moved by the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell. In doing so, perhaps I may thank the noble Lord for notifying me before he tabled his amendment that he was proposing to raise the matter in some way. Similarly, I should also like to thank the noble Viscount, Lord Mountgarret, for having also <P>


<a name="column_1102"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1102</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>warned me beforehand that he intended to intervene in the debate. Further, I should like to thank all noble Lords and noble and learned Lords who took part in the debate. But, as a number of them have spoken, perhaps they will forgive me if I do not refer to each of them by name. I am especially grateful to the noble and learned Lords, Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone and Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle, for their contributions on the legal matters involved in the case.
<P>

<a name="50705-06_para3"></a>In replying to the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, it might be helpful if I were to remind your Lordships of what it is that your Lordships' House is actually being asked to do. Before doing so, I should like to refer to the remarks made by the noble Earl, Lord Longford, which were, if I may say so, most entertaining. However, I must confess that I did strain myself during the course of his speech to ascertain the precise relevance of what the noble Earl was saying to both the Motion and to the amendment. But then it came to me all in a flash: it was a speech that had to be made; after all, this is Wimbledon Fortnight.
<P>

<a name="50705-06_para4"></a>A petition for a Writ of Summons to this House is not a petition directed to your Lordships: it is a petition to the Queen. On the advice of the Home Secretary and the Law Officers, Her Majesty the Queen refers the petition to this House so that the House may advise Her Majesty as to the law with regard to that petition. By long-established practice such petitions are referred to the Committee for Privileges which under Standing Order 75 is required to sit with the assistance of no fewer than three Lords of Appeal. We of course had four. When agreed to by the House, the decision is submitted to Her Majesty in the form of a judgment preceded by the words:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is resolved and adjudged".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-06_para5"></a>Such a decision is not therefore the opinion of a majority of your Lordships but a judgment. It is a judicial proceeding analogous to, although not wholly comparable with, a judgment following a hearing before an Appellate Committee. In those circumstances your Lordships may feel that the House should only rarely and for exceptionally compelling reasons seek to interfere with the report of a committee based on a judicial hearing at which Lords of Appeal were present and where those Lords of Appeal have given their judicial opinions.
<P>

<a name="50705-06_para6"></a>The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, is in the form used in 1922, as the noble Lord, Lord Strabolgi, mentioned in the course of his remarks, which was the last occasion when this House asked the Committee for Privileges to reconsider a peerage case&#151;the position of Viscountess Rhondda. On that occasion, as the noble Lord, Lord Strabolgi, reminded us, it was the Lord Chancellor who moved the amendment and he explained that he was taking that unusual course because in his view the Attorney-General had not put to the committee the relevant points of law&#151;that is the significant word, as your Lordships will appreciate&#151;which ought to have been considered.
<P>

<a name="50705-06_para7"></a>On that occasion the House agreed to refer the matter back to the committee and the committee, having considered those points of law, made a second report in exactly the opposite sense from its first report. It is of <P>


<a name="column_1103"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1103</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>course a matter for your Lordships, but the House may feel, particularly in the light of what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Jauncey, has said as a member of the Committee for Privileges, that the Rhondda case does not provide a suitable precedent for the present case in that there are no new legal arguments which would justify us asking the committee to consider or to reconsider the matter all over again.
<P>

<a name="50705-06_para8"></a>I feel bound to add that if the committee were to consider the matter further, I have no doubt whatever that it would come to precisely the same conclusion. With these points in mind, and with that background and the background indicated by other noble Lords in the course of this short debate, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, will feel able to withdraw his amendment. If he felt unable to do so, I would be bound to advise your Lordships that it would be right not to support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who have contributed to the debate, which has been useful and informative. I wish to refer to a number of the submissions that have been made. In doing so I would advise the House that I am minded to withdraw my amendment but I think it would be for the courtesy of the House if I explained why. If I did not do so, the House would not be correctly advised.
<P>

<a name="50705-06_para9"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone, in his inimitable style, discounted the ancient right of the creation of barony by writ of summons. I am not sure that he intended l&#232;se-majest&#233;&#151;I am sure that would be a wrong interpretation&#151;but we have as part of the proceedings of the committee a report which, as I believe the noble Lord the Chairman of Committees has advised us, was written by an expert on peerage law. It states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Crown has the right to issue a Writ of Summons either (i) to a person who does not have a peerage at all, or (ii) a person whose peerage does not entitle him to a Writ of Summons".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-06_para10"></a>I believe that that right still exists for the Crown.
<P>

<a name="50705-06_para11"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hailsham, also said that the Barony of Farnham no longer exists. It does exist but the old Barony of Farnham does not entitle the holder to a seat in this House. The noble and learned Lord also said&#151;and this is where I think he supported my argument&#151;that the Act of Union had gone by the board.
<P>

<a name="50705-06_para12"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Jauncey&#151;I am indebted to him for his contribution to this debate, which was welcome&#151;advised the House that Lord Farnham continued to sit by virtue of election for life. This is where I take issue with the committee in the sense that it did not consider the basis on which that election for life was founded. My contention is that it was founded on the basis of the Act of Union of 1800. A number of noble Lords have effectively said, and the House has effectively said, that in the consideration of previous privileges committees it no longer existed after 1922. The noble and learned Lord made reference to the Scottish Peers. A number of them sat between 1707 and 1963 by virtue of that Act of Union which was not changed until 1963. The noble and learned Lord also suggested that it was not competent to issue a barony by writ. I have referred to that.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-06_para13"></a>I am indebted to the noble Lord the Chairman of Committees for reminding the House that this is consideration of a petition to Her Majesty and we sit in a judicial capacity in this sense. However, I would point out to the House that we are all equal in sitting in that judicial capacity.
<P>

<a name="50705-06_para14"></a>I now come to the reason for withdrawing my amendment. That reason was given by the noble Lord, Lord Glenamara. He referred to a matter which I did not notice because it was not included within the proceedings&#151;I can quite understand why&#151;and that is that the writ of summons received by Lord Farnham had inscribed within it a condition that it was for life. That is the legal basis on which we can agree this Committee for Privileges report. I hope that we are not in error in presuming that the wording of that writ of summons makes it clear that it was only entitling the holder to a seat in this House for life because, as the noble Viscount, Lord Mountgarret, pointed out, I suspect that this is the last opportunity we may have to put this matter to bed. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="50705-07_para7"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, this is the second time that this amendment has appeared in my name. When it was first moved in Committee it was debated but withdrawn in response to a plea for more time to consider it in detail. I hope that I am not trespassing on the territory of noble Lords opposite if I say that I believe that the additional time has not been wasted. I explained the amendment in considerable detail when moving it in Committee, and I shall be brief today.
<P>

<a name="50705-07_para8"></a>The amendment introduces changes to Section 19 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1927 which presently provides that, if a landlord draws up a lease which allows a tenant to assign with the landlord's consent, that consent cannot be unreasonably withheld. The changes would permit the landlord and tenant to agree in advance the conditions under which consent will be forthcoming and provide for a landlord not to be taken to be withholding consent unreasonably if he does so because the conditions have not been made out. The changes are to apply only to new leases and are not to apply to residential or agricultural leases. In effect, the amendment represents the essence of the compromise and the basis of the agreement between differing interests in the property industry which has enabled the Bill to get this far.
<P>

<a name="50705-07_para9"></a>The point that the amendment called for more detailed consideration than was possible between its first being tabled and being moved in Committee was well made by the noble Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, and the noble Lord, Lord Meston. I hope that, with the benefit of the additional time since Committee, the amendment will be taken in the spirit of reason, compromise and agreement which has distinguished the passage of the Bill. I beg to move.

<a name="50705-07_para10"></a>The amendment is complex, with wide ramifications. It was described by the noble Earl as the backbone of the package which had been agreed by the relevant interests. The amendment appeared on the Marshalled List only on Monday, 19th June, and there was considerable disquiet, of which I was made aware, that your Lordships had been invited to accept the amendment in Committee only two days later on Wednesday, 21st June, without time for mature consideration and the opportunity for discussion and consultation with interested parties.
<P>

<a name="50705-07_para11"></a>Concerns had been expressed to me that this part of the package altered what I chose to describe as the balance of power between landlords and tenants and, although privity of contract liability was generally regarded as not defensible, the anxiety was that this part of the package was designed to enable landlords to obtain much more control over assignments once they had lost the benefit of privity of contract liability.
<P>

<a name="50705-07_para12"></a>However, as well as drawing attention in Committee to those anxieties, I acknowledged that the changes embraced in the amendment applied only to new tenancies, that the relevant terms could only be terms that had actually been agreed by the relevant parties, and that the amendment was not capable of applying either to residential or agricultural tenancies.
<P>

<a name="50705-07_para13"></a>Since the noble Earl was good enough to withdraw the amendment in Committee, I have now had the opportunity to reflect fully on the package, and in particular this part of it, and to consult with interested parties.
<P>

<a name="50705-07_para14"></a>Under the law at present&#151;under Section 19 of the 1927 Act as is&#151;landlords are free to ban assignments. They will continue to be free to ban assignments if Section 19 is amended as proposed by the noble Earl. However, under the present law the practice is that landlords rarely impose an absolute prohibition upon assignments. That is because the landlord has the comfort that, if the assignee fails, he can sue the first tenant and later assignees together with their guarantors. He can do that because each assignee is highly likely to have given him a direct covenant to honour the lease until it expires.
<P>

<a name="50705-07_para15"></a>However, a landlord who chooses to ban assignments outright under the present law is imposing harsh lease terms on his tenant and terms which are rarely imposed in practice. The tenant would find such a ban especially harsh if the lease were long. But if the lease is long, there are likely to be rent reviews. At each review the question asked is: what rent would these premises fetch if offered on the open market with these harsh assignment terms? If other landlords are universally banning assignments, then those lease terms would be regarded as normal; but if, on the other hand, as is the case in fact, other landlords are not generally banning assignments, then the restrictive landlord may well have to bear the economic cost of receiving a low rent after a review.
<P>

<a name="50705-07_para16"></a>If the noble Earl's amendment is accepted, landlords under new leases will have a choice. They can either ban assignments or they can go down the route of allowing assignments to assignees who satisfy the conditions prescribed. Where there is a choice between being <P>


<a name="column_1108"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1108</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>restrictive or not restrictive there will be a calculation to be made by the landlord about how to protect the rent at review. It is likely that many landlords will not risk their position at review by imposing a ban on assignment or by imposing unreasonable conditions, unless perhaps where they consider that the letting is of so special a nature as to require such a restriction.
<P>

<a name="50705-07_para17"></a>The noble Earl's amendment allows the creation of conditions which would have been invalid under Section 19 as presently drawn. Yet to my mind, on consideration, it opens the way for landlords to take a less restrictive course of action than they might well have taken if privity liability had been modified and Section 19 had been left unchanged.
<P>

<a name="50705-07_para18"></a>Whereas the package may not produce perfect justice in every case, I am satisfied, having had sufficient time to reflect on it, that it achieves a proper balance between the interests concerned, that it is likely to do justice at least in the great majority of cases, and therefore that it may go forward unopposed.

I am glad that the result of that consideration has been as the noble Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, indicated. His explanation of how the clause will work accords with my understanding of it.

<P>
<A NAME="50705-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Henderson of Brompton </B>   moved Amendment No. 1:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
After Clause 3, insert the following new clause:
<center><b>("Protection of Children from Violence</B></center><br>
.&#151;(1) It shall be unlawful to subject a child to violence, whether or not in the exercise of any parental right, and whether or not by way of punishment.
<br>
(2) In considering whether punishment of a child amounts to violence, regard shall be had in particular to whether the child&#151;
<br>
(a) was struck with a stick, belt or other object; or
<br>
(b) was struck or shaken in such a way as to cause, or risk causing&#151;

(3) In section 12 of the Children and Young Persons (Scotland) Act 1937 the following are hereby repealed&#151;
<br>
(a) in subsection (1) the words "assaults," and "assaulted,",
<br>
(b) subsection (7).").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50705-08_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, as a preliminary, perhaps I may say that this is an all-party amendment for the protection of children from violence. I believe that all the signatories to the amendment are present except for the noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull, who, most unfortunately, has a long-standing prior engagement elsewhere. The noble Baroness spoke in support of a variant of the amendment at Committee stage in the Moses Room. She much regrets that she cannot be here today in person to support the amendment. However, she has given me authority to say that she most certainly supports the amendment together with the other signatories. I hope that the amendment will be treated as an all-party amendment, and that there will be no hint of party politics&#151;perhaps we had enough at Question Time&#151;imported into our deliberations.
<P>

<a name="50705-08_para7"></a>I begin with the need for the amendment. To my mind, it has been clearly expressed by a community study of physical violence to children in the home, financed by the Department of Health, and carried out by the Thomas Coram Research Unit over the past few years. That research lends the strongest possible support to the need for this new clause, or something like it, in order to curb violence to children in their homes.
<P>

<a name="50705-08_para8"></a>The study involved detailed interviews with mothers of one year-old, four year-old, seven year-old and 11 year-old children, a smaller number of fathers, and some of the children themselves, from among 400 randomly <P>


<a name="column_1110"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1110</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>selected families. Like all such research, it probably under-estimates the real situation in that most parents will be most unlikely to exaggerate any violent treatment which they have given to children in the home. The rates of severe punishment by mothers, indicated by the study, must be of great concern to the country, the Government and this House. The figures would be even higher if punishments by the fathers were taken into account, but I cite the figures regarding mothers. Sixteen per cent. of all children had been severely punished, and 24.5 per cent. of seven year-olds had been severely punished.
<P>

<a name="50705-08_para9"></a>The vast majority of cases of severe punishment&#151;it is nearly 90 per cent.&#151;involved hitting the child; and the children who were most frequently hit were more likely to have experienced other forms of physical punishment. The study defines "severe" punishment as punishment involving,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the intention or potential to cause injury or psychological damage, use of implements, repeated actions or over a long period of time".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-08_para10"></a>I believe that my quotations from the study which has been so recently undertaken by the Coram Research Unit provides ample evidence for the need for this clause. I now turn to the text of the clause to illustrate its purpose.
<P>

<a name="50705-08_para11"></a>The purpose of the clause is to protect children from abusive forms of physical punishment which were designated as severe in the report to which I referred. A similar provision was drafted by the Scottish Law Commission in its 1992 Report on family law. Noble Lords who were present at Committee stage in the Moses Room will remember that I sought to introduce the Law Commission's form of amendment; and previously an attempt had been made to introduce that version in the House of Commons. In the House of Commons there was a vote; the attempt was not successful. In Committee in the Moses Room there was no vote; the Committee stage was a special procedure which did not allow a vote.
<P>

<a name="50705-08_para12"></a>I therefore withdrew the amendment in order to come back on Report, as I now do, having taken into account most minutely and seriously the objections which were raised by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate and by the noble Lord on the Opposition Front Bench. To my mind they spoke helpfully and not destructively. I was impressed by the fact that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate, as well as the Minister in the House of Commons, expressed some sympathy with the amendment. I very much hope that we have produced the right wording and that the amendment, or something like it, will be accepted.
<P>

<a name="50705-08_para13"></a>This version seeks to overcome the criticisms made in Committee in the Moses Room, in particular those by the Government. It upholds the general principle that no violence to children shall be justifiable under the guise of punishment&#151;a principle upheld by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, at Committee stage and by other Scottish Ministers in another place. I believe that we have come very close to what the Government can accept. If they still have some sympathy, I hope that they will express not only sympathy but agreement.
<P>


<a name="column_1111"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1111</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-08_para14"></a>I should emphasise that the clause does not ban all smacking. It leaves courts to determine what amounts to violence but requires them to have regard in particular to whether the child was struck with an implement or in a way which caused, or risked causing, prolonged pain. Prolonged pain is described as "more than momentary". Thus, courts are free to take into account other circumstances in addition.
<P>

<a name="50705-08_para15"></a>Unlike the previous version, this clause does not imply that hitting a child with any kind of implement, even a rolled up newspaper, would amount to violence. Therefore, I believe that it answers many questions raised at the previous stage of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50705-08_para16"></a>I hope that this revised version of the Scottish Law Commission's proposal, amended in accordance with criticisms made of it in both Houses, especially by Ministers, will find favour in all quarters of the House. If accepted, the amendment goes some way towards meeting our obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. For all those reasons, I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-08_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   My Lords, my name is to the amendment and I rise to support it.
<P>

<a name="50705-08_para17"></a>There are many of us who would prefer to see a clear prohibition of all physical punishment of children in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and with the worldwide trend against accepting any level of violence to children.
<P>

<a name="50705-08_para18"></a>It is quite inevitable that in time, and I hope sooner rather than later, we shall agree to give children at least the same protection from all kinds of assault that we as adults take for granted for ourselves. We do not defend gentle slaps of women by their husbands or, for that matter, slaps of umpires at Wimbledon and there is no logic or justice in defending gentle smacks of children.
<P>

<a name="50705-08_para19"></a>But the new clause is not about banning smacking altogether. It is quite clear to those of us who have been working in the House over the years&#151;and I may say that it is a good many years now&#151;to rid our culture of the idea that deliberately hurting children is a useful form of discipline in the school or the home that a bid for full prohibition would fail at the moment. So we welcomed the proposal of the Scottish Law Commission strictly to limit physical punishment as an appropriate step in the right direction which would command public, professional and, we believed, all-party political support. So did the full range of Scottish children's organisations and professional groups. They were surprised to find that the Government, while accepting most of the Law Commission's proposals for Part I of the Bill, left out this provision. They were even more surprised to find in previous stages of the Bill that the Government actively opposed the provision. Can it be that the Government actually approve of children being beaten with sticks and belts or in ways that cause or risk causing significant pain or injury?
<P>

<a name="50705-08_para20"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Fraser, said in Committee that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"no violence to children should be justifiable under the guise of punishment".&#151;[Official Report, 6/6/95; col. 12.]</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1112</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-08_para21"></a>Surely, he must agree that hitting children with sticks and belts or in ways which cause or could cause injury or prolonged pain constitutes violence? I hope that we shall get an unambiguous answer to that today.
<P>

<a name="50705-08_para22"></a>The Scottish Law Commission found that the public overwhelmingly support legislation to stop extreme forms of physical punishment. But we also know now from the very detailed Department of Health sponsored research&#151;to which the noble Lord, Lord Henderson, referred&#151;that one in six UK children and up to a quarter of seven year-olds are still being severely physically punished. To suggest, as the Minister did at Committee stage (again at col. 12), that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"statutory law and common law offer sufficient protection to children from assaults by parents, teachers or others who have charge of children",</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-08_para23"></a>is patently absurd, given that research finding and given the views of the whole range of Scottish professionals involved in child protection. The current law, the vague concept of "reasonable chastisement", causes a dangerous confusion in the minds of parents and inhibits those in child protection from giving clear messages.
<P>

<a name="50705-08_para24"></a>An English Peer treads with great trepidation in to Scottish matters&#151;and I certainly feel that strongly&#151;and especially Scottish children's law when, on the whole, the Scots have got it more right than we have, with a sensitive children's hearings system and other innovations. But today those of us from all parties who are pursuing this issue are doing so because we have been begged to by the very strong, probably unprecedented coalition of Scottish organisations. They see it as an issue with a UK-wide significance, and so do we. Eminent figures, including the current President of the British Paediatric Association, Professor Roy Meadow, and the immediate past president, Sir David Hull, have written in support of this provision. All the major UK-wide child protection and child welfare organisations support it, although most, it is true, would go further and argue for a clear prohibition of all physical punishment.
<P>

<a name="50705-08_para25"></a>The Minister gave us some cause for hope when he said that he had sympathy with the intention behind the new clause, but then produced legal and other arguments against accepting it. Many of these were carefully answered by the Scottish Law Commission when the noble Lord, Lord Henderson, requested it to review the criticisms. It does seem quite extraordinary that the Government should have rejected the results of the detailed consultation carried out by the commission in 1992 and such eminent legal advice in so cavalier a fashion.
<P>

<a name="50705-08_para26"></a>However, the opposition to the Law Commission's clause from the Government seemed implacable, so we have produced, as the noble Lord, Lord Henderson, said, with our advisers, a new version which we hope will prove acceptable. It does, after all, paraphrase the words of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Fraser, that children must not be subjected to violence in the guise of punishment. It highlights abusive forms of punishment, but it does not tie the hands of courts, which can have regard to other factors as well. There is still plenty of time to sort out any remaining technical problems if we can unite behind the uncontroversial intention of protecting children from violence.
<P>


<a name="column_1113"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1113</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-08_para27"></a>Let us have no more attempts to trivialise this issue with anecdotes about hitting children with rolled up newspapers and so on. These insult the serious purpose of the new clause and, more seriously, they insult the good sense of Scottish judicial authorities who have absolute discretion to decide whether a prosecution is in the interests of the child and are quite capable of distinguishing physical actions taken to protect a child. The real purpose of the new clause is educational. It is a modest measure. Accepting it will send out a signal&#151;not yet the completely unambiguous signal that some of us would like but a big improvement on the present dangerous confusion&#151;that it is not on to hit children with implements or in ways that risk causing injury or prolonged pain. I hope very much that the Government can now accept the modified version of the clause in Amendment No. 1.

<P>
<A NAME="50705-09_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   My Lords, I also wish to add my support to the amendment, at least to the extent that I continue to believe that Scotland needs guidance about the matter. While such legislation cannot control every situation, at least most people would know what was permissible and eventually bring some pressure to bear on others.
<P>

<a name="50705-09_para0"></a>I also believe that the amendment would give some guidance to the courts as to how to sort out the rights and wrongs of an incident brought before them. Principally, the courts have to decide whether it was violence rather than punishment and, if it was punishment, did the parent take reasonable or unreasonable action.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Macaulay of Bragar: </B>   My Lords, at the Committee stage of this important Bill relating to children in Scotland I made some comments which directed people back to the Scottish Law Commission on the issue of punishment of children. The amendment that appeared at the Committee stage would have been unenforceable in the courts. I note with interest the new amendment, Amendment No. 1, which has struck the correct balance in that it has taken out the question of assault.
<P>

<a name="50705-09_para1"></a>As I understand it, the amendment leaves the common law of assault unchanged but brings into the Children (Scotland) Bill the question of violence. It may be a distinction without a difference, but, as my noble friend Lady David said, the message is being sent out through the legislation to parents that they cannot abuse their children in any way, in particular striking with the methods which are detailed in subsection (2) of the amendment. The emphasis has now been changed. As I look at it, the common law of assault remains, but within the context of the Children (Scotland) Bill parents are told: "You can't be violent towards your child". Maybe the courts will have to determine the difference between being violent and assaulting someone, but violence is spelt out in the new amendment. I hope that it will find favour in your Lordships' House.
<P>

<a name="50705-09_para2"></a>The original amendment was proposed by the Scottish Law Commission. With the greatest respect to the Scottish Law Commission and the Law Commission in England, I do not believe that everyone should kneel down when they make a pronouncement. We must look at it in its proper context. The amendment appears to meet <P>


<a name="column_1114"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1114</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the earlier criticisms which were made of the original amendment. Speaking from this side of the House, we are able to support it. It is not perfect; no amendment will ever be perfect. We could come back on Third Reading with another one. But in so far as we seek a compromise which will give statutory protection to children and send a message to parents, particularly irresponsible parents, we have probably struck the right balance in the amendment. I support it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lady Kinloss: </B>   My Lords, I support the amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Henderson. He explained the reasons and the need for it very clearly. ChildLine Scotland reported that a high proportion of the children who telephone identify physical punishment as their main problem. It also said that some of the children felt sad; they tried to find reasons for the emotional, as well as the physical, pain that they felt. Some felt that it must be their fault, although they could not understand why or what they had done to deserve such severe punishment. They often found the emotional pain harder to bear than the physical pain. The problem with emotional pain is that it is probably harder to detect. A few even said that they had reached the point where they no longer wanted to live. That is tragic. Surely these children must be listened to and somehow helped. A vast majority of the children are reported as saying that they just wanted the hurt to stop but did not want their families to split up. I support the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="50705-09_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour: </B>   My Lords, I am extremely concerned about this amendment. I have given it a great deal of thought. Trespassing on railway property is one of the few cases for which trespass exists as an offence in Scotland. The reason for that protection under Scottish law is that it brought danger to the people who trespassed; it is not for any other reason. It is against the law in Scotland to trespass on railway or aircraft property&#151;and quite rightly.
<P>

<a name="50705-09_para3"></a>What does a parent do if a child commits that offence on several occasions? That child must be punished. A child may deliberately run in front of traffic. In the old days, if the police caught you doing that, you usually received a cuff on the ear. You did not dare tell your father about it in case you got a cuff on the other ear. I would argue that it did not do us any harm. Let us remember that children today are not perfect. They need to be punished from time to time. There is, for example, a problem with drugs.
<P>

<a name="50705-09_para4"></a>I am very unhappy about this clause for another reason. I do not want parents who get fed up with their children, and for no other reason, to be able to fall back on Clause 51 and ask the local authority to place the child under compulsory measures of supervision. There is that risk. The clause provides for compulsory supervision where the child,

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-09_para7"></a>The only alternative punishment available to a parent is to leave a child in the corner of a room facing the corner for several hours. That is far more cruel than is a good, hard slap across the backside with a soft slipper, or depriving the child of food. I am thinking back to my own childhood and that of many of my contemporaries. Those were the punishments that I disliked, because they left one with an awfully bitter taste in the mouth.
<P>

<a name="50705-09_para8"></a>I realise the point of what was said. But where a child has deliberately put his or her life at risk or done something utterly stupid, we must give the responsible parent the power physically to punish that child in some way. Sometimes the alternatives to physical punishment can have a far more serious effect upon the child.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Macaulay of Bragar: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Earl sits down, am I interpreting his remarks correctly? Is he saying that violence on the part of the parent is an essential ingredient for the control of the child?

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-09_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Young of Dartington: </B>   My Lords, I support this amendment. I put it to the noble Earl who just spoke that there is a considerable difference between the father whom he brought before us who gives a child a cuff across the ear, and the stepfather. I wonder whether the noble Earl would feel the same way and make the same remarks with such confidence about a stepfather. An important fact needs to be borne in mind by those who are against this amendment. The families of today are very different from the kind of families that existed in the past; and they are still changing at a rapid rate&#151;in the view of many of us, not in a favourable direction.
<P>

<a name="50705-09_para9"></a>To go back 25 years, the great majority of children were brought up during their years of dependence by their natural parents. The proportion of children lucky enough to be brought up by their natural parents until they are 16 has fallen steadily and very fast in recent years. The proportion is now not much higher than 50 per cent. Soon, on the basis of the trends observed, only a minority of children will have the good fortune to be brought up until the age of 16 by both their natural parents together. It is a dreadful thought. It means that more and more children, although brought up by one natural parent (usually it is the mother, but sometimes the father) may have to put up with a series of step-parents and the like. Temporary relationships are becoming more and more common. The natural impulses and bonds that bind natural parents to their own children cannot apply with anything like the same force to those who are not the natural parents. Unfortunately we have heard too many stories in recent years about the abuse that children can suffer&#151;not so much from stepmothers, but from stepfathers, who are very much in evidence now in our society.
<P>

<a name="50705-09_para10"></a>It is important that this House should recognise the fact that children are not now protected by natural impulses in the way that they once were&#151;as well as the arguments that were put forward by other proponents of this amendment, and at least put it on record that we are against subjecting children to the kind of violence to which they can be subjected, and are most liable to, <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>when it is not their natural parents who are responsible for them. I urge noble Lords to give very serious consideration to this amendment. Even though it may not accord with their natural inclinations to support something like this, I urge them to think again and to be prepared to give it their support.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-09_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, I shall be very brief. I was not able to be present at all at Committee stage, so I have not joined in this discussion. There is no question that the problem in Scotland is probably greater than it is in England and Wales. There is no question that there is still a lot of violence to children. We know that that violence goes on to affect the next generation. I know that from my own experience.
<P>

<a name="50705-09_para11"></a>On the other hand, noble Lords talk about the relationship of ordinary parents to ordinary children. It is very important, given that we are not elected and when some of us are not as closely in touch with ordinary parents and children in all sorts of homes as we were or might be, not to suggest that legislation that includes a provision that is so far from what people understand and will be happy about is likely to work.
<P>

<a name="50705-09_para12"></a>I have been trying to imagine how I would explain the amendment to ordinary parents of ordinary children in relation to what they are and are not allowed to do. It is possible to explain the present law on the question of assault, though I understand that will be repealed by this provision. I shall be interested to know whether my noble friend on the Front Bench feels that the amendment is sufficiently different technically from the last amendment to enable it to be more easily explained to parents.
<P>

<a name="50705-09_para13"></a>I am not happy about the amendment. I cannot imagine how one will explain to parents that they must not hit their children with any "other object"&#151;what the object is will be discussed by the court. How can we explain "momentary pain or discomfort"? I am not happy about it. However, I am ready to be convinced and shall listen to what my noble friend says.

<P>
<A NAME="50705-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Macaulay of Bragar: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Baroness sits down, I am not sure that I heard her correctly&#151;I apologise if I did not. I believe she suggested that there is more violence inflicted towards children in Scotland than there is in England and Wales. On what basis does she make that assertion?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-10_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, I do not know whether any research has been done. I thought it was generally understood that that was so and that we were extremely worried about it. I may be wrong and the noble Lord doubtless knows much more about it than I do.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   My Lords, this amendment is a sort of little sister to the one moved at Report stage in another place and then again at Committee stage in the Moses Room when Divisions were not possible.
<P>

<a name="50705-10_para0"></a>As the Ministers, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, explained, the remedies already available in Scotland through the law on assault make the amendment <P>


<a name="column_1117"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1117</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>unnecessary. I do not believe it will take us any further. People who know already what is and what is not permissible, and who obey the law as it stands, will hear the message of the amendment. It may confuse them and raise difficulties. Those who really need to hear the message of the amendment will not hear it now any more than they are already aware of what the existing law requires.
<P>

<a name="50705-10_para1"></a>Something else worries me. The Bill is not a bad Bill as it stands. It is likely to receive its Third Reading next week and will thereafter return to another place for our amendments to be agreed or disagreed&#151;only eight days before we rise for the Summer Recess. If any amendments are made in this House with which the other place is unable to agree, we shall start a "ping-pong" for which there is no time before we rise for the Recess. If the Bill does not receive Royal Assent before we rise and if anything were to befall the Government before we return in October, we should lose the Bill. We have all worked hard for it and Scotland needs it urgently&#151;indeed, it has needed it for the past five years or longer. I hope therefore that noble Lords who tabled the amendment will not press it. However, if it is pressed I shall vote against it.

<P>
<A NAME="50705-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hope of Craighead: </B>   My Lords, I wish to add a brief word to what my noble friend Lady Saltoun said. In this difficult matter I urge your Lordships not to underestimate the width and flexibility of the common law in Scotland on assault. The court over which I preside hears cases which involve violence to children. We describe them as cases of assault because that is the way in which our law is defined. However, we do not find it difficult to detect cases where&#151;to use the words of the noble Lord, Lord Henderson of Brompton&#151;abusive forms of severe punishment have been used. Where something of that kind has taken place, then to the mind of the Scottish criminal lawyer, in my experience, it suggests that an assault has been committed.
<P>

<a name="50705-10_para2"></a>The difficulty we all share is, in the end, one of evidence; bringing cases before the court and making use of the common law which already exists to protect children against violence. For those reasons, I support the view expressed by my noble friend.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Annan: </B>   My Lords, no one doubts that children often deserve to be punished; but there are different ways of doing it apart from physically assaulting them. That is the main argument behind the amendment. Again, when it is said that parents will not get the message from the amendment, I do not imagine that many Scottish parents who at the moment hit their children with various weapons actually read the legislation. However, if the amendment is passed, they will find the police at their door and they will then get the message&#151;and it is an important message.
<P>

<a name="50705-10_para3"></a>My noble and learned friend said that the common law of Scotland on assault is adequate. If that is so, why has the research and all the evidence raised by the noble Lord, Lord Henderson of Brompton, been accumulated? <P>


<a name="column_1118"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1118</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>It suggests either that the common law on assault is not adequate or, if it is adequate, it is being ignored by the authorities. That is another reason why I hope the amendment will be accepted.
<P>

<a name="50705-10_para4"></a>I hope your Lordships do not accept the argument that this amendment is so serious that it would be a menace to the Bill if it were accepted because it would put it back to another place. If the government timetable is such that that occurs, then that is the fault of the Government or of the "usual channels". That is not a substantive argument and can be used in almost every case when amendments which are in the faintest degree controversial are tabled and moved.
<P>

<a name="50705-10_para5"></a>On several occasions in recent years the European Court of Justice has notably disagreed with the British common law on matters of this kind. If the amendment is not accepted, I suspect that once again we shall be hauled in front of the European Court and once again humiliated over our attitude on matters of common humanity.
<P>

<a name="50705-10_para6"></a>Perhaps I can conclude by saying that the land of my forebears does not put itself on a par with that diehard citadel of corporal punishment, the Isle of Man. The message from the amendment is, "Throw out the tawse".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-10_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, we have had a long and important debate on this matter, but as has already been made clear in Committee, the Government are of the view that the law as it stands already offers sufficient protection to children from assault by parents, teachers or others who have charge of them. That view was echoed by the noble Lord, Lord Macaulay of Bragar, in Committee, though I realise that he has shifted his opinions today.
<P>

<a name="50705-10_para7"></a>Like earlier amendments which were considered here and in another place, there are dangers in seeking to amend the existing law in the way proposed by the new clause. Like earlier versions, the new clause would place unnecessary constraints on the power and the flexibility of the courts to take all the circumstances of each case into consideration. This has proved to be a key factor in recent case history. I emphasise that point. Cases cited by the Crown Office show that the courts take all the circumstances of the case into account. It is the reasonableness of the punishment rather than whether an implement has been used which is the key factor in their determination.
<P>

<a name="50705-10_para8"></a>Another principal concern with the new clause is that, because of the wording in subsection (1), it appears to go much further than what was recommended by the Scottish Law Commission. It appears to make it unlawful for a parent to punish a child reasonably. My other concern with subsection (1) is that it is defective. It does not say whether to submit a child to violence constitutes a criminal offence. Moreover, as the noble Lord, Lord Macaulay, pointed out, it leaves an important area of uncertainty with regard to the relationship between this provision and the general law of assault. On this point I am very grateful for the contribution of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, who, as noble Lords will know, is the Lord Justice-General. Noble Lords should bear in mind his knowledge, experience and wisdom in this matter in assessing their reaction to <P>


<a name="column_1119"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1119</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Annan, suggested that Scottish common law is deficient if, as the noble Lord, Lord Henderson, pointed out, there is evidence to justify such an amendment. I would point out that the problem is not the difficulty of defining the punishment. The problem is the difficulty of obtaining the evidence and corroborating that evidence.
<P>

<a name="50705-10_para9"></a>There are other deficiencies about the wording in subsection (2) which were pointed out by my noble and learned friend in Committee. The courts would have some difficulties in interpreting subsection (2) (b) (ii). What is meant by,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"more than momentary pain or discomfort"?</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-10_para10"></a>That seems hard to tease out and would give rise to uncertainty. More importantly, since the test would arise where there was no injury, it is extremely hard to see how anyone could ever tell whether the pain or discomfort lasted more than a moment or indeed risked doing so. Again, what is meant by "injury" in subsection (2) (b) (i)? Does it mean only physical injury? If so, would it include a bruise?
<P>

<a name="50705-10_para11"></a>A number of very important observations have been made against the amendment. In that regard I am grateful to my noble friends Lord Balfour and Lady Carnegy, the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, with his knowledge on these matters. As with earlier versions, the new clause contains a number of deficiencies which mean that the Government could not possibly accept it.
<P>

<a name="50705-10_para12"></a>I end where I began. The law as it stands, both statutory law and common law, is sufficient to protect children from assault by parents, teachers or others in charge of children. There are offence provisions in the Children and Young Persons (Scotland) Act 1937 as well as common assault. The common law offers a certain flexibility which might be lost by incorporating this new clause into law. On that basis, I ask the noble Lord and his supporters to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-10_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Macaulay of Bragar: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Earl sits down, perhaps I may ask whether this amended clause has the support of the Scottish Law Commission.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-10_spnew7"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, I am not able to answer that question. I do not know.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-10_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Henderson of Brompton: </B>   My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who have spoken in this debate. It certainly exposed any difference between the two sides, which I should like to encapsulate by saying that there are some noble Lords, including the Lord Justice-General, who seem to presume that the existing law, whether common law or statute law, is sufficient to curb violence in the home while the other party, if I may describe a number of noble Lords as a party, are of the opinion that the evidence which I adduced for the United Kingdom surely shows that the existing law is not sufficient to protect children from violence in the home. I could say to the House, like the noble Lord, Lord Annan, said, that I am proud to have Scottish forebears. In fact, all my four grandparents were Scottish. That is about as good a ticket as I can give to the House as a recommendation for my speaking on a Scottish Bill.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-10_para13"></a>I find the view that the existing law is not sufficient to protect children in the home from violence prevails against those who think that the law is sufficient already. I remind your Lordships that this House gave a lead to the House of Commons by inserting into the criminal law of the country a provision that corporal punishment in schools should not be allowed. The House of Commons agreed to the Lords amendment and that is now the law of the land. If it is the law of the land that corporal punishment is not allowed in schools, surely it cannot be difficult&#151;I say this to the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour&#151;to explain to parents that if it is not allowed in schools, a fortiori, it should not be allowed in the home. We want to improve the culture on the subject of violence which was changed in the schools and to make the same change in the home.
<P>

<a name="50705-10_para14"></a>I very much hope that the change in the culture of violence which we initiated in this House with regard to schools will be followed by this amendment which will change, I hope, the violent culture in the homes of the country. I commend the amendment to the House.

("( ) executed before a relevant person; and").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50705-11_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 8. This is a provision which should be put into the Bill to make sure that when parents make agreements about parentage and so forth, to put it quite colloquially, it confirms that they know what they are doing. At Committee stage I believe that the Minister, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, suggested that perhaps a notary public would not be available in, for example, a remote country area.
<P>

<a name="50705-11_para6"></a>The reasoning behind these two amendments is to broaden the scope of the people before whom an agreement can be executed. We have a notary public who, basically, is a solicitor and a justice of the peace. I do not believe that one can move anywhere in Scotland without bumping into a justice of the peace or a sheriff clerk. These are not matters of great urgency. They will not be decided within an hour or two. In making the arrangements it gives the persons involved the opportunity to go before people of responsibility who can question them as to the identity of the parents. There will not be much difficulty with the mother, particularly if she has not given birth, but that is another matter. As regards the father, the provision is to make sure that the parties are properly designated and that they have the capacity to enter into an agreement.

<a name="50705-11_para7"></a>It is quite obvious that a notary public, a justice of the peace or a sheriff clerk are persons who can judge, broadly speaking, whether people know what they are doing and what commitments they are entering into. By allowing this amendment, it will also provide a certain amount of safeguard for the child of the parties involved in the agreement. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-11_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Advocate   (Lord Rodger of Earlsferry): </B>  My Lords, these amendments are similar to provisions brought forward in Committee by the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael. At that stage, my noble and learned friend Lord Fraser of Carmyllie agreed that parents who are about to undertake a parental responsibilities and rights agreement should give due thought and consideration before doing so. I am sure that all noble Lords would agree with that. It was also confirmed at that stage that it is correct that the process should involve a formal step. Nonetheless, the Government remain of the view that that is already achieved in the existing arrangements of Clause 4, and particularly in subsection (2). As my noble and learned friend made clear in Committee, in producing the guidance notes which will accompany the agreement forms it is the Government's intention to make it clear to such parents that they are taking a substantial step which will involve a change in their status and that they may therefore wish to take legal advice on it before committing themselves.
<P>

<a name="50705-11_para8"></a>Nonetheless, the Government are not convinced that the amendments are required, or are even sufficient, to ensure that the parents obtain legal advice. They would involve the parties in additional effort and cost, depending on whether there was a "relevant person" near where they live. I notice that the amendment as now drafted seems in part to cater for the point that was made in Committee about how the provisions would work if one party was located in England and the other in Scotland. However, we are not quite sure that its terms are entirely appropriate. That is because the amendment simply requires the agreement to be signed before a relevant person such as a notary public. In other words, the notary public is simply acting as a witness. There is no requirement upon that person to ascertain whether the person signing the document appreciates what it is that he is signing. That is completely different from the situation ordinarily when a document requires to be sworn before a notary and it does not ensure that legal advice is obtained by the parents.
<P>

<a name="50705-11_para9"></a>For that reason, the Government remain of the view that the existing provisions are sufficient. We have already given a commitment to keep the process as straightforward as possible. We believe that the provisions are sufficient, and in those circumstances I ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.

<A NAME="50705-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Macaulay of Bragar: </B>   My Lords, it is nice to hear the Government talk about Clause 4 because we stopped doing that some time ago. I am advised that the cost of executing a notarial document is less than &#163;40. The cost of getting married in civil ceremony is &#163;66, and the registration of a marriage costs &#163;27. I am not very good at arithmetic, but that amounts to about &#163;90. Therefore, I cannot see why providing that additional protection for those involved, and especially for the <P>

It is all very well for "alleged parents"&#151;if I can put it that way&#151;to do such things, but it is the child who is most centrally involved. I cannot see why building in another wall of defence for the child (who has no part in the proceedings) should be so firmly resisted by the Government. We shall, as usual, read with interest what the Minister has said; but, in the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="50705-12_para8"></a>I should like to thank the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope of Craighead, for the suggestion that has led to these amendments. In his capacity as Lord President of the Court of Session, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, thinks that the Bill should provide sufficient policy guidance for him to make appropriate rules of court concerning the taking of the views of the child. The noble and learned Lord drew attention to the text of Article 12(2) of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which says,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the child shall in particular be provided the opportunity to be heard".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-12_para9"></a>We have also borne in mind that where a very young child is concerned, the court or the children's hearing must not be bound to go through the motions of trying to ascertain his or her views.
<P>

<a name="50705-12_para10"></a>We have therefore produced what we think is an appropriate formula to provide that the court and children's hearing have a duty as far as practicable both to allow the child the opportunity to indicate a wish to <P>


<a name="column_1125"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1125</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>express a view, and if the child does so indicate, to obtain his or her views. Having done so, they must have regard to these views.
<P>

<a name="50705-12_para11"></a>In relation to Amendment No. 16, I should add that if your Lordships accept the new clause after Clause 64, which deals with warrants for the further detention of a child, I would consider it appropriate at Third Reading to make proceedings under that clause subject to the same provisions relating to taking the child's views as other proceedings mentioned in Clause 16. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hope of Craighead: </B>   My Lords, I am very grateful to the Minister for accepting the advice, which I gave on behalf of the court, that the amendment should be brought forward. As far as we are concerned, it achieves something useful because it separates the giving of the opportunity on the one hand, for which we shall have to make careful rules, and the method by which the views may be expressed if the child wishes to express them. That too will have to be subject to careful rules. The way in which the provisions are now framed is in accordance with what we would wish to see and assists clarity in rule-making functions, which is my principal concern.
<P>

<P>
<A NAME="50705-12_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Macaulay of Bragar </B>   moved Amendment No. 11:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 9, line 29, at end insert:
<br>
("( ) shall consider if it is necessary to appoint a person to ascertain the views of the child in the proceedings.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50705-12_para13"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment stands in my name and that of the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie. Amendment No. 11 is grouped with Amendments Nos. 12 and 170. Indeed, Amendment No. 170 is consequential upon Amendment Nos. 11 and 12. The amendments seek to build into the legislation a means of allowing a child's views to be heard and dealt with. As we all know from experience, various sheriffs&#151;and perhaps judges in the High Court&#151;take different approaches to talking to children and finding out their views. Most of the time that is done behind closed doors when a judge, particularly in civil cases, asks a child what he thinks about what is going to happen, and who he likes or does not like.
<P>

<a name="50705-12_para14"></a>The amendment has been tabled to take the child out of the adversarial process and to provide another safeguard to ensure that the child's views are properly represented in the proceedings. If a suitable person is appointed to speak for and to represent the child outwith the court, that will make the proceedings much more satisfactory from everyone's point of view and the child will not need to be seen by the judge in chambers or whatever. The amendments have been tabled to benefit those children who are unfortunately involved in adversarial proceedings between their parents, whether married or otherwise. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-12_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rodger of Earlsferry: </B>   My Lords, those of your Lordships who were involved in the earlier stage of the Bill will be aware that the theme of the Bill is the importance of taking into account children's views. The procedures as to how the child's views are obtained are <P>


<a name="column_1126"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1126</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>just as much a matter of court procedure and practice as if the child were giving evidence in court. As my noble and learned friend said in Committee, the Sheriff Court Rules Council has been considering how best to achieve that end. Work on the preparation of one of the necessary rules of court has already begun.
<P>

<a name="50705-12_para15"></a>As your Lordships will be aware, it is the normal practice to leave the detail of such issues to be carried into effect through rules of court. Considerable expertise is available in the Sheriff Court Rules Council. That council includes among its members practitioners experienced in family law and lay members as well as members of the judiciary. It is well-versed in the preparation of provisions which relate to procedure.
<P>

<a name="50705-12_para16"></a>In preparing such rules of court, the views of interested parties and experts are sought through both formal and informal consultation. The Government amendment to Clause 11 is designed to facilitate just such preparation of rules of court which will allow for the kinds of situations set out and dealt with in the amendment. Given that it is normal to leave such matters to rules of court, I ask the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-12_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Macaulay of Bragar: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation which had an air of sympathy about it. We shall have to see in due course what the rules of court say. The amendments emphasise matters which persons who are preparing the rules of court should take into consideration, because the Bill is the last chance that the children of Scotland will have for a long time to have themselves put in a proper position and to be represented properly in all proceedings relating to their welfare and future.
<P>

<a name="50705-12_para17"></a>As I say, I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate for giving that explanation. We look forward to seeing what the rules of court say. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50705-12_para20"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment is self explanatory.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-13_para0"></a>It has been my experience when dealing with legislation in your Lordships' House that different bits of an Act are brought into force at different times. If the amendment were to be considered, the words should read:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"prior to the coming into force of this part of this Act".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-13_para1"></a>Otherwise, I feel that the amendment will lie on the shelf for an incredibly long time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-13_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, I can understand why the noble Lord has tabled the amendment, but I can give my noble friend Lord Balfour some immediate reassurance and say that I am not convinced that the amendment is necessary.
<P>

<a name="50705-13_para2"></a>First, although I am aware that sheriffs do on occasion provide a note explaining the reason for their decisions, it is not the same as one which explains the nature and effect of the order. Secondly, I believe that it should be for the legal adviser to the party who is the subject of the order to explain the nature and effect of the order to his or her client. That reflects the current position. Lastly, I would hope that (following rules of court and procedure guidance which will arise after the Bill is enacted) orders made by the courts under subsections (1) and (2) of Clause 11 will be clear as respects their nature and effect.
<P>

<a name="50705-13_para3"></a>As regards how a Clause 11 order would relate to existing orders for custody or access, orders for custody or access would be superseded by an order under Clause 11(1) or (2). For instance, if a person applied for a "residence order" under Clause 11(2), that order would, in effect, overtake any existing order for custody. In addition, Clause 15(2) makes it clear that where, before Clause 11 comes into force, a final decree has been made in relation to a custody or access order, any application to vary or recall that order is to be treated as if it has been made under Clause 11.
<P>

<a name="50705-13_para4"></a>The thrust of the Bill is that all new orders, or variations of existing orders, should be in terms of Clause 11. So the position is quite clear and, I would suggest, means that there is no real need for this amendment. On the basis of that explanation, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Macaulay of Bragar: </B>   My Lords, I listened with interest to that explanation, but I am not sure that it meets the problem in relation to international law. The words "custody", "access", "residence", and "contact" are used in the Bill. I am sure that the noble Earl is well aware that the essence of the Bill in relation to children is the making of a residence order and an order for contact with the parents. The amendment was put down so that from the international point of view it will be clear what is meant by the words "residence" and "contact".
<P>

<a name="50705-13_para5"></a>Schedule 3 paragraph 40(2) and paragraph 36(3) mention the words "residence", "contact", "custody" and "access". They are all mixed up and that might not be understood by people outwith Scotland. We have an international convention on child abduction and a European convention on the recognition and enforcement of decisions concerning the custody of children. The amendment has been put down to ensure <P>


<a name="column_1128"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1128</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that if any order is made by a court, which has to go to a foreign court, the foreign court should have no doubt about what is meant by the words "residence" and "contact".
<P>

<a name="50705-13_para6"></a>I hope that the Government will have a look at this matter because it could lead to great confusion. As we know from child abduction and custody cases, which are reported day in and day out in the newspapers, there is sometimes a great deal of confusion about what those words mean. It is not difficult for a judge to spell out what he means when he talks about "residence" and "contact". If it means custody or access, let him say that so that the matter can be dealt with properly. With those observations, which I hope the Government will take away and look at, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="column_1129"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1129</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-13_para15"></a>The word "paramount" has crept into the Bill and Amendments Nos. 17 to 19 make clear that, within the context of the legislation, people dealing with children should remember that the best interests of the child, as distinct from the paramount interests, shall remain a primary consideration of the hearing. The inclusion of the amendments will not harm the legislation. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-13_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Rodger of Earlsferry: </B>   My Lords, the exception to the paramountcy principle in Clause 16 (for the courts and children's hearing) and also in Clause 17 (for local authorities) has been discussed at previous stages of the Bill. The question of paramountcy has not crept into the Bill; the word "paramount" has been part of the legislation relating to children for about 70 years and is an important aspect.
<P>

<a name="50705-13_para16"></a>The Bill is essentially about the welfare and protection of children and it clearly establishes and endorses the paramountcy of the child's welfare. It makes only one exception; to protect members of the public from serious harm. That is a protection which they have every right to expect.
<P>

<a name="50705-13_para17"></a>The key point is that Clause 16(5) is not about giving hearings and courts powers to take specific action in relation to a child but rather it provides hearings and courts with a power to do something which would not put the welfare of the child as the paramount concern. That in itself is not a separate power to send a child to secure accommodation or to place the child under a supervision requirement. It opens the way to the body exercising its functions, for which succeeding provisions of the Bill provide specific authority.
<P>

<a name="50705-13_para18"></a>It is important to see Clause 16(5) in its context. It does not stand on its own; it provides flexibility for a sheriff or a hearing to make appropriate decisions under the relevant legislation where children threaten members of the public with harm. This is not some draconian measure which will allow hearings and courts carte blanche to deal with children as they see fit. They would have to exercise their powers in accordance with the legislative provisions and in doing so the welfare of the child would continue to be a consideration but not the paramount one.
<P>

<a name="50705-13_para19"></a>With that reassurance I hope that the noble Lord will agree to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-13_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Macaulay of Bragar: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation and in due course I shall beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="50705-13_para20"></a>Perhaps at this point I may raise the question of progress in your Lordships' House. It is no one's fault that today we have to deal with two Scottish Bills, one directly following the other. As regards this Bill, we have about 80 groups of amendments to deal with. Even with the best will in the world, and if the amendments sail through, the Government having taken on board the suggestions that we made in Committee, we shall need about four hours to debate this Bill. I do not mind working late because I am in the Palace in any event but four hours from now is half past nine.

It would be wrong to consider such a serious Bill at ten o'clock at night. Indeed, the Children (Scotland) Bill is equally important. Perhaps we could adjourn the House for five minutes.

<A NAME="50705-14_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, many of the government amendments to the Children (Scotland) Bill are technical and therefore some groups will be dealt with very quickly.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50705-14_para4"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, I apologise to my noble and learned friend on the Front Bench because I have had no opportunity to discuss the amendment with him. However, I must explain the position. It is a consequential amendment which arises because of the sensible government Amendment No. 124. That deletes the reference to a "relevant local authority" in Clause 68(3) and moves it, under Amendment No. 165, to Clause 90, which is the interpretation clause dealing with Part II.
<P>

<a name="50705-14_para5"></a>The definition of a "relevant local authority" is now fully described in Amendment No. 165 and is inserted in its correct alphabetical position in Clause 90. I hope that your Lordships will agree that the government amendments make the legislation easier to read and understand.
<P>

<a name="50705-14_para6"></a>As well as this amendment, which I spotted because of my own cross-referencing in the Bill, Amendments Nos. 122, 125, 127 and 128 are all consequential. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="50705-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy </B>   moved Amendment No. 21:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 15, line 8, at end insert ("and for whom they are providing accommodation.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50705-14_para9"></a>The noble Lady said: My Lords, this is a purely probing amendment. It serves to limit the use of the term "looked after" to only those children and young people who are accommodated away from the family home.
<P>

<a name="50705-14_para10"></a>One of the underlying principles of the Bill is to minimise the role of the state and to maximise parents' ability to continue to exercise their rights and responsibilities in relation to the care of their children. The effect of the recent change introduced by the Government in Committee is that a child subject to a supervision requirement at home will now be regarded as being "looked after" by a local authority. Parents may well view that as both confusing and over-intrusive, where the local authority's duty under Clause 68(2) is only from time to time to investigate that any conditions imposed by the supervision requirement are being fulfilled. That does not really mean that the local authority is looking after the child.
<P>

<a name="50705-14_para11"></a>There is also scope for confusion from the point of view of the local authority. Does the duty under Clause 68(2) limit or circumscribe any duty of care owed to the child under common law? Would it not be possible to clarify that position in the Bill while at the same time allowing those children and young people subject to supervision in relevant accommodation access to aftercare and other support from local authorities? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-14_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   My Lords, I see difficulties in the inclusion of children subject to a domestic supervision requirement under Clause 68(2) (a) in the category of "looked after" children. Will such children be entitled to claim aftercare under Clause 28? I wonder whether the Minister has calculated the numbers of such children and the scale of the costs involved. I am advised by the Association of Directors of Social Work that the costs of including those children could amount to &#163;8.77 million. I wonder whether provision will be made in the Bill for that sum. While there is no problem if that provision is to be made, children should be re-categorised if adequate provision is not being made for them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-14_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rodger of Earlsferry: </B>   My Lords, I listened with care to what the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, said. I have some sympathy for her position. I know that it is a probing amendment but, nevertheless, it would have the effect of removing from local authority responsibilities and services the children who are subject to compulsory measures of supervision at home.
<P>

<a name="50705-14_para12"></a>Clause 17 sets out a duty that a local authority has to children looked after by it. The intention is that this clause should embrace all categories of children who receive services or assistance or for whom local authorities have responsibilities under the Bill: that is, those who are accommodated, those who are subject to compulsory supervision and those who are subject to an order or warrant under the Bill.
<P>


<a name="column_1132"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1132</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-14_para13"></a>Where a child is subject to a supervision requirement but continues to live at home, his parents still have a fundamentally important part to play in the upbringing of the child&#151;and I am sure that that is what the noble Lady would wish. But in making a supervision requirement, the children's hearing will have concluded that the child has needs which the local authority has a role in meeting. I suggest to your Lordships that we cannot ignore the needs of such children and the duty which local authorities should have to them. It is a matter for the children's hearing to decide whether that is so in all the circumstances.
<P>

<a name="50705-14_para14"></a>Most importantly, I should emphasise that by including children in the general category of being "looked after", we ensure that they qualify for all appropriate services. One such potentially important service is aftercare.
<P>

<a name="50705-14_para15"></a>By redefining the category of children covered by Clause 17(6) (b), the noble Lady would be depriving any child who was subject to a home supervision requirement at school-leaving age of receiving continued support under the aftercare provisions of Clause 28. I should observe that aftercare is already a duty under the 1968 Act in cases of home supervision. I am sure that the noble Lady will agree that such children might well require further advice, guidance and assistance from the local authority. Therefore, it would be unfortunate if such an amendment were made which would have the undesirable repercussion of depriving the children of that advice and so on. I hope that with that explanation, the noble Lady will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-14_spnew8"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie </B>   moved Amendment No. 22:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
After Clause 17, insert the following new clause:
<center><b>("Duty of local authority to child not looked after by them</B></center><br>
.&#151;(1) Without prejudice to the provisions of section 17 above, where under or by virtue of this Part of this Act, a local authority decide any matter with respect to a child, the welfare of that child throughout his childhood shall be their paramount consideration.
<br>
(2) In making any such decision a local authority shall have regard so far as practicable to the views (if he wishes to express them) of the child concerned, taking account of his age and maturity; and without prejudice to the generality of this subsection a child twelve years of age or more shall be presumed to be of sufficient age and maturity to form a view.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50705-14_para17"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, this amendment follows on from the previous amendment. It attempts to define the duties of the local authority to children who are not categorised as "looked after" but are in receipt of social work intervention. That includes children in need and children in refuges.
<P>

<a name="50705-14_para18"></a>Clause 17 provides clearly that "looked after" children shall be treated with their interests as paramount, but there seems to be no corresponding duty to children in need in the community or in refuges. <P>


<a name="column_1133"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1133</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>While the amendment would resolve that problem, I wonder whether there is an error or omission from the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-14_spnew9"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, the noble Earl has raised a number of interesting points in moving this amendment. I assure him that there is no error or omission. He is right to suggest that when local authorities are contemplating taking action or providing services under Part II of the Bill, there will be many circumstances in which they should seek the child's views.
<P>

<a name="50705-14_para19"></a>I believe also that the child's welfare should be a matter of considerable concern in any dealings which a local authority has with a child or the parents. But I am less clear that it would be appropriate to place a specific duty on a local authority to have welfare as a paramount concern when the authority is not actually looking after the child and therefore has no formal relationship with him.
<P>

<a name="50705-14_para20"></a>I think that we have to differentiate rather carefully between public intervention in the life of a child or family and the simple provision of support services. The noble Earl's proposed clause would bite wherever and whenever a local authority were considering any action under Part II. I believe that writing such a sweeping provision into primary legislation would run a very serious risk of creating such a heavy and onerous requirement on local authorities that they would find real difficulty in meeting its terms and delivering their services&#151;and in meeting priority needs. It is too prescriptive and would require a degree of consultation and interaction between the authorities and individuals which would probably prove impracticable.
<P>

<a name="50705-14_para21"></a>I believe that the best of what the noble Earl seeks will be obtained through good practice and through guidance where that is necessary. However, they are not matters for the face of the Bill. On the basis of those reassurances, I hope the noble Earl will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<a name="50705-15_para2"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, the amendment is concerned with broadening the scale of children's service plans to include the education service and to bring in the health boards' provisions. That corporate planning should not be too difficult to co-ordinate as the two local authority departments and the health board each know what services they provide. I do not believe that it would be too difficult to produce an integrated plan to co-ordinate their existing services.

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1134</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-15_para3"></a>I have taken the point made in Committee that provisions by voluntary organisations will be too difficult to organise within the child service plan. However, I believe that the statutory agencies ought to be required to do so. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rodger of Earlsferry: </B>   My Lords, at an earlier stage we discussed the extent and scope of the plans for child care services. On that occasion, the noble Earl moved an amendment to delete the word "relevant" and thus extend the planning requirement to include all services for children. I understand the wish to see services for children properly co-ordinated and well planned. But, nonetheless, the Government remain very firmly of the view that attempting to stretch the plans to include health and education is unrealistic and would be unhelpful.
<P>

<a name="50705-15_para4"></a>We have now had some considerable experience in the preparation of strategic plans for community care services. Those services, like services for children, require careful planning and co-operation among a number of agencies. I think it is fair to say&#151;although not a happy thing to say&#151;that initial attempts which endeavoured to cover every single aspect resulted in the production of plans that were so lengthy and complex that they were almost incomprehensible. I very much fear that the amendment would have precisely the same result on the plans for child care services provided under the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50705-15_para5"></a>The clause introduces a new requirement on local authorities. I hope that the plans which will be produced will be crisp, clear and well focused. The aim is that they should be key management tools capable of providing a broad, strategic overview of the development of child care services. They are strategic plans, not plans focused on the needs of any particular child and they should be seen in that context. I strongly believe that the amendment would not only be unhelpful but, on this occasion, would actually cause significant harm to the procedures which I understand the noble Earl is most concerned to see work well. With that explanation, I hope that the noble Earl will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-15_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   My Lords, I am undoubtedly a little disappointed in the answer of the noble and learned Lord. However, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50705-15_para8"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, in Committee mention was made of the fact that the child service plans may well contain much turgid detail. I believe that that is likely. Therefore, the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that an easily read guide to the local <P>


<a name="column_1135"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1135</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>authority's child service plans is made available in most of the languages used in its area, including Braille. That wee booklet would be made available on demand and be displayed at community access points which local authorities will be setting up. They should also be given to all families receiving a service from the social work department.
<P>

<a name="50705-15_para9"></a>There is still a general lack of knowledge about the scale of operations carried out by the social work department, the education department and the health board which I should have liked to include. The proposed booklet could reduce that knowledge gap. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-15_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, we introduced Clause 19 to the Bill as a government amendment in the Committee stage in this Chamber following debate on the matter in another place. It lays a clear duty on local authorities to publish information about services for children. Clause 19 has been welcomed as a useful addition.
<P>

<a name="50705-15_para10"></a>However, I am not sure whether the noble Earl's proposed addition would add anything of further value, although he made some good points when introducing the amendment. He seeks to make local authorities responsible for bringing the information to children and families who may benefit, but has to acknowledge, of course, that local authorities will not necessarily know who all potential beneficiaries might be. It is therefore not possible to make the requirement an absolute duty, and the amendment rightly qualifies it by simply requiring the authority to take such steps as are reasonable. In effect therefore the first part of the amendment could equally well be covered in guidance, if necessary.
<P>

<a name="50705-15_para11"></a>The second part of the amendment requires information to be published in a form which is accessible to likely users. The noble Earl, quite rightly, has a dislike of turgid information. Again, I am sure that it would be in a local authority's best interests to publish in an attractive and usable manner information about services for which they are accountable. It is through the publication of such information that residents in local authority areas see how their authorities respond to local needs. I should add that there are a number of local authorities which already produce their guides in different languages; indeed, there are some which also produce such information in Braille.
<P>

<a name="50705-15_para12"></a>The Bill is considerably longer than it was when it was originally introduced. I am clear that we have been able to make a number of improvements to it. On the basis of what I have been able to tell the noble Earl, I hope that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-15_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Mar and Kellie: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for what he said, especially as he said that much of what I am looking for will in fact be included in guidance. Therefore, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

(a) reduce the likelihood of a child requiring to be looked after by the local authority; and
<br>
(b) increase the likelihood of a child no longer requiring to be looked after by the local authority.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50705-15_para15"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, in moving the above amendment, I should like to speak also to Amendment No. 26. The two amendments are designed to ensure that the local authority makes plans for preventive services and the back-up of community services. However, I am not clear why it is the Government's intention to leave that aspect of social work with children in the voluntary area. Will there at least be guidance that will cover and promote a full range of preventive and community services?
<P>

<a name="50705-15_para16"></a>Amendment No. 26 deals with that vital resource of respite services. The Government have opposed the inclusion of respite services on the face of the Bill because,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it would not be helpful to highlight one particular service in primary legislation"&#151;[Official Report, 6/6/95; col. 54.]</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-15_para17"></a>Yet the Government have recently introduced their own clause for a particular service&#151;Clause 26&#151;which deals with the provision of day care services.
<P>

<a name="50705-15_para18"></a>Respite services are a key preventive service. It can be the vital service to keep families together and to further the development of their children. At present, huge gaps in respite services exist across Scotland with many families unable to access services. Practice demonstrates that government support for respite services is not enough. The need to provide such services must be recognised in children's legislation. Can the Minister please confirm that respite services will be part of children's service plans? I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="50705-15_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Rodger of Earlsferry: </B>   My Lords, I can well understand the noble Earl's desire with Amendment No. 25 to require a local authority to include among the services which it provides those which will,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"reduce the likelihood of a child requiring to be looked after by the local authority; and increase the likelihood of a child no longer requiring to be looked after by the local authority".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-15_para19"></a>Nonetheless, we are of the view that services for those purposes can indeed be provided under Clause 21 as it stands. In safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children in need, the local authority is also required to promote the upbringing of such children by their families by providing a range and level of services appropriate to the children's needs. That is a more positive way of achieving what Amendment No. 25 seeks to do. This matter will be covered in a range of guidance.
<P>

<a name="50705-15_para20"></a>Amendment No. 26 calls for respite services to be specifically included within Clause 21. It has already been acknowledged that these services can play an important part in keeping families together. We would <P>


<a name="column_1137"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1137</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>expect them to figure in children's services plans drawn up by local authorities. Nonetheless the Government still hold to the view that it is not only respite services which can be of great assistance in keeping families together, but there will be other services too. We have concerns about the possibility&#151;we have said this on previous occasions&#151;that specifying particular services within this clause could mean that other services not so specified would be held not to be included in the range of services a local authority will be required to provide. When one includes one provision, legal arguments can arise about others. Respite services are of course important but they will only be part of the range of services. For the reasons I have given it would not be appropriate to specify them. In those circumstances, I hope that the noble Earl will feel able to withdraw his amendments.

<a name="50705-16_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this is an amendment to Clause 22 of the Bill. Clause 22(2) states,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"For the purposes of this Chapter of this Part a person is disabled if he is chronically sick or disabled or suffers from mental disorder (within the meaning of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984)."</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-16_para9"></a>The Bill we are discussing is entitled Children (Scotland) Bill and the child for whose welfare we are all concerned suddenly becomes a person in this clause within the meaning of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act which deals with adults who are unfortunate enough to have mental disorders. This amendment seeks to introduce flexibility into the definition of disablement within the terms of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act. It gives time for the condition of the child to be properly assessed over a number of years. It is quite a simple amendment but it has great significance for the children of Scotland for whom this Bill has been introduced into your Lordships' House with all-party support.
<P>

<a name="50705-16_para10"></a>It is difficult to diagnose at an early age whether a child is mentally ill within the definition of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act. However, an adult has had time to develop and to demonstrate his propensities one way or another, whether he demonstrates violence, schizophrenia or any other condition. It is easier&#151;I do not use that word lightly&#151;for a psychiatrist to diagnose an adult's condition who is 18 or older as that adult will have had time to develop by then. The Bill as it stands at present will place children in a context which has nothing to do with children's disorders. The objective behind the amendment is to tailor the Bill to suit the needs of children. As we all know, children develop in various ways. Unless there is a child who is an absolute menace&#151;if I can put it that way&#151;and can be diagnosed psychologically as being,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"chronically sick or disabled or suffers from mental disorder (within the meaning of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984)"</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-16_para11"></a>it is difficult to take a child out of a home, for example, and place him within the context of that Act.
<P>

<a name="50705-16_para12"></a>The definition contained within Clause 22(2) may have been taken from some other Act. I believe it is adult-based and that it has nothing to do with the welfare of children. We must look after children and ensure that they develop properly, in so far as we can. I know that children may develop some conditions and no one can help that, just as some adults become schizophrenics and develop other conditions. I believe that the definition contained in Clause 22(2) is a fairly draconian one to impose on children who are governed by this Bill. On that basis, I would ask the Government, even if they do not accept the terminology of the amendment, to consider that the people who framed this amendment are all concerned with the welfare of children. Even if the phraseology of the amendment is not acceptable to the Government, perhaps they might reconsider the clause we are discussing and return at Third Reading with a different definition of disablement in Clause 22(2). I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-16_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour: </B>   My Lords, I should like to make one comment here. Even if the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Macaulay of Bragar, is not <P>


<a name="column_1139"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1139</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>accepted, I wonder whether in the existing subsection (2) of Clause 22 the Government would consider using the words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"For the purpose of this part of this Act".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-16_para13"></a>If it is restricted to this chapter, as the clause reads, Chapters 3 and 4 could be affected.
<P>

<a name="50705-16_para14"></a>My other concern about the amendment is the reference to "an adult" in sub-paragraph (c). I wonder whether we have allowed for a disabled adult, who perhaps was physically fit when the child was born but subsequently had a serious accident, to be helped with the care of children within the provisions of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-16_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, this is the second occasion on which the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Macaulay, has been discussed in this House. It has also been discussed at length on separate occasions in another place.
<P>

<a name="50705-16_para15"></a>If I may be forgiven for being equally persistent, I shall reiterate what my noble and learned friend said when we previously debated the matter in Committee. The definition in the Bill has the twin advantages of being flexible and also of being familiar to local authorities in that it is drawn from the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986. It is not draconian, as the noble Lord, Lord Macaulay, suggested. Moreover, we have already provided a definition of a disabled adult which for the purposes of Clause 22 is the same as that of a disabled child.
<P>

<a name="50705-16_para16"></a>My noble and learned friend also said that he could appreciate the temptation to produce particular types of conditions within the definition of disability. Again I have to say that going down that road carries the real risk that some specific condition may be omitted, thus placing the child with that condition outside the definition of a disabled child and, more importantly, denying the child the opportunity to benefit from services which authorities will provide under Clause 21.
<P>

<a name="50705-16_para17"></a>My noble friend Lord Balfour raised a point about the drafting in line 38 on page 17. We shall look into that and contact him in relation to the point that he made.
<P>

<a name="50705-16_para18"></a>On the basis of the argument that I have reiterated to the noble Lord, I hope that he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-16_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Macaulay of Bragar: </B>   My Lords, I may feel obliged to withdraw the amendment, but whether I am able to do so is another matter.
<P>

<a name="50705-16_para19"></a>Looking at the terminology of Clause 22(2), it occurs to me that it is a restricting clause. Let us assume that, as suggested by the noble Earl, Lord Balfour, the reference to the chapter was deleted. The subsection would read:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"For the purposes of this Part a person",</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-16_para20"></a>which obviously means a child,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"is disabled if he is chronically sick or disabled or suffers from mental disorder (within the meaning of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984)".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-16_para21"></a>I apologise for not giving the noble Earl prior notice of this point but it has just occurred to me. Is that not a restrictive clause? It means that if a child does not fall within the definitions in the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984 then he or she is not designated as being <P>


<a name="column_1140"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1140</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>disabled within the meaning of the Children (Scotland) Bill. I wonder whether the Government and their advisers might look at that point and consider whether a broader concept to take account at least of the spirit of my amendment might be more suitable to a Bill which is entitled the Children (Scotland) Bill.
<P>

<a name="50705-16_para22"></a>We are not dealing with adults. We are dealing with developing personalities. Those of us who are familiar with children know how children develop over the years. They develop one way and then another. It seems to me that Clause 22(2) places a limit on the children who can be covered by the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50705-16_para23"></a>The noble Earl is a caring Minister, as is the noble and learned Lord, Lord Fraser, who has taken a great interest in the Bill. We are all trying to do our best for children. It would not be good for the children of Scotland if a restrictive piece of legislation deprived them of the assistance they might need during their years of development. With those observations, and having heard what the Minister said, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

The aim of the Government is to keep Clause 22 as simple and focused as possible and to avoid cluttering the primary legislation with too much detail. Therefore, whatever the intention behind Amendment No. 32, which the noble Lord does not seem to be clear about, we believe that it would add unnecessary detail. Nonetheless, the intention is that guidelines will be issued which will deal with the objectives that lie behind the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50705-17_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Amendment No. 33 is grouped with Amendments Nos. 34 to 38. The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that where a carer's assessment is made in respect of a disabled child that assessment should be made at the same time. The Bill as drafted introduces two assessments which may be relevant to families affected by disability. It is much fairer if the carer and the disabled person are assessed at the same time rather than separately. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-17_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour: </B>   My Lords, I should like to draw the attention of your Lordships to page 18, line 10, of the Bill, which reads:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to carry out an assessment of the carer's ability to continue to provide".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-17_para4"></a>I get the impression that this relates not only to the carer's physical ability but also to his financial ability to provide care and whether a person can afford to look after a disabled child.
<P>

<a name="50705-17_para5"></a>In relation to Amendment No. 37, I do not know where the word "many" appears in line 15. I have not found it.
<P>

<a name="50705-17_para6"></a>In addition, I could not possibly agree to Amendment No. 38. I believe that the word "by" is much more important than "in respect of".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-17_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, the essential purpose of the amendments moved by the noble Lord, Lord Macaulay, is, so far as we understand, to remove the need for a carer to request an assessment and for the assessment of the carer's needs to be carried out independently of the needs of the child.
<P>

<a name="50705-17_para7"></a>I have difficulty with that on three grounds. First, it goes beyond our undertaking to align the Scottish provisions dealing with carers as closely as possible to the provisions which will apply in England and Wales. Secondly, I fear that the amendment, by requiring the carer's needs to be assessed independently of the needs of the child, might put the clause outwith the scope of the Bill in that it is a children Bill. Any assessment of adult carers would need to be carried out for the purposes of addressing the needs of the child.
<P>

<a name="50705-17_para8"></a>The third point is that I do not feel that it is appropriate for assessments to be imposed on carers. There will be carers who are perfectly happy and competent to care for the child. Local authority intervention of the kind which would apply if the amendments were adopted might well be resented by some carers. However, I accept that carers should be aware that they have a right to an assessment when the child's needs are being assessed. We propose to cover the point in the guidance issued following enactment of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50705-17_para9"></a>For those reasons, and for the reasons put forward by my noble friend Lord Balfour, but with the assurance that I have given on guidance, I invite the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-17_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Macaulay of Bragar: </B>   My Lords, the more closely one considers the Bill, the more difficult it becomes. One is not aware of many of these issues until considering the Bill. The assessments are made at the <P>


<a name="column_1142"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1142</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>request of the carers. Under Clause 23(1) where there is an assessment to determine the needs of a disabled child, a person in that section referred to as a carer,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"may request the local authority ... to carry out an assessment"</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-17_para10"></a>of the carer's ability. Should a power be given to the local authority to assess the carer? Why should the impetus come from the carer? We have to be careful about the needs of children, disabled or otherwise. Might some provision be built into Clause 23(1) to give the local authority the power to assess the ability of the carer to look after the disabled child?
<P>

<a name="50705-17_para11"></a>The more one reads the Bill, the more one sees problems emerging. It is an all-party Bill; I do not make any party points. Will the Government and their advisers consider the matter to see whether the local authority should be given some power to consider the carer as well as the child rather than wait for the request of the carer?
<P>

<a name="50705-17_para12"></a>Subject to that, and seeking to be helpful, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="50705-17_para17"></a>At present, the Bill offers some young people who have been looked after by their local authority the useful possibility of help, guidance and assistance as young adults. I continue to believe that the age range specified is too tight and that a slight relaxation of the age range of eligibility will be more than beneficial in the case of those who were discharged from being looked after by the local authority after their 15th birthday.
<P>

<a name="50705-17_para18"></a>I would suggest that it would be even more significant to look at the size of the group discharged after they reach 15&#189; years. I clearly believe that an enlargement of the catchment group could be useful in reducing homelessness, addiction, unemployment, lack of skills, disaffection and delinquency, all of which cost the nation a fortune, albeit set against a different budget. I remind noble Lords that the cost of a week's imprisonment is &#163;500 per person.
<P>

<a name="50705-17_para19"></a>Similarly, I should be keen to see the age range of the power to assist raised to 23 years. That would bring the provision up to a par with the average age of leaving home which is now understood to be 22 years. It also reflects the fact that growing up in a "looked after" environment is rarely a springboard to early maturity. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="50705-17_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Scottish Office   (Lord Fraser of Carmyllie): </B>  My Lords, I am keenly aware of the importance of aftercare.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-17_para20"></a>To my mind the key point is that services&#151;that is, advice, guidance and assistance given to them&#151;should be improved, not simply extended to people who are slightly older. If we get the services right at the early stage I very much hope that we shall be able to avoid some of the difficulties which exist at present.
<P>

<a name="50705-17_para21"></a>It is not simply a question of resources, although clearly additional costs could be significant if we both materially improve services and extend the age range of the young people who might qualify to receive them. It is just as important that the services and support should be carefully tailored to meet the needs of the young people involved. I hope that that can be achieved.
<P>

<a name="50705-17_para22"></a>I stress that the clause contains a duty for local authorities to provide aftercare for young people up to 19 and a power to continue assisting young care leavers until they are 21. All in all, we are providing for aftercare on a wider basis than is available for other parts of the United Kingdom. The aftercare provisions are considerably more generous than they are under the 1968 Act.
<P>

<a name="50705-17_para23"></a>I do not believe that we need to take aftercare beyond a young person's 21st birthday. But it should be noted that Clause 29 empowers local authorities to contribute to costs of education and training for young people beyond 21.
<P>

<a name="50705-17_para24"></a>This is essentially a children Bill. We have provided a strong framework of aftercare within it. I hope that, with the assessment on the quality that is provided, rather than extending the range the noble Earl will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1144</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-18_para4"></a>First, I believe it is essential that it is made absolutely clear that there are no exemptions to the jurisdiction of the future Children (Scotland) Act and that children in independent schools are definitely covered by that legislation.
<P>

<a name="50705-18_para5"></a>Secondly, problems arise in independent schools which need to be resolved. I believe that all schools should have effective and powerful internal systems to deal with complaints by pupils, parents and guardians. I further believe that there is a need for a system of external investigation and inspection. This, I understand, is already in place but seems to be little known and probably under-resourced.
<P>

<a name="50705-18_para6"></a>Thirdly, there are an increasing number of children from abroad attending Scottish independent schools. Our reputation in education goes before us, but we must live up to it. These children may be vulnerable, culture-shocked and far from home. We must ensure that the local systems of support are good enough to meet their needs.
<P>

<a name="50705-18_para7"></a>Fourthly, it may be necessary to give assistance and advice on anti-bullying and anti-abuse strategies. Her Majesty's inspectors should, by now, have broad experience in the area. As an analogy, the Scottish Prison Service has for the past two years had an anti-bullying strategy at the top of the list of priorities of governors of young offenders institutions. Perhaps the old virtue of over-privileged children being subjected to artificial hardship has broken down in an era of social mobility.
<P>

<a name="50705-18_para8"></a>Fifthly and finally, private education is bought and paid for, but it is not a consumer product which can be returned to the manufacturers. Parents who have committed their children to an independent school must be confident that the school is a competent place where their child can grow up. There is no second chance for a ruined childhood and upbringing. The amendment would put the Secretary of State's existing task on the face of the Bill and publicise it. I beg to move.

I noticed that in Scottish newspapers recently&#151;I shall not mention the name of the school involved&#151;it was stated that the headmaster had taken on board the problems which had been recognised in the school. He said that he was quite happy to have any inspection at any time. If that is the case, I cannot see why the noble Earl's amendment should be resisted by the Government.
<P>

<a name="50705-18_para9"></a>I noticed that in his remarks the headmaster said that hanging a child out of a window by his ankles and inserting a broom into a certain part of his anatomy was "horseplay". If that is horseplay, it is not the type of horseplay to which I should like my child or anyone else's to be subjected. The whole objective behind the amendment is to give an avenue through which parents and children can obtain justice within the school system. If the headmaster who made the remarks was responding to the criticisms of that school, then let us have an open house with the Government supporting the amendment.

<a name="50705-18_para11"></a>As a parent myself, I believe that one should complain first to the headmaster and, if the problem is not resolved quickly, one should remove one's child from the school.
<P>

<a name="50705-18_para12"></a>Schools might wish to consider the proposal that there could possibly be room for having a really independent person outwith the school whom the children could consult if they had a problem. It would have to be publicised to the children and everything would have to be totally confidential. The outside adviser would have to have the ear of the headmaster 24 hours a day, but something like that could be useful.

<A NAME="50705-18_spnew4"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   My Lords, I entirely agree with what the noble Earl, Lord Kintore, has just said. Apart from anything else, no amount of inspections would stop the kind of bullying described by the noble Lord, Lord Macaulay. Bullies do not hang children out of the window by their ankles when the inspector is standing below. I do not think inspections would stop that kind of thing and what the noble Earl, Lord Kintore, suggested is far more likely to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-18_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Earl for moving the amendment and particularly for the way in which he did it. As he is aware, a number of allegations have been made about a school in Scotland in what seemed to me to be extremely unfair circumstances. Little opportunity was allowed to the school to offer any explanation of whether the allegations were well-founded. For that reason, I am grateful to the noble Earl for approaching the matter in an objective way and without reference to particular circumstances.
<P>

<a name="50705-18_para13"></a>I am in complete agreement with the noble Earl that it is clearly desirable that the new welfare duty should be imposed on schools and that, as part of their inspection, Her Majesty's inspectors of schools should have regard to that new welfare duty. The inspections will be carried out on a routine basis, but in my view it would not be helpful to be restrictive in the Bill as to the frequency of the inspections. We have proposed a five-year inspection cycle, but that is not the only basis on which it might be undertaken. I take very seriously the noble Earl's concern that inspections should be triggered by complaints by pupils or their parents. All complaints about the operation of independent schools received by the Secretary of State are already followed up with the schools concerned. Her Majesty's inspectors of schools can be asked to carry out investigations and report their findings to the Secretary of State and make recommendations for improvements in provision by schools where those are considered necessary.

<a name="50705-18_para14"></a>My conclusion is that there is already in place an effective means of investigating complaints about the operation of independent schools. However, it does not end there. I note what the noble Earl, Lord Kintore, and the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, said. I can advise them that child protection guidelines are being drawn up by Professor Kathleen Marshall of Glasgow University, in consultation with a number of interested and expert parties, for use by the independent schools in meeting their new duty under this clause. Clause 34, as at present worded, will provide an effective means of ensuring that appropriate welfare standards are in place in independent schools. I hope that noble Lords will be reassured by the action that is being initiated by independent schools in Scotland to meet the new duty that is imposed on them. With those words, I hope that the noble Earl will feel that he can withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="50705-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Macaulay of Bragar </B>   moved Amendment No. 50:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Page 31, line 22, leave out subsection (5).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50705-19_para2"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this is an amendment to Clause 43 of the Bill in relation to the publication of proceedings at children's hearings. Its objective in leaving out subsection (5) of this particular clause is that no proceedings in a children's hearing should be published at all. As was discussed in Committee, the Secretary of State for Scotland has a power to order the publication of children's hearings, but it has never to my knowledge been used.
<P>

<a name="50705-19_para3"></a>It is important to remember that the whole purpose of children's hearings in Scotland was to contain dealings with children within the community, with access between the Children's Panel, the parents and the child and with reference to the sheriff to find out whether grounds of referral were justified. To allow publication of the hearings in any shape, manner or form would be contrary to the proposals of Lord Kilbrandon, who set out the guidelines that children should be dealt with within the community.
<P>

<a name="50705-19_para4"></a>Children are sent to a hearing for a variety of reasons. If they have committed some horrible crime such as murder, rape or arson, they will not be dealt with within the children's hearing system; they will be dealt with through the normal court process, assuming that they are over the age of criminal responsibility. It would not help the running of the children's hearing system if anyone were allowed to report the basis or the decision of the hearing or to name the children or their parents. That is why this amendment was tabled.
<P>

<a name="50705-19_para5"></a>Many people will say that children would not be at the children's hearing if they had not done something wrong. But that is not the point at issue. The whole point of a children's hearing is to set a child who has gone wrong in whatever way back on the right road. The worst approach is to publicise his or her appearance before the children's hearing and let neighbours and peers at school know that the child has been before the hearing and has been dealt with. This amendment was tabled for the protection of children. That is an essential ingredient of the Bill. On that basis, I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   My Lords, this amendment is identical to one that the noble Lord tabled at Committee stage. It remains my view that a dispensing power is necessary to provide for exceptional cases in the interests of justice.
<P>

<a name="50705-19_para6"></a>The noble Lord will be aware that the Secretary of State already has such a general power in the 1968 Act. The Children Act 1989 extends such a power to both the court and the Secretary of State. The noble Lord is absolutely right: these powers are not to be used lightly; nor have they been used in the past. But there may be circumstances, however rare, where it may be appropriate to dispense with the prohibition. This long-stop provision ensures that, should such a situation arise, either the court or the Secretary of State has the necessary powers available. I stress that it is very much a long-stop provision. With that assurance, and knowing the history of this provision, I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.

<A NAME="50705-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Macaulay of Bragar: </B>   My Lords, I am always very intrigued by the phrase "the interests of justice". The question is: justice to whom? Is it justice to the individual or to what we care to call society? Obviously the amendment is not acceptable to the Government, so there is no point in my pressing it. I have not yet heard who is to be Secretary of State for Scotland. I hope that whoever it is will take on board the Minister's remarks. I am sure that whoever he is&#151;and I have a suspicion who it might be&#151;will exercise his humanity and will not allow to be broadcast anything that happens within the children's hearing system subject to the guidelines provided by the Minister.

An undertaking was given in another place to consider the introduction of a provision that would extend to a child the right to attend all stages of a children's hearing. Following an amendment in Committee by the noble Lord, Lord Macaulay, we undertook to bring forward these amendments. They fulfil the commitment by giving the child an unqualified right of attendance. The amendments also ensure, however, that the hearing may proceed in the absence of the child.
<P>

<a name="50705-19_para10"></a>The later amendments in my name introduce a similar right for the child to attend a hearing of an application before a sheriff to establish the grounds of referral.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-20_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   My Lords, the only time I have felt a frisson of irritation during the course of the Bill is over this matter. I am as anxious as other noble Lords to ensure that the unique system that we have in Scotland of children's hearings should be maintained and improved wherever possible.
<P>

<a name="50705-20_para0"></a>Why I indicated previously that we have to introduce this arrangement is that a children's hearing is an informal body. It is quasi-judicial and as such does not follow judicial procedure. It does not conform to the European Convention on Human Rights which, in Article 6, guarantees a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law which provides the procedural safeguards required by that article. This leaves hearing decisions open to challenge under the convention.
<P>

<a name="50705-20_para1"></a>We are bound to take this matter very seriously because of our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights. A wider range of disposals on appeal to the sheriff is necessary and this is provided in subsection (5) (c) (iii) of Clause 50. That, in our view, is the best way to preserve the hearings system, while meeting our international obligations.
<P>

<a name="50705-20_para2"></a>This is a matter which we have considered with the greatest care, since we are, as the White Paper affirmed, strongly committed to the hearings system. With those strongest of reassurances, I hope the noble Lord can withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hope of Craighead: </B>   My Lords, I support the Minister on this point. I had experience of the difficulty of dealing with these matters on appeal. It is largely with the benefit of that background that the wording of the clause was constructed. This provision is necessary in order to give the court the power to deal with some difficult matters without the necessity to go back before the children's hearing, which may find it difficult to accept the factual basis upon which the court has to proceed, having allowed the appeal.
<P>

<a name="50705-20_para3"></a>This is an extremely technical matter to explain. However, I can assure your Lordships that my experience tells me that this clause is valuable and I suggest that the Government have made the right decision to include it in the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-20_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Macaulay of Bragar: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, in connection with these matters. What concerns the people involved with child welfare and children's hearings is whether this is the best way to test the European Convention on children's rights.
<P>

<a name="50705-20_para4"></a>As far as I am aware, no case has been taken to the European Court. According to a radio broadcast I listened to last week, it takes three to four years to obtain a decision from the European Court, but it is hoped to speed up that process by cutting out the Commission and therefore getting to the European Court fairly quickly.
<P>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1151</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-20_para5"></a>I still maintain&#151;with the greatest respect, despite the views expressed in this short debate&#151;that this provision runs contrary to Kilbrandon. Once we start running contrary to Kilbrandon on one view, we may as well give up the children's hearing system altogether. That may be a cynical view, but it is a view I express. It is perhaps a sad view that the criminal courts, the sheriff court, the High Court and so forth, including the European Court, are to be brought into the matter. Why cannot the children's hearing exercise a quasi-judicial decision which is open to judicial review? That is an entirely different animal from the sheriff being allowed to impose his own views on the children's hearing.
<P>

<a name="50705-20_para6"></a>There is a lot of work to be done on this matter between now and Third Reading, if not afterwards. I cannot for the life of me see why the sheriff has been brought into this procedure to impose his decision on the panel and on the child. I hope that the Government will have another look at it. We should let one of the cases go to the European Court and let the European Court tell the children's panel that it is acting in contravention of the law. I am not convinced that this section is based on any European Convention. No doubt the Minister will attempt to convince me otherwise.
<P>

<a name="50705-20_para7"></a>I am extremely unhappy about the intervention of the sheriff in what is, as the Minister said, a system unique to Scotland for dealing with children. If we are going to take them out of the children's system and dump them into the sheriff court, let us forget about children's hearings and get on with it. Let us put the children back into the sheriff courts as they used to be when I started practice; when the sheriff took off his wig and we all went into a room with the mother and father and discussed the situation. That is the easy way to do it. That is expressing a personal view, but I can see what the end result of this approach to the children's panel system will be. With those perhaps rather cynical observations, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="50705-20_para14"></a>In response, my right honourable and learned friend the Lord Advocate entered into discussion with the Lord President of the Court of Session as to how the latter's concerns might be met in relation to the problem of the dual route of appeal. The result of those discussions, in which I also participated, has been to agree that we should not jeopardise the availability locally of appeals in the sheriff courts through the appeal route provided in Clause 50(11) to the sheriff principal from decisions of the sheriff.
<P>

<a name="50705-20_para15"></a>It was also agreed that we should not jeopardise the opportunity of direct appeal to the Court of Session in those cases where it seemed appropriate for such an appeal to be brought, say, where there were major issues.

COMMONS AMENDMENT
<br>
 9After Clause 16, insert the following clause:
<center><b>Exceptions to the rule that hearsay evidence is inadmissible</B></center><br>
' .&#151;(1) Subject to the following provisions of this section, evidence of a statement made by a person otherwise than while giving oral evidence in court in criminal proceedings shall be admissible in those proceedings as evidence of any matter contained in the statement where the judge is satisfied&#151;
<br>
(a) that the person who made the statement will not give evidence in the proceedings of such matter for any of the reasons mentioned in subsection (2) below;
<br>
(b) that evidence of the matter would be admissible in the proceedings if that person gave direct oral evidence of it;
<br>
(c) that the person who made the statement would have been, at the time the statement was made, a competent witness in such proceedings; and
<br>
(d) that there is evidence which would entitle a jury properly directed, or in summary proceedings would entitle the judge, to find that the statement was made and that either&#151;
<br>
(i) it is contained in a document; or
<br>
(ii) a person who gave oral evidence in the proceedings as to the statement has direct personal knowledge of the making of the statement.
<br>
(2) The reasons referred to in paragraph (a) of subsection (1) above are that the person who made the statement&#151;
<br>
(a) is dead or is, by reason of his bodily or mental condition, unfit or unable to give evidence in any competent manner;
<br>
(b) is named and otherwise sufficiently identified, but is outwith the United Kingdom and it is not reasonably practicable to secure his attendance at the trial or to obtain his evidence in any other competent manner;
<br>
(c) is named and otherwise sufficiently identified, but cannot be found and all reasonable steps which, in the circumstances, could have been taken to find him have been so taken;
<br>
(d) having been authorised to do so by virtue of a ruling of the court in the proceedings that he is entitled to refuse to give evidence in connection with the subject matter of the statement on the grounds that such evidence might incriminate him, refuses to give such evidence; or
<br>
(e) is called as a witness and either&#151;
<br>
(i) refuses to take the oath or affirmation; or
<br>
(ii) having been sworn as a witness and directed by the judge to give evidence in connection with the subject matter of the statement refuses to do so,
<br>
and in the application of this paragraph to a child, the reference to a witness refusing to take the oath or affirmation or, as the case may be, to having <P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_1155"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1155</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=2>been sworn shall be construed as a reference to a child who has refused to accept an admonition to tell the truth or, having been so admonished, refuses to give evidence as mentioned above.
<br>
(3) Evidence of a statement shall not be admissible by virtue of subsection (1) above where the judge is satisfied that the occurrence of any of the circumstances mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (e) of subsection (2) above, by virtue of which the statement would otherwise be admissible, is caused by&#151;
<br>
(a) the person in support of whose case the evidence would be given; or
<br>
(b) any other person acting on his behalf,
<br>
for the purpose of securing that the person who made the statement does not give evidence for the purposes of the proceedings either at all or in connection with the subject matter of the statement.
<br>
(4) Where in any proceedings evidence of a statement made by any person is admitted by reference to any of the reasons mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (c) and (e) (i) of subsection (2) above&#151;
<br>
(a) any evidence which, if that person had given evidence in connection with the subject matter of the statement, would have been admissible as relevant to his credibility as a witness shall be admissible for that purpose in those proceedings;
<br>
(b) evidence may be given of any matter which, if that person had given evidence in connection with the subject matter of the statement, could have been put to him in cross-examination as relevant to his credibility as a witness but of which evidence could not have been adduced by the cross-examining party; and
<br>
(c) evidence tending to prove that that person, whether before or after making the statement, made in whatever manner some other statement which is inconsistent with it shall be admissible for the purpose of showing that he has contradicted himself.
<br>
(5) Subject to subsection (6) below, where a party intends to apply to have evidence of a statement admitted by virtue of subsection (1) above he shall, before the trial diet, give notice in writing of&#151;
<br>
(a) that fact;
<br>
(b) the witnesses and productions to be adduced in connection with such evidence; and
<br>
(c) such other matters as may be prescribed by Act of Adjournal,
<br>
to every other party to the proceedings and, for the purposes of this subsection, such evidence may be led notwithstanding that a witness or production concerned is not included in any list lodged by the parties and that the notice required by sections 81 and 82(2) of the 1975 Act has not been given.
<br>
(6) A party shall not be required to give notice as mentioned in subsection (5) above where&#151;
<br>
(a) the grounds for seeking to have evidence of a statement admitted are as mentioned in paragraph (d) or (e) of subsection (2) above; or
<br>
(b) he satisfies the judge that there was good reason for not giving such notice.
<br>
(7) If no other party to the proceedings objects to the admission of evidence of a statement by virtue of subsection (1) above, the evidence shall be admitted without the judge requiring to be satisfied as mentioned in that subsection.
<br>
(8) For the purposes of the determination of any matter upon which the judge is required to be satisfied under subsection (1) above&#151;
<br>
(a) except to the extent that any other party to the proceedings challenges them and insists in such challenge, it shall be presumed that the circumstances are as stated by the party seeking to introduce evidence of the statement; and

<FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_1156"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1156</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=2>
<br>
(b) where such a challenge is insisted in, the judge shall determine the matter on the balance of probabilities, and he may draw any reasonable inference&#151;
<br>
(i) from the circumstances in which the statement was made or otherwise came into being; or
<br>
(ii) from any other circumstances, including, where the statement is contained in a document, the form and contents of the document.
<br>
(9) Where evidence of a statement has been admitted by virtue of subsection (1) above on the application of one party to the proceedings, without prejudice to anything in any enactment or rule of law, the judge may permit any party to lead additional evidence of such description as the judge may specify, notwithstanding that a witness or production concerned is not included in any list lodged by the parties and that the notice required by sections 81 and 82(2) of the 1975 Act has not been given.
<br>
(10) Any reference in subsections (5), (6) and (9) above to evidence shall include a reference to evidence led in connection with any determination required to be made for the purposes of subsection (1) above.'.

<P>
<A NAME="50705-21_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rodger of Earlsferry: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 9. It may be of assistance to the disposal of the business if at this stage I speak only to Amendment No. 9. Your Lordships will see that the amendment proposes to insert a new clause after Clause 16. The purpose of the new clause is to introduce exceptions to the rule that hearsay evidence is inadmissible.
<P>

<a name="50705-21_para5"></a>The basic rule of our law is that hearsay evidence is inadmissible. What is proposed here is that a limited number of significant exceptions should be introduced to that rule. The clause embodies proposals which come from the report of the Scottish Law Commission. The report is the result of years of work, including consultation with various interested parties in the formulation of the proposals. The clause does not reproduce exactly the proposals of the Law Commission. A number of amendments have been made, particularly to deal with procedural matters, but basically it gives effect to the policy as embodied in the Law Commission report.
<P>

<a name="50705-21_para6"></a>Your Lordships will already have seen the exceptions included in subsection (2) (a). The subsection reproduces the existing well-known exception of someone who is dead but adds a part to deal with people who by reason of their bodily or mental condition are unfit or unable to give evidence. Subsection (2) (b) goes on to deal with people who are outwith the United Kingdom and it is not reasonably practicable to secure their attendance at the trial or to obtain their evidence in any other competent manner. It would then be possible for hearsay evidence of that matter to be adduced.
<P>

<a name="50705-21_para7"></a>Importantly, in paragraphs (c), (d) and (e), further exceptions are introduced. The exception in paragraph (c) is where a person cannot be found and all reasonable steps which, in the circumstances, could have been taken to find him have been taken. Paragraphs (d) and (e) deal with the situation where someone appears in court as a witness but declines to answer or refuses to take the oath and then refuses to give evidence.
<P>


<a name="column_1157"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1157</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-21_para8"></a>Among the purposes of paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) is to deal with the problem that has been highlighted in our courts over recent years and on which there has been a divergence of opinion among the judiciary, including, in particular, the noble and learned Lord, Lord McCluskey. That relates to the situation where a person who is an incriminee&#151;someone who has admitted a particular crime&#151;and whether it should be competent to lead evidence of that person's admission in a situation where the accused person has drawn attention to that by the appropriate notice and has incriminated that person. The provision means that where the person who is the incriminee cannot be found after reasonable steps, it would be possible for evidence of the statement&#151;the admission&#151;to be led, or, where he has been led in evidence&#151;and that would be the appropriate thing if it could be found&#151;but does not give evidence or refuses to give evidence or refuses to take the oath, or whatever it may be, in that situation evidence could be led.
<P>

<a name="50705-21_para9"></a>I would be the first to admit that this is in many ways a matter where a balance of judgment has had to be reached. From the prosecution point of view there are obvious dangers that people may, for whatever reason, choose to hide themselves, other people who may fabricate evidence, and so on. Those are dangers of which we are aware. But we believe that the balance which has been struck is an appropriate one. It is, after all, a matter of judgment. The Law Commission has considered this matter very carefully. We believe that on balance it is appropriate to go down this road. In particular, we hope that it will deal with that particular and anxious matter which arose in the case of Maclay and had earlier arisen in the case of Perry, where, under our existing law, it was not possible to lead the evidence of an admission by an incriminee. It is a matter of judgment but we believe that the balance has been appropriately struck. I beg to move.

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Macaulay of Bragar: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move Amendment No. 9A as an amendment to Commons Amendment No. 9.
<P>

<a name="50705-22_para0"></a>The amendment seeks to delete paragraphs (2) (b) and (c) of the new clause. The noble and learned Lord, Lord McCluskey, has tabled an amendment to leave out paragraphs (2) (c),(d) and (e), so it may be for the convenience of the House if we discuss the whole principle at the same time. I do not know whether that is a good idea, but we are dealing with the same topic.
<P>

<a name="50705-22_para1"></a>I am rather perturbed by this provision. I have tried to make inquiries but at the moment I do not have precise information. However, as I understand it, the provision was introduced in another place at the last minute and went through, as they say colloquially, on the nod. No one noticed what was going on. I am not saying that anyone was being dishonest but I find it very strange that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate goes <P>


<a name="column_1158"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1158</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>along with what the Law Commission said in this instance but with regard to the Children (Scotland) Bill and the Law Commission's view on violence to children the Government did not accept what the Law Commission said. So let us forget the Scottish Law Commission. It does its best. Let us look at this particular piece of legislation and see what it is all about.
<P>

<a name="50705-22_para2"></a>We have hearsay evidence in civil cases, which was introduced some years ago. Hearsay evidence was admissible at the discretion of the judge. Discretion is built in here as well. But the big distinction is particularly that in southern proceedings it is not the judge who is hearing the evidence, but the jury. They are an entirely different species. Of course a judge can dismiss from his mind certain matters and presumably treat them neutrally. But once the so-called "evidence" of a statement is before the jury, the simple truth of the matter is that the jury will hear the evidence and say, "Well, he told that to the police and he has disappeared".
<P>

<a name="50705-22_para3"></a>The disturbing phrase in Clause 9 is that the evidence,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"shall be admissible in those proceedings as evidence of any matter contained in the statement".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-22_para4"></a>How on earth is that to be tested? There is no witness and therefore no cross-examination. Are we really saying that if a statement is taken, for example, at a police station that that is not going to be tested before the jury? For example, it may be presented to a jury in a murder case and it will be said, "That is what Joe Bloggs said but, by the way, he is not here because he has scarpered. He gave a statement to Inspector Bloggs and there is a statement from the inspector. That is what he said and that is the evidence".
<P>

<a name="50705-22_para5"></a>I am not a judge, but no doubt the noble and learned Lord, Lord McCluskey, will give us greater insight into how judges approach these matters. The judge can say until he is blue in the face that he will ignore this or that and treat it on the basis that there has been no cross-examination. But that is not good enough. I cannot remember the name of the Bill, but in 1990 there was provision for taking evidence by satellite, for example. That matter is not dealt with here. I am looking at subsection (2) (b) which says that the person who made the statement,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"is named and otherwise sufficiently identified, but is outwith the United Kingdom and it is not reasonably practicable to secure his attendance at the trial or to obtain his evidence in any other competent manner".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-22_para6"></a>Presumably, that is a reference to the 1990 Bill as regards taking evidence by satellite. For example, in a criminal trial how does the defence know that it is not possible to obtain his or her evidence,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in any other competent manner"?</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-22_para7"></a>It is laying out a minefield for delay in criminal trials.
<P>

<a name="50705-22_para8"></a>I now turn to subsection (2) (c). In making the statement the person,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"is named and otherwise sufficiently identified, but cannot be found and all reasonable steps which, in the circumstances, could have been taken to find him have been so taken".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-22_para9"></a>That does not say by whom. Does that mean that the mythical Inspector Bloggs comes in and says, "We have tried to find Charlie Smith, but we cannot, so let us just get on with the trial. Here is a statement that he made <P>


<a name="column_1159"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1159</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>at the police station". The prosecutor then shows that to the jury. According to this Bill, as drafted, that statement becomes evidence. I find it a disturbing piece of legislation. I suggest to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate that this is legislation done in haste and that it would be better to tread carefully rather than to rush in and just incorporate this piece of legislation into the Criminal Justice Bill. In my view, that will cause more trouble than it is worth. I hope that the Government will take it away and think again. I beg to move.
<P>

<a name="50705-22_para10"></a>Moved, that Amendment No. 9A, as an amendment to Commons Amendment No. 9, be agreed to.&#151;(Lord Macaulay of Bragar.)

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McCluskey: </B>   My Lords, I believe that it would be convenient if I speak to my Amendment No. 9AA. First, in response to what the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate said, I welcome the good parts of this amendment. If it does remedy what I perceive to be the injustice in the McLay case then I certainly welcome it. I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Macaulay, will find the answers to most of his questions in the report of the Scottish Law Commission, in particular in paragraph 5.45 dealing with television links and the legislation that governs it.
<P>

<a name="50705-22_para11"></a>As regards this general clause and subsection (2) introduced by Amendment No. 9, paragraph (a) is perfectly tolerable because to some extent it governs the common law in relation to persons who are dead and may be in relation to certain others. I am not very happy about the notion of "unfitness". I would like to think that that would apply only when the person was permanently unfit or unfit for such a length of time that it would be acceptable to proceed with his hearsay evidence. However, that is acceptable.
<P>

<a name="50705-22_para12"></a>Equally, paragraph (b) is acceptable except that once again it would be desirable to have written into the paragraph the words "within a reasonable time" so that it reads:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"not reasonably practicable to secure his attendance within a reasonable time".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-22_para13"></a>Then one could proceed to introduce the hearsay evidence. No doubt that is a consideration which the judge will bear in mind when he applies that. On that basis, I can accept it.
<P>

<a name="50705-22_para14"></a>My Amendment No. 9AA proposes the omission of paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) from subsection (2). I apologise for the fact that it is a manuscript amendment but these matters arose at rather a late stage. As the noble Lord, Lord Macaulay pointed out, these paragraphs permit, within the confines of the clause, that a policeman can state that he heard an oral statement by a person who was a competent witness. He might say, "I heard him say, 'It was not me what done it, it was X'"&#151;that is, the accused.
<P>

<a name="50705-22_para15"></a>Thus X risks being convicted on the basis of police evidence and hearsay. As the noble Lord, Lord Macaulay, pointed out, that cannot be cross-examined. The witness cannot be cross-examined in the circumstances of this section and the policeman will simply say, "That is what he said". He cannot be cross-examined about the details. I do not like that at all.
<P>


<a name="column_1160"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1160</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-22_para16"></a>Your Lordships will see from paragraph 5.49 of the report of the Scottish Law Commission that its proposal in relation to paragraph (c) was not one which met with favour from the consultees. It writes that the majority of our consultees did not favour the creation of an exception to the hearsay rule on this ground, considering that such an exception would be open to abuse. I endorse the view of the majority whom the commission consulted that this is open to abuse.
<P>

<a name="50705-22_para17"></a>So this new clause effects a very substantial alteration in the law relating to hearsay. I shall try to identify the weaknesses only once. First, the evidence will not be able to be tested or challenged in cross-examination. Secondly, as the commission points out in paragraphs 4.4, 4.5 and 4.18, a conviction based on hearsay evidence which cannot be subjected to cross-examination may well be a breach of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. I do not believe that we should be rushing into legislation in a fashion which may result in a breach of the convention.
<P>

<a name="50705-22_para18"></a>Furthermore, this hearsay evidence can be brought in as evidence of the fact, without any risk at all that the maker of the statement which constitutes the evidence can be charged, for example, with perjury even if his statement is quite deliberately false. Nor can a person who makes up the statement or who persuades the missing witness to make the assertion, be charged with subornation or perjury because there is no perjury involved. As a matter of principle the evidence, in most circumstances, cannot be the best evidence. So the danger is indeed real.
<P>

<a name="50705-22_para19"></a>What the new clause enables to be done is that the accused person, or some other interested party or an over-zealous policeman, can produce as admissible evidence of the facts of the case evidence which he knows to be false and which he knows the alleged maker of the statement would never say in court, because the alleged maker of that statement would not take the risk of being charged with perjury as regards the making of the statement.
<P>

<a name="50705-22_para20"></a>We have always been deeply suspicious of hearsay evidence except where it is absolutely essential&#151;and I do not think that the essentiality is made out. I have read carefully the thorough report of the Scottish Law Commission which considered all these matters in great detail and I regret to say that I do not find the arguments persuasive in relation to these matters.
<P>

<a name="50705-22_para21"></a>In paragraph (c), one is talking about a person who cannot be found. A person can, in effect, be made to disappear either by the accused person, the accused person's friends or even by an over-zealous policeman. No doubt the Minister will point to subsection (3) and say that evidence of a statement shall not be admissible unless the judge is satisfied that the person whose evidence is adduced in that form is not missing by reason of some activity on the part of the person in support of whose case the evidence is to be given. What worries me about that is that it is extremely difficult to prove why a person is missing. If he simply does not turn up and nobody seems to know where he is, it is impossible to satisfy the judge as to who, if anyone, caused the disappearance. That applies whoever caused the disappearance. In any event, if a policeman were <P>


<a name="column_1161"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1161</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>responsible for encouraging the witness to disappear, which could happen, it is not at all clear to me that in subsection (3) (a) the policeman would fall under the description of,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the person in support of whose case the evidence would be given",</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-22_para22"></a>because the policeman is not a party to the case. It is not his case; the Lord Advocate is, in a sense, the person who owns the case on that side. Therefore, with respect, it appears to me that the safeguard contained in subsection (3) is an empty and fairly useless one.
<P>

<a name="50705-22_para23"></a>In case I should be thought to be scaremongering in suggesting that witnesses can be made to disappear, I recall a case of some years ago in which, acting as a prosecutor, I was approached by a very high-ranking policeman and asked if a particular witness who was in police custody could be excused further attendance at the trial. I could not release him because the defence said that they wanted him there. However, within three hours the witness had escaped through an open lavatory window, his handcuffs having been removed to allow him to go to the lavatory. He was not then available for the trial. One would not have to be unduly cynical to suppose that the police had decided that he was better out of the way. That was no doubt because he was an informer and they were endeavouring to protect him. So, it can happen, and it worries me that people on the accused's side of the fence, particular professional criminals, might pay for or otherwise cause witnesses to disappear, and thus be unable to put before the court evidence which would not otherwise be available.
<P>

<a name="50705-22_para24"></a>Much the same considerations apply to paragraphs (d) and (e). It is common to find people refusing to give evidence in court. It is deeply worrying that the prosecution can then come forward and present substantial statements to the court.
<P>

<a name="50705-22_para25"></a>I should like to make just one other point in that regard. It is a curious phenomenon that if evidence is taken in the form of precognition by an independent officer who is a servant, in effect, of the Lord Advocate, that precognition cannot be used in order to adduce hearsay evidence; but if a statement is taken or allegedly taken by a policeman in his notebook or on the back of an envelope while he is in the back of a car, that can be introduced. Once again, I am surprised at the discrimination against a precognition (other than a precognition on oath) and in favour of the police statement. I do not favour that. In addressing the general matter, I hope that I have made my points on Amendment No. 9AA.

<A NAME="50705-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rodger of Earlsferry: </B>   My Lords, in replying briefly, I acknowledge that this is not something which noble Lords will find altogether easy because it is a major and important change. It is always correct in matters of hearsay evidence that they are not subject to cross-examination. That is why we have generally excluded them. However, it has never been an absolute rule. Death is an obvious example, but judges have always had to comment on the fact that there has not been any cross-examination. The evidence here will be in the same category. It will therefore be a matter of comment that it has not been subject to <P>


<a name="column_1162"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1162</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>cross-examination. I note, however, that under subsection (4) it will be possible to lead evidence in relation to credibility and reliability.
<P>

<a name="50705-23_para0"></a>I also accept that there is always a risk that people may be made to disappear. As we know, that happens at present. It is a question of judgment as to whether, when people have disappeared, their evidence should nonetheless be available. Obviously, it is not a good thing if an accused person can make a witness against him disappear, because the Crown thereby loses the evidence. It is evidence, however, which will be subject to the comment that it has not been able to be cross-examined. Therefore, I accept that it is a question of judgment.
<P>

<a name="50705-23_para1"></a>In the circumstances, all that I can say is that we have considered the matter carefully in the light of the report and having particular regard to Perry and Maclay. We believe that this is the best way forward. Obviously, we shall consider the matter as time goes by, but we believe that this is the correct way to proceed.

At what stage was it introduced? That is a matter which concerns me. Indeed, I hope that everybody who is interested in the administration of justice in Scotland will be concerned that we have not had time to consider the proposals. We know that they come from the Scottish Law Commission, but that is not the point. Lawyers, the Law Society and others interested in these matters should have time to consider the provisions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-23_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rodger of Earlsferry: </B>   My Lords, the amendment was introduced in Committee. As I recall, the report appeared after the recent break. I think that we would have been open to criticism if we had not taken the opportunity presented by this Bill to bring forward legislation prepared by the Law Commission to deal with the very acute problem of Perry and Maclay.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-23_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McCluskey: </B>   My Lords, I am proposing not to move my amendment, but I should like to reply specifically to the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Macaulay. The matter was dealt with at the sixth sitting of the Scottish Standing Committee. It was introduced by Lord James Douglas-Hamilton who spoke, broadly speaking, in the same terms as the Lord Advocate has spoken today. There was no opposition to it at all. It was then referred to again on Report and there was again no opposition to it. Therefore, as the noble Lord, Lord Macaulay, said, it went through on the nod.

<P>

<a name="50705-23_para4"></a>This is a short amendment which I hope will meet with the Government's approval. It seeks to give 14 days' notice within the terms of Commons Amendment No. 9 and to ensure that a person involved in a case can have adequate notice to pursue the matters covered by the debate that we have just had. It seeks to give the defence an opportunity to make proper inquiries as to people who have disappeared, are not available or cannot be found. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord McCluskey, said, if a person is ill he might be fit to appear within a certain period of time. On that basis, I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-23_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rodger of Earlsferry: </B>   My Lords, although I understand the intention behind the amendment, it is not well taken. It would impose a limit of 14 days but, as noble Lords will realise, such circumstances could arise within 14 days of the commencement of a trial. It could happen that somebody who was available at the start of the 14-day period was subsequently not available. The person may have died, for example. In that situation it does not seem appropriate to require that notice should be given within 14 days. Therefore we do not prescribe a limit to the notice but say that it must be given. It will of course be obvious that if it is given too late a judge will have to consider whether to allow an adjournment or whatever it may be. I hope with that assurance that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-23_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Macaulay of Bragar: </B>   My Lords, I am obliged to the Minister for that explanation. I am not entirely convinced, but we shall look with interest at what the noble and learned Lord has said. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="50705-23_para8"></a>Unfortunately, the notion of "good reason" is an extremely vague one. I suggest that it should have been tightened up.

<a name="50705-23_para9"></a>I suggest to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate that the idea of prejudice should be specifically written in so that it is not left as vague as it is at present. That is the basis of the amendment. I beg to move.

<P>

<a name="50705-23_para11"></a>The question of prejudice will be relevant to the allied question of whether some adjournment should be allowed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-24_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McCluskey: </B>   My Lords, I am trying to keep pace with the speed of developments. This clause is concerned, in effect, to put into statutory form the law which has been developing since Muldoon v. Herron and which most recently found expression in Jamieson v. Her Majesty's Advocate in July last year. I do not greatly approve of the way the law has developed. But it has developed slowly in the courts and there is nothing that I propose to alter in respect of it. But what worries me about the matter here is that, if one looks at the Jamieson case, one has the kind of situation where the witness comes into court and says, "I cannot give evidence about the matter. I did not see it". Then under pressure he says, "Well I might have said something different to the police. Yes, I did give a statement to the police". He is asked, "Did you tell lies to the police?" "No". "Did you tell the truth to the police?" "I suppose I did". Then the police say in court, "What he told us was this". That then becomes the evidence in the case. This provision gives that statutory form.
<P>

<a name="50705-24_para0"></a>That worries me and so I am concerned to move this amendment which would insert after the words, "he adopts it as", in paragraph (2) the words, "an accurate statement of". In other words, one has to be a little more strict than the court was in the case of Jamieson. It is not to be regarded as evidence which the jury can found upon unless the witness says, "Yes, I said it, and I accept that it is an accurate account of the evidence which I would have given if my memory had not failed me". I beg to move.
<P>

<a name="50705-24_para1"></a>Moved, That Amendment No. 10A, as an amendment to Commons Amendment No. 10, be agreed to.&#151;(Lord McCluskey).

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rodger of Earlsferry: </B>   My Lords, the question is whether the evidence should be admissible. I of course understand the point that the noble and learned Lord makes, but where someone in the circumstances he described says, "If that is what I said, it must have been true", or whatever it is he says, he has in effect adopted it as his evidence.
<P>

<a name="50705-24_para2"></a>The question is whether that evidence is admissible. It will be open to cross-examination and comment. I do not believe that it would add anything in practice if he merely said, "I adopt it as accurate", or whatever it may be, because that is the tenor of it. It may well be that in such circumstances questions arise as to whether the evidence was accurate. I believe that the spirit of what <P>


<a name="column_1166"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1166</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the noble and learned Lord said is reflected in what we have here and in the Jamieson case, although I accept of course that it is not put in quite that way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-24_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McCluskey: </B>   My Lords, I am not impressed by the answer to the effect that the person can be cross-examined. If one were to look at the case of Jamieson, one would find that were Marianne Robertson, who gave evidence&#151;her evidence is printed in the report of Jamieson v. Her Majesty's Advocate&#151;to be cross-examined she would, I presume, simply say, "I don't remember". Therefore the cross-examination will be of no value in challenging the statement which is attributed to her by the police.
<P>

<a name="50705-24_para3"></a>Obviously when a person is asked the question, "Did you tell the police the truth?", as she was asked, such a person will not say, "No". She will say, "Yes", as Marianne Robertson did. So I do not see the safeguards as being sufficient. However, I do not propose to divide the House on the matter, and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

Your Lordships will see that the purpose of the amendment is to delete the words "or without" from paragraph (2) (b). Although we are talking here about a statement in a document, when one unravels the definition one finds that a statement in a document includes an oral statement which a policeman may have written down in a document, being a police notebook or the back of an envelope. That is unfortunate because it cannot be right to allow a policeman to create a document of this kind without the knowledge of the alleged witness to it. That is precisely what the clause, as presently drafted, does.

<a name="50705-25_para0"></a>One is already going very far in allowing in such hearsay evidence; but, surely, in the circumstances, we do not need to include the words "or without", thus enabling the policeman to appear at the trial and make an assertion that a statement was made which he overheard as a bystander and wrote down on a piece of paper, which is a document within the meaning of the new clause. I beg to move.
<P>

<a name="50705-25_para1"></a>Moved, that Amendment No. 12A, as an amendment to Commons Amendment No. 12, be agreed to.&#151;(Lord McCluskey.)

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-25_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rodger of Earlsferry: </B>   My Lords, I believe that if these words were inserted, they would inappropriately circumscribe the provision. For example, let us suppose that someone were to admit to killing someone else in the presence of a third party. If that third party, being shocked and so forth, thereafter wrote down an account of what he had heard, I believe that would be invaluable evidence in a document, the accuracy of which would be likely to be much greater than the accuracy of his recollection some months later. Therefore, in that situation it would be unfortunate if that were not admissible simply because it had not been taken down in the presence and with the knowledge of the person who had made the confession.
<P>

<a name="50705-25_para2"></a>One can see that if the matter were limited in that way, it would be unlikely that people would sit there as they heard a confession and write it down, whereas if they had noted it down shortly afterwards, or whenever it might be, it would be likely to be accurate and an important element. It is for that reason and in such circumstances that we believe it should be with or without the knowledge of the person concerned.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-25_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McCluskey: </B>   My Lords, I hope that tomorrow the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate will read carefully what he has said today because I believe that it is entirely and utterly inaccurate. The new clause, which is embraced by Amendment No. 12, applies to sections covered by Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 and not Amendment No. 11. Therefore, it does not relate to <P>


<a name="column_1169"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1169</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>confessions. If a policeman writes down a confession, whenever he does, that is admissible under the present law. However, this provision relates to statements which are admissible under the new clause as covered by Amendments Nos. 9 and 10. In other words, they include statements made by witnesses rather than by accused persons, except in the special circumstances covered by the new clause introduced by Amendment No. 11. I shall read Hansard most carefully but I believe that the noble and learned Lord has misunderstood the issue&#151;-

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-25_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rodger of Earlsferry: </B>   My Lords, I was thinking, for example, of incriminees, who are an important category of person. If someone who might be an incriminee had made an admission that would have been written down and that would be important.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-25_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Macaulay of Bragar: </B>   My Lords, does not the debate that has taken place between the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate and the noble and learned Lord, Lord McCluskey, demonstrate that this piece of legislation should be taken away and considered? It is ridiculous that at this time of night we are discussing the matter in haste because we are under pressure to deal with another Scottish Bill. I make no criticism of those involved; we thought that we could deal with both pieces of legislation and that we could debate this Bill in the so-called dinner hour. However, it is now farcical that we are discussing matters of such great importance to the law of Scotland in such circumstances in your Lordships' House.
<P>

<a name="50705-25_para3"></a>I urge the Government&#151;and they will not be criticised from this side of the House&#151;to take the proposed legislation away and to allow us to look at it properly. We can then obtain representations from the judges and all those concerned. These pieces of evidence are crucial to the administration of justice in Scotland. Attending your Lordships' House is not my only duty&#151;I have other things to do&#151;and I have had no time to do justice to the amendments. I am sure that other members of the judiciary have not even seen them. It is ridiculous that the law of Scotland should be dealt with in this cavalier manner and I lodge a firm protest about what is happening.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-25_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McCluskey: </B>   My Lords, I hope that this is the last time that I shall rise to my feet. I listened to what the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate said. If he was talking about the case of a possible incriminee, I withdraw what I said. I shall read carefully what the noble and learned Lord said because perhaps I misunderstood the way in which he put it. Perhaps, like myself, he is in the interests of haste abandoning his notes and thus putting the argument more briefly than he otherwise would. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<br>
(2) If on such an application the sheriff is satisfied that the conditions in subsection (4) below are fulfilled, he may make an order that the person who appears to him to be in possession of the material to which the application relates shall&#151;
<br>
(a) produce it to a constable for him to take away; or

(b) give a constable access to it,

within such period as the order may specify.
<br>
This subsection is subject to section (Disclosure of information held by government departments) (11) of this Act.

<br>
(a) that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that a specified person has benefited from the commission of an offence to which this Chapter applies;

(i) is likely to be of substantial value (whether by itself or together with other material) to the investigation for the purpose of which the application is made; and
<br>
(ii) does not consist of or include items subject to legal privilege; and

(c) that there are reasonable grounds for believing that it is in the public interest, having regard&#151;
<br>
(i) to the benefit likely to accrue to the investigation if the material is obtained; and
<br>
(ii) to the circumstances under which the person in possession of the material holds it,
<br>
that the material should be produced or that access to it should be given.

(5) Where the sheriff makes an order under subsection (2) (b) above in relation to material on any premises he may, on the application of the procurator fiscal, order any person who appears to him to be entitled to grant entry to the premises to allow a constable to enter the premises to obtain access to the material.

(a) shall not confer any right to production of, or access to, items subject to legal privilege;

This amendment is linked also with Amendment No. 83C and seeks to substitute the word "relevance" for the words "substantial value". I do not believe that the amendment is very happily phrased. The message which the amendment seeks to spell out is that to allow a search of any place under a warrant and to take anything which is of "substantial value" in a criminal investigation is far too wide. What is taken should be of relevance and substantial value. Perhaps the Government will look again at that. Otherwise a police officer searching for, for example, drugs may enter a property with a warrant and clean out a house and take everything, subject to hire purchase and so on. It may be better if we insert the word "relevance" to indicate that a police officer cannot just take everything from the house. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-27_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   My Lords, the new clauses as introduced by Commons Amendments Nos. 81 to 83 closely follow the disclosure provisions in the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1987 and the powers applicable to England and Wales contained in the Criminal Justice Act 1988 Act and the Drug Trafficking Act 1994.
<P>

<a name="50705-27_para2"></a>These new clauses introduce very strict measures for the seizure and disclosure of material to the court as part of an investigation into whether somebody has benefited from an offence. Those measures are tempered by the requirement that for material to be seized or disclosed under the new provisions, it must be of substantial value to the investigation.
<P>

<a name="50705-27_para3"></a>A requirement for the material to be only of relevance, as proposed by the amendments, would substantially widen the seizure and disclosure powers beyond the existing provisions in both Scotland and England. I am satisfied that those powers are sufficient for the investigation into the proceeds of general crime and I see no reason why they should be wider than the existing powers in the drug trafficking legislation or the equivalent powers in England and Wales. I hope with that explanation, the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-27_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Macaulay of Bragar: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for that explanation. On this side of your Lordships' House, we have no desire to impede the investigation into drug trafficking offences and the profits coming from that. I tabled the amendment in order to prevent a policeman from entering a house and taking everything from it, whether or not it is of relevance. However, I shall read with interest what the Minister said and beg leave to withdraw Amendment No. 82A.

(4) An order under subsection (1) above shall not require the production of any material unless it appears to the Court of Session that the material is likely to contain information that would facilitate the exercise of the powers conferred on the Court by section 91(1) (a) of or paragraph 1 or 12 of Schedule 3 to this Act or on an administrator appointed under paragraph 1(1) of that Schedule.
<br>
(5) The Court may by order authorise the disclosure to such an administrator of any material produced under subsection (1) above or any part of such material; but the Court shall not make an order under this subsection unless a reasonable opportunity has been given for an officer of the department to make representations to the Court.
<br>
(6) Material disclosed in pursuance of an order under subsection (5) above may, subject to any conditions contained in the order, be further disclosed for the purposes of the functions under Part II of this Act of the administrator or the High Court.

(10) Material may be produced or disclosed in pursuance of this section notwithstanding any obligation as to secrecy or other restriction upon the disclosure of information imposed by statute or otherwise.
<br>
(11) An order under subsection (1) above and, in the case of material in the possession of an authorised government department, an order under section (Order to make material available) (2) of this Act may require any officer of the department (whether named in the order or not) who may for the time being be in possession of the material concerned to comply with such order; and any such order shall be served as if the proceedings were civil proceedings against the department.
<br>
(12) Where any requirement is included in any order by virtue of subsection (11) above, the person on whom the order is served&#151;
<br>
(a) shall take all reasonable steps to bring it to the attention of the officer concerned; and

<P>
<A NAME="50705-28_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Macaulay of Bragar: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move Amendment No. 83A as an amendment to Commons Amendment No. 83. In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 83B. The reason for leaving out the words "an officer of" and linking the evidence to the department is that there is no control over the people who can give evidence. I should like to see the matter more restricted than it is at present. As it stands, it is rather vague. It refers to "an officer of the department". What is an officer of the department? Does that mean a civil servant, the office boy or a higher executive officer? By providing for the department to be able to make representations to the court, the department will then decide who should represent it at court; otherwise, anybody can walk into court and make representations. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-28_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   My Lords, the amendments to which the noble Lord has spoken would replace the reference to an officer of the department with a reference to the department. While I understand that he is concerned that an appropriate person should deal with these matters, I do not understand what practical difference the amendments make in legal or in practical terms.
<P>

<a name="50705-28_para0"></a>A government department can act only through its officers. Where representations are to be made on behalf of the department, they can be presented only through an officer or a solicitor instructed by the department.
<P>

<a name="50705-28_para1"></a>The anxiety which may have prompted the amendment is that there may be doubt as to whether the current reference in the provisions to an officer of the department means that the department cannot be represented in court by an advocate or solicitor. There is no doubt that an officer making representations could be so represented by a lawyer. Therefore, I hope that the noble Lord will agree that his anxieties, which I understand, are misplaced.

<a name="50705-29_para5"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, the amendment hopes to extend child protection orders to include children who seem to be engaging in self harm. At present a child protection order is available for a child being harmed or likely to be harmed by someone else. However, I am concerned that there is no protective provision for a child who is harming himself or who is likely to do so. For example, he might be acting suicidally, glue sniffing to excess, taking drugs or persistently playing "chicken" on roads or railway lines. I hope that the Minister can assure me that such a child situation has been considered. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-29_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, I recognise the intention behind the noble Earl's amendment and sympathise with it. However, I would suggest to the noble Earl that it is not necessary. The ground set out in Clause 56(1) (a) (ii) provides for a child protection order to be granted where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the child will suffer significant harm if he is not removed to and kept in a place of safety. The harm in such circumstances need not be inflicted by another party; it may be self-harm. With that assurance, I hope the noble Earl will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>the District Courts (Scotland) Act 1975 or in which such a court has ceased to exist.

(10) In relation to an area to which this subsection applies the Secretary of State may, if he is satisfied that&#151;

(a) there is no sheriff habitually resident in that area, or there is a likelihood that the sheriff who is so resident will be frequently absent from the area; and

(i) an authorisation under subsection (1) and (2) may be granted only by an honorary sheriff serving in that area;

(ii) an authorisation shall lapse under subsection (4) (b) (i) when seventy-two hours have expired since it was given; and

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50705-30_para8"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, the tabling of the above amendment stems from concern about the operation of applications for child protection orders in remote areas. The amendment was given some consideration in another place but was not conclusively discussed. The circumstance with which the amendment deals is the fact that there is no district court in the island councils' areas. Justices of the peace in the area have no experience of sitting on the Bench.
<P>

<a name="50705-30_para9"></a>It would seem to be better if an honorary sheriff received training to deal with child protection order applications. That would be operable in the event of a sheriff not being available. By way of example, perhaps I should point out that the sheriff for Orkney and Shetland lives in Shetland, but bad flying conditions could easily prevent him reaching the islands in a reasonably short time. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-30_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, the amendment would introduce special procedures to be followed in emergency protection cases where there is no district court in the area.

<P>

<a name="50705-30_para11"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, in moving the above amendment, I should like to speak also to Amendments Nos. 228, 229 and 242. Under the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968, where a child has been detained in accordance with Section 296(3) of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975, the reporter is obliged to bring the child's case before a children's hearing on the first lawful day. The amendments reintroduce a similar worthwhile provision in the Bill and, therefore, ensure that children who have been arrested do not remain longer than is necessary in a place of safety.
<P>

<a name="50705-30_para12"></a>I should also add that it may be appropriate to make further minor changes on Third Reading in relation to children who on being referred to a children's hearing&#151;whether or not after arrest&#151;are already subject to a supervision requirement. I beg to move.

However, the government amendments introduce a number of small but important improvements to the provisions which apply to children being kept in places of safety. Therefore, I believe that the government amendments essentially secure the same purposes as those which the noble Lord is seeking to achieve. In the circumstances, I hope that the noble Lord will not move his amendments. I beg to move.

They represent a useful addition to the legislation governing both adoption and supervision of children who have been before a children's hearing. Social work practitioners in the field of child care may see from time to time differences of opinion arise between the local authority and the children's hearing as to the arrangements which should be made for the future of the child. The local authority, for example, may be considering a permanent placement by pursuing the possibility of adoption while the hearing may consider that, with further assistance, the child could be reunited with his original family.
<P>

<a name="50705-32_para6"></a>Clearly it is desirable that all parties involved should have a clear and unambiguous understanding of what is best for the child.

However, it is conceivable that circumstances might change.

The aim is simply to ensure that the sheriff should have at his disposal an express statutory power to be satisfied that the order that he makes will be appropriate for the protection of the child. If he should be in any doubt about an exclusion order providing that protection he will have that power to make a child protection order and the child could be suitably removed to a place of safety.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50705-33_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment concerns the extension of exclusion orders beyond the six-month limit within the Bill in Clause 76(1).
<P>

<a name="50705-33_para11"></a>I am not sure whether the amendment is necessary, but it has been put down for clarification. In Clause 76(3) a power is given to the sheriff to vary or recall an exclusion order. I am not sure whether that power allows him to extend the exclusion order.
<P>

<a name="50705-33_para12"></a>Having created a bit of a fuss about exclusion orders in the early stages of the Bill, I would be the last person to suggest that anybody should be excluded from his or her own home unnecessarily. However, the problem is that if the authorities do not get on with a prosecution, if there is to be a prosecution, then in the interests of the child and perhaps the community it may be necessary to keep the person concerned away from that particular area.
<P>

<a name="50705-33_para13"></a>The effect of the amendment is to some extent to erode civil liberties, but in the field we are dealing with, namely child abuse, it is important that there should be some continuity in dealing with the offender and the allegedly abused child. As indicated in the Committee stage of the Bill, the Government have, to their credit, gone a long way to balance the interests of the allegedly abused child and the alleged abuser. I would not like it to be thought that from this side of your Lordships' House we are suggesting that people should be excluded from their homes unnecessarily. That is why the determining words in the amendment are "on cause shown". One would hope that we can rely on sheriffs to make sure that it will not be as a result of incompetence on the part of the authorities but on the basis of real cause shown to the sheriff that extension of the exclusion order is allowed.
<P>

<a name="50705-33_para14"></a>I move the amendment with some reluctance. The Minister said during the Committee stage that if the authorities cannot deal with these matters within six months then, unless the person is in custody, there is something wrong with the process of justice. This is an enabling amendment to take account of extraordinary circumstances. As I said, the determining phrase is "on cause shown". I hope that the courts will interpret that as real cause to show that the exclusion order should be continued for a period, with an upper time limit of six months. I beg to move.

We wish to ensure that children who might be subject to abuse are protected for as long as is necessary. As he remarked, I indicated during the Committee stage that I have my concerns about introducing open-ended exclusion orders. It would be quite inappropriate for public intervention of this type to continue without any focus. Indeed, such intervention might ultimately exacerbate the problems being faced by a family.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50705-33_para15"></a>Our exclusion provisions are accordingly focused on assisting the non-abusing parent to make the first positive step in stopping that abuse. The exclusion order provision therefore allows public intervention from a very early stage and for a period of some six months thereafter.
<P>

<a name="50705-33_para16"></a>I believe that a period of six months should give adequate time for the non-abusing parent to receive the necessary counselling and support to resolve the situation by her own hand.
<P>

<a name="50705-33_para17"></a>Where the "named person", as he or she is described, continues to be a threat, the remaining parent or partner could apply for an order under the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981 where the named person was the spouse or cohabitant. I realise that it is a difficult area. However, on balance I believe that the six month period is both reasonable and adequate. I hope that the noble Lord will be satisfied.

<A NAME="50705-33_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Macaulay of Bragar: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation.

<a name="50705-34_para14"></a>I do not know how to describe that provision; it may be rhetoric. However, the amendment sends a warning to people dealing with adoptions to get on with them. I am advised by some people involved in the adoption business (if I may so phrase it) that even unopposed adoptions have taken four months to be ratified in the courts. There is no excuse or justification for that length of time to be taken in what is an extremely sensitive area. It is sensitive for the adoptive parents; it is sensitive for the child if the child is old enough to understand what is going on.

The term "unreasonable delay" is extremely elastic. It could mean almost anything. However, I well recall that a close friend of mine who was concerned with adoptions found that it was often wise to monitor what was happening for quite a time before the adoption was confirmed. What on the face of it may look an extremely suitable adoption, in fact not infrequently turns out not to be so. It is only when the child has been in the home, sometimes for quite a long time, that it is safe to conclude that that adoption is suitable.
<P>

<a name="50705-34_para17"></a>"Unreasonable delay" is, I agree, such a vague term that it could be interpreted in any way. But I should be extremely unhappy if adoptions were hurried in any way. On certain occasions it is extremely important that there should be time to see what is happening.

<A NAME="50705-34_spnew7"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, I have considerable sympathy with the aims underlying the noble Lord's amendment, as indeed I do with the comments made by the noble Baroness.
<P>

<a name="50705-34_para18"></a>What I can say to the noble Lord&#151;it is not for the first time&#151;is that the amendment is unnecessary. The matter has been raised before. I remain of the view that the Bill adequately protects the interests of children for whom adoption might be under consideration.
<P>

<a name="50705-34_para19"></a>Clause 92 inserts a new Section 6 into the Adoption (Scotland) Act 1978. The new section already makes quite clear that, in reaching any decision relating to the adoption of a child, the court or adoption agency must <P>


<a name="column_1217"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1217</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>regard the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of the child throughout his lifetime as the paramount consideration.
<P>

<a name="50705-34_para20"></a>There can be no denying that this is a serious requirement and it will require courts and adoption agencies to discharge their duties in an effective and efficient way. Clearly, any unreasonable delay would not be in the interests of the child and the court or the adoption agency would be failing to meet the standards set down.
<P>

<a name="50705-34_para21"></a>I am sure that this is the kind of matter which would be better addressed in terms of specific guidance or court rules, if necessary, but it is not something which is required on the face of the Bill. With the assurance that we shall bring forward guidance, if it should prove to be necessary, I hope that the noble Lord will agree to withdraw his amendment.

<A NAME="50705-34_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Macaulay of Bragar: </B>   My Lords, I was interested in the contribution of the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, who described herself as "a miserable Sassenach". I have called Sassenachs a few things but I have never called them miserable. I remember that an Englishman bought me a drink one night! Seriously, the noble Baroness raised an important point that the amendment should not be seen to be a hammer to rush the adoption procedure. I would not like it to be seen to have that objective and that is why I said at the beginning that we all know that it is a sensitive area of human relationships. I quite agree with what the noble Baroness said.
<P>

<a name="50705-34_para22"></a>I listened with interest to what the Minister said. As always, I accept his assurances and look forward to seeing the rules in due course. On that basis, and with my thanks to the Minister for his clear explanation of how the Government approach the legislation, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<br>
("( ) A child or parent of a child may request a local authority to hold an inquiry into their functions in relation to that child, in terms of subsection (1) above, and if the local authority refuse to hold such an inquiry, they shall give written reasons for such a refusal.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50705-35_para0"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, the amendment would give parents and children the specific right to ask for an inquiry into their case. I wish to ascertain from the noble Earl what the Government propose to put into guidance about that. In particular, I wonder whether such inquiries will be easy to request. Will the local authorities be required to justify a refusal? Who will pay for the inquiry? Alternatively, will it automatically have to be paid for by the person requesting it? An inquiry may be helpful, but it seems strange to limit it to those who can afford to pay for it. I hope that I have misunderstood the provisions of the Bill in that respect. I beg to move.

<A NAME="50705-35_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour: </B>   My Lords, before my noble friend replies I wish to make a short appeal. I have often been interested in hearing the replies given by my noble friends on the Front Bench to the noble Lord, Lord <P>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1218</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Macaulay, that something will be put into the guidelines, regulations or whatever comes after the Bill is enacted. I make the appeal that there should not be too great a delay after the Bill comes into force before the regulations appear.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-35_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, first I can reassure the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, on some of the points he raised. There may be some details which I cannot cover tonight, but I shall be able to write to him about them.
<P>

<a name="50705-35_para1"></a>Local authorities should always, in the spirit of the Citizen's Charter, clearly explain their decisions when called upon to do so. This is an important part of their accountability. In addition, all authorities now have in place formal complaints machinery. In cases of maladministration, individuals can have recourse to the local authorities ombudsman. I do not think, therefore, that we need in the Bill a prescription on the local authority to intimate a negative decision in a particular way, which would be one of the consequences of the amendment as drafted.
<P>

<a name="50705-35_para2"></a>I can also reassure my noble friend Lord Balfour that it is our intention to minimise any delay or time-lag between the Bill coming into force and regulations which are required for it. With those assurances to both noble Earls, I hope that the amendment can be withdrawn.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50705-35_para16"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment is grouped with Amendment No. 176 and it refers to the deletion of Section 53(1) of the Children Act 1975. I am advised that the amendment might be acceptable to the Government. It is technical and is a tidying-up process which follows on Amendment No. 168. Perhaps the matter could be considered to see whether the amendment is technically correct. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-35_spnew9"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, Amendments Nos. 175 and 176 seek to delete references to Section 53(1) of the Children Act 1975 from Sections 14 and 15 of the Adoption (Scotland) Act 1978. I agree that for practical purposes the Section 53 provisions, which allow a court to consider custody rather than adoption, are in effect spent because of the improvements brought about through the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50705-35_para17"></a>Clause 93 of the Bill makes clear that an adoption agency should consider alternatives to adoption and should not proceed with adoption if a better option is available. Similarly, paragraph 15 of Schedule 2 amends Section 24 of the Adoption (Scotland) Act to the effect that a court must not make an adoption order unless it considers that this would be better for the child than if it did not make the order. Clause 11 of the Bill provides scope for various orders and arrangements.
<P>

<a name="50705-35_para18"></a>I am sure that the provisions in the Bill and in the Adoption (Scotland) Act 1978, as amended by the Bill, cover all the necessary ground as regards alternative orders. It may be, therefore, that Section 53 of the 1975 Act could be repealed. The noble Lord's amendments, however, only delete other references to it.

<a name="50705-36_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, on the face of it, this is a fairly minor amendment in connection with the regulations that the Secretary of State can make in relation to adoptions. I believe that there was a mistake either in the formulation of the amendment or in the printing of it; it does not make sense as it stands. The words are, "drawing up, in". The wording already contains "in". I believe that it should refer to "drawing up, and" making alterations to, or revoking or replacing an adoption allowances scheme. The general theme is that there is a difference in making alterations to a scheme and drawing them up.

Section 32 provided the meaning of a protected child and the section is to be repealed by the Bill, along with other provisions relating to protected children. Similarly, the reference to Section 35(1), which also comes within the group of provisions to be repealed, also requires to be deleted.
<P>

<a name="50705-36_para9"></a>The amendment to subsection (3) is a self-explanatory update of a reference to the making of the supervision requirement which would previously have been made under the 1968 Act and will in future be made under Clause 67 of the Bill.

<a name="50705-38_para5"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 226, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 227 and 235.
<P>

<a name="50705-38_para6"></a>The procedure for the court to take the views of the child concerned in the proceedings under Part I of this Bill has been discussed at a previous stage of the Bill. In another place amendments were proposed to set out such a mechanism on the face of the Bill. We thought it better that it should be left to the rules of court which would be more flexible and be able to take into account the many different types of case that may arise.
<P>

<a name="50705-38_para7"></a>We have looked at the Bill carefully to ensure that the courts have all the necessary powers. Again, I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, for his helpful suggestion which will allow the courts to avoid significant practical difficulties. It would be very clumsy if, after the court had appointed a person&#151;for example, a curator ad litem&#151;to obtain the views of the child, the person could not report direct to the court but had to be represented by a solicitor or advocate. The amendment makes clear that any person appointed to convey the views of the child to <P>


<a name="column_1231"></a>

<B>5 Jul 1995 : Column 1231</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the court can do so in person, even if he is not an advocate or solicitor. It is an amendment against interest. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-38_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Macaulay of Bragar: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may make a passing comment on Amendments Nos. 226 and 235. When we were discussing the question of the people now known as solicitor advocates, there were rules set out regarding the training and the code of conduct which they had to undergo before they were allowed to represent anyone in the court.
<P>

<a name="50705-38_para8"></a>As the amendment stands, it means that anyone&#151;and I mean anyone&#151;can come in and purport to represent the views of the child. It seems to me, in the way it is drafted, that a granny, an uncle or anybody, could come in and express the views of the child. When we are dealing in this area, it is important that the views of the child are given to the court on some sort of structured basis. I wonder whether Amendments Nos. 226 and 235 are perhaps rather widely framed and whether there should be some inbuilt protection for the child as to who can represent the child.
<P>

<a name="50705-38_para9"></a>I know that this is a difficult area but it seems to be a bit too wide in that anyone can come in and purport to represent the views of the child. I should like to hear what the Minister says in that regard.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705-38_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   My Lords, if what the noble Lord understood was what the clause in fact does, I would readily recognise his anxieties. We are looking at a circumstance where the court will have appointed someone to determine the views of the child. In those circumstances, as the noble Lord can probably recall from his own experience in court, it would be desirable for that person to tell the court directly what those views are rather than having to convey them to the court through the medium of a solicitor or advocate.
<P>

<a name="50705-38_para10"></a>That is all that the amendment seeks to achieve. It was a point that the Lord President of the Court of Session indicated would be a change of practical value. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Macaulay, is reassured that the amendment is not as wide as he thought.

<P>

<P>
<UL>What meaning they attach to the paragraph in the Clinton-Yeltsin statement on the ABM Treaty (10th May 1995): "The scale of deployment&#151;in number and geographic scope&#151;of theatre missile defence systems by either side will be consistent with theatre ballistic missile programmes confronting that side", in relation to the "counter-proliferation" studies and discussions being held both within NATO and bilaterally by Her Majesty's Government and the United States Administration.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705w01_wqn1"></A><B> Lord Kennet </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What are the implications for non-parties to the ABM Treaty of the joint statement of the Presidents of the United States and of the Russian Federation concerning the interpretation of that treaty, and in particular what are the implications for deployment funded, or largely funded, by one of the parties to the treaty in other areas, such as the Israeli Arrow system.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705w01_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   We believe that the ABM Treaty remains an important element of strategic arms control but do not consider that it has any specific implications for the deployment of missile defence systems by non-parties. However, it is not for Her Majesty's Government to interpret the Joint Statement by the Presidents of the United States and the Russian Federation.

<P>
<UL>What proportion of world conventional arms transfers are conducted by firms from the countries (and allowed by the governments), represented at the G7 meeting; and, in the light of the description of the transfers as "excessive" in the G7 communiqu&#233;, what steps the G7 governments are now proposing to take to reduce conventional arms transfers promoted by their own arms industries.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705w01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   We estimate that the countries at the G7 meeting (with Russia) account for about 90 per cent. of world conventional arms transfers. The chairman's statement noted that "the excessive transfer of conventional arms, in particular to areas of conflict, is one of our main preoccupations". The UK, like other countries at the meeting, is committed to responsibility in conventional arms transfers.

We had no doubt that the current situation on the A.34 was intolerable and that there was strong economic justification for a by-pass. But we wanted to be sure of the environmental balance between the principal route alternatives and to confirm that the route proposed was the best solution to the problems of congestion in Newbury.

<a name="50705w01_para0"></a>Congestion has got much worse since the public inquiry in 1988. Then there were about 40,000 vehicles a day on the A.34 through Newbury. Recent counts show an increase of 25 per cent. in the overall traffic levels. Forecasts suggest that traffic flows will reach between 65,000 and 78,000 vehicles per day by the year 2010. The inquiry heard evidence of peak hour delays of up to 30 minutes. Longer delays are not unusual now.
<P>

<a name="50705w01_para1"></a>A team of Highways Agency staff not previously associated with the scheme undertook this further consideration and has reported to me. We have placed a copy of its report in the Library.
<P>

<a name="50705w01_para2"></a>As the report makes clear, the team examined both the background to the scheme and the changes in appraisal techniques, local circumstances and traffic and economic data that have occurred since the inquiry and the subsequent decisions of the Secretaries of State.
<P>

<a name="50705w01_para3"></a>Amongst these matters, the team gave attention to:

<FONT SIZE=3>given and representations we have received since this study was inaugurated.
<P>

<a name="50705w01_para12"></a>We agree with the team's assessments, and with its overall conclusion that the western by-pass, for which statutory orders have been made and confirmed, is the most effective solution for Newbury. We now intend to move ahead speedily with the proposed scheme to bring much needed relief to the town and its residents. On the basis of the team's report and the work leading up to the earlier decision, we can see no justification for further investigation or delay.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705w02_spmin2"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department of the Environment   (Viscount Ullswater): </B>  The Government's policy is that local authorities which are granted unitary powers should be capable of undertaking the full range of functions entrusted to them. Our guidance to the Local Government Commission reflects this aim and we have carried it through in our decisions.
<P>

<a name="50705w02_para0"></a>Under Section 14(5)(c) of the Local Government Act 1992, the Local Government Commission may recommend that joint arrangements are made in relation to local authority functions in an area affected by structural change. It has recommended joint arrangements for structure planning in a number of areas. We have endorsed those recommendations and look to the authorities concerned to make voluntary arrangements accordingly.
<P>

<a name="50705w02_para1"></a>Section 21 of the Local Government Act 1992 contains backup powers for the Secretary of State to establish a statutory joint authority where voluntary arrangements have not been made, or have broken down. Previous ministerial statements about joint working have suggested that the power granted by this section may be exercised in any case where, having regard to the recommendations of the Commission, the Secretary of State had requested authorities affected by a structural change order to carry out a function jointly and those arrangements had failed or had failed to materialise.

We continue to support the recommendations of the commission in respect of joint working on structure plans by unitary authorities and existing county councils. We look forward to the authorities concerned making suitable voluntary arrangements for the maintenance of an up-to-date strategic planning framework for each of the joint structure plan areas indicated. Following reorganisation, the Secretary of State's powers of intervention in the structure plan process under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 remain unchanged. He will consider the availability and use of those powers in the usual way in order to achieve effective strategic planning.

<P>

<a name="50705w02_para8"></a>There was a short discussion of the proposal for a directive on Ambient Air Quality Assessment and Management and a common position was agreed unanimously. My right honourable friend joined colleagues from all member states in welcoming the proposed directive, which will help to tackle the problems of air pollution across Europe and is in line with existing UK practice.
<P>

<a name="50705w02_para9"></a>A common position was also achieved by unanimity on the proposal for the Control of Major Accident Hazards Involving Dangerous Substances (amended Seveso Directive). The proposal closely reflects UK philosophy and practice.
<P>

<a name="50705w02_para10"></a>The Council reached a common position unanimously on a new regulation to replace the existing CITES measures. We welcome the regulation, which will require all member states to control trade in endangered species more effectively. The Council also agreed to a UK proposal to retain the existing 1981 regulation banning commercial imports of whale products.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705w03_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food   (Earl Howe): </B>  At this meeting the Council agreed a comprehensive framework of law covering the welfare of farm animals transported throughout the European Union. Rules have been set for the first time on the length of time for which animals can be transported and when journeys must be broken for food, water and rest. There will be maximum limits on travel time for all journeys and a clear definition of a journey's end. Animals will have to be held in one place for at least 24 hours to recover before they can be moved again.
<P>

<a name="50705w03_para0"></a>If animals are to be transported for more than eight hours, vehicles will have to provide specified equipment such as proper ventilation and temperature control.

<FONT SIZE=3>specific rules on the space allowance that animals must be given in the different types of transport.
<P>

<a name="50705w03_para1"></a>The agreement also provides for a proper framework of rules and Union-wide powers to enforce the rules. Hauliers will be licensed and, if they fail to observe the rules, licences will be removed. In addition, those engaged in the trade will have to be properly trained. Journey plans will be needed for all substantial journeys across borders. The European Commission will have the role of ensuring that member states are applying the rules correctly and its veterinary inspectorate will be strengthened so that it can do so. The Council agreed to review the arrangements in three years' time.

<a name="50705w03_para2"></a>The Council also agreed to change the expensive and inflationary agri-monetary system which the United Kingdom voted against last December. Whilst the final proposal was an improvement in budgetary terms, the United Kingdom again voted against. The new arrangements will lead to a distortion of the support system by paying farmers in some countries more than is justified by the market rate for the national currency concerned. The Government believe that any such arrangement should be subject to a specific time-limit; a proposal to link it to the date of the introduction of a single currency was not acceptable.
<P>

<a name="50705w03_para3"></a>The Council reached agreement on support prices and related measures for farm products for 1995&#150;96. The Council decided to maintain almost all prices and aid rates unchanged, rejecting the Commission's initial proposals for modest cuts. There will be some small reductions in seasonal price increments for cereals and sugar storage payments. My right honourable friend the Minister made it clear that he regarded this as a wasted opportunity; and that there could be no question of increasing the existing ceiling on agricultural expenditure.
<P>

<a name="50705w03_para4"></a>Agreement was reached on a number of other items as part of an overall package. These included changes to the support system for cotton aimed at stopping the sharp increases in expenditure seen in recent years; the definitive allocation to Italy and Greece of the increases in milk quotas previously allocated on a temporary basis; and rules allowing the continued operation of the "knacker" industry in the United Kingdom and Ireland.
<P>

<a name="50705w03_para5"></a>In addition to the United Kingdom's vote against the changes to the agri-money rules, negative votes were recorded by Sweden against the complete package; by Austria, Denmark and, from the opposite standpoint, Italy against the animal transport decision; and by Netherlands, Denmark and Luxembourg against the definitive allocation of milk quotas.
<P>

<a name="50705w03_para6"></a>In addition, the Commission undertook to make a proposal before 31 July on the rate of set-aside for arable crops sown for harvest next year. This will be an improvement on last year's timetable, when the proposal came too late. At the insistence of my right honourable friend, the Commission promised to take full account of the interests of users of cereals, particularly pig and poultry producers, who are having to pay too much for their supplies.

<a name="50705w03_para7"></a>The Council at last adopted a measure allowing arable land taken out of production for forestry or environmental purposes to count against the set-aside obligation of the farmer concerned. This is something for which the Government have long been pressing, with the full support of environmental and farming organisations. It should boost farmers' participation in forestry and environmental schemes.

<a name="50705w03_para8"></a>Finally, the Council agreed that France could pay certain limited national aids to its wine producers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50705w03_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   The Government will continue to press their view at every suitable opportunity that the main response to the faults of the CAP must consist of progressive reductions in product linked support and protection. This would lead to the eventual removal of artificial restrictions on production and the creation of a competitive and market-driven farming industry. Any remaining support should be targeted towards environmental and other specific objectives.
