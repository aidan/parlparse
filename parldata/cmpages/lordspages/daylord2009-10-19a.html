I am confident that our policies will maintain energy security in the short and longer term.</p>

Will the Minister recognise that many people would endorse the report&#146;s recommendation that energy security be treated with the same focus as other national security issues? Will he also recognise that the many concerns raised by Mr Wicks&#146;s report must be treated with real seriousness&#151;I am not sure that that has always been the case? Is it not ironic that, after some seven years of the Government apparently believing that a new programme of nuclear power stations would not be needed, a view they held until the middle of the decade, Mr Wicks, a former Energy Minister, is now recommending a doubling of the existing programme of nuclear power stations?</p>

It is worth remarking that Mr Wicks said that there is no energy crisis and that the Government are doing many of the things that are important, but energy security should of course be a prime responsibility of government. It was this Government who decided

While we will look at what he said about the scale of nuclear energy in the future, what is not in doubt is our belief that nuclear has a very important role to play.</p>

We cannot rely on the free market to solve this problem for us, particularly given the way the free market is being used for political purposes. Therefore, is it not becoming a matter of urgency, which I am quite sure that the Government agree with, that we start to build some nuclear power stations, as well as some clean coal power stations, right away&#151;and right away means right away?</p>

However, I can reassure my noble friend that we have about 10.8 gigawatts of electricity-generating stations under construction; another 10.8 gigawatts has received all planning consents. We would expect the first nuclear power station to be up and running by the end of 2018. We are in the process of conducting a competition and taking forward proposals in relation to the funding of up to four scaled-up, CCS clean coal projects.</p>

What is the Government&#146;s attitude to the potential acquisition of British companies, or European energy companies supplying into Britain, by major Russian corporations?</p>

With regard to security, this Government have been very strong in Europe about the need for a diversification of our energy supply, so we are not reliant on any one country. Alongside that, we have pushed for, and been successful in, the further liberalisation of the European market, which again will aid that diversification. That is the best way to deal with those issues.</p>

What are the Government doing, both at national and European level, to increase gas storage? Have they given active thought to the possibility that at the European level there should be an obligation on all member states to have a minimum amount of gas storage available?</p>

These matters have to be considered in that context. As for the UK, the North Sea remains a strategic storage reserve. My understanding is that there are 19 projects in some part of the pipeline for commercial development

The Minister recently stated that by 2012, we would have only five hours more gas added to that figure, which is considered inadequate for a long, cold winter and insecure world. What new steps, other than the ones that he has outlined, which I do not think are adequate, are the Government taking to improve on the Mr Wicks&#146;s report?</p>

I have said that we will respond to Mr Malcolm Wicks&#146;s report, which of course we will. The noble Lord is ignoring the fact that in the North Sea we already have our strategic reserve of gas. He is ignoring the projects in the pipeline&#151;</p>

We can look ahead for many years to the North Sea as one of the most important suppliers of our gas reserves. The noble Lord also clearly and blatantly ignores the fact that import facilities have increased enormously in the past year or two. You have to take all those components together&#151;and my judgment is that we have the right policies for today and for the future.</p>

Would he further agree, therefore, that it is incumbent on government to meet the growing demand from those in housing need by investing further in housebuilding, construction training and new models of social ownership?</p>

We have, as I have explained, taken action in the short term through the housing pledge&#151;in particular, the kick-start programme to unlock stalled sites&#151;but we recognise that, in the long term, there will be a continuing need for housing. We need to ensure sufficient land for development, a strong housebuilding sector and an increased long-term supply of affordable housing. Above all, we need strong and active government action.</p>

He will be aware of the challenge by a number of councils of all political persuasions against the shift out of the decent homes value-for-money budget. Does this not mean that council tenants will be subsidising the programme to a fairly considerable degree? Frankly, that is a rather odd component.</p>

Let me remind noble Lords that, in 1997, we inherited a massive &#163;19 billion backlog on social housing repairs, with more than 2 million homes failing basic decency standards and too many of society&#146;s most vulnerable on the streets or in bed-and-breakfast accommodation. We have made massive improvements since then, radically transforming people&#146;s homes through 700,000 new kitchens, 525,000 new bathrooms and the rewiring of 740,000 council homes. This has been a success for the decent homes policy, which did not exist before.</p>

Those are the homes with gardens that we are not building any more, but which could be released if only we had a good enough offer for older people, who need something more manageable and less expensive to heat and maintain. That would thereby release the homes that young families so badly need.</p>

Over many areas of policy, faith communities can reach people that Governments sometimes cannot, so those partnerships are valued. As for funding for affordable rural housing, the right reverend Prelate may be aware that our target was flexed, as we are now getting less output for our grant because of the falling away of Section 106 moneys. Subject to that, we need to continue to work together to ensure that we can deliver affordable rural housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="0910199000038"></a>We will be conducting the consultation next year. The principles being followed will base it on certification data for noise and oxides of nitrogen emissions, and we will consult widely in the industry as that consultation is conducted. The industry has responded to previous measures with very significant improvements in respect of oxides of nitrogen, fuel efficiency and noise pollution. Aircraft today are 70 per cent more fuel-efficient than the first commercial jets. Since standards for oxides of nitrogen were adopted in 1981, permitted emissions have reduced by 37 per cent and new aircraft have become significantly quieter over the past 20 years. The Airbus 380, for example, is 3 decibels quieter on take-off than the older Boeing 747s. That equates to a 60 per cent smaller footprint, despite the aircraft being much heavier. We are making significant investments to ensure that the next generation of aircraft improves still further on those standards. For example, we are assisting with &#163;340 million of investment to Airbus for the development of the Airbus A350 XWB, &#163;60 million to GKN for composite wing components, and &#163;114 million to Bombardier Aerospace for the development of composite wings for the Bombardier CSeries programme. With these measures in place, we expect significant future improvements in the efficiency of aircraft.</p>

Does the Minister agree that it would be the height of economic and environmental madness to build a major new airport in the Thames estuary, or anywhere else in the south-east, and keep Heathrow open? You either close Heathrow or you do not build a new airport. It makes so much logical sense to have just one hub airport, not two. It is environmentally important that you do not have two.</p>

At the moment, the Conservative Party has a different policy on aviation, depending on which tier of government you speak to. The Mayor of London appears to be in favour of a new four-runway airport in the estuary; that is in the largest Tory-controlled local authority in the country. The leader of Kent County Council, which is the next largest, is in favour of turning Manston on the north Kent coast into an international airport. The official spokesperson on transport for the Conservative Party refuses to engage in a debate on these issues, for reasons that may strike noble Lords as obvious given her problems with those controlling Conservative local authorities. However, she has said:</p>

The savings will be very real.</p>

In particular, it could continue his acknowledged support for the rail industry by opening and developing, where possible, lines that have closed and, perhaps more importantly, look at the continued work on the development of high-speed rail links to the Midlands and the north.</p>

It is important to understand that, even with the recession, monthly passenger traffic at Heathrow this September was only 0.3 per cent down on September 2008 and the airport is running at nearly 99 per cent capacity. The issue of further expansion at Heathrow will not go away; it needs to be kept under review. However, it is also important to look at the case for the high-speed line which would make Heathrow more accessible. The two are not either/or choices. Only 3 per cent of flights from Heathrow go to Manchester or Leeds, which are the two most popular destinations touted for a potential high-speed line, and in future all domestic and short-haul flights put together will account for only about 15 per cent of the traffic to and from Heathrow. The case for high-speed connections at Heathrow is very strong&#151;we are looking at it&#151;but that does not obviate the need to consider future capacity at Heathrow itself.</p>

<a name="91019-0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="0910199000050"></a>As the Prime Minister explained in his speech on 4 September, the advice of the security services is that the military action in Afghanistan, combined with sustained pressure on al-Qaeda in Pakistan, is suppressing terrorists&#146; ability to operate effectively from the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region.</p>

<p><a name="st_50"></a>
<a name="0910199000051"></a><b><a name="91019-0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="0910199000392"></a>Lord Lamont of Lerwick:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. Have the Government considered carefully the published opinions of Rory Stewart, the former British soldier who is an Afghan expert and who is now at Harvard? He has written not just that democratic government is impossible in Afghanistan but that any effective government is impossible there, and that al-Qaeda no longer needs large-scale bases in Afghanistan when it can train in Eritrea, Somalia, Yemen, at outward-bound courses in Derbyshire or indeed flying schools in Florida. Have they considered his opinion that what is needed is not more troops but fewer troops with a more carefully defined and limited objective?</p>

<p><a name="st_51"></a>

The Statement made by the Prime Minister last week set out that strategy. It is important that we counter the insurgents there, but it is also important that we build good governance in Afghanistan and help the Afghans to take control of their own affairs. It is true that there are threats and dangers from those who are training terrorists in other parts of the world, but I draw attention to what the security services have said: that three-quarters of all the plots that affect us in this country have their origins in that region. Therefore, it is right that we should make that a priority.</p>

Is not rule number one in an international intervention such as this is that the international community has a single, clear political strategy, attached to which is a small number of priorities which are then pursued in a unified fashion? Why, after seven years and tens of thousands of deaths and casualties, does no such thing exist, nor is it even close to existing? Is that not our real problem in Afghanistan?</p>

I do not think that anyone has ever suggested that the troops themselves can win the situation and bring stability to Afghanistan. Our overall objective has to be to make Afghanistan self-sustainable and to provide stability in that region so that it cannot be a safe haven. We have embraced the comprehensive approach&#151;the combination of civil and military effort&#151;and we have encouraged others to do so. At the end of the day, we need to see that progressing.</p>

Will the Government look again to see whether they can increase the amount of evidence that can safely and practically be brought forward to establish that that threat, which many of us accept, really exists?</p>

There is a problem in always explaining properly and fully the extent of the threat. I mention the Chief of the General Staff&#146;s comment today that we are there,</p>
<ul><a name="0910199000304"></a>&#147;to protect this country&#146;s security and our involvement is non-discretionary&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0910199000265"></a>It is difficult to put all the information into the public domain, and certainly to do so as early as we would often like, but it is important to try to do that. I repeat that the security services have been straightforward in making their views clear that 75 per cent of the threats to us here originate in that area.</p>

President Obama has said that he is not going to make up his mind on troop levels until the political situation in Afghanistan has been sorted out. Today, it has been announced that President Karzai did not get 50 per cent of the vote, so there is argument there about that. There is no cohesion in Afghanistan. The terrorist threat comes from Pakistan, not Afghanistan, but it looks as if there is no cohesive strategy, as the noble Lord just said. Those of us who support our presence there feel that it could be much better enunciated.</p>

I remind the House that this is the first time the Afghans have been in control of running such elections. I do not think that there has been shilly-shallying on our part. I think that the Prime Minister&#146;s Statement was clear last week. He laid out the three conditions on which we would be increasing our troop numbers, and that was a realistic assessment of the situation.</p>

<a name="91019-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="0910199000059"></a>As regards Pakistan, we have been very clear for a very long time that it is important in that region, and that threats come from the Afghanistan/Pakistan border region. It is impossible to think of it as a simple dividing line between the two countries. The document that the Government published last April related to policy in Afghanistan and Pakistan. That recognised well the links between the two.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="0910199000065"></a>Amendment 266 relates to Clause 138, if it were to remain in the Bill. If the Secretary of State had used the rather controversial power to make a determination, the amendment would require Ofqual to report that in its annual report, so that the Secretary of State&#146;s actions are open and accountable for all to see. Amendment 267 requires similar reporting in the annual report if the fee-capping power has been used. Amendment 268 requires information about consultation that Ofqual has undertaken during the previous year. Amendment 268A requires Ofqual to take into consideration significant reports on its performance. We would expect Ofqual to state how it was to improve, if that were necessary&#151;if there were some sort of criticism in the report. Amendment 269 asks the organisation to consult the public on its plans and publish and lay before Parliament an annual plan with its main objectives and priorities for the coming year.</p>

<a name="91019-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="0910199000066"></a>All that may seem very prescriptive, but given that we on these Benches want to remove Clause 138, and given that the Government are resisting that rather strongly, we feel that it is important to lay out in the amendments how Parliament expects Ofqual to behave in relation to transparency and accountability. That would give Parliament the opportunity to question what is happening if necessary; of course, it cannot do that unless it has the information. This group of amendments would give it that information. None of the things that we are asking for is something that Ofqual would not want to do anyway, but it is important that we lay such things out clearly when we are setting up this system for the examination regulator. I beg to move.</p>

We support the amendment and would like to see Ofqual fulfil its functions in a transparent and accountable manner. In order to restore public faith in the examination system, people must be able to see clearly the functions and actions of the body in charge of regulating examination standards. Furthermore, it is right that Ofqual should be held to account for any failure or perceived failure in its duties. Enhanced transparency will ensure that Ofqual is held to high standards, which should make sure that our examination system is, once again, a vigorous and robust structure that displays the hard work and dedication of the students to the best possible advantage. I hope that the Minister will give a favourable reply to these amendments.</p>

I was interested to hear what the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, had to say in introducing this debate. At times, it was difficult to hear her because when noble Lords leave the Chamber after Questions it can be very noisy. I support what the noble Baronesses, Lady Walmsley and Lady Verma, said about the importance of Ofqual being held to account and the key role that Parliament will play. Ofqual will want to fulfil the aspirations set out in the noble Baroness&#146;s amendments. We all accept the principle that Ofqual should be independent of Ministers and accountable to Parliament. The Bill delivers that. Its provisions are modelled on those for Ofsted. It is tempting for noble Lords on all sides of the House to think of things that seem important now and write into the legislation that Ofqual should report on them. I appreciate that that is not the kind of game that we are in, but I appreciate the thought that has gone into these amendments. We should resist that temptation to create a tick-box mentality that risks Ofqual having to report on the detail of A, B and C, even if, at a later date, the X, Y and Z are more important, although I think the noble Baroness is driving at a higher principle than that. We should instead trust that the accountability arrangements will truly hold Ofqual to account for those things that are really important at the time.</p>

<a name="91019-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="0910199000070"></a>Amendments 244 and 265, tabled by the noble Baronesses, Lady Walmsley and Lady Sharp, relate to success measures and my answer to them is similar. We agree that Ofqual should establish specific success measures and report against them. We would expect Parliament, probably through the Select Committees, to insist on nothing less. Indeed, the chair of interim Ofqual, Kathleen Tattersall, stated in a letter to the Public Bill Committee in another place that she intends that Ofqual will do that.</p>

The same might be said about Amendment 268A, which relates to reporting to Parliament about Ofqual&#146;s functions. On Amendment 267, any further guidance given by the Secretary of State on fee capping or on anything else will be published, allowing Parliament to look to Ofqual to give its view.</p>

<a name="91019-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="0910199000072"></a>Briefly, on consulting on the plans, Amendment 269 risks being a bit prescriptive and going into too much detail about how Ofqual should go about its business. It is Parliament&#146;s job to hold Ofqual to account on how effectively it plans but, again, I appreciate that Parliament will want to know how it goes about its business, and the communication between Ofqual and Parliament will be key. If the Bill puts into place lots of hoops for Ofqual to jump through, Ofqual will spend its time jumping through them and not necessarily planning, but I appreciate the importance of clear communication in planning.</p>

<a name="91019-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="0910199000073"></a>On the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, I caution that there is a difference between transparency and a white noise of information. There is a difficult balance to be struck, and it is important that public bodies get it absolutely right. If Ofqual spends its time publishing literally vast amounts of information, what is important may get lost in a deluge; so it may be possible to fulfil a publication requirement but not necessarily to communicate, and the effect might be to improve neither understanding nor confidence.</p>

<a name="91019-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="0910199000074"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Neill, argued this point rather eloquently in her Reith lectures a few years ago, in which I was very interested. She argued that transparency can create its own problems if it results in,</p>
<ul><a name="0910199000306"></a>&#147;a flood of unsorted information and misinformation that provides little but confusion&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0910199000269"></a>although I appreciate that noble Lords do not expect something like that to happen. A key founding principle of these reforms is transparent decision-making rather than transparent information. We must be careful not to confuse the two, as these amendments would.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="0910199000075"></a>In the light of what I have said, and bearing in mind the communication that we have already received from the interim Ofqual, I hope noble Lords will consider not pressing their amendments.</p>

In practice, what sort of qualifications will become victim of this clause and what sort will avoid it?</p>




<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_446"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column 446</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

Ofqual will be a risk-based regulator, which will intervene only where it judges it necessary to do so to achieve its objectives. If Ofqual is confident that a recognised awarding body can be trusted to develop qualifications without them being checked individually, it can regulate on that basis. Therefore, qualifications run by those awarding bodies would not need to be individually checked by Ofqual. It will then rely on its ongoing monitoring to ensure that standards are up to scratch, which is a major change, of which I believe that the noble Lord is aware, from the current regime under which every qualification must be checked individually. It will go from an individual qualification check to an organisational check, which is why we are saying that it will be more light touch.</p>

<a name="91019-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="0910199000081"></a>However, Ofqual still has the discretion to insist on accreditation for a qualification if it decides that that is necessary. If an accreditation requirement is imposed, it means that, for example, a new qualification has to be checked or accredited before it can be awarded. This is a crucial power for Ofqual to impose extra quality control when this is needed to protect standards. For example, Ofqual could require that all A-levels are subject to the accreditation requirement, given the detailed requirements that A-levels have to meet. It could also require that all IT qualifications from &#147;Fictional Award Body Limited&#148; are subject to the accreditation requirement&#151;perhaps because it had picked up concerns about the body&#146;s IT qualifications or just because it was a new market.</p>

<a name="91019-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="0910199000082"></a>This clause provides for Ofqual to decide when a qualification needs to be accredited. It also builds in consultation requirements, procedures that Ofqual must follow, before it can insist on accreditation. It is a necessary part of a necessary power. I hope that with that explanation, the noble Lord will be satisfied.</p>

First, how are guided learning hours to be policed? It is all very well to have this number sitting there, but as the noble Baroness will remember, one successful state school has been pioneering GCSEs in a term and successfully getting the qualification based on apparently a much reduced number of learning hours. Is the number of guided learning hours to be enforced or applied in schools, and if not, what is the point of them? Secondly, what is subsection (12) all about?</p>

I would expect schools, colleges and providers of courses of study leading to a qualification to ensure that the guided study hours are fulfilled. On the appropriate number of hours to be attached to a given qualification, I see the decision on that as very much part of the role of Ofqual. Indeed, I expect that to be a key contribution for it to make.</p>

<a name="91019-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="0910199000086"></a>Subsection (12) means that Ofqual does not need to apply guided learning hours to the award of credits simply because credits are combined to make full qualifications, and for these purposes it is full qualifications that we are interested in. I assume that the &#147;we&#148; refers to Ofqual. It may be helpful if I write to the noble Lord further on this if I have not given him the clarification he is looking for.</p>

The noble Lord asked particularly about subsection (8). It requires Ofqual to put in place review arrangements of any decision to withdraw recognition, which is obviously a key part of the regulator&#146;s role. More detail about those arrangements is set out in subsection (9).</p>

<a name="91019-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="0910199000090"></a>Like any regulator, Ofqual needs to have a range of sanctions and powers to allow it to step in and nip problems in the bud. We hope that Ofqual will not have to use these powers very often but it is crucial that they are there if needed. As I am sure noble Lords will agree, Ofqual must not be a toothless tiger.</p>

<a name="91019-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="0910199000091"></a>The Bill provides a number of sanctioning powers to enable Ofqual to act in a proportionate way to safeguard standards and protect the learner. The ultimate sanction must be available to Ofqual, even though it would hope never or rarely to use it: that power is to withdraw from a body recognition to award some or all qualifications so that those qualifications are no longer regulated.</p>

<a name="91019-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="0910199000092"></a>Clause 146 makes it explicit that Ofqual has the power to make such a sanction and, at the same time, ensures that it can be used only in limited circumstances and that there are effective checks on that power so that it can be used only when circumstances demand it. What are those limited circumstances? The power can be used only where the body has breached a condition of recognition and that breach is prejudicial. What are the safeguards? The clause sets out the steps that Ofqual must take before withdrawing recognition, including giving notice of its intention to do so, setting out the reasons for taking such action and taking account of any representations from the awarding body; that must be key. Ofqual must make arrangements for review of withdrawal decisions where requested to do so by the awarding body. My note does not say whether that is an external arrangement, but the fact that Ofqual must make the arrangements suggests that they are in Ofqual&#146;s gift.</p>

<a name="0910199000095"></a><b><a name="91019-0003.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="0910199000419"></a>The Minister of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and Ministry of Defence (Lord Drayson):</b> My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall now repeat a Statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the Defence Secretary. The Statement is as follows:</p>

<a name="91019-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="0910199000096"></a>&#147;With permission, Mr Speaker, I wish to make a Statement on defence acquisition. In December 2008, my predecessor asked Bernard Gray to undertake a review to identify improvements that we could make in the acquisition of defence equipment. On Thursday, I published Mr Gray&#146;s report and placed a copy in the Library of the House in advance of our defence policy debate. I said then, and I repeat now, that I apologise that honourable Members did not have longer to read and digest a report that is both lengthy and complex. I therefore welcome the opportunity that you have provided today, Mr Speaker, for a further discussion to take place on its content. Indeed, I suspect that today will not be the end of the conversation.</p>

<a name="91019-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="0910199000097"></a>Mr Gray&#146;s recommendations are far-reaching. We accept most of them and work is in hand, as part of a wider acquisition reform strategy, to implement the changes that we agree are needed. Mr Gray&#146;s report has got the debate well and truly started, which is something that I warmly welcome. It is an important subject and one that we very much wanted to surface. That is why we commissioned this report.</p>

<a name="91019-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="0910199000098"></a>I am very grateful to Bernard Gray for the effort that he has devoted to this, the analysis that he has produced and his support in developing proposals with my department to implement many of his recommendations.</p>

<a name="91019-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="0910199000099"></a>This is not a new issue. As Bernard Gray&#146;s report highlights, all countries with significant defence capabilities face the same inherent complexities of military acquisition and, over many decades, have had to deal with cost and time overruns. Indeed, as the report says, many of our allies are complimentary about the UK&#146;s efforts to drive reform in this area and model their systems on ours.</p>




<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_450"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column 450</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91019-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="0910199000100"></a>In the last 12 years, we have implemented a succession of initiatives to improve acquisition processes, including &#145;smart acquisition&#146;, the defence industrial strategy and, more recently, the defence acquisition change programme. These have had a significant impact on performance, as the National Audit Office has recognised in successive reports. At its best, my department&#146;s project management is very good indeed. As the report observes, there are dedicated people at all levels in the Ministry of Defence and among our suppliers, with a strong commitment to ensure that the services have the equipment that they need to deliver success on current operations and in the future.</p>

<a name="91019-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="0910199000101"></a>The system works best when the need is most urgent. We have successfully provided &#163;4.1 billion-worth of equipment to theatre in Iraq and Afghanistan through urgent operational requirements since operations began. Our people, military and civilian, can be proud of that achievement. The service chiefs have made it clear that our service personnel are never asked to undertake missions unless we are fully satisfied that they have the right equipment to do the job.</p>

<a name="91019-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="0910199000102"></a>However, the Gray report also brings out, through analysis of a sample of individual projects, the problems that still persist. These include not only the tendency of programmes to cost more and take longer to deliver than was initially estimated but the further cost growth to which this gives rise and the pressure that it places on limited resources, even in a period when the defence budget as a whole has grown substantially in real terms. The report points to remaining skills gaps and to shortcomings in the existing arrangements for managing the equipment programme and it argues for regular defence reviews to provide a strategic context for decisions on the equipment programme.</p>

<a name="91019-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="0910199000103"></a>To some extent, the difficulties that we and others face in estimating the cost and time to deliver projects reflect the fact that much modern defence equipment is at the leading edge of technology and is constantly having to adapt to meet evolving military requirements. Providing our Armed Forces with the best involves a degree of technological risk and uncertainty, but there are steps that we can and must take, in the light of the Gray report, to build on earlier reform and deliver a radical improvement in performance.</p>

<a name="91019-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="0910199000104"></a>First, I have already announced that we will undertake a Strategic Defence Review immediately after the general election. Preparatory work is already under way and I intend to publish a Green Paper early in the new year. We will also examine legislative frameworks for implementing Bernard Gray&#146;s recommendation that a Strategic Defence Review be conducted early in the term of each new Parliament.</p>

<a name="91019-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="0910199000105"></a>Secondly, we will work to adjust our equipment programme to bring it into balance with future requirements and the likely availability of resources through the current planning round and, in due course, the Strategic Defence Review.</p>

<a name="91019-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="0910199000106"></a>Thirdly, we will plan equipment expenditure to a longer timeframe, with a 10-year indicative planning horizon for equipment spending agreed with the Treasury. We will increase transparency by publishing that planning horizon and an annual assessment of the affordability of our programme.</p>




<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_451"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column 451</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91019-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="0910199000107"></a>Fourthly, as recommended by Mr Gray, we have already strengthened board-level governance within the Ministry of Defence by establishing a new sub-committee of the Defence Board, chaired by the Permanent Secretary as accounting officer and charged with determining, for agreement by the board and Ministers, an equipment plan that is aligned with strategy, affordable and realistic.</p>

<a name="91019-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="0910199000108"></a>Fifthly, we will improve the way in which we cost projects in the equipment plan, using better and more sophisticated techniques applied more consistently and ensuring that investment decisions are based on the most reliable available forecasts. We will also improve the management of risk across the programme.</p>

<a name="91019-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="0910199000109"></a>Sixthly, we will introduce stronger controls over the entry of new projects into the equipment programme and over changes in performance, cost and timing of individual projects.</p>

<a name="91019-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="0910199000110"></a>Seventhly, we will sharpen the business relationship between the Ministry of Defence head office, the Defence Equipment and Support organisation and the service commands by further clarifying roles and responsibilities and by establishing new arrangements to provide greater visibility of project management costs in DE&amp;S to the capability sponsor in head office.</p>

<a name="91019-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="0910199000111"></a>Finally, we will accelerate the improvement of key skills, including in cost forecasting and programme management, in DE&amp;S and the Ministry of Defence head office.</p>

<a name="91019-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="0910199000112"></a>All these changes are consistent with Bernard Gray&#146;s main recommendations. I do not intend to take up his suggestion to establish DE&amp;S as a government-owned, contractor-operated entity to put it more at arm&#146;s length from the rest of the Ministry of Defence. The Government have thought about this carefully, but we are not convinced that such a change would ultimately lead to better outcomes for the Armed Forces or defence generally.</p>

<a name="91019-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="0910199000113"></a>Having DE&amp;S as fully part of defence ensures a close working relationship with the military. Equipment acquisition is core business for my department and we have to get it right. I intend to publish a wider, more detailed strategy for acquisition reform based on these proposals in the new year to contribute to work on the Strategic Defence Review. I am delighted that Bernard Gray has agreed to work with us on this and we look forward to pressing ahead to make the changes that are needed&#148;.</p>

We welcome this report; it has been long awaited. We are also delighted that Bernard Gray has agreed to help the MoD to implement many of his recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="0910199000116"></a>At a time when we are at war, the findings of the Gray report reveal more than just financial mismanagement.

<a name="91019-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="0910199000117"></a>The report expresses what many observers of the defence procurement process have long believed: the procurement system is dysfunctional. The net result  


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_452"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column 452</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>has been to damage the efficiency of the Armed Forces, as they do not receive the equipment that they need when they need it.</p>

<a name="91019-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="0910199000118"></a>All those involved in the defence procurement process will welcome both clarity and predictability in the way in which the Government engage with industry, the MoD and the Armed Forces. Our service men and women surely deserve the best equipment that we can give them, just as the British taxpayer deserves the best value for their taxes.</p>

<a name="91019-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="0910199000119"></a>Some of the most troubling facts revealed by the Gray report are that the average procurement programme overruns by 80 per cent, increases by an average of &#163;300 million and creates a host of additional costs to the MoD.</p>

<a name="91019-0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="0910199000120"></a>As the report states, the MoD equipment programme is,</p>
<ul><a name="0910199000307"></a>&#147;unaffordable on any likely projection of future budgets&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0910199000270"></a>or spend profile. Too many types of equipment are being ordered for too large a range of tasks and at too high a specification. As the report observes, defence planning is not conducted in tandem with the costing of options. The Government&#146;s poor financial planning allows them to promise more defence capabilities than the MoD can afford.</p>

<a name="91019-0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="0910199000121"></a>The Minister gave a pledge, reported in the <I>Financial Times</I> on Friday 16 October, to,</p>
<ul><a name="0910199000308"></a>&#147;implement most of the recommendations of this report within six months&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0910199000271"></a>Can the Minister reassure the House that this will be the case and that this report will not suffer the same fate as the Government&#146;s defence industrial strategy, of which the Minister was the chief proponent?</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/91019-0004.htm"/>


<a name="91019-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="0910199000122"></a>Of all the recommendations, the key one seems to be proposed reform within the DE&amp;S. The report addresses the fact that existing commercial practices and project management are inadequate; there is a blurring of roles and accountability between the identification of capability and the ability of DE&amp;S to deliver it. What steps will the Government take to address this deficiency? Will the Government identify those programmes that they deem no longer meet the requirements for current or projected operational scenarios? Is it not better to be honest with defence contractors that keep design teams going at some considerable cost? Could the Minister elaborate on how the Government will clarify the roles between the capability sponsor, the customer and DE&amp;S and the efforts to improve commercial skills within the department?</p>

<a name="91019-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="0910199000123"></a>Aspects of MoD accounting and process would not be countenanced in a private sector organisation&#151;for example, the exclusion of costs from the planning process and the refusal to use external commercial lawyers to approve contracts before signing. The report makes it clear that the costs of delay or programme changes are not measured in any systematic way and there appears to be a lack of programme management and commercial and financial skills at the DE&amp;S. However, the Government have already declined to accept the report&#146;s recommendation that the DE&amp;S should be changed into a separate, publicly owned, contractor-operated body, with private sector management  


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_453"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column 453</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>drafted in to get to grips with the MoD&#146;s cost overruns and programme delays. Will the Minister explain more fully why this recommendation was rejected by the Government?</p>

<a name="91019-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="0910199000124"></a>I understand that there were concerns that the military&#146;s role in the purchase programme would be removed, but this seems strange, as the report recommends that military personnel remain integrated in secondary positions. Does the Minister agree with the report that, while many of the problems in acquisition have occurred for a long time, &#147;smart acquisition&#148; has had a limited impact in improving the situation?</p>

<a name="91019-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="0910199000125"></a>Finally, despite their importance to industry and the UK economy, the Statement makes no mention of defence exports, which were discussed in the report, particularly the French aspect. What is his department doing, in the light of the comments on defence exports, to maximise exportability of UK defence equipment?</p>

<ul><a name="0910199000309"></a>&#147;in the private sector, if one trades when one knows that one&#146;s operation is insolvent, that is a criminal offence. At the present time, the Ministry of Defence, frankly, is bust. There is a yawning gap between resources and commitments&#148;.</ul>
<a name="91019-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="0910199000127"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Drayson, replied:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="0910199000282"></a>&#147;My Lords, I am afraid that I do not recognise at all the characterisation that the noble Lord has just set out&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 9/7/09; col. 760.]</p>

<a name="91019-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="0910199000128"></a>The noble Lord is known as a very bright chap with a successful track record in the private sector. Surely when he answered my question the Government must have been aware of the scale of the problem because, as the Gray report points out,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="0910199000283"></a>&#147;On average, these programmes cost 40% more than ... originally expected ... and are delivered 80% later than first estimates predicted. In sum, this could be expected to add up to a cost overrun of approximately &#163;35bn&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0910199000272"></a>That is equivalent to approximately one year&#146;s total defence expenditure. The phrase in the Statement on,</p>
<ul><a name="0910199000310"></a>&#147;the tendency of programmes to cost more&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0910199000273"></a>must be the understatement of the year. Surely Ministers and officials must have been aware of the scale of the problem, yet the Government chose to sail on. Looking back, surely it was irresponsible to place orders for the two new aircraft carriers&#151;with, no doubt, substantial penalties for cancellation and their implied major costs of aircraft, to say nothing of manning and escort costs&#151;against the financial background of which we now hear. The Statement also uses this rather extraordinary sentence:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="0910199000284"></a>&#147;The service chiefs have made it clear that our service personnel are never asked to undertake missions unless we are fully satisfied that they have the right equipment to do the job&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0910199000274"></a>How can that possibly square with the equipment deficiencies that we were certainly aware of as the Afghanistan campaign commenced?</p>

<a name="91019-0004.htm_para6"></a>

Will L.E.K. Consulting be continuing its work on the implementation phase and will private sector expertise be called on to implement certain changes?</p>

<a name="91019-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="0910199000130"></a>Overall, however, as far as these Benches are concerned, we very much welcome this thorough report and support many of its recommendations. Indeed, we ought really to have a full report to do justice to its importance and scale. We particularly welcome a more frequent and regular Strategic Defence Review and the recommendation to,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="0910199000131"></a>Finally, in broad terms, how do the Government intend to balance the books&#151;by providing more resources or by cancelling major projects?

They absolutely do. In response to the point from the noble Lord, Lord Lee, about the scale of the problem that we face, I accept that this report shows that in stark relief. Taking into account the fact that the report was based upon a sample of projects&#151;so that it did not review all defence procurement projects&#151; the conclusions coming from that review are, none the less, pretty stark. We really do need to improve the performance in the Ministry of Defence.</p>

<a name="91019-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="0910199000133"></a>However, the noble Lord asked me a direct question about whether or not Ministers were aware. It is quite clear that Ministers have certainly been aware&#151;including me, as a former defence procurement Minister&#151;of the long-standing challenge of managing defence procurement effectively, as have many of my predecessors. However, the size of the problem that Mr Gray has identified takes us further in two respects. First, it shows the scale of the problem, which is extremely significant. Secondly, it goes to the heart of the causes of the problem in a way that previous reviews, going back many decades, have not. That comes from two areas. He first asks questions about the framework within which defence procurement projects have to be decided, and then he asks questions, given that framework, about the performance of the defence organisation in implementing the management of those projects.</p>

<a name="91019-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="0910199000134"></a>On the framework, the fact that Mr Gray has identified the need for much more regular Strategic Defence Reviews every time there is a new Parliament, and for the defence equipment plan to be planned within a 10-year planning framework agreed with the Treasury, provides an effective framework to enable the reality of defence procurement to take place in an effective manner. The control, which will now exist from the new executive committee, of having an affordable plan sign-off annually within that regular Strategic

<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="0910199000135"></a>I absolutely reinforce what I said last week. I was asked by noble Lords about implementation. Our target is to implement these reforms&#151;which we accept despite their stark nature&#151;within six months. We need to fix these problems. Bernard Gray has identified in his review how each service in the Armed Forces quite rightly acts to do the best for each service, but that the way in which that is managed between the three services does not provide the best result for defence as a whole. The clarification of the roles between the service and the providers needs better discipline within a structure, strengthened with better training of personnel in planning and project management.</p>

<a name="91019-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="0910199000136"></a>That goes to the heart of why, after reflecting for several weeks on the recommendation of a GOCO, we have decided that that would not be the right thing to do. We have learnt over the past few years that the reforms that we have implemented have been seen to be successful&#151;in particular, I point to the success in delivering equipment to operations through the UOR process. Having the military absolutely integrated into the acquisition process, whereby military personnel who have recently returned from theatre are working with civilians and industry to deliver projects, is the way to deliver kit that is absolutely fit for purpose. Although, if one privatised the DE&amp;S and separated it into a GOCO it may be possible to retain military expertise for a period of time, that military expertise would become outdated in pretty short order because it would not be possible to have military personnel from the armed services, from operations, working within that organisation. We have therefore concluded that we need to implement the reforms on improved skills, but to do so while retaining the defence procurement function centrally within the Ministry of Defence.</p>

<a name="91019-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="0910199000137"></a>The draft report was provided to Ministers in July. Since then, we have been working with Bernard Gray on the detail of his report and potential recommendations and, therefore, on a plan of implementation. We will be working with Mr Gray and with L.E.K. Consulting.</p>

<a name="91019-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="0910199000138"></a>Finally, the noble Lord asked how the Government intend to balance the books. The books may only be balanced through an SDR. We have committed to carrying out that SDR immediately after the general election. We will be setting out in our Green Paper early in the new year the themes that will lead into that SDR. That gives the Ministry of Defence the best possible chance to plan, in the run-up to the general election, the answer to that important question.</p>

This challenge of defence procurement is huge. That is no excuse, but we should not underestimate what it will take to fix it.

<p class="amendment_hs_quote"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="0910199000287"></a>Ofqual shall determine the number of points to be allocated in respect of each grade of each regulated qualification in any performance tables published under the auspices of the Secretary of State.&#148;</p>

However, the function of the amendment is to draw attention to the performance tables in all their various forms. Following examinations being reported under different headings, which became very diverse and confusing, whereby you had different  


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_457"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column 457</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>columns for IB and vocational exams and a third column for A-level examinations, we now have a consolidated point score. That has made it possible for the performance of schools which teach a broader curriculum to be recorded in a common currency of points, particularly those schools that are introducing GNVQs and, in a constructive way, many city schools that provide a broad range of BTECs and other examinations at GCSE&#151;and to a much larger extent at A-level.</p>

<a name="91019-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="0910199000145"></a>If that is to be believable, it is important that the point setting be carried out independently of any organisation with anything to gain from setting the points to their advantage. The majority of the distortions have been caused by government, although I do not blame this Government in particular. Governments tend to introduce new qualifications and want them to be taken up. One of the ways in which they have incentivised schools to take them up is by seeing to it that they are awarded a substantially excessive number of points. At the moment some GNVQs, which are good examinations, are rated in the league tables as being equivalent to four GCSEs, when clearly in terms of the work required to complete them they are worth substantially less. This distorts the whole pattern of education.</p>

<a name="91019-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="0910199000146"></a>Schools plunge into these examinations not so much because they are what are required by their pupils, but because it is the way in which the schools can be rated highly in the league tables. That is not the motivation which should lie behind a school&#146;s decision to change in this way. These examinations may well be right for their pupils, but the pupils&#146; interests should come first, rather than how the school appears in the league tables. For the two to be matched up it is enormously important that the point setting should be independent of government and, obviously, of awarding bodies or anyone else with anything to gain from setting the points one way or the other.</p>

Yes, there are a thousand different ways of measuring a school; I would not find it difficult to produce 40 or 50 relevant measures even for a primary school. If you have skill and experience, you should be looking at that and, anyway, you should be visiting a school to see what it feels like. However, while there is a need for a measure of how well a school is doing academically&#151;I agree that you may need to split this assessment into different bits&#151;how many should it be split into?</p>

<a name="91019-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="0910199000151"></a>At primary level we have English, science and maths. Can you really lump them all together into one figure, or should we see them separately? Should we just publish the individual subjects that are taken at A-level and not try to lump them together because how can one add physics to drama? The whole process within the breadth of A-level or GCSE of allocating the same grades to totally different subjects is one which, in essence, is a compromise but it is meant to mean something; it is meant to indicate a level of difficulty, a level of achievement; and it is putting things on a common scale because they are easier to understand that way. At the end of the day, even if people want to see the complexity, they also want the simplicity. They want the overall Ofsted judgment on a school as well as the 40 or 50 different criteria by which Ofsted makes its judgment. To get down to one measure, you need a way of translating a BTEC into a GCSE. That is what the point system is for. I am not saying that in any way it is perfection but that it is a useful measure for parents who have to make decisions about schools.</p>

I believe that we should consider this amendment further, consider how to take forward the aspirations of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, and return with something on Report. Having seen some amazing physics teachers in action, I can well imagine how one could add drama to physics but I would be interested to know how one could do it the other way around&#151;maybe a lighting-TECH or something like that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="0910199000153"></a>The values put on qualifications in performance measures for schools should reflect both their challenge and their size and how much time it typically takes to study for them. Just as with qualifications standards, I do not believe that Ministers would want to interfere in setting these values, but while there is a suspicion that they might do so now or in the future, we risk undermining the credibility of the school accountability system, as the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, has explained so eloquently.</p>

<a name="91019-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="0910199000154"></a>So, just as we need independent judgments on standards, in matters of school accountability, we also need independent judgments on how the size of one qualification stacks up against another. We believe passionately in the role of Ofqual as a fully independent, expert regulator of qualifications and as part of that, in the area of school performance measurement, we need Ofqual to be involved in checking and providing assurance that we have sound, objective judgments about the comparability of qualifications.</p>

However, it has the virtue of bringing into the light of legislative day this strange committee called JACQA, which exists in order to enable the Secretary of State to decide whether he will fund particular qualifications. I want to discuss it in relation to the next group of amendments because of the power which that gives to the Secretary of State&#151;quite rightly as he is the keeper of the purse&#151;over the whole business of which qualifications shall be taught in English state schools. As a result of the economics of the whole process, he has a strong voice in what is in those qualifications. If the Secretary of State does not like a particular qualification, he can, as he did recently, say, &#147;No, we&#146;re not going to fund this&#148;. Even though the qualification has been passed by Ofqual and is in every other way eligible, he can say, &#147;No, we don&#146;t want to give money to that&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="0910199000158"></a>That is fair enough: it is the Secretary of State&#146;s job and it is what the Secretary of State is for. It seems to me an enormously important consideration when we come to Clause 138, because it gives the Secretary of State all the control he can possibly need over the content of qualifications and how they are delivered. It gives him no specific powers, but it gives him the ultimate veto, which effectively will give him all the control that a Secretary of State could ever have, need or want. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="0910199000160"></a>However, what happens if the Government decide not to fund some of the qualifications that have gone through that fairly rigorous process? It seems to us only right that when a qualification has jumped through all the hoops laid out for it and a young person wants to take that qualification, it should be funded by the department, particularly in the light of the involvement in the system of the QCDA. That is what our amendment seeks to ensure.</p>

<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="0910199000161"></a><b><a name="91019-0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0910199000437"></a>Baroness Verma:</b> Before we get into deep discussion about the QCDA, it seems fitting to begin with a debate about the damage caused by the restrictive nature of qualifications in this country. We have tabled Amendments 273A and 273B to draw attention to what we consider to be the misguided policy of the Government.</p>

<a name="91019-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="0910199000162"></a>Our Amendment 273A calls for a review of the provision of the international baccalaureate examination. This examination has upheld very high standards of qualification and it provides a rigorous and effective assessment that has held standards at a consistently high level. Our Amendment 273B calls for a review of the provision of IGCSE and Cambridge Pre-U examinations in the state sector. These examinations are increasingly being offered by independent schools rather than the traditional state-run examinations.</p>

<a name="91019-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="0910199000163"></a>We have tabled these amendments not just to call attention to the success of these examinations, and certainly not to rerun debates regarding the importance of upholding standards in schools and examinations. It is true that these exams achieve all those things, but we draw attention to them in order to raise two main points. First, we believe that increased choice in examination qualifications will help to drive up standards in schools. The schools which offer these diverse exam choices know that their parents have an option about where they send their children. If the examinations offered are not up to scratch, parents can just take their children elsewhere. In line with the workings of the market, this will have a knock-on effect of ensuring that these examinations will need to uphold their standards in order to maintain their reputation and increase the numbers who select that particular exam. In the light of that virtuous spiral, encouraged by increased choice of examination, can the Minister account for the fact that despite promises to the contrary the funding for IB provision in the state sector has been removed?</p>

<a name="91019-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="0910199000164"></a>Secondly, there is a widening gap in our society which is becoming more marked and one that we must attempt to bridge. It is the gap between those who can afford to go to independent schools and so are given the opportunity to take qualifications, and those who remain in the state sector and are given no option at all.</p>

<a name="91019-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="0910199000165"></a>I hope that the Minister will acknowledge that disparity and will be able to update the House on the Government's intentions. We believe that it is utterly wrong that those with money should be able to go to  


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_461"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column 461</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>schools where a more robust examination system is followed than those without. With that in mind, can the Minister account for the Government's decision not to fund the international baccalaureate examination? Can she also inform us of the status of the funding of the IGCSE? At the moment, without funding, the Government are effectively denying access to that exam for those in the state sector.</p>

<a name="91019-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="0910199000166"></a>I am interested in the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Lucas, Amendment 263. We agree with the objectives behind the amendment, and I am very glad that he has raised the issue. Nevertheless, I feel that I must reserve some judgment purely because it seems rather inefficient to use one quango to administer another. One might say that if JACQA does not need to be independent, it may be sensible to abolish it altogether to save costs.</p>

<a name="91019-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="0910199000167"></a>Similarly, the issues raised by Amendment 274 are useful for the debate. The question is: if the advice of JACQA does not have a bearing on whether qualifications are funded, does that not imply that it should be abolished? It would seem odd to maintain a quango that operates with all the costs that that entails but without any real function or purpose. I will listen very carefully to the Minister.</p>

At the moment, we have something of an examinations apartheid between state and independent schools, which seems to me quite wrong. Independent schools are now experimenting with the IGCSE and with the Pre-U and, so far, the results seem very promising. They are enjoyed by the young people, the young people are challenged by them and the brighter children certainly seem to thrive better with those examinations than with those on offer in the state sector. Of course it was right in the early days to restrict the spread of new examinations, but now that they are much better established in the independent sector it would make sense for the Government to extend them in the state sector as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="0910199000170"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, made some assertions about the international baccalaureate, suggesting that funding for it has been removed. I can reassure her that that is not the case: funding for the international baccalaureate in state schools has not been removed. I turn to her amendments. Of course people should be able to choose from a range of high-quality qualifications, as she suggests, to help them to achieve their potential and to recognise what they have learnt. Of course the qualifications offer should be kept under review, as it is. Of course noble Lords will be interested in the Pre-U, but the Pre-U and the baccalaureate are already available in the state sector. They are regulated by interim Ofqual, so we can be sure that those qualifications will be of high quality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="0910199000171"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Perry, was also concerned about the IGCSE but, as I have said in this place once before, the IGCSE has not yet been submitted to interim Ofqual. It is not accredited and its processes for maintaining standards are not monitored. That is not to say that it will not be in future, but it would be self-defeating for Parliament to set up an independent regulator and then, in the same Bill, ask the Secretary of State to review whether maintained schools should be able to use qualifications that have not been submitted to the regulator for accreditation. We must have a system and stick by it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="0910199000172"></a>Taking a step back from that, we know that the current learning offer for young people is confusing. I have taken that point from many discussions in this House. Too many qualifications fail to support the progression from learning to skilled employment and higher education that we all want to see. That is why we are looking to streamline the qualifications offer in the maintained sector into four main routes: GCSEs and A-levels, diplomas, apprenticeships and foundation learning.  We believe that qualifications outside those routes should be available where they meet a need that cannot be met within the four main routes.</p>

<a name="91019-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="0910199000173"></a>It is also why we have made a commitment, which noble Lords are keen to see, to review the entire publicly funded pre-19 qualifications offer in 2013. By then, we will be in a position to look at all qualifications in the offer and the contribution made by each. Limited reviews focused on individual qualifications before that date would not enable us to make sound, objective judgments. I assure noble Lords opposite that all regulated qualifications will be considered in that review.</p>

<a name="91019-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="0910199000174"></a>I shall speak briefly about Amendments 263 and 274 on JACQA and the funding of pre-19 qualifications in schools and colleges. We believe that it is right that the responsibility for taking decisions on funding eligibility should remain with the Secretary of State. I appreciate what the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said, but we have to disagree. It is an important principle that Ofqual&#146;s regulatory decisions should be kept separate from the policy role that the Secretary of State takes. Decisions about what qualifications to fund are policy decisions, as the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, made clear. It is for the Secretary of State to decide whether a qualification is appropriate for use in the state sector, and whether it is consistent with the national curriculum and with his or her wider strategy for qualifications. Government has a responsibility to our young people to ensure that the qualifications they study for are coherent&#151;we will come on to that word&#151;and provide good progression routes into further study or employment. Government also has a responsibility to the taxpayer to make sure that qualifications provide good value for money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="0910199000175"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, said, the Joint Advisory Committee for Qualifications Approval&#151;JACQA&#151;has been established to advise the Secretary of State on which pre-19 qualifications should be eligible for public funding. That decision remains with the Secretary of State under the Learning and Skills Act 2000. JACQA&#146;s membership has been set to ensure

The aim is to ensure transparency in the process, so I am delighted to have the opportunity to talk about this on the record.</p>

<a name="91019-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="0910199000176"></a>The published criteria set out the basis on which decisions about public funding eligibility will be made. These criteria, along with a full explanation of its evidence-gathering and decision-making processes, are included in a new JACQA handbook for awarding organisations, which will be published later this month. I will ensure that, when it is published, it will be made known to Members of the Committee. The Secretary of State&#146;s decisions are similarly published. JACQA will also publish an annual report on its activities; the first will be in December. I can confirm today that the annual report will include a summary of those qualifications not recommended for approval and the reasons for those recommendations.</p>

It was never submitted for approval because the Secretary of State, or rather the Minister for Schools, indicated that, if it was, he would not fund it anyway; so, unsurprisingly, no one has gone to the trouble of submitting these things for acceptance. However, if it was clear that the Government were prepared to fund them, they would be submitted like a shot because there is a big market for them in grammar schools. Indeed, grammar schools would take to them like a duck to water, as have many independent schools now. Particularly for bright kids, but generally for someone of a more analytical frame of mind, they are a great replacement for the rather degraded set of examinations that are GCSEs. This power is a great weapon in the Secretary of State&#146;s armoury, and I agree with the Minister that it is entirely appropriate that the Secretary of State should have it. He can receive all sorts of advice from all sorts of directions, but he must decide these things. It is his responsibility, and I am delighted that the power remains with him.</p>

<a name="91019-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="0910199000187"></a>As my noble friend Lady Perry said, the IB is at a very inflated rate in the performance tables. It is rated as five A-levels, even though the teaching time for it is perhaps three-and-a-half A-levels, which, to go back to Amendment 261, is another reason why I should like there to be a proper independent rating of these things. However, I very much hope that in the future we will see arrangements whereby the state sector is again allowed to innovate. It is wonderful that independent schools are getting back to innovating, are bringing in the IB and are supporting the Pre-U and the IGCSE. But that should be happening in the state sector too, where it will require a degree of openness and encouragement.</p>

<a name="91019-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="0910199000188"></a>Some things really need to be done. For example, our IT qualifications at GCSE and A-level are miserable and boring. They are stuck in the IT of 20 years ago with spreadsheets and business practices. There is no programming or engagement with the web. Certainly, there is no Web 2.0 and interactivity, which is what all the kids are doing for themselves. IT should be a wonderful, exciting examination that sets students off at pace into the outside world. Instead, it is an absolute drag and is done only by those who cannot find more interesting things to do, which is a disgrace. All that needs to happen is for innovation to be encouraged and allowed, and better examinations would emerge. For now, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Rather than the quango-filled, bureaucratic tangle we have before us, we would prefer a streamlined, simple and clear-cut structure, which would be transparent and accountable.</p>

<a name="91019-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="0910199000190"></a>Within such a framework we would hope to remove the need for the QCDA altogether and thus cut down on yet another agency. As the Bill stands, the QCDA is responsible for the QCA's non-regulatory functions. According to the Explanatory Notes it is designed to support,</p>
<ul><a name="0910199000312"></a>&#147;Ministers on developing the curriculum and related qualifications and delivering National Curriculum assessments&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0910199000276"></a>It is understandable that the Government, when they removed the regulatory functions from the QCA, thought that it would be only natural to form another agency out of the remaining functions. Nevertheless, this approach is symptomatic of a government whose first thought is bureaucracy over simplicity.</p>

<a name="91019-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="0910199000191"></a>We would move the functions of the QCA in relation to the national curriculum back to the Department for Children, Schools and Families, which would achieve two goals. First, Ministers who are responsible for making promises with regard to the curriculum could be held accountable for these promises. Secondly, it would carve at least one quango from this Bill and take one step towards reducing the bureaucracy that this Government have introduced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="0910199000192"></a>At this year&#146;s Conservative Party conference, my honourable friend Michael Gove said:</p>

<p><a name="0910199000277"></a>and so cut the waste out of the system. We on these Benches feel that removing the QCDA is an important part of these reforms. I will be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s claims that in order to have Ofqual we must, therefore, have the QCDA. We do not believe that this is the case and it is perhaps telling that this is the solution the Government have come up with&#151;another issue, another quango.</p>

In other words, this is not a wrecking amendment. It is perfectly possible to pass a Bill that includes Ofqual but excludes the QCDA, so I hope that the Minister will consider removing this quango from the Bill. I look forward to her response.</p>

It was an e-mailed request to the Public Bill Office which has been interpreted in absolute full. But the effect is exactly what I wanted, which is to demolish the QCDA and leave no trace of it in the Bill, although I could have drafted the last amendment, Amendment 276ZZA, rather better. I think it should refer to the QCA rather than the QCDA, which would not then exist because I would have already deleted the clauses referring to it.</p>

<a name="91019-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="0910199000195"></a>My objective in this is positive. I think that the curriculum belongs with the Secretary of State. We have had a long period of the curriculum being looked after by a quango and what we have now is ever-increasing complexity and specification with less time for schools to teach beyond the curriculum, along with less freedom for teachers. This congestion and sclerosis have resulted in such things as modern languages being thrown out for lack of room because all these other things have to be taught. While quangos tend to complicate matters because they want to take into account, accommodate and include everyone&#146;s view so that the curriculum satisfies every good idea that is brought to their attention, Ministers tend to simplify. They want something that is clear, usable and focused on the sort of things they feel people care about. A Minister-led curriculum would be lighter, clearer and simpler, and would allow more time for schools and teachers to go their own way, which is very much my objective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="0910199000197"></a>I agree absolutely with the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, that schools should be freed up to innovate and not be restricted by an overly prescriptive curriculum. Our approach would be to have a minimum curriculum entitlement for all children and then a wide range of options for schools to offer what they believe would suit their children in their situation. Indeed, they have a duty to do that. However, a slightly more arm&#146;s-length body such as the QCDA advising the Secretary of State is not quite such a bad idea as the Opposition think.</p>

However, the Explanatory Notes to the Bill state that the QCDA will report to Ministers. They do not say that it will report to Parliament, so the Select Committee procedure will be completely ignored. I can assure noble Lords that if you are in a non-departmental public body and you have some responsibility, the thing that worries you is not that you might be summoned to see the Minister, but that you might be called to appear in front of the Select Committee. Ignoring the Select Committees gives the game away as to what the accountability of the QCDA is intended to be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="0910199000199"></a>An NDPB has a structure, with a chairman and a board, and is almost always said to be &#147;independent&#148;, and, indeed, we may be given some indication of the degree of independence which the Government think the QCDA will have. In the <I>Oxford English Dictionary</I>, &#147;independent&#148; means &#147;free from the control of&#148;. In my study of independence, I have always taken Jane Austen quite seriously. She had a clear idea of what &#147;independent&#148; meant and she spelt it out on more than one occasion; it was usually a desirable feature of a bachelor.</p>

<a name="91019-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="0910199000200"></a>However, the question becomes: at what point does the degree of control over a body mean that you cannot any longer say that it is independent? There must then come a point where the independence is either illusory or so eroded that the game is not worth the candle, and why should anyone of real quality and experience want to be the chairman&#151;or, indeed, a member&#151;of such a body? This is the position of the QCDA. The Bill ties it down to a much greater degree than was the QCA tied down in the 1997 Act. The word &#147;must&#148; has crept into its relationship with the Secretary of State with an unprecedented Hegelian frequency, and directions are more frequent and less specific; previously confined to parts of the Act, they are now of general application.</p>

<a name="91019-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="0910199000201"></a>There seem to be two reasons for this creeping erosion of independence, this centralising of control by the executive, which is recognised in the Explanatory Notes where they refer to being accountable to Ministers but not to Parliament. The first reason for the erosion is that one driving force of the third way is the secular certainty that centralised executive power in the hands of Secretaries of State is the way forward. We may&#151;as, indeed, the Liberal Democrat Benches do&#151;object to that, but if it is there it has to be recognised; it is no good wishing that it was not. The second reason is ministerial frustration. As policies seem not to be working&#151;as when the decision is reached that the Learning and Skills Council needs to be abolished&#151;so it follows that the rules governing its successor bodies must be more mandatory; Ministers need them to be so. Thus the screw turns: now we see the possibility of independence; now we do not.</p>

The functions of the QCDA would be better discharged and accounted for if they were in the hands of the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="0910199000203"></a><b><a name="91019-0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0910199000451"></a>Baroness Perry of Southwark:</b> My Lords, a little history might help us here. Before the 1988 Act brought in by the noble Lord, Lord Baker, there was no external body to control the curriculum. Various bodies, such as the Schools Council, could advise on, consider, discuss and launch various experimental parts of the curriculum and so on but, nevertheless, in those days the Secretary of State was the only person who could have intervened at any stage. There was no national curriculum. It was the 1988 Act&#151;21 years ago now, so I suppose that it is celebrating its 21st birthday before it dies&#151;that laid down a basic curriculum.</p>

<a name="91019-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="0910199000204"></a>I was a great admirer of the concept of having a broad and balanced curriculum and of laying down that it should include English, mathematics, a science, a social science and so on. Much though the national curriculum has become an object of criticism and dislike by many people in recent years, we tend to forget that in its original form it was simple and broad and left an enormous amount of freedom for individual schools to experiment and innovate. It ensured that young people going through their secondary education, particularly the latter half of it, did not become too narrow in what they did. Various surveys by Her Majesty&#146;s inspectorate had found that young people might be taking five GCEs or CSEs, in the days before those were brought together, all in the same corner of the curriculum; they could all be maths and science, or all social science and history, or all English and literature and so on. That did not seem to be a very broad curriculum.</p>

<a name="91019-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="0910199000205"></a>The concept of the broad and balanced curriculum that came through in the 1988 Act was a simple one that could very well have stayed in the hands of the Secretary of State. It was then handed over to the first of these many bodies that have changed so many times, the National Curriculum Council, which was then separate from examinations, and it was that quango that turned it into the nightmare that it became, with 458 different assessments needing to be made and so on. My noble friends are putting forward the concept that the matter of the curriculum should ultimately be left in the hands of the Secretary of State, rather than being handed over to a quango full of people who all have axes to grind&#151;the physicists want special kinds of physics, the historians want a particular kind of history and so on. That is where it went wrong before and I would be nervous that we were perpetuating a system that overcomplicated, overcontrolled, took away innovation and took away the professionalism of teachers in schools.</p>

<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_469"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column 469</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>eloquently the spectrum of independence, from how Ofqual might be defined as an independent regulator through to the SFA as an agency. This debate gets to the heart of some of the differences around the Chamber.</p>

<a name="91019-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="0910199000207"></a>It might have been helpful in the previous debate if I had mentioned to the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, that the QCDA will be a joint chair of JACQA; I had that note, so I thought that I would throw that in while I was on my feet.</p>

<a name="91019-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="0910199000208"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Perry, gave us a helpful insight into the history of how we have come to where we are. I stress, though, that on the question of the erosion of the independence of the QCA we would argue that the QCA legislation, the 1997 Act, already provides for the Secretary of State to direct the QCA or to require it to have regard to plans. There really is no significant change for QCDA provisions. Accountability to Ministers is, and will remain, clear. The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, asked about the QCDA&#146;s accountability to Ministers and how that might affect its relationship with the Select Committee. I am absolutely confident that the QCDA will come before the Select Committee and be able to be questioned by it, as I am sure noble Lords would expect.</p>

<a name="91019-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="0910199000209"></a>To those who ask whether we need a Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency, I would attempt to explain that ministerial decisions on curriculum, qualifications and assessment policy issues need to be informed by expert and professional advice. Once those decisions have been made, we need an agency that is capable of putting them into practice and ensuring that we have high-quality curricular assessments and qualifications.</p>

<a name="91019-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="0910199000210"></a>Since these advice and delivery functions are clearly accountable to Ministers, who are accountable to Parliament, it is fair to ask&#151;as did the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, very clearly&#151;why those functions cannot be performed within the department. There are two principal reasons why we believe that the Bill&#146;s approach is correct. First, the department&#146;s responsibility is to lead and manage the system. Its role and expertise are principally about policy and strategy. It is generally not appropriate for the department to have large delivery and professional functions in-house. This is our approach. Just as funding of teacher training is done by a non-departmental public body, similarly, the specific functions relating to the QCDA&#146;s remit sit well in an agency&#151;an agency that will have the culture and focus to enable it to develop professional knowledge, technical skills and the kind of organisational culture that we need.</p>

<a name="91019-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="0910199000211"></a>Secondly, we need transparency. Some of the functions of the QCDA need to be carried out at one step removed from Ministers&#151;most obviously, when delivering national curriculum tests. I would be very interested to hear from the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, whether she would expect the national curriculum tests to be delivered directly by the Department for Children, Schools and Families and whether that is what is being proposed. Given the importance of test results, everyone needs to be confident that they are delivered impartially. Even with Ofqual as a regulator overseeing tests, there must not be any suspicion, however unfounded, that Ministers have an opportunity to influence the detailed

This point has been made by the party opposite in this Committee.</p>

<a name="91019-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="0910199000212"></a>Like every other public body, the QCDA will need to be efficient, as we would expect the highest standards of governance. The forthcoming move of the QCDA to Coventry, for example, following the Lyons review a few years ago, will significantly reduce the agency&#146;s costs. It is simplistic to argue that the creation of Ofqual means that it is not appropriate to maintain the QCDA functions and that it is a straightforward matter to bring its functions into the department. That would be a significant mistake. We will challenge the QCDA to take advantage of its relocation to drive down costs and I am confident that it will respond positively. The QCDA will be an efficient and effective organisation at the heart of England&#146;s education system. It will not make policy; that is for Ministers.</p>

<a name="91019-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="0910199000213"></a>With regard to the analysis of the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, we are clear that the QCDA will be an arm&#146;s-length body, have independence within a clearly defined remit and be accountable. It will support Ministers in delivering policies and be accountable through Ministers, with a clear and transparent remit, reporting to ministerial remits and not going off and doing its own thing. Our approach has an extremely strong commitment to an independent Ofqual and to the appropriate governance for the delivery and expertise that we wish for from the QCDA. I hope that, with those reassurances, noble Lords will allow the clause to stand part.</p>

<p><a name="0910199000278"></a>How can anybody do that without going off and doing their own thing? How can you find the line between policy and the delivery of policy? My father was twice the Secretary of State for Education and I thought that the Department of Education was a great department of state. I cannot accept that it should not have anybody within it responsible for any part of the delivery of the Government&#146;s policy. That seems the most extraordinary statement&#151;that in some way we must separate the creation of policy from its delivery. It is not done in this Bill; if the QCDA&#146;s objective is to promote coherence, that is a major policy decision, I should have thought. But I cannot see how you can separate those things in such a way, which leaves one with the question of why there is a wish to separate them. Why is there a wish to erode the accountability of Secretaries of State to Parliament? How does that go down on the &#147;Today&#148; programme? The more one thinks about it, the more it simply does not work.</p>

A fundamental problem with the Civil Service as it has emerged in the past 12 years is the continuing divorce of delivery from policy. If you operate the two separately, policy never learns from the problems that arrive in delivery, which just produces new policy with a whole fresh set of problems rather than building on what has gone before. We have seen that with this endless cycling of initiatives and destruction of institutions before they have had

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="0910199000216"></a>I agree with the noble Baroness that I would not have the Minister setting the examinations. As I said under an earlier amendment, I would have that done professionally, as GCSEs and many other examinations are done, by organisations set up for that purpose. I do not see why it has to be retained within government. However, the idea that separation produces anything other than confusion, bad policy and bad delivery is very much given the lie by the performance of this Government and department over the past 12 years.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Perry, reminded us that before the national curriculum was introduced in 1988, there was no such thing and that examinations were set by the special assessment boards. They, incidentally, were largely influenced by universities. Indeed, going back a little further in history to the post-war period, one reason that education within the German state was given to the Lnder state organisations was because we had poured scorn on the degree to which political influence had set the national curriculum in states such as the Nazi and, for that matter, the Soviet state.</p>

<a name="91019-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="0910199000221"></a>The great danger of politicising the national curriculum is there; we say, carefully, that the Secretary of State has to be the one who decides, yet there are virtues in going back to the situation where the universities set the curriculum. Indeed, I believe that, in the other place, the honourable gentleman Mr Willetts has even suggested that that might be quite a good idea. From these Benches, our notion is close to that which the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, talked about on the early days of the national curriculum. We see there being some advantage in having what we call a minimum curriculum offering, because during the 1970s and  


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_472"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column 472</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>1980s there was certainly a time when schools were doing very different things, and it was quite a good idea to be able to pull it together nationally.</p>

<a name="91019-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="0910199000222"></a>If there is to be some form of minimum curriculum offering, and decisions on what that offering shall be reside with the Secretary of State, it seems appropriate to us&#151;and here I come back to what the Minister was saying&#151;that within the department, if the Minister is to take those decisions it is surely better that those who advise him are people with some professional competence in education rather than his civil servants, whose competence is in policy and strategy, not in the professional area. If the Secretary of State is to have responsibility it therefore seems appropriate, in a way, to have some advisory body, which should on the whole comprehend the professionals rather than just being civil servants.</p>

<a name="91019-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="0910199000223"></a>This group of amendments is, therefore, about who should be on the board of the QCDA. We believe that, in order to carry out its functions properly, the QCDA needs to be able to call on the expertise of people on the board with knowledge and experience in the areas of education and training with which it will largely be dealing. It is vital that it does not consist of just industrialists and accountants but some real, down-to-earth educationalists who know what is going on and are up to speed on the latest thinking.</p>

<a name="91019-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="0910199000224"></a>First, we think that the proposed board is rather too small to contain that expertise, so with Amendment 269B we want to increase its minimum size from eight to 12 and its maximum size from 13 to 15, which is not a substantial increase in size but a slight one. Amendment 269C is in fact taken straight from the Education Act 1997 and the terms of reference for the QCA, so that those who constitute the board shall be persons with experience, first, in education, as in sub-paragraph (a) of that amendment, secondly, in training or, thirdly, in the &#147;industrial, commercial, or financial&#148; world. However, we have added a requirement for two-thirds of the membership to have experience in all the areas of education covered by the QCDA.</p>

<a name="91019-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="0910199000225"></a>Amendment 272 would require that the QCDA take account of the expertise and practical knowledge of the awarding bodies. These bodies are eager to work with the QCDA, as well as with Ofqual, and I am sure that both organisations would benefit from listening to their considerable store of knowledge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="0910199000226"></a>Amendment 273 would remove Clause 171(2), to stop the Secretary of State from meddling by preventing the QCDA from working on a particular qualification, even if it thinks it necessary. Amendment 275 to Clause 184 would bring the academies into the local family of schools by ensuring that children there have the same entitlement to the national curriculum. As the Committee may know, academies may currently move outside the national curriculum. Under Liberal Democrat policy, all schools would have more autonomy over the whole curriculum, but all children would receive a minimum curriculum entitlement. I beg to move.</p>

Even her last amendment, under the scenario she paints in which we would have a curriculum that took only half the time in school, I would approve. However, the idea that it should apply now, when we have a curriculum that takes up 120 per cent of school time? Perish the thought.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="0910199000228"></a>The purpose of my amendment is to draw attention to the word &#147;coherence&#148;. It is not a term defined in art, but it seems to be the opposite of &#147;diversity&#148;. It seems to give the QCDA the remit of trying to eliminate any new shoots which may appear and sprout off in unexpected directions, and to remove the diversity in the system. That diversity is in many ways a source of strength to the system. One can find, certainly in independent schools with their broader ability to look at qualifications, a qualification that fits any particular group of learners and replace it with something that requires a focusing-down in which everyone sings the same note. That is what &#147;coherence&#148; means&#151;at least in physics. A &#147;coherent&#148; beam of light does not diverge. There is no diversity and everything sings exactly the same tune all the time. I find that a distressing direction for the QCDA to be given.</p>

I express particular sympathy with Amendment 269C of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp. Indeed, as I made clear in the previous debate, we on these Benches do not believe that such a body as the QCDA is necessary. Nevertheless, we have advocated through the Bill the importance of including the views of those with the knowledge and expertise that comes from being involved in education, training and professional matters. If the QCDA is to exist, it is obviously sensible that it should include people with the relevant experience, knowledge and understanding to allow the quango to fulfil its functions more effectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="0910199000230"></a>I will also be pleased to hear the Minister&#146;s response to the amendment of my noble friend Lord Lucas. We agree with him that the inclusion of the word &#147;coherence&#148; seems strange. The curriculum should be set out in such a way as to improve standards. The body responsible for the development of the curriculum and qualifications should play an active role in seeking to create a framework which concentrates on promoting and improving standards. Does the Minister not agree that, as the objective of the QCDA is laid out in the Bill, it is important that this vital element is included and made clear in primary legislation?</p>

I appreciate that many people wish to give advice to Secretaries of State about a whole host of issues. However, the QCDA is very much about bringing together that professional advice systematically, being in touch with the national curriculum, keeping it very tightly scrutinised, commissioning research and carrying out a whole host of activities which support the role of giving Ministers that professional advice systematically.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="0910199000236"></a>Amendment 271, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, concerns coherence and makes a very interesting point. Everything that the QCDA does, for example on the curriculum, should be with a view to helping young people leave school with the skills and knowledge that enable them to play their part in society, and to be successful in future education or employment. QCDA cannot achieve that by looking at individual parts of the curriculum in isolation. That is where the word &#147;coherence&#148; comes in. QCDA should seek to ensure that, collectively, those parts provide a broad and balanced curriculum&#151;that is very important, as the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, stressed&#151;so that skills and knowledge in different parts of the curriculum reinforce each other. Learning at one stage of the curriculum should build on what has gone before and provide the foundation for what follows. That has been clearly articulated following the reviews of the secondary and primary curriculums. Both words&#151;&#147;quality&#148; and &#147;coherence&#148;&#151;need to be in the Bill.</p>




<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_475"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column 475</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91019-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="0910199000237"></a>We do not necessarily want Amendment 272 on awarding bodies in the Bill. The QCDA will be responsible for the development of draft criteria for qualifications such as GCSEs and A-levels. I want to be clear that the QCDA will act as an expert adviser to the Government on qualification policy issues, too. It could not do these jobs effectively without a strong relationship with a wide range of partners, including, of course, higher education&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, made clear&#151;employers, schools, colleges and awarding bodies. We do not need to tell the QCDA to do that; it will be easier for it to have a strong relationship with awarding bodies, particularly now that it will not be regulating them&#151;Royal Assent permitting. I hope that we will see strong relationships developing.</p>

<a name="91019-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="0910199000238"></a>On the further amendment on the Secretary of State&#146;s power to remove qualifications from the QCDA&#146;s scope, I am not sure that the Committee needs me to go into this, but if Ministers no longer need the QCDA&#146;s advice on a particular area of qualifications, it should not be obliged to keep on providing it. That probably goes without saying.</p>

<a name="91019-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="0910199000239"></a>Amendment 275 on including academies in the QCDA&#146;s remit is unnecessary. Our current funding agreements require academies to inform the QCA of its assessment arrangements in respect of the core national curriculum subjects, and it would not be reasonable or proportionate in this case to legislate and hence alter the previously agreed position set out in signed funding agreements. The department already monitors the curriculum in academies before and after they open, and results show that they are improving faster than the national average, as we know very well.</p>

<a name="91019-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="0910199000240"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, talked about the importance of getting the governance right for the QCDA. Under the current legislation, the QCA board has to have between eight and 13 members, and that has served us well. It is big enough to allow for a rich mix of people but small enough to allow it to take decisions effectively. In fact, on the QCA there is strong expertise from the higher education and education sectors. There is a vice-chancellor, a head teacher, an FE principal, as well as employers. However, I appreciate the noble Baroness&#146;s concern to obtain the right involvement in the right way from the right experts. The QCDA has general duties to have regard to reasonable requirements of learners, employers and HE. You do not necessarily have to have members on the board to have regard to the requirements of learners, employers and HE. That is not necessarily the only way of ensuring that their views are taken on board at the highest levels. The QCDA will listen to those views and those of all key stakeholders. However, the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, were very reasonable, and I am happy to continue the conversation on that issue.</p>

<a name="91019-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="0910199000241"></a>I think that I have picked up most of the points that noble Lords raised and that they will consider withdrawing or not moving their amendments.</p>

In relation to academies, she says that the detail is tied up in the funding agreements. The difficulty is that time and again there are individual funding agreements and if you want to know what is happening you have to look at each funding agreement to see precisely what it is. I do not think that that is a satisfactory situation. It would be much better if the academies were brought within the general body of schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="0910199000243"></a>Turning to the main amendments that we put forward&#151;Amendments 269B and 269C&#151;I take on board what the Minister says. Of course, the Secretary of State has the expertise available to him and many of those who currently sit on the board are experts. We proposed changing the numbers because we wanted two-thirds to represent those who have expertise in education and it is much easier to get two-thirds of 12 or 15 than it is of eight or 13. It struck us that, if all three sets of expertise were represented, it would be a good idea to have slightly more people than a minimum of eight and that it would be a good idea to have a number divisible by three. I am grateful to the Minister for her positive reply, which we may talk about further. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

We tabled it to obtain within 12 months of the commencement of this part a review of the result of the abolition of the national strategies, which was announced in the Government&#146;s White Paper of June this year. This amendment is tabled on the basis that, if the Government will not heed our advice to get rid of the QCDA, it might as well do something useful. As noble Lords will be aware, we supported Ed Balls in his decision to get rid of national strategies in favour of a system that would give more power to teachers, save money and allow attention to be paid to more effective means of raising standards. If, as I hope, the Government might be persuaded on our point in this amendment, I feel that I need say nothing more, other than that we look forward to hearing the Government&#146;s suggestions on how and when such a review might take place.

I would be very happy to commit to the department undertaking a review that we will report to Parliament on the impact of these changes and that it should do so when the changes have had a chance to embed.

We now come to the children&#146;s services section of the Bill, where we tighten up the arrangements on co-operation to ensure children&#146;s well-being.</p>

<a name="91019-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="0910199000248"></a>The first three amendments in my name in this group relate to housing. Amendment 276A would add housing as a consideration in the arrangements between local authorities and relevant partners for the improvement of children&#146;s well-being. Amendment 276B would extend the duty to co-operate to include local housing authorities by naming them as relevant partners for children&#146;s services authorities in England. Amendment 276BA would add registered providers of social housing to the same group as those with a duty to co-operate.</p>

<a name="91019-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="0910199000249"></a>I am aware that the Government believe that local housing authorities are already included in the arrangements for children&#146;s well-being and the duty to co-operate, but I do not believe that other social housing providers are. Besides, we believe that it is not happening on the ground. There is a lot of evidence from Shelter, which briefed us, that housing can have a profound impact on the well-being and safeguarding of children and young people but that there is currently a lack of information sharing between housing and children&#146;s services and a lack of understanding of procedures and good practice on both sides, which can result in vulnerable children slipping through the safety net.</p>

<a name="91019-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="0910199000250"></a>Since the Laming inquiry into the death of Victoria Climbi&#233; in 2003, priority has rightly been given to joint working. Since then, legislation and associated guidance have required local public bodies to work  


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_479"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column 479</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>together through children&#146;s trusts. There is little evidence to suggest that children&#146;s trusts have wholly succeeded in improving outcomes for children so far and there is a substantial amount of local variation. This Bill is intended to address the existing limitations of children&#146;s trusts by strengthening their statutory basis. In particular, the aim is to improve the co-operation of children&#146;s services authorities with their relevant partners. That is why we want to emphasise housing.</p>

<a name="91019-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="0910199000251"></a>Extensive studies have shown the major impact that bad housing has on children&#146;s life chances. Homelessness, poor housing conditions and overcrowding all have negative effects on a child&#146;s development. For example, Shelter research has found that children living in overcrowded and unfit accommodation are almost a third more likely than other children to suffer respiratory problems.</p>

<a name="91019-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="0910199000252"></a>Despite the proven links between children&#146;s well-being and housing, Shelter&#146;s children&#146;s service has found that there is a lack of information sharing between local authority housing departments and children&#146;s services around preventing homelessness, mitigating the impact of temporary accommodation on children and identifying additional support needs.</p>

<a name="91019-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="0910199000253"></a>Given the significant connection between housing and children&#146;s health and well-being, Shelter believes that it is vital that the new legislation specifically recognises local housing authorities as relevant partners for the improvement of children&#146;s well-being in the establishment of children&#146;s trust boards. We have added other social housing partners in recognition of the fact that many housing associations and housing trusts house thousands of needy children every year. Making specific mention of housing in the Bill would also give housing providers a stronger voice and more influence over the strategic arrangements of children&#146;s trusts. This would go a long way towards ensuring that vulnerable families in difficult-to-reach circumstances are contacted by family support and outreach workers. After all, they all need housing and they will have contact with the housing department at least, or a social housing provider, even if they have no contact with social services or other children&#146;s services.</p>

<a name="91019-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="0910199000254"></a>Amendments 277 and 277A relate to the children and young people&#146;s plans, which the newly statutory children&#146;s trust boards must set up and implement. Amendment 277 would require the CTB to produce a version of the plan in the language and format that is suitable for children to read and understand. Amendment 277A would require them to consult relevant groups when devising or revising that plan.</p>

<a name="91019-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="0910199000255"></a>Article 12 of the UNCRC requires that all children have the right to express their views and have them taken into account and given due weight according to their age and maturity in all matters affecting them. Clause 187 transfers the duty of preparing and implementing the children and young people&#146;s plans from the local authority to children&#146;s trust boards. Existing regulations require local authorities to consult such children, relevant young persons and families in the area of the authority as they prepare their plan and, of course, we welcome the Government&#146;s commitment to transfer this duty to the children&#146;s trust boards. But existing regulations place an obligation

While we welcome these provisions, they really are inadequate because there is no explicit requirement to make the CYPP accessible to those most affected by it&#151;in other words, children and young people.</p>

<a name="91019-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="0910199000256"></a>Research has found that, while children and young people may be increasingly consulted in the preparation of the plan, they are not always informed or told about the outcome of the consultations. Therefore, the duty to consult should be accompanied with a duty to inform the participants on the outcome of the consultation. This currently occurs for parent and partner organisations, but it does not occur for children. Awareness of the plan is low among children. We believe that the benefits for children and young people for understanding local strategies would far outweigh the costs. A summary for children would ensure that they could understand what services they could access and what local service providers were doing to improve their well-being.</p>

I will leave him to make the substantial speech on this, but I would like to thank the Bill team for the time that they have devoted to this issue. I support what the noble Lord is about to say and I look forward to the Minister&#146;s explanation of what the Government intend to do about this issue. I beg to move.</p>

In April 2009, the Child Poverty Action Group published a similar assessment of child well-being in 29 European countries. The UK ranked 24th, behind Romania, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania and Malta. These findings were widely reported and prompted media discussion about why the UK&#146;s children were apparently so unhappy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="0910199000260"></a>This amendment does not seek to place a new structural or administrative burden on the system. It merely asks that the children&#146;s trust boards have regard to the need to implement the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child when preparing its young persons&#146; plans. I for one can see no burden here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="0910199000261"></a>In December 2007, the Government published their first children&#146;s plan. It aimed to put the needs of families, children and young people at the very centre of everything that we do. It set out the Government&#146;s plans for the next 10 years under each strategic objective of the Department for Children, Schools and Families. The introduction to the plan records that it has been developed with regard to the principles and articles of

It is therefore unclear on what grounds the Government might oppose this amendment. Children England and the NSPCC have suggested that the UK needs to build a culture of respect for children&#146;s rights and believe that this could be achieved by embedding the principles of children&#146;s rights in policy-making and practices.</p>

<a name="91019-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="0910199000262"></a>The Joint Committee, in its report, agrees with those witnesses who emphasised the benefits of incorporating the UNCRC into British law, accompanied by directly enforceable rights. The Joint Committee also stated that it is particularly significant that all four children&#146;s commissioners in the UK, with their extensive experience of working with children, think that it would make a real practical difference to children if the UNCRC were incorporated into UK law. The Government have not persuaded the Joint Committee that children&#146;s rights are adequately protected by UK law or that incorporation of the UNCRC is unnecessary. Having signed up to the convention on behalf of children in the UK, the Government now have a duty and a responsibility to make their agreement and support meaningful in every possible way.</p>

<a name="09101914000001"></a><b><a name="91019-0007.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09101914000121"></a>Baroness Verma:</b> My Lords, the main thrust of the clauses is to provide for the establishment of children's trust boards on a statutory footing and give them the responsibility of providing a children and young people's plan. I have listened very carefully to the amendments proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, and I look forward to the Minister's response. We, too, think that it is important to address the issue of who will be the relevant partners involved in a children's trust board. I would be very interested to hear what the Minister thought about involving the local housing authority. I would also be interested to hear her views on involving local GPs and Sure Start centres on the boards.</p>

<a name="91019-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09101914000002"></a>It is a point of fundamental importance that merely making the boards statutory will not solve any underlying problems. We also need to address the issue of who sits on the boards and who the significant, useful and relevant partners should be. We have therefore tabled Amendments 276AA and 276C. A demand for the independence of academies has been constant from these Benches so, again, the amendments are designed to ensure the autonomy and independence of the academies.</p>

<a name="91019-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09101914000003"></a>We believe that it is essential that academies should have the right to be represented on children's trust boards. It may be mutually useful for them to be represented there. Nevertheless, we believe that academies are independent organisations and should not have a duty of co-operation with the boards. The Independent Academies Association has expressed concern about the duty of having to be a relevant partner, when surely it would be more productive to turn that duty into a right, which would allow them, to cite the White Paper, to be,</p>
<ul><a name="09101914000111"></a>&#147;able to influence the strategic direction, commissioning and delivery of services for children&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09101914000093"></a>As a right, academies would have their independence preserved, but would also have the capacity to be relevant and useful partners. I await the Minister's response with interest.</p>

<a name="91019-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09101914000005"></a>I start by focusing on Amendments 276A, 276B and 276BA, proposed and spoken to by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, which concern housing. I put on record the importance of good housing and its impact on the well-being of children and young people and acknowledge that decent housing is a major factor in improving children's outcomes. I join others around the Committee in paying tribute to the work that charities such as Shelter do to promote issues of concern about housing&#151;in this case, the impact on the quality of life for children that poor housing can have. I therefore fully support the aim of those three amendments to ensure that housing is integral to the work of children&#146;s trusts. It is important that the amendments allow us to have that debate.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/91019-0008.htm"/>


<a name="91019-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09101914000006"></a>The five Every Child Matters outcomes are what we mean by children&#146;s well-being, and we expect local services to work together more effectively to deliver them. The addition of services such as housing to the list of outcomes is therefore inappropriate, but I agree that good housing will be an important contributory factor in delivering the Every Child Matters outcomes.</p>

<a name="91019-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09101914000007"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, pointed to the fact that housing authorities are already captured by existing legislation. Top-tier and unitary authorities are the establishing authorities and district councils are relevant partners in children&#146;s trusts. Their housing departments are therefore already involved. However, the Government recognise that housing departments need to get more engaged; I support the noble Baroness in her remarks on that. I can reassure her that the new statutory guidance, going out for consultation shortly, will state that the chief executive, along with the director of children&#146;s services, should ensure that those links are forged and are working well.</p>

<a name="91019-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09101914000008"></a>We also recognise the important role that registered social landlords play. Through the children and young people&#146;s plan regulations, we intend to require children&#146;s trust boards to consult them when drawing up their plan. Also, the new statutory guidance will seek to ensure those responsible for housing locally are involved in the work of the children&#146;s trust board itself. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, was especially concerned about the lack of information-sharing between local housing departments and children's trusts. I make clear that we are strengthening statutory guidance there. Through the comprehensive area assessments, we will assess whether the new arrangements are working effectively in practice. That is an important development to watch.</p>

<a name="91019-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09101914000009"></a>Turning to Amendments 276AA and 276C, I can assure the Committee that the clauses do not threaten academies&#146; independence. I can reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, in that regard. Adding academies to the list of relevant partners empowers them&#151;in the way that I think that she is looking for&#151;not only in local strategic decision-making, but also in forging strong links with other children&#146;s trust partners.</p>




<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_483"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column 483</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91019-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09101914000010"></a>Although Amendment 276C would give academies the right to be represented on the children&#146;s trust board, that is different to the automatic representation that would be given to academies as relevant partners. Under that amendment, academies could choose not to be represented on the board. That could leave academies, which educate some of the most vulnerable children in our country, outside the most important partnership in the children&#146;s services world.</p>

<a name="91019-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09101914000011"></a>We are about empowering academies. I can assure the Committee that that is about better outcomes in services for young people and their families by making services integrated, accessible and available, not about academies losing their autonomy. Yes, we are requiring academies to work with children's trusts, but let me be clear: we expect children's trusts to engage positively with academies, as with other schools. There will be significant benefits from that way of working.</p>

<a name="91019-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09101914000012"></a>As a post script to my response to those two amendments, I remind the Committee that the consultation conducted last year into legislative options for strengthening children&#146;s trusts gave a clear steer that academies should be included on the same basis as maintained schools.</p>

<a name="91019-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09101914000013"></a>On Amendment 277, we wholeheartedly support the principle that the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, promotes of involving children and young people. I am happy to place on the record a clear commitment to set out in statutory guidance that we will expect children&#146;s trust boards to produce a child-friendly version of their children and young people&#146;s plan. That represents a significant strengthening of the current position.</p>

<a name="91019-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09101914000014"></a>On Amendment 277A, I am happy to confirm that the indicative regulations, which we have sent to Peers, will be placed in the House Library. They set out the different groups and bodies that we intend the children's trust board to have to consult when preparing the children and young people's plan. The statutory guidance will also emphasise the need to consult widely when preparing the plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09101914000015"></a>I shall pick up on another point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, about the importance of consulting young people. We recognise that the genuine participation of children and young people is vital for the success of the children and young people&#146;s plan, as our indicative regulations will show.</p>

<a name="91019-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09101914000016"></a>I now come to the powerful contribution made by my noble friend Lord Morris and the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, regarding the UNCRC. I am happy to put on record again a clear commitment to reference the convention in statutory guidance to which the local authority and its relevant partners must have regard. We will also look to offer practical advice and guidance to children&#146;s trust boards on how to ensure that their children and young people&#146;s plan is consistent with the principles of the convention.</p>

<a name="91019-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09101914000017"></a>We may have the opportunity to debate again&#151;I hope we do&#151;the Government&#146;s commitment to the convention. We are strongly committed to the implementation of the convention. We have had some very positive feedback on our approach to the  


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_484"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column 484</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>children&#146;s plan and the UNCRC within that. However, the responsibility for implementing the convention lies with the state. In general, treaties and international conventions are not incorporated into UK law, as happens in some other countries. Our approach to the UNCRC has been to implement it through a combination of policy initiatives, guidance and legislation. The children&#146;s plan brings that together coherently.</p>

<a name="91019-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09101914000018"></a>Our primary concern is to focus on the outcomes that the convention requires and their delivery. Using specific pointers and instructions in guidance will be very successful in achieving the kind of change that is required to have regard to the convention in legislation. It is an extremely significant step forward for those who are concerned to see the UNCRC progressed in this country. For example, we plan to state in the guidance that children and young people should be engaged in line with Article 12 of the UNCRC, which states that, as the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, wants, children have the right to say what they think should happen when adults are making decisions about them. I believe this is a significant step forward. I am happy to put this clear commitment on record, and I hope that with that the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment.</p>

It is very gratifying that the Government accept the importance of housing in relation to the well-being of children. I thank her for mentioning that the guidance will ensure that the links are made stronger and that they will be assessed in the comprehensive area assessment. I am also delighted that she confirmed that social landlords will be consulted and brought more into the family of organisations that are working on the well-being of children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09101914000021"></a>I am staggered by the suggestion that academies should not have the duty to co-operate in this matter. Safeguarding children is not an option. It should be the duty of all relevant bodies. I thank the Minister for what she said about the child-friendly version of the Children and Young People&#146;s Plan, which was very gratifying, and also about the consultation with the relevant groups. I echo what the noble Lord, Lord Morris, said in welcoming the commitment she gave about the statutory guidance and the practical advice to children&#146;s trust boards on the compliance of their plan with the convention. As she rightly said, it is the responsibility of the state to comply with the convention that it has signed. However, I would have thought that part of that compliance would be ensuring that the convention was implemented by every relevant body in the state. It is very appropriate that that should be done, and I am most grateful to the Minister. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I would like to leave a thought in the Minister&#146;s mind for her to reflect on between now and Report. It was stirred in me by hearing the noble Lord, Lord Morris, refer to the question asked by convention officials about why British children were so much less happy than others. That made me remember a large symposium brought together by the honourable Member in another place Diane Abbott, in which it emerged that children in large parts of London felt safer in the streets that they did at home or school. Section 10(4) of the Act lists those who are to be regarded as relevant partners with local authority children&#146;s services. It includes the police, probation and the youth offending team. The absence of the magistracy in some form needs to be thought about for two reasons: first, they would have something to contribute and, secondly, they would have a great deal to learn. It is very important that those who sentence young people understand the framework in which they have been living and to which they will be sent to live. I hope the Minister will bear that in mind if I put something down on Report.</p>

Clause 188 inserts a new Section 9A into the Children Act 2004 in relation to setting targets for safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children. My intention is to make the first determination of these targets a matter for the affirmative resolution of Parliament to allow them to be properly debated, not just nodded through. This is a vitally serious matter in which many Members of Parliament take an interest since we still have far too

The Children Act 2004 contains a provision for a first set of regulations to be subject to affirmative resolution: the sunset provision on private fostering. My amendment is very simple; it refers to that provision and relates it to the first determination of the safeguarding targets. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="91019-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09101914000026"></a>We agree with the noble Lord, Lord Laming, that setting statutory safeguarding targets is a necessary step in the drive to improve safeguarding and child protection in all areas, as the noble Baroness has already suggested. We also agree with the spirit of this amendment; it is absolutely necessary that the proposed targets are appropriately considered and consulted on. However, it is not necessary to achieve this through the affirmative procedure, and I hope to persuade her of that.</p>

<a name="91019-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09101914000027"></a>While I understand why the noble Baroness proposes that the regulations should be subject to the affirmative procedure, this provision, as she suggested, follows its equivalent in Section 1 of the Childcare Act 2006, under which the Secretary of State sets early-years targets in accordance with regulations. That regulation-making power is subject to the negative procedure rather than the affirmative procedure. We set this out in our memorandum to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, which is content with our approach.</p>

<a name="91019-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09101914000028"></a>We have expressly specified in the Bill the matters which the regulations on safeguarding targets may address. These include the subject matter of targets, the periods to which targets might relate, and the procedure for setting targets. These issues have already been discussed as part of the National Safeguarding Delivery Unit stakeholder consultation workshops that were held over the summer, and I assure the noble Baroness that they have been very comprehensive and inclusive. The next stage will commence shortly when we launch a public consultation on the new package of safeguarding indicators and statutory targets.</p>

<a name="91019-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09101914000029"></a>It is right to consult fully on the details and to listen very carefully. We have listened very carefully in the generation of the documents for consultation. We will outline our proposals in this area, including the indicators against which targets would have to be set, the periods to which the targets would relate, and the procedure for setting them. As I have stressed, we have already consulted stakeholders on the development of our proposals for revised safeguarding national indicators and new statutory targets, and we are committed to continuing public dialogue and consultation on the regulations.</p>

<a name="91019-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09101914000033"></a>This amendment requires that a child who is the subject of either a Section 47 investigation or a child protection plan shall be seen by the key worker separately from the parents or carers. Section 47 requires the local authority to make inquiries, where a child is suspected to be suffering or to be likely to suffer significant harm, to enable it to decide whether it should take any action. A child protection plan is drawn up when the local safeguarding children board decides that the child is at risk of significant harm.</p>

<a name="91019-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09101914000034"></a>The amendment does not envisage the child being subjected to any sort of medical or forensic examination or interrogation. I thought that I would make that clear right from the start. However, experience of a large number of sad cases has shown that it is essential that the key worker&#146;s opportunity to get to know the child or to hear from the child is not compromised by the presence of the parent or carer.</p>

<a name="91019-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09101914000035"></a>Currently there is no law on seeing children separately. However, I accept that both legislation and guidance note the importance of obtaining children&#146;s views and perspectives. Section 53 of the Children Act 2004 placed a new duty on local authorities to ascertain and give due consideration to the wishes and feelings of children before providing services under Section 17 or making decisions under Section 47 of the Children Act 1989.</p>

<a name="91019-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09101914000036"></a>I also accept that in <I>Working Together to Safeguard Children</I>, the statutory guidance on child protection, there is emphasis on the central importance of the child in safeguarding procedures. In paragraph 5.4, the guidance comments:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a><a name="09101914000108"></a>&#147;Some of the worst failures of the system have occurred when professionals have lost sight of the child and concentrated instead on their relationship with the adults. The child should be seen by the practitioner and kept in focus throughout work with the child and family. The child&#146;s voice should be heard and account taken of their wishes and feelings&#148;.</p>

<a name="91019-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09101914000037"></a>In paragraph 1.28, the guidance emphasises that assessing the risk of significant harm,</p>
<ul><a name="09101914000112"></a>&#147;depends on communicating effectively with children and young people, including those who find it difficult to do so because of their age&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09101914000094"></a>Furthermore, in paragraph 5.62, local authority children&#146;s social care has the lead responsibility for Section 47 investigations, which,</p>
<ul><a name="09101914000113"></a>&#147;should always involve separate interviews with the child who is the subject of concern".</ul>
<a name="91019-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09101914000038"></a>In paragraph 5.109, the key worker appointed under a child protection conference should,</p>
<ul><a name="09101914000114"></a>&#147;regularly ascertain the child&#146;s wishes and feelings",</ul>
<p><a name="09101914000095"></a>and, in paragraph 5.119, the child protection plan should be,</p>
<ul><a name="09101914000115"></a>&#147;explained to and agreed with the child in a manner appropriate to their age and understanding&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09101914000039"></a>So I am not saying that there is nothing in guidance; far from it&#151;all these things add up to a strong imperative to see the child separately&#151;but the facts of the terrible deaths of Baby Peter and others indicate that this is not enough. It should be a legal duty for three reasons. First, seeing the child separately from the parent is the only way in which the key worker can reliably fulfil their new statutory duties under Section 53 of the Children Act 2004. Secondly, seeing the child separately is central to the effective protection of children, a fact acknowledged by the Secretary of State, Ed Balls, in his press conference statement on the death of Baby Peter. Thirdly, it is clear from the three official overviews of child serious case reviews that guidance on the need to see children is not sufficient. These overviews all note that there is little to no evidence that the children who were subsequently murdered or injured were ever seen or talked to directly.</p>

<a name="91019-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09101914000040"></a>The study of serious case reviews in 2003-05 discusses the lack of focus on the child and children not being seen alone, and comments, on page 91:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a><a name="09101914000109"></a>&#147;This also applies to babies who are not yet able to speak for themselves and can be ignored&#148;.</p>




<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_489"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column 489</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09101914000096"></a>A skilled and experienced social worker can detect from the state of the baby and the way in which it interacts with the carer the sort of relationship that it has with the carer. The baby really does not need to be able to speak.</p>

<a name="91019-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09101914000041"></a>The obligation on agencies to share information is already in legislation. Seeing the child separately from their carers is just as important as sharing information, and many more children would have been protected from harm if their key workers had done so. Such a law would help key workers in their extremely difficult task of simultaneously supporting parents and policing them. It would allow the key worker to explain to parents that they are simply following the law when requesting to see the child alone and that this does not necessarily imply a lack of trust in the parent. The amendment would identify the bottom line; namely, that the child is the client in these circumstances, not the parents.</p>

<a name="91019-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09101914000042"></a>This amendment was debated in another place, where the Secretary of State, Mr Ed Balls, claimed that the matter was already in statutory guidance. However, in his argument that the amendment is unnecessary, he relies on the remark in paragraph 5.62 of <I>Working Together to Safeguard Children </I>that Section 47 inquiries,</p>
<ul><a name="09101914000116"></a>&#147;should always involve separate interviews with the child who is the subject of concern&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09101914000097"></a>Apart from that, there is no mention of seeing the child separately. However, this amendment is not about formal investigations under Section 47. It is about key workers establishing a continuous, professional relationship with at-risk children separate from the carers. The Secretary of State suggests that the law enables social services to take emergency action if the parents refuse to allow the child to be seen alone. That is irrelevant, since they will seek such emergency power only if they have in the first place sought to see the child alone and have been refused.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09101914000043"></a>This is not the time to be mealy-mouthed and claim that current statutes are sufficient. They are clearly not and the poor, little corpses of numerous children in the graveyards of this country are proof positive of that fact. It is time for the Government to listen to children in need, rather than to parliamentary counsel, and do something about it. I beg the Minister to take the lead and accept this amendment. I beg to move.</p>

The evidence clearly suggests that it is all too easy for the signs to be hidden and for the issues to remain undiscovered if a child is able to be seen only with a parent. I will be very interested to hear whether the Minister thinks that it would be more suitable or helpful to institute a system whereby children are seen separately from their parents.</p>

More often than not, the families who cause problems are strong in their behaviour and the defence that they put up. Something that has always worried me is why on earth two social workers do not carry out the visit and be of sufficient support to each other when facing a difficult situation.</p>

<a name="91019-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09101914000046"></a>I do not think that what happened in another place is satisfactory. I hope that we can get a much stronger reaction from the Minister. I did not intervene previously, but some very powerful changes have been accepted. We have heard about the importance of the use of human rights, children&#146;s rights and so on, which will be even more important in future. This provision is fundamental and I warmly support it.</p>

Recent history makes a great case for the Minister to answer if she is going to reply in the same terms as her colleague at the other end of the corridor.</p>

<p><a name="st_148"></a>
<a name="09101914000048"></a><b><a name="91019-0009.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09101914000136"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> I am delighted to respond to this important discussion. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, has identified an extremely important step or principle, which should underpin the approach taken by children&#146;s services when engaging with vulnerable children. This is an important point in our deliberations. I do not wish to be facetious, but it would be possible to put something in statute, as well as in guidance, and still no action is taken. We have to do all those things. I will say why we do not need this on the statute book.</p>

<a name="91019-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09101914000049"></a>For me, this is about how we make the right statutory guidance and make it happen. The message that came through to me from the report of the noble Lord, Lord Laming, was how you go about doing it. &#147;Just do it&#148; was one of his mantras. However, I am for ever in the business of dialogue, as noble Lords have realised through this Committee stage. When the safeguarding clauses were introduced in the other place we made reference to the current provisions set out in statute and guidance designed to ensure that, where appropriate, local authority social workers see children separately from their parents and caregivers. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, referred to the comments made by my right honourable friend, Ed Balls. But we know that there are concerns that, however strong the legislative and guidance framework is, this will not in itself ensure that all children are seen alone when appropriate. We have to think about how we will make that happen. We need to ensure that all children are seen alone, when appropriate, that their wishes and feelings are ascertained and that they are protected from harm in every circumstance.</p>

<a name="91019-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09101914000050"></a>The progress report of the noble Lord, Lord Laming, emphasised the importance of children being seen and their family circumstances being understood through their eyes. It is absolutely right that we tackle this issue of professionals losing sight of the child, which, as we have heard, again and again comes from the feedback and analysis that we see from serious case reviews. This is in line with the Government&#146;s statutory guidance, <I>Working Together to Safeguard Children</I>, which sets  


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_491"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column 491</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>out the local authority&#146;s responsibilities when children are the subject of Section 47 inquiries and of child protection plans.</p>

<a name="91019-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09101914000051"></a>We have committed to publishing revised guidance later this year and we will make sure that seeing the child, alone when appropriate, and ascertaining their wishes and feelings are placed at the centre of undertaking Section 47 inquiries and implementing child protection plans. We will also emphasise that the social worker should record each visit to a child. I know that there is a debate about the level of paperwork and bureaucracy to which social workers are subject, but we are committed to the important step of record keeping. Where the child is not seen alone during such a visit, the social worker should record why not, which is an important step.</p>

<a name="91019-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09101914000052"></a>As we know, social work is a profession under significant pressure at the moment. There are significant challenges in capacity and in quality, which is well understood in this Committee. We cannot solve these problems necessarily through more legislation. We are addressing them through investment in, among other things, a support programme for newly qualified social workers to ensure that they have appropriate case loads and the high quality supervision that they need to develop into social workers who can prioritise the face-to-face engagement with children, and make good, professional judgements, as part of a strong profession, about the best way to work with parents and families.</p>

<a name="91019-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09101914000053"></a>We are also investing in the training and development of managers, as well as encouraging returners back to the workplace by creating new, advanced professional roles within the marketplace that will keep the best social workers at the front line. We are committed to building on this with a comprehensive reform of social work and, most important as this Bill progresses through Parliament, we will look at the report of the Social Work Task Force which is due soon.</p>

<a name="91019-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09101914000054"></a>As I have said, social workers have an incredibly difficult job to do, and it is vital that the child&#146;s wishes and feelings are taken into account. Section 53 of the Children Act 2004 amended Sections 17 and 47 of the Children Act 1989. As a consequence, local authorities are already required, so far as is reasonably practicable, to ascertain a child&#146;s wishes and feelings about what services might be provided or what action should be taken to safeguard and promote their welfare. It is about how we translate statutory guidance and requirements into practice.</p>

<a name="91019-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09101914000055"></a>We are revising the guidance entitled <I>Working Together to Safeguard Children 2006</I> to make clear the responsibility of local authorities&#146; child social workers and what kind of support and improvements are needed in the field. We are looking at new arrangements for the comprehensive area assessments of local areas, which were introduced in April 2009. Under these, Ofsted will undertake an annual inspection of each local authority&#146;s contact, assessment and referral centres. This is an important lever for driving up standards as part of the new arrangements for comprehensive area assessments. We will see a programme of inspection of services for looked after children at least once every three years. These inspections will include sampling of case files where visits to the child have taken place and

The inspectors will look at gathering reviews of children and their families and thus provide a check on practical arrangements, which I believe will provide a significant step forward.</p>

<a name="91019-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09101914000056"></a>I shall close by saying that in no way are we complacent about the amount of work that needs to be done in order to promote a comprehensive safeguarding framework in this country so that the concerns that the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, is talking about are tackled as a matter of course. I hope that, with those reassurances, the noble Baroness will consider withdrawing her amendment.</p>

I thank the Minister, but I have no illusions about the fact that having this on the statute book will ensure that no child is killed by its parent or carer ever again.

There must also be better supervision, and I know that the Government are doing something about that. However, they cannot say that they have done absolutely everything if they do not give social workers this particular tool. It will enable them to explain to parents why they must see children alone. The Minister talked about making a record of whether the child had been seen, and if not, why not. That will simply not do. In such a case, emergency powers must be sought to ensure that the child is seen. The noble Baroness used the phrase &#147;as far as is reasonably practicable&#148;.

Many studies have shown that you can often predict the educational attainment of children by looking at the levels their parents reached. In particular, if parents receive education and support in the skills and knowledge needed to be a good parent, that inevitably benefits the child.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09101914000064"></a>According to proposed new Section 5A(2) in Clause 191, children&#146;s centres exist to meet the needs of,</p>
<ul><a name="09101914000117"></a>&#147;parents, prospective parents and young children in the authority&#146;s area&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09101914000098"></a>While they may focus on the child, they are also de facto centres for adult education. This amendment was suggested to us by the National Institute for Adult Continuing Education which does valuable work in adult education in other areas. The amendment clarifies that family learning is legitimate and appropriate for children&#146;s centres, and recognising this in legislation will strengthen this rather than risking it becoming a marginalised afterthought, or even being seen as an improper activity. Family learning enables parents to discuss not only parenting and childcare skills, and to understand their children&#146;s development, but also should provide an opportunity for them to reflect on their own careers in the labour force and how they may need or want to upskill or reskill in order to offer better lives to their children. Family learning plays a significant role in delivering the skills for life agenda of language, literacy and numeracy, and statutory recognition that it has a place in children&#146;s centres would allow it to become more effective. Educating

<a name="91019-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09101914000065"></a>Amendment 281 requires each Sure Start children&#146;s centre to have a designated lead on child safeguarding, as schools are required to do. This would be particularly helpful in the multi-agency context of the children&#146;s centre as early identification of dangers to children could quickly lead to multi-professional intervention. This follows on from the words of my noble friend Lady Walmsley on the previous amendment; these are all linked issues. Understanding the early indications of child neglect or abuse can require considerable skill and experience. We know of cases where many experts have missed the signs in the children who have sadly died, where identification and strong action might have prevented tragedy.</p>

<a name="91019-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09101914000066"></a>The amendment has been suggested by Action for Children, which provides many of the children&#146;s centres. It has noted that within some SSCCs each agency has a separate file for each child. It believes that this is a very risky practice that has already been identified in some serious case reviews. It can be impossible to build up a full picture of the situation when each professional has only one or two pieces of the jigsaw and we strongly recommend better interaction between professionals. We need SSCCs to have a designated lead who has proper training, clear lines of accountability for safeguarding and access to all the relevant information. There should be an expectation for recording and sharing information. The role of SSCCs in child protection is key to this and should be acknowledged. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s reply. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09101919000002"></a>The noble Baroness&#146;s comment that educating parents is good for children is entirely right. It takes me back to an early visit that I made to a Sure Start centre, where the school was thoroughly involved in the process of catering for the parents who could come along. We should not forget that many parents who were not enthusiastic about their own education would often happily do as requested and drop their child at a particular point because they were not allowed beyond that, so we cannot expect them to much appreciate how things have changed since then. Now we have schemes where the adult can learn IT skills or go in for art classes and do the kinds of things that they might have been deprived of doing as a child; and/or they can work with their own children in the nursery classes on learning through play, which we are now back to hearing about as the way forward in every sense. I thoroughly support that kind of approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09101919000003"></a>I fully support the other two amendments in relation to the safeguarding side of things and the requirement that community services must include health visiting and community mental health services. It is crucial to recognise that these centres could be other places in which early signs of special needs could be detected and worked on. I support the amendments.</p>

I assume that they are for children of pre-school age, although I cannot see it in the Bill; probably I have looked in the wrong place. I wonder how long they will be open for. Is it term time or is it in the summer, when the parents are under greatest pressure? I thoroughly endorse what the noble Baroness, Lady Garden, said about&#151;I do not like the word&#151;intergenerational interaction, but we tend to forget that many parents have had no proper childhood themselves and have never learnt even how to play. Single children of single parents in deprived areas who have not had access to playgroups and the like start hugely handicapped when they become parents themselves, which they are apt to do in teenage years. They are therefore in need of emotional as well as intergenerational skills within their own generation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09101919000005"></a>This could be a lifeline to many children, because the art of loving and caring parenting is like a golden chain; once it is broken, once a child does not have it, they do not have it to hand on and it has to be restored. There is no effective way of doing that at the moment except in institutions, which are never well geared to do it. If these gatherings of adults can, with the child, instruct the parent on how to be a mother or a father, that would be a great step forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09101919000007"></a>Amendment 280C would mean that health visiting services and community mental health visitors were included among the services that may be provided through children&#146;s centres.

<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09101919000011"></a>As to Amendment 280, I agree that many children&#146;s centres already work with local providers, offering learning activities to improve parents&#146; employability and running family literacy, language and numeracy programmes. For example, the London Borough of Merton is developing a purpose-built intergenerational centre, bringing together a wide range of partners from the public and third sectors. This will be built around a planned children&#146;s centre and is due to open operationally in 2010. The building is located close to two schools and is to offer a base to sustain and develop intergenerational projects. In addition to a day nursery and meeting and interactive areas, there will be a kitchen for joint food preparation activities. I remember debating a few years ago how young people were losing the ability to cook and how difficult that was, so that is a great idea. There will also be space for horticultural activities and, if that were not enough, an adventure playground as well. I am off to Merton.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09101919000012"></a>In Oldham, the lifelong learning service used family learning impact funding to develop its work with parents living in local refuges.

There is so much going on; I do not want to leave anyone out, but we have over 3,000 children&#146;s centres around the country now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09101919000013"></a>On Amendment 280C, the Childcare Act 2006 already places duties on relevant partners&#151;including, the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, will be interested to know, the primary care trust&#151;to work together with the local authority to provide better integrated services relevant to young children, parents or prospective parents. That will, of course, include health visiting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="09101919000014"></a>Clause 191, the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, will be pleased to hear, will require partners to consider whether those services that include health visiting and community mental health services should be provided through a children&#146;s centre. We are developing statutory guidance, as noble Lords will not be surprised to hear, for local authorities and primary care trusts on how to consider which services to deliver through children&#146;s centres, because they are such a wonderful opportunity. In both cases, we think that it is right to leave it to local partners to determine where to locate these services so that they best meet the needs of local children and their families, but one cannot imagine a better candidate than the children&#146;s centre.</p>

At this point, we need to remember that there is a great danger in this field that people will be prevented from giving the comfort that children need when they are hurt, frightened or lonely. This is a big issue; if you cannot give a hug to a child without being thought to be a paedophile, the child suffers, as does the adult. This is proliferating around the country. It may be unnecessary and it may not flow from statute, but it is certainly a reality. I hope that the department and the Minister will be addressing this and will be able to tell us something about it later on, whether in debate on this Bill or otherwise. This is something that we neglect at our peril.</p>

It is important for all people who work with young children&#151;I think that the noble Lord is concerned particularly about settings involving young children, because there you are more likely to find a child who trips and needs a hug when they get up, and so on&#151;that we get the training and support right for staff who work in these settings. That is why our department has a children&#146;s workforce strategy looking at these exact questions: what are the judgments that staff need to make and the competencies that they need to have in the various settings in which they work? What is the core knowledge about information sharing and so on that all people who work with children need to have? I would be happy to give the noble Lord more information about that.</p>

This is not just in child centres; it is in schools and throughout society. Matt of the <I>Daily Telegraph</I>, who so often puts his finger on the pulse, had a cartoon the other day of a child at his 18th birthday party being congratulated on having finished being a boy and instead becoming a suspected paedophile. It is a horrible situation; there are times now when one cannot express one&#146;s compassion without at the back of one&#146;s mind being afraid of being labelled as having some other motive. That is much more general than we are ready to acknowledge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="09101937000002"></a>The background to all this goes back as far as February 2000. Following the death of Victoria Climbi&#233; and the subsequent report by the noble Lord, Lord Laming, the Government set out their intention to reform the provision of children&#146;s services. At the time, the Children&#146;s Minister, Margaret Hodge, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a><a name="09101937000155"></a>&#147;We want to give parents and families greater support. Integrated teams of professionals working in and around children&#146;s centres and schools will bring services more directly to families&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09101937000141"></a>Children&#146;s families were certainly a central part of the Government&#146;s response and there has been much successful work&#151;we have discussed some already this evening&#151;in such centres. At the National Conference for Sure Start Children&#146;s Centre Leaders in March 2008, Beverley Hughes, the Minister of State for Children, Young People and Families, said that,</p>
<ul><a name="09101937000165"></a>&#147;a Centre can build pride and confidence in a deprived neighbourhood, with potential to act as a base for all kinds of additional activities to benefit the whole community ... links with local primaries are clearly particularly crucial; the stronger these are, the more likely it is that you will be able to help the children in your Centre to make a successful transition when it is time for them to start school&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09101937000142"></a>That came up in the previous set of amendments, as your Lordships know.</p>

<a name="91019-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09101937000003"></a>The Bill seeks to embed this success by placing such centres on a more secure footing. Indeed, the Government acknowledge that such centres might have local governance arrangements at some unspecified point in the future. I have to admit that that side of it continues to puzzle me: it would be much more sensible to set up the arrangements and bring them into force at an appropriate time&#151;but at least to have them in the Bill.</p>

<a name="91019-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09101937000004"></a>My amendment would make that aspiration a reality. It would remove the suggestion in the Bill that local authorities &#147;may&#148; create governing bodies for children&#146;s centres and replace the option with a requirement. There are four points. Proposed new subsection (1) would make it a requirement for local authorities to create governing bodies to have responsibility for children&#146;s centres. Proposed new subsection (2) would require those governing bodies to establish parents&#146; forums. Proposed new subsection (3) would allow governing bodies to be given additional powers and obligations via secondary legislation. Proposed new subsection (4) would allow arrangements for the staffing, organisation and operation of children's centres to be changed by secondary legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09101937000005"></a>The rationale for all this is that many children&#146;s centres are collocated on school sites, and the intention is that the majority of centres will be collocated as the programme is developed. Children&#146;s centres have very close relationships with neighbouring schools. Currently, such centres are funded and co-ordinated via the local authority. The local children's trust has a co-ordinating role for the centres, with strategic priorities being set by the trust.</p>

<a name="91019-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09101937000006"></a>The vast majority of school governors support this form of provision, but many are concerned about the poor governance of children&#146;s centres and the loosely defined responsibilities and funding in place in many areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09101937000007"></a>The entire thrust of <I>Every Child Matters</I> policy has been, and is, that services should be delivered and co-ordinated as close to families as possible. The advisory model proposed in the Bill gives those local families no real power to tailor such services to local need. Local governance, following strategic priorities set by the local children&#146;s trust, would give local people a real input into these services.</p>

<a name="91019-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="09101937000008"></a>There is an additional point: schools with specific funding routes and accountabilities are being asked to work with children&#146;s centres and, in so doing, are taking on serious responsibilities. These schools and the governing bodies within them find themselves working with management arrangements and structures that are very different from those of the school.</p>

<a name="91019-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="09101937000009"></a>School governing bodies attempting to develop partnership working with children&#146;s centres have been frustrated by the process. One governing body described running into &#147;a wall of bureaucracy&#148; when it attempted to work with a children&#146;s centre. Another complained that decision-making was distant and remote, when the rationale for the programme stresses the importance of neighbourhood teams.</p>

<a name="91019-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="09101937000010"></a>One answer to a questionnaire on this issue sent by the NGA to governors illustrates the case. The question was what issues of concern governors felt had yet to be resolved. There came the answer:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a><a name="09101937000156"></a>&#147;We feel we need clear terms of reference that set out what the local authority, the Partnership, the children&#146;s centre advisory board (still to be set up)&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09101937000143"></a>incidentally, how many of them have been set up where there are children&#146;s centres? That is one of the issues. Perhaps the Minister can give me answer&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09101937000166"></a>&#147;and the Management of the centre do, and are responsible for, in relation to children&#146;s centres&#148;.</ul>
<a name="91019-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09101937000011"></a>The second question was:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a><a name="09101937000157"></a>&#147;Do we need a set of Standard Operating Procedures to cover site/pedagogical relationships between Children&#146;s Centres &amp; Schools?&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09101937000144"></a>The answer was:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a><a name="09101937000158"></a>&#147;We feel we do not need a set of SOPs, because we would then be interfering with the management of the centre and that would not be an advisory capacity. Any more direction would make us responsible without the authority for the finance&#148;.</p>

<a name="91019-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09101937000012"></a>The clear conclusion of most of the NGA responses to the questionnaire, when members were asked to comment, was that clear governance&#151;possibly joint governance with the governing body of a partner school&#151;would offer the best solution for children's centres. Any such governing body would need a mechanism to consult families, which is why the NGA supports the formation of parents&#146; forums for these centres. Local governing bodies for children&#146;s centres would deal with these problems and be in line with the Government&#146;s wish to focus children&#146;s services at the neighbourhood level. Local governing bodies for children&#146;s centres make even more sense when children&#146;s centres and schools are collocated. Common governance arrangements would surely make strategic planning and local consultation simpler and more effective.</p>

Perhaps I may say from these Benches how much we support all that the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, has said. She is absolutely correct that what is wanted is a clear, consistent set of rules, that the sensible thing is to have a proper governing body rather than just an advisory board, that the voice of the parents should be heard very clearly and that, therefore, within that governing body there should be established something equivalent to a parents&#146; forum.</p>

When might we reasonably expect to see draft regulations on this topic? On the assumption that that is not going to be before Report, can the Minister explain how she expects the centres to be governed, including how independent that governance will be? We think that it is very important for parents to be involved in children&#146;s development and education. It will be interesting to hear what the Minister thinks of the amendment and its reference to the parents&#146; forum concept.</p>

I hope that I can offer her some reassurance. We are very committed to some pretty similar aspirations, but we do not necessarily agree on the way. I am not sure, having just looked behind me, whether the noble Baroness is going to be pleased with what I have to say, but I shall do my best.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09101937000017"></a>I agree&#151;and I am keen to put on record&#151;on the benefits of effective governance in children&#146;s centres.

I believe that our proposals to establish those advisory boards will bring opportunities for local people to influence the services that children&#146;s centres provide and encourage accountability of children&#146;s centres to local people, but without expecting too much, too soon, of children&#146;s centres. That is not by any means to undervalue their potential; many children&#146;s centres are still at an early

Our regulation-making powers, to which the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, referred, will enable us to introduce governing bodies if, after careful consideration, it seems appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09101937000019"></a>To be fair, and to be clear with the Committee, we have not yet determined a timescale. There are no firm plans at this stage to introduce statutory governing bodies. I implore the Committee to understand the range of children&#146;s centres and of stages of development that they are at. While many children&#146;s centres already have parents forums, which play a significant role in shaping services, many centres work closely and sensitively with parents in other ways. While the Bill does nothing to prevent parents forums when centres want them locally, we would not want to impose such forums on all centres, as this might disrupt other existing, successful ways of consulting parents.</p>

<a name="91019-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09101937000020"></a>Finally, I am happy to assure the noble Baroness that new Section 5C will require local authorities to include people representing the interests of parents in the local authority&#146;s area as members of advisory boards. That is the clear connection for which the noble Baroness is looking. In addition, new Section 5D will require local authorities to consult before opening a children&#146;s centre, making significant changes to services provided through children&#146;s centres, or before closing a centre. Our statutory guidance will stress that local authorities should ensure that they consult parents in these circumstances. That is absolutely right. I hope that, with those reassurances, the noble Baroness will consider withdrawing her amendments.</p>

An enormous number of regulations is referred to in this clause. The concern that this amendment seeks to probe is how these regulations will ensure that local authorities use their new powers to fund early-years providers in a way which safeguards centres of excellence. There are many extremely good providers of early-years education. Local authorities that have them in their areas know who they are. Many of them are maintained nurseries, headed up by highly qualified, specialist early-years teachers. Some of them are run by the voluntary sector and some of them are private.</p>

<a name="91019-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="09101937000026"></a>We believe that quality early-years provision can be delivered only when the staff are well trained to understand how children's brains and personalities develop and how to respond to them when they reach each stage of development. There has been much debate about this in the press in the past week, particularly since the Cambridge primary review was published. I believe that education that takes account of child development and how children learn best is what is needed to help children fulfil their potential and avoid turning them off education for good. But this expertise comes at a price; my concern is that those settings that have the vision to employ teachers with their knowledge and expertise are not disadvantaged by the new arrangements. I hope that the Minister can reassure me that local authorities will be able to ensure that these centres of excellence do not suffer under Clause 195. I beg to move.</p>

Funding should be based, primarily, on participation rates and not the number of places available. That will enable additional funding to be targeted at the most disadvantaged children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="09101937000028"></a>A presumption against the closure of maintained nursery schools is already clearly set out in statutory guidance. Maintained nursery schools are required by law to have a head teacher, and we have stated clearly in guidance that this cost should be reflected in the new funding arrangements, meaning that they are still likely to be funded at a much higher level than any other early years setting. I noted carefully the point that the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, made about the centres of excellence. We do not have a legal definition for those centres, but in listening I understood the point that she made and, indeed, I share her view about the importance of child development.</p>

<a name="91019-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09101937000029"></a>Clearly, the quality of staff and settings are key drivers for improving children&#146;s outcomes and narrowing attainment gaps. That is why we want to encourage local authorities to incentivise and reward maintained, private, voluntary and independent providers&#151;I stress this&#151;for quality provision. We feel it is right that settings with a higher quality of staff should attract more funding, but not that some settings should be given high levels of ongoing financial protection when they could be supported to make reasonable efficiency savings, thereby enabling redirected funding to reach many more children.</p>

With these two amendments, we move onto the next part of the Bill, which is about schools. Chapter 1 of Part 10 concerns the intervention by the Secretary of State in local education authorities when a large number of their schools are underperforming. The purpose of this amendment is, first, to ensure that where the Secretary of State intervenes to take over the education services of a local authority&#151;because it is running a disproportionate number of low-performing schools&#151;the judgment on whether a school is low-performing is not the peremptory one of the National Challenge, based on raw performance data, but the more considered judgment of Ofsted, which looks holistically at the school&#146;s overall performance. Ofsted also takes into account the population it serves and the difficulties it may face in serving a particularly disadvantaged or, perhaps, an ethnically and linguistically diverse population.</p>

<a name="91019-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="09101937000033"></a>The second purpose is, similarly, that the question of whether a local authority has a disproportionate number of such schools is, again, to be a matter for Ofsted to decide in its local area agreement, rather than for the Secretary of State to decide and step in. I am sure that the Minister will tell us that the Secretary of State would not step in without consulting Ofsted, just as it happened with Haringey and Baby P. Nevertheless, if that is the case, why should we not have Ofsted instead of the Secretary of State in the Bill?</p>

We will ensure that any decision to direct a local education authority to obtain advisory services is supported by robust evidence&#151;such as data on attainment, pupil progression in relation to reasonably expected standards, and standards previously attained by pupils there or at comparable schools&#151;and is not, as suggested, wholly dependent on the Secretary of State simply guessing, without careful assessment, which LEA is underperforming. The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, asked whether we will provide guidance or criteria to define what we mean by disproportionate. I cannot commit that we will provide a full definition but, following consultation in the revised &#147;schools causing concern&#148; guidance, that consultation will, of course, be extended to Ofsted.</p>

It is imperative to remember that the Secretary of State, not Ofsted, is responsible for school standards&#151;and that he is accountable to Parliament for them. We think that is what precludes Ofsted from being involved in this process. The Secretary of State sets targets and annually collects the data, and therefore maintains a legitimate overview of standards and of those schools where there is low performance. Given that responsibility, he must have the freedom to make the ultimate decision when he deems that standards in a school or schools are low, and thus whether an LEA has the capacity to secure rapid and sustainable school improvement for the pupils in an area.</p>

<a name="91019-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="09101937000038"></a>I stress that we do not anticipate that the Secretary of State will make this decision in isolation, or that this power will necessarily be used at the first instance. I can give noble Lords the assurance that Ofsted will be consulted where it is deemed necessary. We must remember that our goal here is to ensure that all children have access to a high standard of education, and that they are able to reach their full potential. I would therefore hope that, in the light of those assurances, the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, will feel capable of withdrawing the amendment.</p>

As the Minister said, he would take account of all those statistics but would look to Ofsted to advise him on those things. The point that I made&#151;if Ofsted is going to be doing it, why not put it into the Bill?&#151;remains. However, the issue is not worth pursuing now, and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="09101937000044"></a><b><a name="91019-0011.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09101937000202"></a>Lord Kirkwood of Kirkhope:</b> My Lords, I am pleased to move this Take Note Motion on the Flexible New Deal (Miscellaneous Provisions) Order 2009, laid before Parliament on 29 June and coming into force on 5 October&#151;a significant date to which I shall return in a moment. I am grateful to my noble friend Lady Thomas of Winchester for steering me in the direction of Take Note debates. This is not an attack or an attempt to annul the order; I am absolutely content with its provisions. However, there are some issues that it would be to the benefit of the House to have raised before the order passes into effect and leaves the parliamentary process entirely. I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity to talk a little about the significance of 5 October. As we know, the whole of phase 1 of the Flexible New Deal, a significant programme, came into effect on that date.</p>

<a name="91019-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="09101937000045"></a>I am grateful to the business managers for finding time for this important debate and I am grateful to the Minister, whose sunny disposition when faced with these orders is impossible to breach. I do not know what groaning went on in the department when it found out about this, but the Minister had a broad grin when I asked him to do it. I am grateful for that; it is important for the House to know that Ministers are as willing as he is to do these bits of scrutiny.</p>




<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_508"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column 508</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91019-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="09101937000046"></a>I will deal with two specific aspects of this order in detail. However, as I said at the beginning, the Flexible New Deal is now a big programme, almost of the same scale as the policy framework under which it sits, the Jobseekers Act 1995. That has been overlaid by the Flexible New Deal and it is a matter of agreement across the House that there are different ways of approaching this general direction of travel. I am sure that in future debates and in the other place, when it would be more in order, we will hear more about the substance of our various proposals to develop the programme. Given that it has just been introduced, however, this is a key moment. It would be to the benefit of the House if the Minister could update us this evening on how that operational implementation has passed off compared to the department&#146;s expectations.</p>

<a name="91019-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09101937000047"></a>Paragraph (2) of Article 2 deals with the distinction between training allowances and earned income. There is nothing particularly exceptional about this, because these same provisions were applied to all the precursor New Deals. It was not a surprise. The surprise is more that there was a major consultation, as the Minister knows, in March 2009. The consultation was of such significance and magnitude that it was referred to the Social Security Advisory Committee. The SSAC came up with some recommendations. One was about the speed of the rollout, which brings us to the order before us.</p>

<a name="91019-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="09101937000048"></a>More widely, there is concern that the way in which this crucial public policy area is being developed at law is now so piecemeal, complex and detailed that we should be thinking about a sort of consolidating measure. I say to all sides of the House that these provisions find their provenance in the Employment and Training Act 1973, with amending legislation thereafter. Well, the situation with employment schemes in 1973 was quintessentially, qualitatively and quantitatively different from the situation with the Flexible New Deal.</p>

<a name="91019-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09101937000049"></a>Article 2(2) of the order may be all very well in its context; we can accept it because we have seen it before and it is part of the system. However, it is no longer safe for any Government to hang the whole active labour market policy development that we are seeing, and will see, on the Employment and Training Act 1973. If they do, they will get amendment after amendment, order after order. There was a major consultation in March on the order and a &#147;(Miscellaneous) (No. 2)&#148; order dealing with the Flexible New Deal was laid last Monday.</p>

<a name="91019-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="09101937000050"></a>There comes a point when Parliament must raise this issue with the department, under any Government. Of course, this would take parliamentary time and would be a matter of consolidation but I and my colleagues would welcome and facilitate any attempt by the department, working under a Government of whatever colour, to look seriously at the statutory foundation for the Flexible New Deal and intermediate and flexible labour markets in the future, so that we do not have to do these orders night after night, dealing with their content and the piecemeal tinkering with the system that they involve.</p>

<a name="91019-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="09101937000051"></a>Article 2(3) is different and the Minister might say a word about it. Of course, I understand that it makes perfect sense to separate out what are called the test  


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_509"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column 509</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>trading rules for self-employment. Self-employed trainees through the Flexible New Deal potentially could have a trading arm. HMRC is very jealous about the trading bit of that, as opposed to the training allowance and the money that the trainees get as participants in the Flexible New Deal programme. That is new to me. I have not found a provision of this kind before. I do not know whether this is HMRC getting into the act late or what. I may be wrong about that, and would be pleased to be corrected if I am, but test trading is important.</p>

<a name="91019-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="09101937000052"></a>I come off the back of that narrow point to a wider point. Self-employment is very important, going forward, in getting flexible employment. People with intermittent conditions and mental illness and other things who find it difficult to go into entry-level jobs at any scale at all in an employment context or in their own dwelling house can be supported perfectly well through self-employment. I therefore want some assurances not only about whether these test trading provisions are new in this order, but also that they will not damage, affect, interfere with or restrict the rollout of self-employment provisions under the Flexible New Deal. If they did, I would have some serious concerns.</p>

<a name="91019-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="09101937000053"></a>The evaluation and provisions in the Explanatory Memorandum of this order are also important. It is reassuring to know that the Policy Studies Institute, which is well respected and well known as an evaluator of departmental policy, is to look at all this. I hope that it will. I am cheered by the fact that paragraph 12.3 of the Explanatory Memorandum talks about,</p>
<ul><a name="09101937000169"></a>&#147;a report of early findings in December 2009&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09101937000147"></a>They will be very early findings in December 2009. I hope that the Minister will confirm that the department is still aiming to achieve that. Paragraph 12.2 refers to other important provisions that should be looked at, which go all the way through to an evaluation programme ending in 2012-13. That is entirely right and proper and all the bullet points in paragraph 12.2 will need to be studied.</p>

<a name="91019-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="09101937000054"></a>I hope that the Minister will focus the PSI work on some of the policy issues that concern many people in the new contracted-out service providers as regards what they are to expect in the future. It does not help them when they read in the <I>Financial Times</I> of 30 September that the onflow of clients will be up to 40 per cent less&#151;that was a fortnight before phase 1 started. That is to say that service providers who were told earlier in the year that there might be 450,000 client onflows over the middle to longer term are suddenly told a fortnight before the programme starts, &#147;Oops, it is 250,000&#148;. I should perhaps have declared an interest as a non-remunerated, non-executive director of the Wise Group. I can tell the Minister that that reduction will have a signal effect, although not in the short term, because these programmes are being wound up. However, even well run businesses such as the Wise Group will find that a significant difference to embrace at such notice after the contracts have been signed. The order will be directly affected by some of these matters.</p>

<a name="91019-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="09101937000055"></a>One reason why the onflow will be reduced is welcome. There are early signs that the economy is picking up and that unemployment figures will come  


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_510"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column 510</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>down. I was cheered to see the recent unemployment figures, as I am sure we all were. However, I am puzzled by the fact that the Government launched the &#163;1 billion Future Jobs Fund after these contracts were negotiated. I am not clear whether that can be folded into the Flexible New Deal scheme. However, the guarantee of a job or training for young people would certainly have a direct effect on the client group onflow on to the Flexible New Deal. Therefore, the Government have by their own hand reduced the number of potential clients, which does not enhance the confidence of people who are in the business of putting this important policy in place.</p>

<a name="91019-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="09101937000056"></a>In that regard, what is the order&#146;s scope? I understand that personalised employment programme pilots are being rolled out in Barnet and Hampshire. I assume, and I hope that the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, that people in Flexible New Deal will be either under phase 1&#151;phase 2 when it rolls out next spring&#151;or under pathfinders or pilots. There will be no other jobseeker&#146;s allowance provision anywhere else. If people are not in phase 1 or phase 2 or the pathfinders or pilots, there will be no other jobseeker&#146;s allowance people working in any other part of the system and therefore they will be covered by the order.</p>

<a name="91019-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="09101937000057"></a>Has there been operational guidance on how Articles 2 and 3 of the order will be rolled out? The Social Security Advisory Committee was concerned about the speed at which the programme was being developed. I accept that these are second-order issues, but if the guidance is not given timeously and properly to the people who are operating these schemes, and indeed to the private contractors who will offer their services, problems will arise along the way.</p>

<a name="91019-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="09101937000058"></a>I hope that the Minister will allay some of my fears. I am on his side in trying to make this policy work as successfully as possible and I guess that that is true of colleagues on all sides of the House. However, I repeat that I think that we are now getting to a stage where it is no longer safe to rest the statutory foundation for a scheme of this size on the legislation that we have. We should be looking for early consolidation; otherwise, I fear that we will come back to these piecemeal, second-order issues night after night on the Floor of the House. I shall not point at anybody because I am not supposed to do that, but I give fair warning that, as long as the Minister is prepared to grin and bear it, I am prepared to table these Take Note Motions, because it is important that people understand the detail behind these orders. On that basis, I beg to move.</p>

I am grateful to him for giving us the opportunity to debate the Flexible New Deal. I am also grateful to the Minister, who said that he did not mind answering wider questions about the Flexible New Deal than those concerned with the order itself. I shall take him up on that in making some general points.</p>

<a name="91019-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="09101937000060"></a>First, as regards the contracts that my noble friend mentioned, do the current funding arrangements mean that the shorter-term jobs are funded more generously  


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_511"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column 511</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for the contractors than the longer-term jobs, or has that changed? Perhaps the Minister could let us know. Secondly, will the reports from the Policy Studies Institute&#151;the first one is due out in December&#151;address the contracts to ensure that the contractors are not creaming off the easiest clients to help while parking the hardest to help, who, after all, will be the most expensive? This is even more of a possibility in the current employment climate, where the pressure to meet targets will be greater than before. After the 52 weeks are up, these clients can simply be handed back to Jobcentre Plus. However, that is too early to be caught by the report from the PSI.</p>

<a name="91019-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="09101937000061"></a>In April, when we debated the main Flexible New Deal regulations, the Minister said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47"></a><a name="09101937000161"></a>&#147;Providers are required to invest in all customers who walk through their door&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 27/04/09; col. 85.]</p>

<p><a name="09101937000148"></a>We need to know that that is indeed happening. While on the subject of help for those with complex problems or multiple barriers to work, could the Minister give us the up-to-date position on the niche providers, usually in the charitable sector, vis- -vis the primary contractors? Is it the case that some of the most successful are not being subcontracted by the bigger providers sufficiently to enable them to keep going? There are disturbing reports that many quite sizeable niche providers with a great deal of experience in getting people with multiple problems into employment are in danger of closing down. This is a worrying problem. Can the Minister give us any comfort on that score?</p>

<a name="91019-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="09101937000062"></a>There is one other point in relation to contractors. At present, they fall outside the freedom of information requirements, although they will be spending taxpayers&#146; money. That point was made by the Social Security Advisory Committee. This puts them in an anomalous position with the public sector. Are there any plans to include them within the ambit of the Freedom of Information Act?</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/91019-0012.htm"/>


<a name="91019-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="09101937000063"></a>I turn now to the staffing of Jobcentre Plus offices, on which the Minister was kind enough to provide me with information during the summer. Is he confident that all Jobcentre Plus offices will have enough well trained staff to operate the Flexible New Deal? We will have a chance in the Welfare Reform Bill to debate this further, but perhaps the Minister would give us a snapshot of the current position.</p>

<a name="91019-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="09101937000064"></a>Are there any circumstances in which a person in the greatest need of help to find work but who has been unemployed for less than six months is able to access the Flexible New Deal? Do personal advisers have any discretion in this area?</p>

<a name="91019-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="09101937000065"></a>My final point is a practical one. The Flexible New Deal is a regime with conditionality for those who fail to fulfil their obligations. I hope that, if letters from Jobcentre Plus are sent to participants as part of the sanctions regime, the postal strike will be taken into consideration and that people will not find that they have been sanctioned when they have not received a letter in time. I am sure that other arrangements will be put in place; I hope that this is the case.</p>

<a name="91019-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="09101937000067"></a>I take this opportunity to summarise the general concerns on this side of the House with the Flexible New Deal as it stands. As many noble Lords will be aware, our concerns have led us to develop a broader approach to the issues of unemployment and welfare reform. The Flexible New Deal was developed at a time when the economy was strong and was designed to support a relatively narrow group of people into economic activity&#151;those who had spent a long period on JSA and who in practice found it difficult to find a sustained place in the workforce. With the onset of the recession, many more people have become likely to find themselves unemployed for more than a year, not so much because they have underlying difficulties in the workplace, but because there are, for the time being, too few jobs for them. The Flexible New Deal, therefore, has become a rather different animal and the expected volumes have increased substantially&#151;although they have decreased a little, as the noble Lord said.</p>

<a name="91019-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="09101937000068"></a>At the same time, the new work capability assessment seems to be sending rather more people into JSA than expected. It is entirely likely that in the years to come considerable numbers move straight from incapacity benefit to jobseeker&#146;s allowance. Therefore, the Flexible New Deal looks to be an inappropriate programme in the present environment for a number of reasons.</p>

<a name="91019-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="09101937000069"></a>First, a structure which sends clients back to Jobcentre Plus after a year during the depth of a recession would send exactly the wrong incentive to the providers. The message would be: save your cash for the next tranche when there are more jobs available. In practice, of course, we want providers to make sure that their clients are kept trained and motivated when there are appropriate jobs. Secondly, there is no price differentiation in this structure. It is difficult to believe that the cost of preparing someone for work who has spent many years on incapacity benefit will be the same as for someone with an impeccable work history and a solid skill base who has been made redundant through no fault of their own. The former incapacity benefit recipient may have spent, for instance, five years or more on that benefit and then been transferred on to jobseeker&#146;s allowance after a work capability assessment, and then wait another year to go to a provider, during which time Jobcentre Plus will have provided only modest support.</p>

<a name="91019-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="09101937000070"></a>The distinction between former incapacity benefit recipients who are transferred on to JSA, rather than on to the work-capable component of the employment and support allowance, also looks somewhat artificial. They are likely to need rather similar forms of support; yet under the current Flexible New Deal structure one set will go to providers, while the other will have very limited support, apart from a minority who will transfer to the planned Invest to Save pilots. Surely a sensible approach would be to consolidate the support for these groups, not least to obtain the benefits of scale and, indeed, to involve the specialists&#151;particularly in the third sector&#151;on the basis of the price differentiation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="09101937000071"></a>Finally, on this side of the House we are concerned that the programmes to support the 18 to 24 year-old age group may divert these youngsters from providers into various make-work activities. A better option would be to give this group to a provider base which is motivated to ensure that the next steps that the youngsters take genuinely add to their future employability. These are some of the reasons that we have developed a policy to help all these groups and introduce what we are calling the work programme as soon as possible. That way we will be able to get the hardest-to-help back into economic activity as we come out of the current recession, not the one after that. At the same time, many in the 18 to 24 year-old age group will have undertaken activity which will have enlarged their opportunities in life, rather than narrowed them.</p>

As noble Lords are aware, and as the noble Lord pointed out, the Flexible New Deal programme became operational in 28 of the 48 Jobcentre Plus districts on 5 October, and I welcome the chance to update the House on its progress, and to discuss the regulations that underpin it.</p>

<a name="91019-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="09101937000073"></a>The Motion was tabled on the Flexible New Deal (Miscellaneous Provisions) Order, which covers the employment status of those undertaking the Flexible New Deal. The purpose of the order is to ensure that the training allowance payments are not treated as employed earners&#146; income and that those taking part in the Flexible New Deal are not treated as being engaged in employment. It has been recognised that, without this order, people receiving training allowance would risk losing their eligibility to other benefits, grants and bursaries that are specified in the schedule to the regulations, and which may be affected by remunerative work. That is the narrow purpose of the regulations.</p>

<a name="91019-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="09101937000074"></a>Generally, people on Flexible New Deal will remain in receipt of jobseeker's allowance for the duration that they are on the programme, but will receive a training allowance when an activity or combination of activities means that they cannot be available for and actively seeking employment, which are conditions for continued entitlement to JSA. In particular, this will apply to periods of full-time work experience and work-related activity.</p>

<a name="91019-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="09101937000075"></a>It is important that we remove any barriers that might prevent long-term unemployed people from gaining the experience and skills necessary for them to find employment. This order allows jobseekers to participate in the Flexible New Deal and to develop work habits and skills, while ensuring that they retain their focus on moving off welfare and into paid employment. As noble Lords will be aware, the majority of customers will move on to Flexible New Deal only at the 12-month stage of unemployment. The people reaching this stage of a claim, therefore, will include those for whom finding work is most challenging. In

<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="09101937000076"></a>Active intervention is key for this group of people who have been away from the labour market for a period, and at no time is this more important than in a recession. We need to keep people who find themselves in long-term unemployment close to the labour market, rather than repeat the mistakes of previous recessions in which the long-term unemployed were abandoned on benefits. This is why it is right to push ahead with Flexible New Deal, building on the success of the New Deal to offer people the personalised, tailored and flexible help that they need.</p>

<a name="91019-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="09101937000077"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Kirkwood and Lord Freud, stressed the importance of self-employment. For those who wish to take advantage of self-employment support, as part of the six-month offer, we have ensured that there is a coherent and structured route to help people make the transition into work and to provide the skills, knowledge and confidence they need. It takes the form of training support, both light-touch and intensive, depending on the needs of the individual. Using the expertise of Business Link in England, Training for Work in Scotland and Flexible Support for Business in Wales, together with private and voluntary sector providers, eligible customers can access practical advice and support on how to set up a business, what works and the pitfalls to avoid. This support is available while the customer is still claiming benefit and, where necessary, can continue for up to 16 weeks in the form of mentoring support once they have started trading.</p>

<a name="91019-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="09101937000078"></a>To help overcome the recognised financial difficulties of making the transition to work, we have also introduced the self-employment credit to underpin eligible customers&#146; finances for the first few months of trading as they start to generate an income from their self-employment or business. The self-employment credit is a tax-free payment of &#163;50 a week, payable for up to 16 weeks for customers who leave JSA to take up self-employment. It is designed to give straightforward, unambiguous help to those who decide to take the step into self-employment and to encourage them to take that step.</p>

<a name="91019-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="09101937000079"></a>Providers of Flexible New Deal can choose how best to support people who are interested in self-employment. To respond to customers&#146; varying needs, they may adopt a number of different routes, including short periods of supported test-trading for some, but that would be entirely their decision. In many cases, customers prefer to move quickly off benefits and into independent trading, supported in the early stages by working tax credit where needed.</p>

<a name="91019-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="09101937000080"></a>I am also pleased to confirm that the DWP has secured additional funds to help people back to work in the recession&#151;part of the fiscal stimulus, including funds for Flexible New Deal contracts. The actual costs of Flexible New Deal contracts will not be known until later, as providers are paid for helping jobseekers into sustained jobs, so the more jobseekers they help the more they will be paid. Funding requirements are calculated on the basis of &#163;1,500 per customer starting on provision.</p>




<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_515"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column 515</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91019-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="09101937000081"></a>The current New Deals have served unemployed people well over the past decade&#151;I think there is testament of that in the noble Lord&#146;s report of 2007, but I will not cite the particular reference&#151;and we need to learn from them and adapt. Successful though the New Deals have been, we expect Flexible New Deal to move even more people into sustained employment and to offer appropriate, tailored support for every customer referred. That will put us in a strong position to cope with the long-term unemployment that the recession has caused and will also better place us to address long-term unemployment in the decade to come.</p>

<a name="91019-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="09101937000082"></a>Demand for this programme will clearly be greater than that envisaged in July 2008 when the invitation to tender was first published. We have worked with providers to ensure that this additional demand is reflected in contracts. The contracts signed with the providers allow for the increased investment necessary for the providers to cope with increased customer volumes, with funding split 40 per cent in service fee payments, 40 per cent short job outcome payments and 20 per cent sustained job outcome payments. After 18 months we expect to revert to the default funding model for the Flexible New Deal&#151;a 20 per cent service fee, 50 per cent short job outcome payment and 30 per cent sustained job outcome payment. Contracts retain a strong element of outcome-based payment, which will encourage providers to move customers into employment.</p>

<a name="91019-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="09101937000083"></a>Furthermore we have made provision to ensure that, after 52 weeks, customers can voluntarily extend their mandatory Flexible New Deal programme by up to six months&#151;a point which may address in part the concern of the noble Lord, Lord Freud&#151;if their provider and Jobcentre Plus agree that this is appropriate. That will occur in situations where Jobcentre Plus believes there is a clear value in the customer continuing to work with the supplier and the supplier can demonstrate that with a revised action plan. That may benefit those customers who are good prospects for employment, but who have been held back by a lack of jobs in their area, as they will be able to retain support from their provider further into the economic recovery.</p>

<a name="91019-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="09101937000084"></a>As I said, the Flexible New Deal has now gone live in all of the 28 phase 1 districts. The noble Lord asked whether there is anything else apart from phase 1 and phase 2 and the pilots relating to the personalised employment plans. The answer is no; that should encompass the whole of the JSA regime. In the remaining 18 districts we announced the invitation to tender on 12 October, which is an important stepping stone to achieving full UK delivery around this time next year.</p>

<a name="91019-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="09101937000085"></a>The Flexible New Deal is a key step forward in our programme of welfare reform, which we will be taking further in the White Paper due to be published later this year, something I am sure we will all discuss at a later date.</p>

<a name="91019-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="09101937000086"></a>I shall now deal with some specific points. On the desire of the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, for a consolidated measure, one recognises that consolidation would be helpful but we should not confuse lack of consolidation with the assumption that the changes to  


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_516"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column 516</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the system are piecemeal. They may be piecemeal to a certain extent in the legislative anchor but not in terms of concept and how they are constructed.</p>

<a name="91019-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="09101937000087"></a>The noble Lord asked about training payments and whether the reference in the regulations was new from that point of view. It is not. I can write to him with reference to similar provisions if that would help.</p>

<a name="91019-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="09101937000088"></a>In terms of provider volumes, in July 2008 we indicated that initial estimates of customers would be 773,000 referrals over the five years of the contract. In February 2009, providers were notified that they would be given the opportunity to reassess their proposal to enable us to consider jointly the impact of increases in customer referral volumes, possibly up to 300 per cent higher than those published in the ITT. However, as the noble Lords, Lord Kirkwood and Lord Freud, have recognised, since then estimates of volumes have come down. The latest estimate in September was 1.47 million referrals over the five years of the contract. So even though there have been changes in the interim, the number is still twice that given to the original invitation to tender.</p>

<a name="91019-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="09101937000089"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, asked about self-employment evaluation within the Flexible New Deal. A key element of the evaluation is to establish the immediate and longer term destinations of customers following their participation in the Flexible New Deal. Therefore, customer employment destinations will be tracked upon completion of each stage of the programme and a year later, and this will of course include self-employment destinations.</p>

<a name="91019-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="09101937000090"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, asked about &#147;creaming&#148; and &#147;parking&#148; to seek to ensure that everyone is properly catered for under these contracts. We expect our providers to use their skills to achieve the maximum number of outcomes for our unemployed providers. This will require them to make judgments on each individual customer on what support to apply and when to maximise their chances of securing sustained employment. Consequently, we are focusing on the design of our contracts, payment systems and performance management systems to reward providers for their achievements. It should be remembered that the people referred to our providers are those who already have been unemployed for 12 months. It is unacceptable simply to leave unemployed people with no support whatever. Providers are required to provide a minimum level of support to all Jobcentre Plus customers referred to them. We do not specify the process for dealing with our different customer groups beyond the minimum necessary to ensure that they are available for work. Providers are expected to use their skills, knowledge and expertise to achieve positive outcomes for all their customers. Our contract management processes are designed to ensure that contractors meet the quality and delivery standards set out in the contract specification for all of those they deal with. In addition, external inspection, by Ofsted in England and Estyn in Wales, and validation will ensure the quality and accuracy of their activities.</p>

<a name="91019-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="09101937000091"></a>The noble Baroness asked about niche providers. The smaller and third sector organisations which deliver support for the hardest-to-help and specialist groups play a valuable role in welfare provision and are well   


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_517"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column 517</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>placed to offer services because of their local experience and knowledge of what the community needs. Under the commissioning strategy principles, prime contractors will be expected to ensure that DWP provision is joined up with local partnership arrangements. They will be expected to work proactively with smaller specialist providers.</p>

<a name="91019-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="09101937000092"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, asked about guidance for these regulations. Guidance is in place in Jobcentre Plus to ensure that those placed in training or work experience by a contractor will be transferred smoothly between jobseeker&#146;s allowance and the training allowances and back again. Similarly, the contractors are aware of this change.</p>

<a name="91019-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="09101937000093"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, asked about operational issues. Jobcentre Plus has recruited some 15,000 extra staff since the recession began at the end of September 2008. Once the official statistics for headcount are published, it will confirm that Jobcentre Plus has achieved its plan to reach 82,000 full-time equivalents by the end of September 2009 with a planned rise to 85,000 by March 2010. Perhaps I may emphasise the size of the challenge by saying that the jobseeker&#146;s allowance claimant count nearly double from around 800,000 in April 2008 to around 1.63 million in September 2009. Currently, we receive more than 85,000 calls every working day in contact centres and nearly 150,000 in benefit processing centres. JSA claims are being cleared in around 10 days, ahead of the target of eleven and a half days.</p>

<a name="91019-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="09101937000094"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, also asked about what the Budget means for Jobcentre Plus workloads. Budget 09 announced an additional &#163;2.8 billion for the DWP, which ensures that over the next two years we can create the capacity to maintain and expand our support to jobseekers through the economic downturn and continue with our programme of welfare reform. But I stress that that money is part of the fiscal stimulus and that those who oppose the fiscal stimulus and would not be prepared to carry it forward given the chance could not deliver on the programmes that are in place.</p>

<a name="91019-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="09101937000095"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Freud, gave us a snapshot of his party&#146;s policies on these matters. He referred to what happened to Flexible New Deal customers who at the end of 12 months go back on to JSA. That would be the norm, although I indicated the possibility of a six-month extension. On the timing, 12 months on from the just-introduced phase one takes us to this time next year. If it is the noble Lord&#146;s assessment that we will be in the depths of recession, that is an interesting economic analysis.</p>

<a name="91019-0012.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="09101937000096"></a>I am sure that we will have time to debate the noble Lord&#146;s proposals in more detail. I do not believe that they provide an analytical basis for reducing the time that claimants spend on JSA before being referred for specialist support. They give no evidence that the definition of sustainable employment placements, the provider target, should be increased from 26 weeks to a year. Although the noble Lord advocated differential pricing for provider support to avoid a provider premium, we heard no detail of how customers will be classified, priced, or who will do it. Indeed, they provide no  


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_518"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column 518</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>analytical basis for increasing the time period in which providers can engage with jobseekers. The proposals argue that provider funding should be purely outcome-based to minimise risk to government and enhance provider incentives. However, there is no suggestion about where the interim finance to fund providers should come.</p>

<a name="91019-0012.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="09101937000097"></a>There are other more detailed points, which I am sure that we shall have the chance to debate, but I return to the point that unless the noble Lord&#146;s party changes its view on the fiscal stimulus, should it ever have the opportunity to be in power, it could not possibly deliver even on his aspirations. That would undercut a whole raft of programmes protecting people from being unemployed for longer.</p>

<a name="91019-0012.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="09101937000098"></a>I hope that I have covered the points raised. Perhaps I may conclude my remarks by saying that the introduction of the Flexible New Deal will greatly benefit people who are long-term unemployed, giving them access to a level of individual and tailored support that was not previously available. I am grateful to the House for noting the order and providing the opportunity for the benefits of the Flexible New Deal to be clarified.</p>

<a name="09101937000104"></a><b><a name="91019-0013.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09101937000208"></a>Baroness Walmsley:</b> My Lords, I shall speak also to Amendments 286, 288, 288AA, 289 and 290. This group of amendments relates to the clauses about complaints against schools. We on these Benches share the Government&#146;s position that wherever possible complaints should be dealt with quickly and effectively at the school level. Such a process should be simple and as non-adversarial as possible. The focus should be on a quick resolution rather than a drawn out bureaucratic process in line with other statutory complaint processes for children. We therefore welcome the provisions that allow for parents and pupils to pursue complaints against a school and, if necessary, refer the matter to the local commissioner. This is significant progress towards implementing Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in the education system; that is, the right for children to have their views heard.</p>

<a name="91019-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="09101937000105"></a>While we on these Benches believe that it is important that parents and pupils who have a genuine complaint against a school have appropriate channels for obtaining satisfaction, we have considerable reservations about the system proposed by the Government. We do not want this to be a moaners&#146; charter or something that takes up a lot of the time of head teachers of good schools. We have therefore laid Amendment 283B, the effect of which is to prevent the local commissioner substituting his judgment for that of the head teacher unless it relates to a function prescribed in regulations. We would really like to know what is meant by a &#147;prescribed function&#148; and what sort of function it is. It is important that the new system should not be used by very determined parents to have one more try to get what they want. There has been some experience among appeals panels relating to exclusions and admissions that every tier of possible complaint will bring in an additional batch of such complaints.</p>

<a name="91019-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="09101937000106"></a>We need to avoid the danger of the head&#146;s ability to maintain good order and discipline being undermined. It is a matter of balance and reasonableness, which I accept is difficult to legislate for, but the test of reasonableness must apply. In other words, the local commissioner should be able to substitute his judgment only if the school&#146;s decision or behaviour was unreasonable by the commonly held standards of the profession.</p>

<a name="91019-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="09101937000107"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, has tabled Amendments 284 and 285, about which we have some concerns. In these amendments, the local commissioner would be prevented from considering complaints about behaviour, the enforcement of school rules, or fixed-term exclusions. While we normally uphold the principle that the judgment of the head teacher should operate in these matters, it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that the head teacher might behave unreasonably in these matters. The noble Baroness&#146;s amendments would therefore weaken the right of redress and take away the flexibility of the local commissioner, so we do not support them.</p>

<a name="91019-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="09101937000108"></a>Amendment 286 seeks to include academies in the arrangements for complaints to be heard. It seems wrong, especially as the number of academies grows, that children attending such schools should not have recourse to the local commissioner in the same way as their neighbours do. Why have academies been excluded, and what recourse do parents of academy pupils have if they have a serious complaint against the school?</p>

<a name="91019-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="09101937000109"></a>We will not move Amendment 288, in the light of the Government&#146;s Amendment 288ZA about vexatious complaints, which we welcome.</p>

<a name="91019-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="09101937000110"></a>In Amendment 288AA, we address the right of the commissioner in certain circumstances, to be prescribed in future regulations, to extend the hearing of complaints to former pupils. The amendment would restrict this to circumstances in which it is in the public interest to do so. We are concerned that parents who have exercised their right to remove a child may retain an indefinite right to make complaints against their child&#146;s former school. Some situations just cannot be resolved to everyone&#146;s satisfaction, and we cannot have this sort of thing hanging over the heads of schools indefinitely, so will the Minister indicate what will be in the regulations?</p>

<a name="91019-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="09101937000111"></a>Our Amendment 289 would ensure that when a parent refers a complaint to the local commissioner, he must allow the child the opportunity to comment on the matter. We cannot know about children&#146;s experiences or hope to secure their best interests without asking them their views and listening to their perspectives. The amendment would ensure that, where children want to participate, the local commissioner will hear them and use their views to inform both the conduct of the investigation and the forming of their judgments. It would be an essential safeguard to ensure that children have the opportunity to remain engaged rather than risk becoming excluded throughout the local commissioner&#146;s investigation. The amendment would not force a child to speak to the local commissioner where the child feels uncomfortable or chooses not to express an opinion. However, it would place a duty on the local commissioner to ask them whether they would like to contribute to the investigation.</p>

<a name="91019-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="09101937000112"></a>Amendment 290 would place a duty on the local commissioner to ensure the provision of an advocate to children and young people who make complaints about a school if they so wish. An advocate is an independent person who assists a young person to make his or her voice heard. Independent advocates have operated in children&#146;s social care services since the late 1980s, following revelations of abuse and mistreatment in children&#146;s homes. There is growing

Advocates can demystify the process, raise the child&#146;s understanding of the consequences of their view, help the child to express himself and support local resolutions through processes of arbitration and conciliation. Advocacy can be particularly helpful for disabled children, who face particular barriers to having their voice heard. As Sir William Utting put it in <I>People Like Us: </I><I>t</I><I>he Report </I><I>o</I><I>f </I><I>t</I><I>he Review </I><I>o</I><I>f </I><I>t</I><I>he Safeguards </I><I>f</I><I>or Children</I><I></I><I>Living Away </I><I>f</I><I>rom Home</I>:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a><a name="09101937000164"></a>&#147;Children sometimes need someone with whom they can talk through a problem before deciding how best to deal with it&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09101937000149"></a>Those are wise words. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_194"></a>
<a name="09101937000113"></a><b><a name="91019-0013.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09101937000209"></a>Baroness Verma:</b> My Lords, we are broadly in favour of these clauses and the role which they give the local commissioner. I think most would agree that it is very important to empower parents with due knowledge, understanding and control over what happens to their children at school. We should also acknowledge that it is useful, indeed necessary, to have some fixed process by which complaints can be made and addressed. At the moment, complaints which cannot be satisfied by the governing body of a school go directly to the Secretary of State, which is impractical and unnecessary.</p>

<a name="91019-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="09101937000114"></a>Nevertheless, as we have made clear time and time again, it is crucial that the rights and hard work of teachers are not dismissed. Any complaints system, by its very nature, is bound to be messy. This is even more true of a system which will come into force only when the complaint has risen above the level of the school&#146;s governing body. Many factors have to be taken into account and the decision will not always be easy, nor will it always seem fair.</p>

<a name="91019-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="09101937000115"></a>It is therefore important to begin with a system which seems to strike the right balance between the rights of the parents, the rights of the pupil and the rights of the teachers. Teachers must be allowed to exert their authority and should have the power to enforce school rules without constant second-guessing. We on these Benches think it is crucial that our teachers are afforded the professional respect they deserve. To this end, we have tabled Amendment 285, which would mean that any decision taken to enforce the published school rules cannot be taken to the local commissioner and waste his valuable time.</p>

<a name="91019-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="09101937000116"></a>The school rules are there for all to see and, within the context of the school, surely it is right that teachers should be able to take proportionate action to enforce them. Does the Minister accept that we must trust the professionalism and expertise of our teachers to be able to do this? It may be that there are specific instances where a bad decision is made and action needs to be taken by parents. But in those circumstances, is the Minister saying that the only way of taking these specific complaints forward would be through the local commissioner?</p>

<a name="91019-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="09101937000117"></a>Our concern is that without narrowing the remit of complaints, teachers will not be able to impose the discipline which they need in order to get on with their main job of teaching. We accept that there is a balance to be found. Parents and pupils should have the right to complain against improper actions, but teachers  


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_522"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column 522</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>must be allowed to impose discipline. We are concerned that without the proviso of being able to enforce the school rules, the Government are attempting to legislate against the professionalism of the many because of the impropriety of a few. Is existing legislation in place to deal with those who abuse the powers given to them to enforce the school rules? For the rest, does she agree that we should extend professional trust to teachers?</p>

<a name="91019-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="09101937000118"></a>In this vein, we have also tabled Amendment 287, which asks that the local commissioner must be satisfied that the complaint is not vexatious before investigating a complaint. We are therefore delighted that the Government have decided to concede this point and include these important words in the Bill. I should like to thank the Bill team for their hard work and effort which saw them coming to see our side of the argument. The National Union of Teachers cited this as a key concern and so welcomes its inclusion in the Bill.</p>

<a name="91019-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="09101937000119"></a>We have tabled Amendment 288C in order to probe the power of the local commissioner to disapply the time limit. Can the Minister give us any examples of when this might be necessary? Furthermore, does this power mean that all records will have to be kept indefinitely just in case the time limit is to be disapplied and a very old complaint reopened? In employment cases&#151;the Minister may correct me if I am wrong&#151;the limit is three minutes&#151;I mean, three months. That is the red wine speaking. Does the Minister feel that a different structure should be in place for school complaints?</p>

<a name="91019-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="09101937000120"></a>We have also tabled Amendment 284, which would restrict further what complaints can go to the local government commissioner. Appeals panels, which hear cases regarding permanent exclusions, already exist. These can overrule decisions made by teachers and do so in a quarter of cases. Half of those pupils are returned to the same school from which they were excluded. That is no way to encourage discipline or to support teachers in their difficult task of securing discipline before they even begin to teach. I should like also to declare my support for Amendment 283B, which was tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. It would be very useful to have appropriate regulations and guidance on these matters in order to ensure clarity for all concerned.</p>

<a name="91019-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="09101937000121"></a>We should be clear that, on the whole, we support the measures in these clauses. Nevertheless, key changes should be made and therefore key questions must be asked in order to make sure that the complaints procedure is effective and, more important, that it achieves the correct balance between the right of parents and pupils to complain and the duty of teachers to be able to enforce discipline without constantly having their professional behaviour called into disrepute.</p>

I am very concerned about the high proportion of appeals which are allowed. The Minister can no doubt remember her school days, which are a good deal closer to her than mine are to me, but I have taught since then. When other pupils see a pupil who has rendered their lessons difficult if  


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_523"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column 523</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not impossible to follow because the staff cannot control him or her so their behaviour disrupts the lessons, and they see the same person come back in triumph some days later against the wishes of the teacher, the effect is very poor. It undermines entirely the authority of the teacher and restores the interruptions to the education of the other children. The situation is what it was before.</p>

<p><a name="st_196"></a>
<a name="09101937000123"></a><b><a name="91019-0013.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09101937000211"></a>Lord Lucas:</b> I want to support for the most part my noble friend&#146;s amendments. On Amendment 285, concerning the published rules of the school, it is important that any arrangement upholds the school rules, but I do not think it is necessarily fair that a pupil has to be bound by rules that are introduced after they have joined the school. Changes to the dress code in particular may be imposed arbitrarily by the head of the school after a pupil has made the decision to join so that he or she is faced with no choice but to obey that rule. It is reasonable under those circumstances that the right of appeal can be exercised against it because that pupil did not have the choice of avoiding it by going to a different school. I would put a time limit on this and say that school rules cannot be appealed against if they were in force when the pupil applied to join the school, when it would have been the decision of the pupil or his or her parents to accept them.</p>

<a name="91019-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="09101937000124"></a>With regard to discipline, again it is important that this mechanism should not be able to reopen disciplinary decisions. I would not go along with the exact wording of my noble friend&#146;s Amendment 284 where it states &#147;relating to&#148; because these problems often involve some kind of disciplinary procedure, although often the nub of the problem is elsewhere, such as the failure of the school to deal, for example, with bullying or recognise a special educational need. So I support the spirit of the amendment, but not the exact wording.</p>

<a name="91019-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="09101937000125"></a>As the Minister is the person to whom these complaints are sent, can she tell us what the two or three most frequent reasons for complaint are?</p>

<p><a name="st_197"></a>
<a name="09101937000126"></a><b><a name="91019-0013.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09101937000212"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin:</b> I am interested in the noble Lord&#146;s question because I asked it myself. These complaints go to the Secretary of State so I do not see them. I thought I had the answer here, so by the time I reach the end of my remarks, I may be able to help. I will do my best to deal with the points that have been raised.</p>

<a name="91019-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="09101937000127"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Elton, mentioned the effect on the authority of the teacher if a pupil complaint is upheld. The local government officer will uphold the decision only if the school has already acted reasonably. I am sorry, it is not the red wine in my case, but perhaps I am in need of a cup of coffee. I apologise to the Committee. The LGO will uphold the complaint only if the school has acted unreasonably. We cannot accept a situation where a pupil has no right of redress when a school has acted unreasonably. However, we all expect that schools will act reasonably 99.9 per cent of the time. I have attempted an explanation but I am sure noble Lord will come back to me. He is already.</p>

I cannot do so at the moment&#151;I shall have to write to him&#151;but I know that information is available.</p>

<a name="91019-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="09101937000130"></a>In setting up the independent complaints service we want to make sure that parents and pupils whose complaints have not been dealt with fairly and properly have an effective route to seek redress. At the same time, we are committed to ensuring that this service will not undermine the authority of schools or place any additional burdens on them. It is a delicate balance to strike.</p>

<a name="91019-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="09101937000131"></a>I am delighted that noble Lords have responded positively to our amendments on vexatious complaints. We do not want to encourage vexatious complaints, about which teaching unions have been concerned, and I am glad that we can be accommodating on that issue.</p>

<a name="91019-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="09101937000132"></a>As to whether or not a school&#146;s authority may be undermined, which is the spirit behind Amendments 284 and 285, I emphasise again that what we are doing will not undermine a school&#146;s authority. Schools will continue to agree their own behaviour policies and rules, which is absolutely right. They are the best bodies to do this and nothing we are doing will prevent them doing so. However, the service has to be able to consider complaints which relate to school rules. Not all schools apply their rules as they necessarily intended and surely pupils should have some route of redress in those areas. But where those rules and their implementation are reasonable and lawful, as the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, would expect, there would be no expectation that they should be changed. The noble Baroness can be reassured about that. This is not about asking good schools to do anything that they are not already doing; it is about asking all schools to continue to strive to improve, to learn lessons where issues have led to formal complaints, and to go forward in the way we expect.</p>

<a name="91019-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="09101937000133"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, asked about the prescribed functions of the head teacher. We will outline in regulations the functions of the head teacher, including their functions in relation to discipline. The functions for which a head teacher may be the subject of a complaint will be set out in regulations under Clause 199(2). I can reassure noble Lords that before we make these regulations, as you would expect, we will consult with stakeholders&#151;including, importantly, teacher unions and parent representative bodies&#151;on what might be included.</p>

<a name="91019-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="09101937000134"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, was concerned as to whether academies should be included in the service. Order-making powers under Clause 215 will allow us to bring academies into the service in the future. However, there are good reasons for deciding not to include them in the first place. They are schools facing significant issues, and many schools face challenging circumstances. Academies are often the solution for those longstanding problems in disadvantaged areas, and this represents a huge challenge for academy leadership. It would not be helpful to add to this by asking academies to help us to iron out the processes and structures of the service in these early stages, given that academies already have robust complaint procedures through the independent school standards regulations.</p>




<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_525"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column 525</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="09101937000135"></a>If parents are not satisfied with the response to their complaint, it is heard by a panel that must include one person who is independent of the management and running of the school. There are processes there to offer safeguards to those wishing to complain in the context of an academy.</p>

<a name="91019-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="09101937000136"></a>On the question of disapplying normal conditions for the hearing of complaints, with regard to Amendment 288C, the local commissioner has some discretion to hear complaints if they are not made in writing or within the normal 12-month period. Sadly, not all parents are literate and there may be situations due to illness or incapacity where meeting the 12-month deadline might not be possible. I reassure noble Lords that the intention here is not to open the door for long-gone pupils to resurrect grievances from their school days. The testing phase will consider the circumstances when the commissioner might need to use that discretion. Again, we will work with teaching unions and others to ensure that we are all clear on the criteria that the service might use.</p>

<a name="91019-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="09101937000137"></a>On Amendment 288AA, I hope I can reassure noble Lords that the intention behind Clause 200(6) is to give some limited flexibility. It is conceivable that a pupil may have a valid complaint about a school&#146;s handling of their exam results but would be prevented from complaining because they have since left. We will need to continue consulting with stakeholders and will of course draw on the findings of the testing phase. None the less, I am sure that Parliament, in the shape of the Committee, will have an opportunity to scrutinise these as regulations too.</p>

<a name="91019-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="09101937000138"></a>On Amendments 289 and 290, regarding the involvement of pupils, let us remember that this is a service for pupils as well as for parents. I reassure noble Lords that, as a matter of course, the service will involve pupils if it feels that they are of an age and understanding to be able to voice their opinion. I assure noble Lords that there is nothing in the Bill that restricts the use of an advocate where the service feels it appropriate; for example, in the scenarios that the noble Baroness mentioned, such as for a child with disabilities. It is important to note, though, that advocacy may not be appropriate in every single case.

Would it be possible to introduce a convention or guidance that stipulates that, where a case involves rules in a school which have been agreed and contributed to by the pupils, there should be a presumption in favour of the enforcement of those rules rather more strongly on other occasions? That is something to think about. I have seen the difference that it makes. I assure the Minister that anything we can do to encourage the practice will be fruitful.</p>

I am advised that they are: SEN provision not being fulfilled&#151;no surprise there, I am sure&#151;about which there are approximately 900 complaints per year; pupils being bullied by other pupils, at approximately 120 complaints per year; and fixed-term exclusions not being applied fairly, which again is no surprise, at approximately 200 complaints per year.</p>

We are proposing these amendments on behalf of the Special Education Consortium and the National Deaf Children&#146;s Society. Schools that get a good or excellent rating from Ofsted may have their normal Ofsted inspection put off for at least a year and have a &#147;quick check&#148; or a &#147;health check&#148;. These two bodies are very anxious to ensure that schools do not get the health check without their special needs facilities being inspected by somebody who is qualified to inspect them. There is some evidence to show that schools that have been rated &#147;good&#148; or &#147;excellent&#148; sometimes have facilities for children with special educational needs that are not up to scratch, and they are very anxious to ensure that those schools are not given special treatment and allowed to put off their inspection without the authorities being absolutely clear that they are serving the more disadvantaged pupils and making sure that facilities for those pupils are up to scratch.

We have heard many learned and erudite speeches and debates on the topic. The Government have also taken many amendments on provision for special educational needs or disabled people away to have a think and, one hopes, to come back on Report with something structured and workable. We want to ensure that no one is allowed to fall through the gaps or be left out in the cold. Bearing that in mind, I hope that the Minister will consider Amendment 291 very carefully.</p>

First, the new school inspection arrangements, with their strengthened focus on pupils with special educational needs and disabilities, are being implemented in schools across the country, starting this term. Secondly, the Lamb inquiry has, at the request of the Secretary of State, published an interim  


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_529"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column 529</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>report addressing the specific issue of whether legislative measures are necessary to strengthen these arrangements in respect of pupils with special educational needs and disabilities. That report welcomed the new framework, but recommended that it should be underpinned by a duty on Ofsted to report on special educational needs and disabilities as part of school inspection. The Government have accepted this, and are committed to bringing forward this measure at the earliest opportunity. These developments provide an important context for considering this amendment.</p>

<a name="91019-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="09101944000013"></a>The noble Baroness rightly focuses on training of inspectors, an issue which Brian Lamb also considered in his August report. He recommended that training arrangements should indeed be strengthened, but did not conclude that legislation was needed to achieve this. We agree with that position, although we warmly support the noble Baroness&#146;s view on the importance of the training.</p>

<a name="91019-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="09101944000014"></a>Inspectors&#146; expertise is routinely updated through a wide-ranging programme of professional development that regularly involves special educational needs and disability, while Ofsted is further enhancing its training arrangements so that school inspectors are provided with training on this important matter annually. It will respond formally following the publication of the final report of the Lamb inquiry, which is expected shortly.</p>

<a name="91019-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="09101944000015"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, asked whether an interim statement should be issued where pupils with special educational needs and disabilities are judged not to be learning and progressing as well as pupils more generally. I believe that I can reassure the noble Baroness on this important matter. Under Ofsted&#146;s new arrangements, a school will only be eligible for an interim statement&#151;and a longer interval between inspections&#151;where its previous inspection report shows the learning and progress of pupils with special educational needs and disabilities to be either &#147;good&#148; or &#147;outstanding&#148;. Any school which is &#147;satisfactory&#148; or &#147;inadequate&#148; in that respect will continue to be inspected within a three-year period. I hope that we cannot have a situation where a school might be assessed as generally good but where the SEN portion of that school would be only satisfactory. This provision would not allow it to have a longer period, so I hope that we have reassured your Lordships in that respect.</p>

<a name="91019-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="09101944000016"></a>On Amendment 292, proposing that academies should also receive the report, local authorities have no responsibilities in respect of academies so it would be inappropriate to impose a legal obligation for an academy&#146;s reports to be sent to the local authority. However, I can reassure the noble Baroness that because each academy must have at least one local authority representative on its governing body, and the reports will be placed in the public domain, local authorities will have access to those reports. In the light of these reassurances, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel capable of withdrawing the amendment.</p>

This section of the Bill expands the powers to search that are laid out in the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006. It specifies a further list of items that can be searched for in a school or further education college. That list comprises alcohol, illegal drugs and property suspected of being stolen.</p>

<a name="91019-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="09101944000019"></a>Our Amendments 295 and 303, and Amendment 297, tabled in the name of my noble friend Lord Lucas, call into question the validity of having a very specific list of items for which these search powers can be used. We argue instead that teachers should be able to use the powers to search for anything that is against the published school or college rules. Surely every school has a set of rules; as long as they are published and easily accessible, there seems little excuse for pupils not to be aware of them. Taking that into account, does the Minister not agree that teachers should have the power to enforce those rules in order to maintain discipline in the classroom, and so be able to concentrate more fully on teaching?</p>

<a name="91019-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="09101944000020"></a>It may be that the item causing disruption is not on the list in the Bill, and may not be dangerous. However, it may be something that is against the school rules and causing disruption or disturbance to the point of having a detrimental effect on teaching. The examples that spring to mind may be things like pornography, or something merely disruptive such as the latest craze of new toy.</p>

<a name="91019-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="09101944000021"></a>The first reason for the amendment, therefore, is that we want to allow the maximum possible scope for teachers to be able to use their discretion to enforce discipline and create an environment suitable for teaching and learning. The second reason is one that we have brought up time and again: we must trust the professionalism of our teachers to use these powers. I am not saying that we feel that there should be a free power of search without consent for any item at all but, if there is a school rule that bans an item, then it is surely right to trust the teacher to search for it. Otherwise, what is the strength behind such rules? Pupils will know that their rights help to protect them against even having to obey the rules. What sort of an environment does this create in the classroom?</p>

<a name="91019-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="09101944000022"></a>Our Amendments 293 and 296 offer a slightly different approach. They expand the search powers to include any item that could be constituted as risking imminent harm to the pupil or any other person. These amendments have been suggested by the National Union of Teachers and, on Amendment 296, we have also been given the support of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. We have tabled these amendments as another option for defining when the powers of search without consent can be used. We feel that teachers should be able to exercise their own judgment about when they feel that it is advisable to search a pupil and, here, we suggest that this would be when the item in question poses a threat of imminent harm.</p>

<a name="91019-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="09101944000023"></a>The Minister may say that this power is too flexible and vague. Well, yes, it is flexible, because we feel that we should be able to trust to the professional discretion of the teacher to know when the powers can be used. As for &#147;too vague&#148;, it would be perfectly possible to provide guidance and information about what can and cannot be searched for. This does not, however, have to be laid down in primary legislation. Such guidance may not cover every instance, but surely it would be more appropriate than an inflexible list of prohibitions, which would prevent teachers searching for something they consider to be a risk of imminent harm. Teachers would not have to be left unguided, but they could be left to use their own judgment.</p>

<a name="91019-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="09101944000024"></a>I extend my thanks to the Minister and her Bill team for all the effort that they have put in to listening to our concerns over this matter. We welcome the fact that they have attempted to answer our worries by tabling a group of amendments that allow the list of items that can be searched for to be extended by regulation, but we feel that this does not go far enough. It does indeed increase the flexibility of the list, but unfortunately does not answer the main principle of our concern, which is that we should trust the professionalism of teachers. Any power to search should reflect this, and teachers&#146; responsibility for the health, safety and welfare of pupils under their supervision and care.</p>

<a name="91019-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="09101944000025"></a>Our Amendment 294 would ensure that CCTV footage may be used by members of staff to ascertain whether there are reasonable grounds to use the search powers. I am assured that the Minister may be able to give us the reassurances that we need on this count, and I look forward to her reply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="09101944000026"></a>A second issue, which has also been raised by the National Union of Teachers, regards who should have to prove that the use of the powers of confiscation was lawful. We have tabled Amendment 305 because, currently, the burden of proof as to whether a confiscation is lawful or not lies with the teacher and not the pupil. Amendment 305 would alter the Education and Inspections Act 2006 so that a person who &#147;seizes, retains or disposes&#148; is assumed to have been acting lawfully until it is proved otherwise. The National Union of Teachers is concerned that, if the burden of proof is on the teacher to prove himself or herself innocent, they will be unwilling to use these disciplinary powers. This may have the knock-on effect of reducing discipline in schools still further, and taking away from valuable teaching time. It is crucial to an effective school that teachers are able promptly to search pupils for forbidden items without fear of legal investigations.</p>

<a name="91019-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="09101944000027"></a>In another place, the Human Rights Act was cited as a reason for the burden of proof being laid at the door of the teacher. Seizing, retaining and disposing of a pupil&#146;s property, it was suggested, is an infringement of that pupil&#146;s rights. Therefore, it was said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a><a name="09101944000105"></a>&#147;Members would agree that there must remain an overriding obligation on school staff to act lawfully and reasonably&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill Committee, 26/03/09; col. 847.]</p>

<p><a name="09101944000096"></a>This is obvious. Everyone is in agreement that confiscations should be lawful; the issue at dispute is on whom the burden of proof should rest. According to the National Union of Teachers, it is clear that,</p>
<ul><a name="09101944000134"></a>&#147;the law should not assume that teachers who confiscate have done wrong until they prove that they have not&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09101944000097"></a>I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response on that.</p>

<a name="91019-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="09101944000028"></a>I would also be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s response to the amendments tabled by my noble friend Lord Lucas, particularly relating to the fact that a person who seizes controlled drugs or stolen articles should have a direct and clear choice about whether these should be handed to a police officer or be disposed of. Amendment 302C would allow teachers clear discretion; items may be handed over to the police but do not have to be. It seems to me that there are important considerations to be taken into account here. Do the police need to be involved in every incident of this kind at a school? Is this the best use of their time? I await the Minister&#146;s words about that amendment and about the Minister&#146;s own amendments on this.</p>

<a name="91019-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="09101944000029"></a>Many of the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, in this group address teacher training with regard to being able to carry out effective and legal searches. I can see the reasoning behind these amendments. They may mean that teachers feel better equipped to carry out searches and that parents feel reassured that teachers are operating firmly within the legal guidelines. It would certainly be useful, for example, to have a clear idea of what was meant by each of the other items on the Government&#146;s list. Nevertheless, the National Union of Teachers has expressed to us concerns that this undermines the principle that teachers can be trusted to use their own judgment in these matters. The legislation should be there to protect teachers who exercise their authority to discipline pupils, not to make them use these powers in a different way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="09101944000030"></a>I anticipate a healthy debate on these matters. I look forward to hearing all contributions and the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

<a name="09101944000031"></a><b><a name="91019-0014.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09101944000154"></a>Baroness Walmsley:</b> My Lords, I rise to speak to Amendments 297ZA, 300, 301, 302 and 303ZA, in my name. The issue of searching children and their property is a difficult one. The Government insist that Sir Alan Steer recommended the extension of the existing powers. However, I recall the Minister telling us in this House when those powers were first introduced that no further powers would be sought until Sir Alan had reviewed the operation of the existing powers and published a report. I do not recall seeing such a report and I do not believe that a private report to the Government is good enough. However, we have to deal with what the Government are proposing today, wherever it came from, and it has to be admitted that they have already made some sensible concessions.</p>

<a name="91019-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="09101944000032"></a>My concerns expressed in Amendment 297ZA relate to the safety of the teacher where he or she is doing a search without consent. The pupils may be objecting violently, so it is important for both the teacher&#146;s sake and the pupil that the teacher has appropriate training in these situations. Anger can be defused with proper management. Attitude and body language can all add up to a situation that is either carried through without a problem or a situation that blows up into something uncontrolled.</p>

<a name="91019-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="09101944000033"></a>In addition, as my amendment says, a teacher must know what he is looking for, if we are allowing him to look for drugs; otherwise, he may not know crack from a sherbet fizz. Although some teachers may be familiar with today&#146;s drugs, I suspect that most are not. It is really important to their credibility that they know what they are doing. There will be nothing worse for a teacher&#146;s reputation in the school than being laughed at by the pupils if he confiscates something quite innocuous. Amendment 303ZA is exactly the same thing but relates, in Clause 237, to teachers in colleges of further or higher education. I would encourage teachers not to carry out such searches unless their CPD had properly equipped them to do so.</p>

<a name="91019-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="09101944000034"></a>We on these Benches wish to ensure that no teacher can be forced to carry out searches unless they are willing to do so, unless, of course, that is their job because they are a member of the school&#146;s security staff. I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s assurances in her letter of 15 June 2009, but I would like to have it from her own lips for the record. I say in parentheses how sad it is that we now have to have schools with such a thing as security staff.</p>

<a name="91019-0015.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="09101944000035"></a>The Bill places the burden of proving that a seizure, retention or disposal was lawful on the person who carries out the seizure or disposal. This is a serious disincentive to the use of the power. It means that a teacher who uses it could be the subject of legal proceedings in which he would have to prove that what he had done was lawful. Our Amendment 300 would mean that to be lawful a seizure would have to comply only with new Section 550ZC. I hope that this would protect the teacher from cases brought under the Human Rights Act and would have a similar effect to that of Conservative Amendment 305.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="09101944000036"></a>Amendments 301 and 302 would ensure that only a member of the school&#146;s security staff could seize items found during a search, even if he did not conduct the search, and that he should be able to make the decision as to how to deal with any items found. This would reduce the potential liability of ordinary teachers and put the onus on properly trained security officers to seize and dispose of items.</p>

<a name="91019-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="09101944000037"></a>On some of the amendments tabled by other noble Lords, I have a great deal of sympathy with the idea that the items should include only those that might cause imminent harm&#151;indeed, I have put my name to one of the amendments. Will the Minister consider including that criterion in the eventual regulations that specify what these items should include?</p>

<a name="91019-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="09101944000038"></a>I am afraid that I have no sympathy with the amendments about things that are against the school rules. For example, chewing gum may be against the rules, but it would be a bit over the top to use these powers to search for it. After all, this is not Singapore.</p>

<a name="91019-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="09101944000039"></a>However, for their own protection, teachers should hand over any drugs that are found to the police; otherwise, they would be open to suspicion that they wanted to keep the drugs for their own consumption. None of us would want that. If drugs are found on the premises, most schools already involve the police. That is probably the right approach&#151;while drugs are still illegal.</p>

One of the main issues should be the safety of teachers, which is why I support the emphasis of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, on training in these areas. We must not forget that, when you are using any form of physical restraint, some children will have come from homes where they would consider that that was an immediate assault on them and react to it as such, as has been found when restraint is used in juvenile offender institutions.</p>

<a name="91019-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="09101944000041"></a>The list of prohibited items is already extensive, including offensive weapons, knives, blades, drugs, alcohol and so on. The additional amendments appear to be a catch-all for anything that a school wishes to designate as harmful. That might then include things such as pornography, moral harm and so on. Who would make decisions on whether harm is moral, physical or both? They are difficult areas to decide on.</p>

<a name="91019-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="09101944000042"></a>However, all of us share the concern for the teachers themselves, many of whom are reluctant to use these powers because of the potential for litigation against them. Incidentally, I agree entirely about drugs, which must be handed to the police. However, it would not be a waste of public resources for the school to call in the police when there is a difficult issue. They clearly have the powers and training to carry out these sorts of searches. On that basis, I support the amendments that I have spoken to.</p>

It makes it much easier for me to go through them. I can see that Amendment 297 will not gain favour with the  


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_535"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column 535</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Liberal Democrats, but my general approach is that we should trust schools and teachers; we should not bind them in red tape as though they did not know how to behave. By and large, teachers and schools will conduct themselves sensibly. Any school that went in for excessive amounts of searching would soon find its discipline and morale breaking down. Such matters have to be handled sensibly and with caution. If one trusts schools, schools must also trust their pupils and, if the system of trust breaks down, one is in deep trouble.</p>

<a name="91019-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="09101944000044"></a>I am in favour of giving schools a fairly wide brief as regards the circumstances in which they can search. I believe that they will use it wisely. Hooking schools on technicalities just because we have not thought what the next problem will be and what will cause problems is foolish.</p>

<a name="91019-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="09101944000045"></a>I also agree with what my noble friend said about protecting teachers, although I have not addressed that in my amendments. It is enormously important that teachers should be presumed to be in the right and should not be presumed to be wrong when they undertake what is a difficult and tricky task of persuading a pupil to let themselves be searched. We ought to start by trusting teachers.</p>

<a name="91019-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="09101944000046"></a>In Amendment 297B, which would leave out lines 40 to 43 on page 140, I address the concept of schools&#146; security staff. I live in a cosseted world and I do not think that I have ever been into a school that employs security staff, other than perhaps a caretaker&#151;for example, members of staff whose job is nothing but security, as defined in subsection (8) of new Section 550ZB. They are not teachers who have had training, but people who are employed solely for security reasons, as if our schools are to have bouncers walking around. I do not think that, even temporarily, that is the right way for a school to deal with a difficult situation or that it is right to have that as a constant feature of a school. I accept what the noble Baroness says about training teachers to do that. This ought to be done by teachers&#151;the people with whom the pupil is familiar, someone who knows the pupil, who knows how to handle the pupil and who has been trained in such things&#151;rather than by some security apparatchik who presumably spends most of their time sitting in a dark room watching telly, waiting for that one time in three months when someone blows the whistle because they want to check whether a boy has a knife. I question the idea of confining the powers to specialist security staff.</p>

<a name="91019-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="09101944000047"></a>Amendment 302A and the subsequent amendments relate to the discretion of teachers not to call in the police. As noble Baronesses have remarked, this is a difficult area to get right and they have favoured calling in the police on every occasion. I prefer to see the school and teachers in loco parentis. There are occasions when it should be in a teacher&#146;s discretion not to place on a child&#146;s record what is an extremely difficult black mark to eradicate. To be caught in the possession of drugs means that you will never be allowed to go to the United States as a result. You are dropping the child down a deep, black hole if you get them involved in a conviction for carrying drugs when perhaps all they have done is something foolish, idiotic and teenage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="09101944000048"></a>I want to trust teachers and to give them the kind of discretion that I expect schools and head teachers in the private sector ordinarily to exercise. When I see a drugs bust and 33 kids from Winchester had up for possessing pot, I do not believe that tipping all 33 children into police cells for the night is the right way to treat them. The school is there to look after them as a parent and it must judge whether the behaviour is idiocy or serious. I agree that that is difficult.</p>

<a name="91019-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="09101944000049"></a>I shall not press the amendment but, given the opposition from noble Baronesses whose views I greatly respect, I shall think and inquire about it. However, I believe that automatically tipping children into the hands of the police because of something that happens at school is a difficult way for a school to behave towards its children. It changes the spirit of the school and it is a difficult ask of the parents to consign their children into the hands of such uncaring and thoughtless institutions.</p>

It will also allow staff to deal with less serious incidents where the involvement of the police is, as the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, explains unnecessary and where incidents require an immediate response.</p>

<a name="91019-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="09101944000051"></a>In extending the scope of the power&#151;the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, talked about school rules&#151;noble Lords have called for a power which ranges more broadly. I want to reassure noble Lords that the clause already covers most items that could fall into the category of harm that the Committee has discussed. It enables an authorised member of staff to search a pupil for any article made or adapted for use to cause injury, or intended by the person having it with him to be used to cause injury. Alcohol and illegal drugs are potentially harmful to learners and disruptive to school or college life, both of which will be specified for the first time under the new search powers. These, together with the power to search for stolen items, are things that schools have told us&#151;and, yes, Alan Steer has reported&#151;they would be most likely to need to search for. We have strong reservations about introducing a broader search power either through the definition of harm or the published school rules of the institution. It is vital to remember that searching without consent is a serious infringement of the right to privacy under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and is justifiable only under the specific terms set out in that article.</p>

<a name="91019-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="09101944000052"></a>We must ensure that the powers that enable those searches to take place also ensure that they are undertaken reasonably and proportionately. Earlier, we were talking about the UNCRC concerning the rights of the child. It is fair that we should continue to think about how we work with and support young people; it seems reasonable that here, too, we should act reasonably and proportionately.</p>

<a name="91019-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="09101944000053"></a>The more open-ended the power to search, the harder it is to justify the infringement of human rights. Our approach has been endorsed by the Joint Committee on Human Rights. That is an important balance that we have been able to strike. Furthermore,

Otherwise, we risk causing confusion and uncertainty in schools. That would produce the opposite effect from what the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, wants&#151;empowering and trusting teachers.</p>

<a name="91019-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="09101944000054"></a>The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, asked about items such as pornography&#151;violent or extremist literature was also referred to in the other place&#151;and why they are not included. We have no evidence yet that a power to search for those items is needed. Of course, Ministers could consider legislating to extend powers in the regulations further if and when a need was identified. We know that alcohol, illegal drugs and stolen items are specifically highlighted, especially by the 2008 report to the Secretary of State by Alan Steer, which we have already discussed.</p>

<a name="91019-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="09101944000055"></a>We need to trust schools, and there needs to be a two-way trust between pupils and teachers and teachers and pupils&#151;and between the Government and teachers. Their rules can be perfectly reasonable; I accept that absolutely, but it does not necessarily follow that a search without consent for any item contrary to those rules is reasonable. The point of limiting the scope of the clause to five specific items&#151;knives, other offensive weapons, alcohol, illegal drugs, and stolen items&#151;is that we want to promote clarity and proportionality. The example of chewing gum given by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, was a good one. Another example might be earrings. In a lot of schools with which I come into contact, earrings are strictly prohibited for very good reasons.</p>

<a name="91019-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="09101944000056"></a>The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, asked specifically about the burden of proof on teachers. I shall come to that when I address other amendments. I recognise the noble Lord&#146;s argument that it is impossible for us to predict what schools may need to search for in future. That is why I shall speak to the government amendments&#151;I will not go through the whole list. They will create a regulation-making power to add to the list of prohibited items, as I just suggested. That will maintain the safeguards and clarity of a specified list while allowing the list to be extended if a justifiable need arises. I believe that that meets the concerns of noble Lords opposite. That regulation-making power will be subject to the affirmative procedure, to ensure a proper level of parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="09101944000057"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, talked about training. I have sympathy with her arguments, especially about Amendments 297ZA and 303A. However, it is unnecessary to provide a specific requirement for training in the Bill. Our current guidance on screening and searching of learners for weapons, which we intend to revise and strengthen, advises that no one should do a search without training. That is in the guidance. It is unnecessary to introduce a blanket training requirement for all staff. The training needs of individual staff are rightly the decision of the head teacher. Heads are best placed to decide about training, taking account of roles, previous experience, job responsibilities and the context of the school. These provisions require a head teacher to authorise a particular member of staff to undertake a search, and when doing so the head teacher would want to be satisfied that he or she is competent to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="09101944000058"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, and noble Lords on the Liberal Democrat Benches spoke on the confiscation and disposal amendments. Members of security staff fulfil significant roles. It would be great if schools did not need to have their support, but they make a great contribution to schools around the country. Schools can choose to have searches without consent conducted exclusively by members of security staff. Furthermore, school security staff are the only members of staff who the head teacher may require to conduct a search. Teachers may choose not to conduct a search if they feel uncomfortable in doing so. We touched on this point at Second Reading.</p>

<a name="91019-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="09101944000059"></a>Where other authorised members of staff conduct searches and seize items, it is right that they, as the persons actually conducting the search and seizing the items, have power to use reasonable force. We are firmly of the view that it would not make sense to delegate the power to use force in conducting a search. We also do not want to limit to security staff the power to seize items and to use force in doing so. We are keen to ensure that head teachers have the flexibility that they need.</p>

<a name="91019-0015.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="09101944000060"></a>The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, asked why the burden of proof is on the teacher rather than the pupil. Confiscation is interference in the human right to property. It is a serious matter. I know that the noble Lord is aware of that. The teacher needs to show that confiscation was justified, which is why Section 94 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006, entitled &#147;Defence where confiscation lawful&#148;, is framed the way it is. It is not the same as putting a criminal burden of proof on teachers. I am advised to remind the Committee of that point.</p>

<a name="91019-0015.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="09101944000061"></a>The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, also asked about when items are expected to be handed to the police. Guns and knives must be handed to the police; there is discretion about whether alcohol and confiscated drugs are handed to them.</p>

<a name="91019-0015.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="09101944000062"></a>Turning to Amendment 297B, which the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, referred to, I do not believe that it would be correct for a head teacher to be able to direct any members of staff who did not have school security as a main part of their duties to search against their will. There may be instances where a teacher does not feel comfortable exercising his power to search; for example, where he feels there would be a risk of physical harm. In such circumstances, it will be more appropriate for school security staff or, on extreme occasions, police to conduct the search.</p>

I find that suggestion particularly worrying. The noble Lord said a lot of the things that I have often said myself in other contexts. The suggestion is not necessarily what I would want to happen if drugs were found&#151;it might be the right thing to do or it might not&#151;but I remain concerned about the potential for suspicion falling on a teacher who chooses not to hand the drugs over to the police. Perhaps we can have a word about that between now and Report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="09101944000066"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, has completely changed my opinion that drugs should always be handed over to the police. Maybe I am naive, but I had not really thought about the fact that that would necessarily tip a young person into the criminal justice system. That would not be the right thing at all. Perhaps we can talk about that issue between now and Report and see whether there is some way in which we can make sure that staff are protected should they make that judgment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="09101944000069"></a>While I am on my feet, I will try to be clearer than I may have been before. Teachers do have the discretion to decide whether or not to call the police. This is set out in new Section 550ZC(4) of the Education Act 1996 on the option to dispose of controlled drugs, and in new Section 550ZC(5)(b) of that Act on the option to return a stolen article to the owner or to dispose of it. However, I am happy for us to discuss this further between now and Report.</p>

These amendments would mean that neither the searcher nor the witness to the search of a pupil at school has to be of the same gender as the child. We have tabled these amendments for two main reasons. First, it is of vital importance that we trust our teachers. They are professional people who have already been through all the security checks necessary to become a teacher. We must not assume that even after that every teacher has to be restrained in some way and that without the law in place we would see a large number of cases of teachers abusing this power.</p>

<a name="91019-0015.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="09101944000076"></a>The Minister may argue that this legislation is in place to help protect teachers from parents and children who are waiting in some way to accuse teachers of misconduct. My experience is that legislation based on the worst-case scenario very rarely becomes good legislation. Secondly, there is a very practical element to these questions. Does the Bill as it stands really mean that four teachers, two of each gender, would be required on every school trip which took girls and boys, and where prohibited items might be present?</p>

<a name="91019-0015.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="09101944000077"></a>There is also the problem that, particularly in primary schools, there is an overwhelming lack of male teachers. Figures from 2008 show that, in local authority maintained nursery and primary schools, only 14 per cent of full-time teachers were male and 86 per cent were female. Recent figures from the General Teaching Council for England show that 27 per cent of primary schools in England have no registered male teachers. In that situation, what should female teachers needing to search a male child do? Why should they be put in a position where they cannot do anything because the assumption is that if you search a child of a different sex you must be doing something wrong?</p>

<a name="91019-0016.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="09101944000078"></a>This assumption pervades our society at the moment, which is probably one reason why so few male teachers work in primary schools. I found a quotation from Mick Brookes, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a><a name="09101944000108"></a>&#147;One of the reasons they are put off is the assumption that, if you&#146;re a male working in a primary school, there is a fair chance you will be accused of something some time or other&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09101944000098"></a>Finally, the Minister must accept that we are talking about a search power which would only ever require a pupil to take off an outer layer of clothing and there would always have to be a witness.</p>

<a name="91019-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="09101944000079"></a>It is for those reasons that we have tabled amendments to this clause. We welcome the fact that the Government have taken on board many of the concerns expressed. We are very pleased that they have decided to come back to us with some new thoughts and have tabled their own amendments which would increase the flexibility and would allow the witness to be of a different gender from the child, or the student at an FE college, if it was not &#147;reasonably practicable&#148; to find a witness of the same sex. That is a step in the right direction, but does not go as far as we would like.</p>

<a name="91019-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="09101944000080"></a>Nevertheless, I should like to take this opportunity to thank the Minister and her Bill team for the hard work that they have put into this difficult area. We are grateful for the government amendments which we now accept, but we would like the Government to go further. I beg to move.</p>

During the Recess we were able to have discussions about these issues and respond to the concerns raised both in those meetings and during the debates in another place. As a result we are bringing forward amendments in response to concerns about the low proportion of male teachers in primary schools. For this reason, I propose to speak to the amendments tabled in my name which remove the requirement that a witness to the search be the same gender as the learner being searched where this is not practicable. I hope that noble Lords agree that this strikes an appropriate balance, but I gather that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, does not agree that it does so. However, we are talking about getting the balance right in realistic school situations without weakening the important safeguards in place for learners and, as he suggests, for staff as well. There is a need to maintain consistency across school establishments.</p>

<a name="91019-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="09101944000084"></a>We recognise the difficulties that these safeguards present, particularly to primary schools. However, the powers would be used only rarely in primary schools and the protection these safeguards provide are important for both pupils and staff. They will help to maintain

I appreciate the noble Lord&#146;s comments, but we have made moves towards what I believe will strike the right balance. With that, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to support the government amendments and not press those tabled in the names of his noble friends Lady Verma and Lord De Mauley.</p>

<a name="91019-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="09101944000087"></a>We move now to the issue of recording and reporting the use of force in schools. None of us wants to see members of staff using force on a child in school but we have to accept that sometimes teachers find themselves up against some very difficult situations and restraint becomes necessary to avoid a child injuring himself or another person, and teachers need clarity on this matter. However, we have some concerns about the way in which Clause 239 will operate, so we have tabled a group of amendments to tease this out.</p>

<a name="91019-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="09101944000088"></a>Amendment 306 would remove,</p>

<p><a name="09101944000099"></a>from the list of purposes for which force may be used on a pupil. Since the Government first considered these powers there has been a development in the Court of Appeal. The judgment in R(AC) v Secretary of State for Justice 2008 established that rules allowing children in secure training centres to be restrained to ensure good order and discipline breached Articles 3 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, interpreted in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. My amendment gives the Government the opportunity to revise their proposals on the use of force in schools in line with this judgment. Section 93 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 allows staff to use reasonable force in three circumstances, including maintaining good order and discipline. My amendment would remove that and I urge the Committee to accept it.</p>

<a name="91019-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="09101944000089"></a>Amendment 307 would introduce a regulation-making power for the Secretary of State concerning behaviour management training for members of staff in schools. This amendment is supported by the Children&#146;s Rights  


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_545"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column 545</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Alliance for England, the Children&#146;s Society, the National Children&#146;s Bureau, the NSPCC and Treehouse&#151;as was the previous one&#151;because they know, from all their practical experience with children, that situations where restraint might have been necessary can be avoided by well trained staff. If they were trained in de-escalation techniques, risk assessment and safe ways of using force where necessary, respecting children&#146;s rights and dignity, we would have a much better situation and much less need for this sort of intervention, which should, of course, always be the last resort.</p>

<a name="91019-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="09101944000090"></a>The training should be a proper accredited course. Staff in secure training centres and children&#146;s homes are required by law to undergo such training. It has not heretofore been regarded as being necessary for school staff; however, if the Government are to introduce these new powers, it becomes very necessary. I hope that the Minister will accept my proposal.</p>

<a name="91019-0016.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="09101944000091"></a>Amendment 307ZA allows the Secretary of State to give guidance to the governing body of the school about these recording and reporting powers, and the governors must have regard to it. If that is done, the governors will pay attention to this matter and develop a protocol in the school to which parents will be invited to sign up. It is important that pupils should also be made aware of this protocol. We need openness and accountability here.</p>

<a name="91019-0016.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="09101944000092"></a>With regard to using physical interventions with a pupil with SEN, the child&#146;s particular needs should be reflected in their individual education plan or behaviour plan. Where an individual protocol is in place, arising from a risk assessment, different levels of intervention may have been specified as being foreseeable. Parents should be shown, and agree to, such a protocol before it is necessary to use it. For other children, this is a matter in which the governors should take a serious interest.</p>

<a name="91019-0016.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="09101944000093"></a>Amendment 307D would insert the same amendments into Clause 240, relating to further education colleges.</p>

<a name="91019-0016.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="09101944000094"></a>Amendment 307BA tries to raise the bar a little with regard to those incidents that fall under the duties in Clause 239 to record and report the use of force. In our view, small incidents that do not infringe upon the children&#146;s well-being, rights or dignity should not impose a duty to record and report. Amendment 307BB suggests that it should be down to the discretion of the head teacher to decide which incidents are of such seriousness that it is in the child&#146;s interest to both record them and report them to each parent. Reporting them to a violent parent could result in a child being beaten at home for getting into physical violence. The head teacher must have some discretion in this; head teachers know their children, and we should trust them.</p>

<a name="91019-0016.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a><a name="09101944000095"></a>The Government have included &#147;significant&#148; in line 17 on page 146. Will the Minister explain to the House what she means by that term with regard to the discretion and judgment of the head teacher? None of us wants to impose a heavy burden of unnecessary reporting and letter-writing upon a busy head, while at the same time we want to protect children&#146;s rights. It is important that legislation gets the balance right so that there is a chance of the whole thing operating sensibly in practice on the ground. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="91019-0016.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="09101946000002"></a>We have tabled our amendments and participate in this debate to probe the Government&#146;s intentions. We agree with the Government that it is important to ensure that our pupils are protected from abuse of power and that our teachers are protected from false accusations. We are, however, concerned that a statutory duty to record and report every significant incident may not be the best way to achieve this.</p>

<a name="91019-0016.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="09101946000003"></a>The National Union of Teachers informs us that,</p>
<ul><a name="09101946000078"></a>&#147;current NUT guidance to its members includes advice that procedures should be in place for the recording of significant incidents involving use of physical restraint by staff on pupils and that parents should generally be informed&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09101946000053"></a>Given this, can the Minister inform the Committee of the reason for introducing a statutory duty? Is it in reaction to any particular issue or incident? We would advocate that teachers be allowed to exercise their own professional judgment with regard to what incidents should be recorded and reported to those at home.</p>

<a name="91019-0016.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="09101946000004"></a>We support Amendment 307BB, put forward by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, which, as she explained, would mean that while all &#147;significant&#148; incidents were still recorded, the head teacher could use his or her discretion in deciding whether it was appropriate to inform the child&#146;s parents. There may be occasions, as the noble Baroness explained, where the child is at risk of more harm from angry parents if they are informed of every incident whereby a member of staff has to use some amount of force on a pupil to maintain discipline. In those circumstances, it would surely be more appropriate for the head teacher to be able to exercise discretion and make a suitable judgment about the possible dangers posed to a child if the information was passed directly to their parents, instead of a blanket requirement which took no account of specific circumstances or particular situations.</p>

<a name="91019-0016.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="09101946000005"></a>Like the noble Baroness, I would like to hear a little bit more about the meaning of &#147;significant&#148;. It would be useful to have some examples of what would have to be recorded under this provision and what would not. With this in mind, I again express my support for the amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, which in effect asks for guidance on the type of incidents which are intended to be covered.</p>

<a name="91019-0016.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="09101946000006"></a>Part of our concern about the provisions centres around the worry that teachers are already under a large amount of strain, particularly bureaucratic strain. We should surely seek to decrease, not increase, this burden. Surely everyone wants to avoid any unnecessary and excessive bureaucracy. Given that, does the Minister think that recording and reporting these incidents is a necessary burden? Are the Government not concerned that, with the increase in bureaucracy, they may invite a disincentive for teachers to keep order?</p>

<a name="91019-0016.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a><a name="09101946000007"></a>The National Union of Teachers has expressed concern that the new duties to record and report incidents will,</p>
<ul><a name="09101946000079"></a>&#147;not offer teachers any higher level of protection from allegations from students or parents which are malicious or unfounded&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09101946000054"></a>Can the Minister reassure the National Union of Teachers on this count?</p>

<a name="91019-0016.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a><a name="09101946000008"></a>Our Amendment 308 in this group would mean that a member of staff retained the right to use force as a physical restraint if the pupil attempted to leave the room where they were subject to a disciplinary penalty outside school sessions. The Minister will doubtless recognise the motive behind the amendment, as it has been a constant theme throughout our discussions on this part. The powers to discipline a pupil should be given back to teachers, and we should trust their professional judgment to be able to exercise it.</p>

<a name="91019-0016.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a><a name="09101946000009"></a>The amendment responds, in part, to a concern that teachers are now regularly unable to enforce detentions and other punishments because the pupils can simply leave the room and teachers have no power to stop them for fear of litigation and a desire to protect their jobs. How is discipline supposed to be enforced in these circumstances? Would it not be far better to have a system with clear boundaries, enforceable sanctions and immediate resolutions? Instead, we have a confusing mess of guidance, regulation and general fear of litigation. Within the confines of the system, it is very difficult to enforce discipline at all. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

I want to wait to hear what the Minister has to say, but with reference to Amendments 306 to 308, I am a little concerned about the number of teachers who would have to undergo this type of training. It would appear to be rather expensive, but, if it is really the best way forward, perhaps it is worth doing. On Amendment 306, the maintenance of good order and discipline at school or among pupils educated at the school, during a teaching session or otherwise, is a pretty tricky area. I would not want to see Amendment 308, with the use of physical prevention on a pupil leaving the room. I am all for using your authority, as far as is humanly possible, but physical prevention of somebody leaving a room is really going a little too far. I shall wait to be reassured on those issues by the Minister.</p>

I start with a question that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, asked, about whether the new clauses were in response to a specific incident. They are. There was a case a few years ago, although I do not wish to deluge the Committee further with information, in which an autistic girl was restrained many times without her parents being informed, which caused considerable concern and distress and has  


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_548"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column 548</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>prompted us to look very carefully at the policy. I should be happy to write to noble Lords, giving some background on that very sad case.</p>

<a name="91019-0017.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a><a name="09101946000013"></a>I start by looking at the core recording and reporting requirements in Amendments 307A, 307C and 307D. It is right that teachers and lecturers have the power to use reasonable force in appropriate circumstances, to protect those in their care. I think that that is understood in the Committee. Such incidents can be distressing to learners and staff. Of course, as the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said, we would hope that this was a matter of the last resort. It is appropriate, therefore, that a clear and contemporary report is made of each significant incident&#151;and I recognise the importance of the word significant&#151;and that a report is made to parents. This will act as a safeguard for both learners and for staff, who will be better able to refute malicious and inaccurate accusations. I am sure that that is what already happens in the vast majority of good schools. Recording and reporting is already a good practice which most schools and colleges follow. Making it a legislative requirement will ensure that best practice is applied consistently.</p>

<a name="91019-0017.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a><a name="09101946000014"></a>The meaning of &#147;significant&#148; is an important question, which Amendments 307B and 307BA both probe; however, it is important to maintain a sensible balance. We would not want schools to have to make a report every time a teacher stopped a pupil who was leaning back in a chair or falling over, for example. That is why the use of the term &#147;significant&#148; is essential. We are working with our social partners to clarify the criteria that constitute &#147;significant&#148; and will set that out in our statutory guidance.</p>

<a name="91019-0017.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a><a name="09101946000015"></a>The question of discretion is also important and is probed in Amendment 307BB. I appreciate fully the strength of feeling on whether head teachers should be able to exercise their discretion in reporting significant incidents of the use of force&#151;again, there is the importance of &#147;significant&#148;. I believe, however, that the clause as drafted gets it right in requiring that parents must be told when a significant incident has occurred, which comes back to that important definition.</p>

<a name="91019-0017.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a><a name="09101946000016"></a>Where the relationship between the parent and child is so fraught that such a report might have adverse consequences for the pupil or student, the clause would not prevent the report from reaching the parents through a third party&#151;for example, the local social services department. Our first priority is the protection of vulnerable children. Ensuring that parents or guardians know what has happened to their children in school is an important means of providing that protection. If they do not know, how can they play any part in ensuring that issues are addressed? In a tiny minority of cases, we would expect alternative arrangements to be put in place for the parents to be informed.</p>

<a name="91019-0017.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a><a name="09101946000017"></a>Amendment 306 would remove the power to use force to maintain good order and discipline. While the use of force must always be a last resort, it is important that teachers should have the option of using reasonable force to maintain authority in their classes&#151;for example, to remove a disruptive child from a classroom. To forbid such action would lead to pupils being able to defy teachers&#146; authority and to disrupt other pupils&#146; learning without redress, which I am sure we must all agree we do not want to see.</p>




<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_549"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column 549</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91019-0017.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a><a name="09101946000018"></a>On the concern expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, following the completion of the Smallridge and Williamson review, an Appeal Court judgment, as the noble Baroness said, ruled that force could not be used for the maintenance of good order and discipline in secure training centres. We do not, however, accept that banning it in schools is right as schools are, surely, a fundamentally different environment from the secure estate. Young people in the secure estate lack the home support that most pupils enjoy. They are in a closed environment and more likely to be alone with the staff members when force is being used on them than pupils in school.</p>

<a name="91019-0017.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a><a name="09101946000019"></a>The paramount importance in schools of ensuring good order and discipline, in order that children can learn, is key. It is simply not acceptable for one disruptive pupil to be able to cause mayhem in a lesson. In some cases, while I understand the concern expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, on this, the use of force to get the pupil out of the classroom may be the only option. Without that power, the disciplinary authority of teachers would also be fatally compromised.</p>

<a name="91019-0017.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a><a name="09101946000020"></a>I shall finish on training, an issue that the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, raises again in Amendment 307. We recognise the importance of appropriate training for school staff in the use of force. Our existing guidance on the use of force highlights the importance of good training and recommends that schools set out their approach to relevant training in their use-of-force policy. Our guidance makes clear the principle that force should be used only as a last resort and covers de-escalation techniques, in the very way that the noble Baroness mentioned. As she knows, it is all about reducing risk and ensuring that proper risk assessments are made.</p>

<a name="91019-0017.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a><a name="09101946000021"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, discussed detentions in referring to Amendment 308. School staff already have the power to use reasonable force to prevent a pupil from committing an offence, causing injury, damaging property or prejudicing the maintenance of good order and discipline. In circumstances where a pupil walking out of a detention would clearly undermine good order and discipline, a member of staff would be able, if they judged it appropriate, to use reasonable force to prevent them from leaving.</p>

<a name="91019-0017.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a><a name="09101946000022"></a>It is absolutely right that teachers should have the powers and tools that they need to keep good order in the classroom. Importantly, however, we must ensure that teachers know about the powers that they already have, which are pretty comprehensive. I hope, having addressed concerns, particularly around the key issue of the definition of &#147;significant&#148;, and our work with social partners&#151;the teaching unions and professional associations&#151;to ensure that we get this right and strike the right balance, that the noble Baroness feels able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

The noble Baroness says that it is a completely different context and that the young person is more likely to be alone with a member of staff in a secure training centre. On the other hand, this situation is more likely to happen in a secure training centre because of the nature of the personnel involved.

However, I think that it has its own value. In the next Session we shall doubtless consider home education in detail so I do not want to trespass on that now, but there is a history in this country of a lack of contact and comprehension between Government and home educators. This is not the case in Scotland, where there is a settled arrangement whereby an intermediary body has developed which allows the home education community to communicate satisfactorily with the Scottish Government, and by and large things there proceed pretty well. Here when the Government announced their Badman review, I think that more than 2,000 home educators sent in individual views, and being home educators they were individual views and not copied out of some round robin. The Government must have found it impossible to deal with that variety, depth and passion of view. As a result, the home education community feels, probably quite rightly, that its views were ignored, although I do not blame the Government because I cannot see how a civil servant can ever be expected to get their mind around such an extraordinary variety of opinions and produce a coherent briefing for a Minister. What is needed is some form of intermediary body.</p>

There has been a good deal of hostility to it from the home education community, as I expect there would be to any plan. Nevertheless, I hope that the Government will express themselves open to an initiative in this area and say that they would welcome such an intermediary body if it could be created, or something that would enable the home education community to speak effectively to Government, and then perhaps if there is a known willingness something will happen. I beg to move.</p>

<ul><a name="09101946000080"></a>&#147;what percentage of (a) girls and (b) boys are receiving home schooling in each local authority area, broken down by ethnic group&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="09101946000056"></a>I understand that this is the case at the moment. Does the Minister consider that it might be useful to have a clearer picture of how much schooling occurs in this country? Moreover, might it not be useful and relevant in formulating the structure of education in this country to know who favours home schooling and what their reasons are for it? I will listen to the Minister&#146;s response with great interest.</p>

There are wide-ranging figures from some 20,000 up to 100,000 plus. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, has said, there is a lot of interest in the whole question of home education and how home educators are supported. I know that the amendment seeks to establish a new consultative committee at a national level, but it is interesting that he is flying a kite. It is helpful to fly a number of kites in this area because the diversity of opinion on it is challenging to grapple with.</p>

<a name="91019-0017.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a><a name="09101946000035"></a>Home education is an established part of the British education system and there are great benefits where it works and where it is the best option for the child. I have met some very impressive young people who are a credit to their home education. We recognise the valuable contribution made by home educators and we certainly wish to see home education continue as a real option for parents. We do not wish to undermine it in any way. We want to ensure that home educators receive the right level of support to ensure that they can provide a suitable education for their children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_405"></a><a name="09101946000036"></a>On 9 October, we published our full response to Graham Badman&#146;s report, <I>Review of Elective Home Education in England</I>. The response sets out our strong commitment to supporting home educators, particularly where children have special needs or wish to access examination centres or further education colleges, which I know many find difficult to do.</p>

<a name="91019-0017.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a><a name="09101946000037"></a>It is important for home educators to have a voice in any decisions that affect them. I very much agree with the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, on that. In our response to the Badman report we recognise that consultation at local level is important if home educators are to receive the services that they need. That is why we undertook to include in any statutory guidance that we issue a recommendation that local authorities set up consultative forums for home educators to review local authority arrangements for monitoring and services provided to them.</p>

There are a number of organisations&#151;particularly Education Otherwise, which I have met&#151;that are very good at voicing the concerns of home educators.

I am disappointed that she does not think that anything is needed nationally.

<a name="91019-0017.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a><a name="09101946000042"></a>The amendment would add the words &#147;and community cohesion&#148; to economic and social well being. If truth be known it really adds very little: implicitly promoting economic and social well being in a local area must in itself help to promote social cohesion. The 157 Group wished to emphasise its vision of colleges as the vibrant and dynamic centres of activity in their locality, positively reaching out to serve their local communities, going out and finding out about skills gaps and employer needs, but also holding an open door and saying to the local population, &#147;Come and talk to us and we will help you to fulfil your ambitions and aspirations in educational terms&#148;.</p>

<a name="91019-0017.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a><a name="09101946000043"></a>In that respect it is vital to recognise the role that further education colleges can play within their local communities, providing for educational needs from courses in basic literacy and numeracy on the one hand to foundation and honours degrees on the other. The larger colleges have anything between 15,000 and 30,000 students on their books and a turnover of up to &#163;60 million. They are often larger than the local university and much larger than the schools. Increasingly, they are co-operating with both sets of institutions. The amendment seeks to say that they not only accept but positively welcome their role as movers and shakers within their local community. I beg to move.</p>

There is a problem in that those who have the QTS qualification have little training in vocational subjects. Those who teach vocational subjects in further education colleges have the QTLS qualification, which is not acceptable in an ordinary school unless they have a degree. Some of them come into vocational subjects without having degrees. I am in discussion with the Bill team and with Ministers on these issues and it would be sensible to pursue our discussion.</p>

<a name="91019-0018.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a><a name="09101946000049"></a>Amendment 315A is about outdoor education and whether sufficient training is given to those going through the initial teacher training on how to handle outdoor expeditions. Do they know enough about writing risk assessments and the like? There is evidence that some of them do not have enough training to be confident in taking groups outside school. For that reason, many schools are not mounting as many expeditions. It is important that they do because there are many advantages in having expeditions of one sort or another outside the school.</p>

<a name="91019-0018.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a><a name="09101946000050"></a>In both cases, we need to look at the training that is given and minor amendments are required. It would be sensible for us to pursue our discussions with Ministers and reach an agreement and on Report perhaps make a statement clarifying the situation.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="0910193000064"></a>Binyam Mohamed</h2>
<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="0910193000003"></a><b><a name="91019-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="0910193000057"></a>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Baroness Kinnock of Holyhead):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (David Miliband) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="0910193000004"></a>On Friday 16 October, the High Court handed down its fifth judgment in the Binyam Mohamed case. We are deeply disappointed by the judgment, which concludes that a summary of US intelligence material, prepared by the judges, should be put into the public domain against the clear and express wishes of the United States. We will be appealing in the strongest possible terms.</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="0910193000005"></a>Since we secured the release of the material at issue to Mr Mohamed&#146;s lawyers by the US Government last October, for use in his defence before the US military commission, the only remaining issue for the court was whether it should order public disclosure of seven summary paragraphs of intelligence material received from the US about his treatment while in Pakistan in 2002.</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="0910193000006"></a>The court in its fourth judgment, handed down on 4 February, acknowledged my assessment, made after careful consideration of the US position, and considered advice from our intelligence agencies and other senior UK officials that making the seven paragraphs public against the wishes of the US would cause harm to our national security.</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="0910193000007"></a>On 23 February, we succeeded in ensuring Mr Mohamed&#146;s release from Guantanamo and his return to the UK, following strenuous efforts by the Government over the course of 18 months. The court, throughout its judgments, has noted the &#147;considerable efforts&#148; made in this regard.</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="0910193000008"></a>The court subsequently reopened its fourth judgment on 6 May on the basis that it did not know whether the position of the Obama Administration regarding disclosure was the same as the Bush Administration&#146;s position, on which it had based its judgment. While there was indeed a new President and a new Administration in the US, my assessment of the risk to UK national security remained the same: that disclosure by a UK court of a summary of US intelligence material will harm our national security. This assessment was again informed by correspondence from the Obama Administration&#151;from both the CIA and the White House&#151;as well as by my own discussions of this matter with Secretary of State Clinton. In making this assessment I was again carefully advised by our intelligence agencies and other senior UK officials who are familiar with intelligence matters.</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="0910193000009"></a>The conclusions reached in Friday&#146;s judgment were based on the premise that the principle of control of intelligence is not absolute. However, the principle is at the heart of all intelligence relationships: intelligence  


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS46"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column WS46</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>material communicated in confidence must be protected and cannot be released without the consent of the owner. However, we only share British intelligence with other countries on the basis that they will not disclose it without our express permission. The same inviolable principle applies to foreign intelligence shared with us. If this principle is undermined, the sharing of intelligence will most certainly be hindered. At a time when the UK faces a serious threat from international terrorism, the Government will not take risks with intelligence that is essential to national security and shared with us by many states.</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="0910193000010"></a>The court found that there was insufficient evidence to amount to a real risk that the US would reassess or reduce its intelligence-sharing relationship with the UK because there was no &#147;explicit statement of consequences [of disclosure by the Court] by the Obama Administration&#148;. In my judgment, the comments of the Obama Administration, now made public, from the CIA, the President&#146;s National Security Adviser, and Secretary Clinton, show this not to be the case, and certainly not a risk worth taking. The seriousness of the Obama Administration&#146;s determination to uphold the principle of control which underpins decades of intelligence sharing between our two countries is there for all to see in the records of successive correspondence from and discussions with senior figures in the Obama Administration. In the Government&#146;s view, the court has failed to accord proper weight to these factors or this assessment. On such a fundamental issue, it is right and proper that we appeal its judgment.</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="0910193000011"></a>Honourable Members will be aware that, in the course of this case, Mr Mohamed made extremely serious allegations about his mistreatment while in detention. We have been completely clear on this issue: the British Government stand firmly against torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment; we do not condone, collude with, encourage or solicit it. We take all allegations of wrongdoing very seriously. Allegations that British officials were mixed up in wrongdoing in this case are now properly being investigated by the police. Mr Mohamed is also bringing a separate legal claim for damages against the Government. This will be addressed by the courts in due course.</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="0910193000012"></a>In this case, however, the fundamental question at issue is not the mistreatment allegations made by Mr Mohamed. It is about the principle underpinning intelligence-sharing and the assessment of the risks to the United Kingdom&#146;s national security that would follow from a breach of this principle. Though I have no objection to the material becoming public, and have made this clear throughout, it is for the US to release its own material, not the UK.</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="0910193000013"></a>I am determined that the vigour with which we fight this case will maintain the confidence of and send a clear message to all our intelligence partners across the world: the United Kingdom will protect the information that you share with us and uphold the principle that it is for you, not us or our courts, to decide if and when to release such material into the public domain.</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="0910193000015"></a>On Friday 16 October the European Commission&#146;s Standing Committee on Food Chain and Animal Health (SCOFCAH) agreed to provide up to &#8364;10 million of EU funding to support the UK&#146;s Bovine Tuberculosis (TB) Eradication Programme for 2010. Its decision to provide financial support to the UK is welcome assistance to our efforts to tackle this worrying, complex and costly disease.</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="0910193000016"></a>The UK eradication plan, submitted to the European Commission on 15 September, sets out the planned programme of TB surveillance, control and eradication for England, Wales and Northern Ireland during 2010 (Scotland is not required to submit a plan, having achieved officially TB-free status). The EU funding can be used to offset the costs of TB testing and compensation for cattle slaughtered within this programme. Defra will work with the Administrations in Wales and Northern Ireland to agree how this funding will be shared.</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="0910193000017"></a>I would like to take this opportunity also to acknowledge the excellent work of the TB Eradication Group for England, whose recommendations on strengthening the eradication programme in England helped ensure the approval of the UK&#146;s plan. The group&#146;s first report has recently been published and  I am placing copies in the Libraries of the House.</p>

Regrettably, these letters were not taken into account due to an administrative error within my department when compiling the Answer.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="0910193000023"></a>I am making this Statement on behalf of myself and my honourable friends the Minister of State at the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath), and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Ian Austin).</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="0910193000024"></a>Today we have placed in the Library the government response to the Stakeholder Advisory Group on Extremely Low Frequency Electromagnetic Fields&#146;s<b></b>(SAGE)<I> First Interim Assessment: Power Lines and Property, Wiring in Homes and Electrical Equipment in Homes</I><I>,</I><I></I>published in 2007. SAGE is a group of stakeholders representing sectors engaged with electricity transmission, regulation, property valuation, academic research and public-concern campaigning. The remit of SAGE is to explore the implications for a precautionary approach to extremely low-frequency electric and magnetic fields (ELF EMF) and to make practical recommendations to Government. This first assessment considered two sources of EMF: high-voltage overhead power lines and electrical wiring and equipment inside the home. SAGE is jointly funded by the Department of Health, the National Grid Company, the Energy Networks Association and the charity Children with Leukaemia.</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="0910193000025"></a>SAGE made recommendations for relatively low-cost and proportionate action in four key areas. The Government have decided to take forward these measures proposed by SAGE on:</p>
 optimal phasing of high-voltage overhead power lines; 
<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="0910193000026"></a>electrical appliances in homes;</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="0910193000027"></a>household wiring practices; and</p>
 the provision of advice to the public on ELF EMF.
<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="0910193000028"></a>SAGE also put forward an option to introduce a moratorium on building new homes and schools near high-voltage power lines and new high-voltage power lines near homes and schools. However, SAGE's cost-benefit analysis does not support this option. The Government therefore consider this option to be disproportionate given the evidence base on the potential health risks arising from exposure to ELF EMF and have no plans to take it forward.</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="0910193000029"></a>The Department for Communities and Local Government will take forward recommendations relating to planning, buildings and house wiring. The Department of Energy and Climate Change will take forward recommendations on high-voltage electricity transmission. The Department of Health will take forward provision of health protection information about electromagnetic fields and support of health risk research.</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="0910193000032"></a>Twenty-five years after the famine in Ethiopia that killed over a million people, there is once again a growing drought and conflict-related humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa.</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="0910193000033"></a>Ethiopia accounts for the highest proportion of the humanitarian caseload in the region, with over 6 million people needing emergency assistance until the end of 2009. A third of these people live in the Somali region of Ethiopia. UNICEF estimates that there are currently over 500,000 acutely malnourished children in Ethiopia. A further 7.5 million vulnerable Ethiopians receive food and cash transfers under a Productive Safety Net Programme.</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="0910193000034"></a>The humanitarian outlook for 2010 is very worrying. The current humanitarian crisis could tip over into a humanitarian catastrophe. The prospects for the main harvest in November, which accounts for 90 per cent of Ethiopia&#146;s annual food production, are a particular cause for concern. The late arrival of the rains and prolonged dry spells mean that the harvest is likely to be below average at best, with total crop failure a possibility in some parts of the country. A mid-season assessment is currently under way, and will provide a clearer picture of likely humanitarian needs into 2010.</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="0910193000035"></a>I recently announced an additional, immediate &#163;30 million of emergency aid for Ethiopia, to help make sure that there is sufficient food for those who need it. This additional finance takes the total emergency aid provided by DfID in Ethiopia this year to &#163;49 million, making the UK the second largest bilateral humanitarian contributor after the US.</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="0910193000036"></a>The additional &#163;30 million included &#163;15 million for the UN World Food Programme to ensure that 3.4 million people receive food rations in October, and &#163;3 million for UNICEF to pay for the treatment of up to 40,000 children with acute malnutrition. Through a common humanitarian fund, we are also providing funds for NGOs to provide life-saving nutrition, water and sanitation.</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="0910193000037"></a>Alongside this emergency support, we are continuing to finance the Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP), which aims to protect and build the assets of vulnerable people and reduce their dependency on food aid in the medium term. So far in 2009, we have contributed &#163;35 million to the PSNP.</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="0910193000038"></a>If the forthcoming main harvest does fail, significant scaling-up efforts by the Government of Ethiopia and the international community will be needed to prevent the current crisis becoming a catastrophe in 2010. We continue to encourage the Government of Ethiopia to: publish updated humanitarian requirements as quickly as possible following each assessment; acknowledge the size and scope of the crisis; initiate contingency planning for 2010 as soon as the outlook is known; and facilitate access for all humanitarian actors, particularly in the Somali region, where humanitarian delivery is complicated by a long-running insurgency.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="0910193000039"></a>In recent months, the UK has stepped up its advocacy among international partners, urging them to contribute additional resources in sufficient time to avoid gaps in the humanitarian pipeline. In Ethiopia, DfID continues to monitor the situation on the ground, and is leading efforts to improve the effectiveness of the response and secure better and faster access for UN agencies and NGOs to affected areas.</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="0910193000041"></a>The Government&#146;s response to the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee report on pandemic influenza has today been laid before Parliament (Cm 7722).</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="0910193000042"></a>The committee&#146;s report was published on 28 July of this year. The report highlights a range of issues relating to pandemic influenza planning in general and to the Government&#146;s response to the current swine flu pandemic. The report focuses on:</p>
 &#147;end-to-end&#148; testing of planning, particularly in the NHS;the design and capacity of the National Pandemic Flu Service;critical care capacity in the NHS;support for health and social care workers during a pandemic;communications to the public and healthcare workers; andvaccine supply and distribution.
<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="0910193000043"></a>The government response addresses the points raised by the committee individually, setting out the work and planning undertaken prior to the outbreak of swine flu and the reasoning behind the various stages of the response to the pandemic.</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="0910193000044"></a>Our response clearly demonstrates that United Kingdom planning prior to the swine flu pandemic made the UK one of the best prepared countries in the world, a fact widely recognised in the international community. With one of the largest stockpiles of antivirals in the world and every NHS organisation with a pandemic contingency plan in place, we were in a very strong position to face the threat of swine flu when it emerged earlier this year.</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="0910193000045"></a>Our response to the committee&#146;s report also testifies to the tremendous work that has been done since the outbreak of swine flu&#151;at the front line and behind the scenes&#151;in trying to limit the spread of the initial wave of infection and in preparing ourselves for a second wave this autumn or winter. On behalf of the Government, I would like to thank all those involved in helping to mitigate our worst fears, which a pandemic inevitably brings.</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="0910193000046"></a>The staff of the National Health Service, Health Protection Agency, devolved Administrations and government departments, in collaboration with those from many other organisations, responded tremendously

We were able to limit the spread of the virus from the initial cases entering the UK and cope with very significant levels of infection in some areas during the initial wave.</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="0910193000047"></a>We now have further stockpiles of antivirals and antibiotics and we have tested the resilience of NHS planning in exercise peak practice. We are also beginning to receive the first batches of a new swine flu vaccine, which will be given initially to those most at risk and to health and social care workers, in order to minimise the potential harm that the virus could still cause. This is a very significant development and one that the Government greatly welcome.</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="0910193000048"></a>I would like to take this opportunity to express the Government&#146;s thanks to the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee for its work on this subject. Scrutiny by such a distinguished group of experts has been a valuable part of the development of our policy.</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="0910193000050"></a>Good acoustics are essential to a successful learning environment for all children, particularly for those with special hearing requirements, and my department works hard to achieve this, in partnership with other government departments such as Communities and Local Government (CLG) and with the National Deaf Children&#146;s Society (NDCS). I should place on record my appreciation to the NDCS for its commitment to breaking down the barriers faced by deaf children.</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="0910193000051"></a>To continue our drive for improvement, I am announcing a package of measures designed to ensure that school buildings have good acoustics and that the needs of those with special hearing requirements are met.</p>

<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="0910193000052"></a>My department and Communities and Local Government (CLG) are taking a number of actions to improve acoustics in schools. These include:</p>
Partnerships For Schools (PFS) will ensure, through the approvals process, that all future funding for Building Schools for the Future (BSF) schools will not be approved without contractual commitment to meeting appropriate standards through acoustic test certification;in local authorities where schools have already been constructed with BSF funding, a certificate of compliance with acoustic standards for the most recently funded school, or plan demonstrating how that will be achieved, will be required before further funding is released to that LA; 


<notus-date day="19" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS52"></a><b>19 Oct 2009 : Column WS52</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>my department will publish a design practice note for clients by December 2010, emphasising the importance of good acoustics, including a strong recommendation for testing and reminding them of funding conditions under the BSF programme that I set out earlier in this Statement;my department and CLG will write jointly to every building control body (BCB) in England and Wales, reminding them of the importance of acoustics in all schools, including primary schools, especially for pupils with impaired hearing. We will also remind building control bodies that where acoustic testing is being carried out to satisfy requirements to secure funding, they should use these data to assess compliance with the regulations; andwhere proposals are being considered to adopt alternative performance standards to those set out in <I>Building Bulletin 93</I>, we will also ask BCBs to alert applicants to the latest guidance on acoustics and ask them not to approve alternative performance standards unless a full and proper case has been made in accordance with <I>Building Bulletin 93</I>.
<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="0910193000053"></a>In addition, my department will:</p>
 produce an evaluation of the acoustic environment of up to 10 schools and disseminate the lessons learnt by March 2010;widen the scope of our Space for Personalised Learning project to include a detailed consideration of acoustics in innovative learning spaces with immediate effect; andgo out to public consultation during 2010 on an updated version of <I>Building Bulletin 93: Acoustic </I><I>De</I><I>sign of Schools: A Design Guid</I>e, the key document for ensuring good acoustic standards in schools. This will take on board improvements already proposed following extensive stakeholder consultation, as well as any findings from the investigatory work we will carry out. 
<a name="91019-wms0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="0910193000054"></a>CLG is due to commence an evaluation of Part E of the building regulations later this year. This is the first stage of a full review of Part E that could lead to revised regulations and guidance in 2013. The NDCS will be asked to contribute to this process and my department will be fully involved on any aspects relating to schools to ensure consistency with my department&#146;s guidance.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a><a name="0910193000055"></a>Finally, in the light of the major study that the NDCS has undertaken into recent testing in schools, I have asked DCSF officials to work with CLG officials to examine the implications of introducing mandatory acoustic testing in all new schools. I have asked for this advice by June 2010. Depending on the outcome of this work, it would be our intention to issue a formal consultation on the question of mandatory testing.</p>

<a name="91019-wms0002.htm_para1"></a>

Where levels of these key pollutants are above the air quality objectives set out in strategy, they must carry out a more detailed assessment of air quality and, if necessary, declare an air quality management area (AQMA) and prepare an action plan to deliver air quality improvements in line with the local air quality management (LAQM) process. The third round of this process began in 2006, with all local authorities required to complete the first phase of this round&#151;an updating and screening assessment (USA)&#151;by the end of April 2006. Local authorities which identified a risk of exceeding an air quality objective then carried out a detailed assessment in 2007.

The protected characteristics which may be combined are age, disability, gender reassignment, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation. Clause 14 is therefore relevant where a claimant experiences less favourable treatment because of a combination of two different protected characteristics, such as disability and race or disability and gender.</p>

Should a person experience less favourable treatment because of one or more physical or mental impairments, they can submit one or more disability discrimination claims. Even though a single claim may involve a number of impairments, provided that the person met the definition of a disabled person, in that those impairments had a substantial and long-term adverse effect on their ability to carry out normal day to day activities, this would be treated as disability discrimination.</p>

<a name="09101910000187"></a><b><a name="91019w0003.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09101910000370"></a>Lord West of Spithead:</b> Within British nationality law there are provisions which require a person to be a British national, and to have no other citizenship or nationality. UKBA is therefore required, when considering such cases, to assess whether a person has any other citizenship.</p>

<a name="91019w0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_160"></a><a name="09101910000188"></a>It has been alleged that a Malaysian citizen loses that status on acquiring a British overseas citizen passport. However, two rulings have influenced UKBA's understanding of this position.</p>

<a name="91019w0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_161"></a><a name="09101910000189"></a>The first of these was the case of Lee Thean Hock, in which the Malaysian courts indicated that the issue of a BOC passport, was not sufficient for someone to be deprived of Malaysian nationality. The second, on which UKBA rely, is that of AL and Others. The Asylum and Immigration Tribunal ruled that, as the Malaysian constitution specifies that a person can be deprived of their citizenship by order if they acquire another nationality, it is not lost automatically on acquisition of another nationality or passport.</p>

<a name="91019w0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_162"></a><a name="09101910000190"></a>The Nationality Instructions on Malaysian citizenship refer to both of these rulings for the information of nationality caseworkers. It is on the basis of AL and Others that nationality caseworkers assume that the holder of a British overseas citizen passport will not have lost any claim to Malaysian citizenship unless the Malaysian authorities confirm that he or she has actually been deprived of that status by order, or his or her renunciation of that status has been registered by the Malaysian authorities.</p>

<a name="91019w0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_163"></a><a name="09101910000191"></a>Although the judge in the case of AL and Others stated that the Hock case is &#147;clearly not meant to be regarded as a precedent&#148;, he also stated that &#147;nevertheless, it may be regarded as throwing doubt upon the claims made on the appellant's behalf&#148;. It is of interest as it is a Malaysian court ruling which supports the UK 's understanding of Malaysian citizenship law and it is therefore relevant to providing context to the broader understanding of Nationality caseworkers.</p>
