<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Jenkins of Putney </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether, with regard to their statement that there is no good reason to align defence expenditure with the lower levels of other European countries (Lord Henley, H.L. Deb., 24th April, col. WA65), the release of large sums of money to be spent on health and education would constitute a good reason.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence   (Lord Henley): </B>  My Lords, the level of spending on defence is based on the Government's assessment of our defence needs and priorities, and reflects the importance which we attach to maintaining the Armed Forces to meet United Kingdom defence commitments&#151;principally the protection and security of this country and its dependent territories.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Jenkins of Putney: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that a huge sum of money could be saved immediately by abandoning expenditure on Trident submarines? Will he tell the House under what conceivable circumstances a Trident missile could be fired strategically, sub-strategically or tactically?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I shall not answer that question. However, I can assure the noble Lord that the independent nuclear deterrent has preserved the security of this country for some 40 years and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. I see no reason whatever for changing that. As regards the generality of defence expenditure, we have made reductions in real levels of defence expenditure over the past 10 years. Nearly &#163;8,000 million has been freed for other uses, which include allowing the taxpayer to keep more of his own money.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that, within the lifetime of some of us in this House, on two occasions the government of the day allowed British defences to fall to a level that brought us very near to defeat in war? Should we not be extraordinarily foolish if we ignored that lesson, and did so for a third time?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I should be extraordinarily foolish, as would Her Majesty's Government, to fail to take the advice of my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter. Similarly, we should be extraordinarily foolish if we took the advice of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Chalfont: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister consider reminding the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins, and the House that when the noble Lord, Lord Healey, was Secretary <P>


<a name="column_932"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 932</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of State for Defence he was asked the same question? His reply was: if you do not have adequate defences, you do not have schools or hospitals; what you have is a heap of rubble. Is not that principle as sound today as it was then?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont, and with his remarks about the noble Lord, Lord Healey. The first priority of any government is the defence of this realm. That will be the first priority of this Government; we shall continue that policy.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Judd: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister agree&#151;I believe that he will&#151;that in our highly interdependent global community the only way to approach defence expenditure is to define the threat and the challenge, and then, taking into account social expenditure which helps to make the nation worth defending, do whatever we can and can afford, together with others, to meet that challenge? Will he agree that, given the current instability in the world, above all what are needed are highly integrated, effective international forces? Will he accept that this side of the House will do everything to support the Government when they use their place on the Security Council&#151;and indeed their place within NATO&#151;to achieve that objective?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, if I understood the noble Lord correctly&#151;I am not sure that I did&#151;I suspect that he got the stress the wrong way round. I recommend that he take advice from the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont, and listens to the words of his noble friend Lord Healey, as quoted, and the remarks that he made when he was Secretary of State for Defence in the 1960s. The defence of this realm comes first.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Judd: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister accept that I did not get the question the wrong way round? My point was that it is necessary to have adequate social expenditure to ensure that we have a nation that is worth defending.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, we have adequate social expenditure. We have social expenditure that is far, far greater than was ever the case in real terms when the party that the noble Lord represents was in office; and it has continued to increase in quite dramatic terms over the years. Health expenditure, for example, has continued to grow in real terms over and above inflation every year since 1979.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Mayhew: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister take this opportunity to inform the House as to what countries are helping Britain with the cost of our Rapid Reaction Force in Bosnia?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, that is another question. Obviously, these are matters for the United Nations, and we look to contributions from the United Nations for the Rapid Reaction Force.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Molloy: </B>   My Lords, bearing in mind the dangerous world in which we live, will the Government at all times take very good care to see that no British Minister enters any conference naked or unprepared? Will they make sure that no Minister is put into an inferior position because other people might have greater weapons than we have?
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I have to say that I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Molloy. Perhaps he will offer some advice privately, in the tea-rooms or wherever, to his noble friend Lord Jenkins.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Wright of Richmond: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that a strong and effective defence policy is an essential component of a strong and effective foreign policy and an essential part of the defence and promotion of our national political interest, as well as our security?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord speaks with his usual wisdom. The point is that these matters are irretrievably linked. Foreign policy and defence policy must run together. The one without the other is nothing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Ironside: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that all members of the European Union and Western European Union have differing rights and responsibilities in terms of security? Does he further agree that we have freedom to act in defence of our own interests without constraint, to meet the requirements of our three defence roles with all the military tasks that go with that, and to meet the requirements of NATO policy in terms of nuclear defence?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-01_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend is absolutely correct. His analysis is right. That is what Her Majesty's Government will pursue and continue to pursue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-01_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Jenkins of Putney: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister accept that there can be two opinions about the proper and best way of expending money on defence? Will he further accept that my point argued that expenditure on Trident is a useless form of expenditure? I did not say&#151;I need no advice on this point&#151;that we should entirely strip ourselves of defence expenditure. On the contrary. Does he agree with my argument for proper expenditure on defence which excludes Trident?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-01_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, obviously there can be two opinions on most matters. On this particular occasion, if there are two opinions, I believe that the feeling of the House is that my opinion is right and the noble Lord's opinion is wrong. If the noble Lord so wished, we could spend our entire gross domestic product on health services. It would not give the noble Lord eternal youth, if that were desirable, or even everlasting life. What is important is that we assess our defence priorities correctly and get them exactly right. I believe that we have done so.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Baroness Blatch): </B>  My Lords, no. We have no plans at present to extend the au pair scheme to Poland or to any other countries, but we do keep it under review.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-01_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Belhaven and Stenton: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that reply. Can she explain why, when most other former communist countries&#151;certainly those in central Europe&#151;have been admitted to the scheme, Poland, which has closer ties with the people of this country than any other country of central or eastern Europe, is excluded? Can she further explain the apparent hostility of the Home Office to Poland on this and other matters?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199495/ldhansrd/vo950703/text/50703-02.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, it is not true that there is hostility within the Home Office against Poland specifically at all. There is considerable immigration pressure from Poland and therefore, it is thought, a real danger that the au pair scheme in particular would be used as a means of securing entry into this country in order to undertake full-time employment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dean of Beswick: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that more people from Poland are admitted into this country by other means than from any of the countries mentioned in the noble Lord's Question? Does she agree that substantial numbers of people from Poland are admitted monthly to this country under various other schemes?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, the Poles come in under student schemes, immigration schemes and, as the noble Lord said, other schemes. Whether there are more than from any other country, I am not sure. There is some doubt about the figure. Certainly, more come in than from Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Unfortunately, the au pair scheme has been used as a means to gain entry and for taking up full-time employment illegally. Indeed, one au pair agency told us that about three-quarters of the au pairs on its books worked illegally as well as carrying out their duties, often with the support of the host family.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Braine of Wheatley: </B>   My Lords, can my noble friend give the reason for such discrimination against the citizens of one of our bravest allies in the Second World War and a firm friend in peace?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I hope that nothing in any of my answers detracts from the relationship between this country and Poland; I acknowledge the particular points made by my noble friend. However, since the abolition of the visa requirement in 1992, the number of Polish nationals refused entry has risen considerably. In 1994, over 2,000 were refused admission, representing about 1.5 per cent. of those seeking leave to enter. Four hundred and seventy-two Polish nationals were detained as illegal immigrants; and 200 were found to have overstayed or to have been working in breach of their conditions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-02_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, can my noble friend say whether there has been a great change in the situation? I had a Polish au pair 25 years ago and when I saw the Question I thought that perhaps au pair now meant something different. I had an au pair helping <P>


<a name="column_935"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 935</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with my children. She was from Poland and was admitted by the Home Office. Has that arrangement changed and, if so, when? Are they now specifically excluded?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-02_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, there was a change in 1980 but this particular scheme is for young people&#151;men or women&#151;between the ages of 17 and 27. They must have no dependants whatever in their countries. They come here on a special contract with a family who will keep them as a member of the family, paying them up to about &#163;35 a week and assisting them to learn English. It is a very good scheme.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Bruce of Donington: </B>   My Lords, I acknowledge that a retreat into nostalgia can be a little dangerous. Will the Minister bear in mind, however, that those who drive along the A.40 pass at Northolt a memorial to the Polish squadron who fought very bravely on our behalf in the war? Are those considerations to be abandoned altogether in these modern times or are we sometimes a little guilty of base ingratitude?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-02_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I have absolutely no difficulty in recognising and agreeing with all that the noble Lord says. We are talking here about one particular scheme. The noble Lord, Lord Dean, made the very real point that there are many ways of coming into this country and visiting it. Many Polish people live here and many of their relatives visit; many of them come in on the schemes. In fact, to return to the normal immigration controls, 141,000 applied to come in last year. Of that figure, 2,000 were refused, but that still means that 139,000 were granted entry into the country. It is just that the level of those staying here illegally and the level of breaches of the scheme is higher in the case of people from Poland, sadly, than it is for those from, say, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   My Lords, if the Government are so worried about abuses of the au pair scheme, why is it not policed better?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-02_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, this matter was raised in relation to another Question I answered the other day. It would be disproportionate to have a policing system on almost every house in the land to check up on what people are doing. Those involved come here on a two-year scheme; it is expected that they will go back. However, it is difficult to detect when a young au pair is working for a friend of the family. We know that there is widespread abuse of the scheme.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, I am trying to understand the Government's position. In a sentence, is the Minister saying that the reason the scheme is not extended to Poland is that, in the Government's view, Polish citizens are more likely to cheat than are the citizens of the Czech Republic, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Hungary, Macedonia, the Slovak Republic and the 11 other European countries? Is that what the Government are saying?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-02_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, no, and that is rather a crude way of putting it. I said that in statistical terms the figures that I gave for Poland are infinitely higher <P>


<a name="column_936"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 936</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>than they are for all the countries named. I do not call it cheating. I am simply saying that the scheme exists and the scope for abuse is greater.

<P>
<A NAME="50703-02_spopq0"></A><B> Baroness David </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they are concerned that the BBC is cutting down on the broadcast of educational programmes.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-02_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, I understand that the BBC has no plans to reduce its output of educational programming. The BBC's own publication, People and Programmes, identified educational programming as an important area which the BBC aimed to develop and strengthen over the next few years. I believe that in this area, as in many others, the UK is fortunate to have the best quality broadcasting services in the world.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-02_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. I certainly support the BBC in its educational service. However, the Minister did not give us much information in that Answer. Can she say whether or not the policy has changed? I understood that it had. For instance, there is greater regionalisation. Can the Minister confirm that? Can the Minister say too whether or not there are more repeats of programmes than before? Also, can she say how many staff have already left and whether more staff are leaving, as is rumoured?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-02_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, dealing with the last point first, staff will be reduced by 40 from a total of 200 and future staffing levels are a matter for the BBC. It has developed a new educational strategy which identifies and aims to meet the educational needs of adults and children learning at home, at work, at school and in colleges. It will broaden the base of the BBC's output and involve the introduction of new services for further education colleges and children of pre-school age, and the Government intend that the new BBC Royal Charter will identify education as one of the BBC's continuing priorities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-02_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Rawlings: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that the BBC World Service is not cutting down on its educational programmes? As technically there is freedom to broadcast to eastern and central Europe, the educational programmes have actually increased. There is more teaching of the English language and support for the Marshall Plan for the Mind of &#163;1.5 million from the know-how fund. Will the Minister ensure that that continues?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-02_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, the Government and the BBC are strongly committed to the future of the World Service. The World Service will continue to contain a broad range of high quality educational programming, including those teaching the use of the English language.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, how much do the Department of Education or institutions of higher education pay the BBC for the broadcasting services it provides for them?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-02_spnew19"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, the BBC pays, not the institutions, except in the case of the Open University. The production costs for the programmes agreed between the BBC and the Open University are met by the Open University.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-02_spnew20"></A><B> Baroness Hilton of Eggardon: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister confirm whether it is part of the new strategy that the Esther Rantzen programme is funded from the educational programming budget?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-02_spnew21"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness will be well aware that education can take many forms. The BBC recognises that reaching people who have not made the most of the formal education system can be difficult. They can be put off by programmes which are labelled "educational". The BBC is looking for ways of providing educational material through mainstream programmes. The Esther Rantzen show is one example and receives a contribution from the education budget to reflect the educational element.

<P>
<A NAME="50703-03_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, can my noble friend confirm that the expected job losses in London may be compensated for by job increases in the regions as a result of the new strategy of moving new programmes to the regions?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, that is one way of looking at the situation. In general, the BBC is keen to find ways of redeploying staff whose jobs disappear. That may include relocation. The extent to which that may be possible is a matter for the BBC and the individuals involved.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, there seems to be a severe difference of opinion between the BBC management, which argues strongly that it is maintaining if not increasing its educational output, and the staff, who see cuts and an increase in repeats. We do not expect the Minister to resolve that problem on the spot, but does she agree that educational broadcasting is one of the main reasons why the BBC holds its privileged position of being in receipt of licence fee money? It would be surprising and certainly imprudent were the BBC ever to contemplate cutting expenditure on educational broadcasting.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-03_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, I wonder whether the noble Lord, Lord Donoughue, received the BBC's educational factsheet, which should have set his mind at rest. I am sure the noble Baroness, Lady David, received it. The BBC recently announced a major increase in investment in programme commissions from outside London. That will not lead to reductions in educational output.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone: </B>   My Lords, can my noble friend arrange with the BBC for the placement in the Library of the document called, BBC Education Programmes&#151;The Facts, which challenges the whole of the factual basis upon which the original Question was based?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-03_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend. I have just referred to that document, which was circulated to interested Peers. If those Peers who are interested but did not receive the document <P>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 938</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>wish to contact me, I shall ensure that they receive individual copies. I shall also ensure that a copy is placed in the Library.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may point out that we all received the factsheet, which was interesting and impressive. But other factsheets are often circulated which contain different facts based on different assumptions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-03_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, having received that factsheet, I am surprised that the Question was pursued.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-03_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may ask the Minister something which has not been mentioned regarding the Open University. Is the noble Baroness aware that the Open University organisation is anxious about the new plans for the broadcasting of its programmes? Everybody recognises that it has been brilliant in the past, but it is worried that many programmes in the future will be delivered at night. That will mean that a good many likely students will miss them. There is a great capacity to excite in the BBC broadcast programmes. People who happen to catch those are stimulated and send in inquiries. The Open University is worried that those people, who make up a large percentage of their students, will miss such programmes if the night-time plans increase.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-03_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, the number of hours of Open University programmes will not be cut. With regard to night programmes, the Government favour any measures which increase the amount of educational programming which it is possible to deliver. The programmes are based on schools, most of which have access to video recorders. Broadcasting overnight allows far more material to be made available to schools. However, there may still be a need to provide programmes during normal school hours and it is for the BBC to determine where to strike the balance.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-03_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   My Lords, there are many more students in higher education in the Open University than in any other establishment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-03_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, I said that there would be no cuts.

But if he is keeping options open on that, should he not also be keeping options open on the exchange rate mechanism?

<A NAME="50703-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, since at the ECOFIN meeting last week it was agreed that there will be no move to a single currency in 1997, I do not think that it is quite necessary to take the line that the noble Lord is pursuing. As regards the first part of his question, in which he offered to support my right honourable friend the Prime Minister, I shall of course convey that back to my right honourable friend. I am sure that he will be most delighted to receive support from such a welcome source.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-03_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Renfrew of Kaimsthorn: </B>   My Lords, may I commend the consistency with which my noble friend has responded to this Question and others on very similar topics in recent months and years and may I also commend the consistency of my right honourable friend the Prime Minister? May I go so far as to ask whether my noble friend will agree that in the light of these repeated assurances there is a risk that the Question from the noble Lord opposite was otiose to the point of superfluity?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-03_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I do not intend to answer the last part of my noble friend's question. As regards consistency, I can assure him that I and all colleagues in Her Majesty's Government have answered this Question and similar Questions with the utmost consistency ever since they were first asked by the noble Lord and other noble Lords in all parts of the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-03_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Merlyn-Rees: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord has given us government policy as of just after three o'clock today. Can he assure the House that it will be exactly the same policy after half-past five tomorrow?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-03_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I can give the noble Lord absolutely that assurance. After half-past five or half-past six tomorrow my right honourable friend the Prime Minister will still be Prime Minster. He will be Prime Minister in two weeks' time, he will be Prime Minister in two years' time, and for many years thereafter.

<A NAME="50703-03_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>   My Lords, may I remind my noble friend&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-03_spnew21"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>  &#151;in a form interrogative by asking whether he remembers that Her Majesty's Government's policy was absolutely clear&#151;that we remained in the ERM&#151;until the glorious 30th September 1990? Would he not agree that we should look for changes which may come under pressure? Would he not further agree that the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, was right to raise this matter, for if we are to have the option of entering the single currency on 1st January 1999, which has not been excluded by the Government, we should have to join the narrow band of the ERM by 1st January 1997, which is really not very far away to allow for a change of policy?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-03_spnew22"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend is absolutely correct that we should look for changes. That is why my right honourable friend the Prime Minister and the entire Government have made it quite clear that we shall keep our options open. That is the deal that my right honourable friend the Prime Minister negotiated at <P>


<a name="column_940"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 940</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Maastricht; and at that time possibly my noble friend supported the deal that my right honourable friend the Prime Minister negotiated.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-03_spnew23"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord does not seem to understand his noble friend's question. That is why the Question is not otiose but is vitally important. Is he aware that the option under Maastricht is a nullity unless we are members of the exchange rate mechanism? That is what we signed in the Maastricht Treaty. The question being put to the noble Lord, which I, too, would like him to answer, is this: if we are not going to join the exchange rate mechanism before 1997, why is his party tearing itself apart on the single currency? The issue will not arise for them. They will not be able to exercise the option because the option will not be there. That is the whole point of the Question. Why does not the noble Lord answer it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-03_spnew24"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I suspect that it is the noble Lord who is in ignorance on these matters. He is right to imply that membership of the ERM is one of the convergence criteria. He then goes on to suggest that the refusal to join implies a ruling out of EMU. That simply is not the case. The exchange rate criterion in the treaty was written at a time when the ERM operated under very different rules from the way it operates at the moment. It is not now clear how the requirement will be measured, but there is no legal or practical need for a formal interpretation of the treaty on the subject now, especially since, as I made quite clear, the 1997 start for the EMU is ruled out. For that reason it is quite clear that we can keep our options open on the ERM until well after the election and we can keep our options on EMU open for considerably longer. We can make up our mind at the time as is appropriate.

<A NAME="50703-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Lord allow me to help him by saying what he really means in answer to the question of the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit? Does he agree that what he means is that perhaps Parliament would be dissolved before January 1997 to allow us both options of keeping with the currency, perhaps under either government?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, as and when Parliament is dissolved is a matter for my right honourable friend the Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, who will be Prime Minister in 1997 and, as I said earlier, will be Prime Minister for considerably longer after that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord seemed to be saying that, as there is no question of joining the single currency by 1997, there is no need to say what the Government are going to do on the exchange rate mechanism. Why in that case, as my noble friend on the Front Bench said, are the Government troubling themselves with the whole question of a single currency? If they are leaving the options on a single currency open until the end of the century or beyond, why do they not also leave the options open on rejoining the exchange rate mechanism, or, as Article 109j says, at least stay within the fluctuation margins of it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I do not think that I can take the noble Lord much further. It is quite obvious that there is no need to make our decisions on either for <P>

<P>

<a name="50703-04_para4"></a>Moved, That the Bill do now pass.&#151;(Lord Trefgarne.)

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-04_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Judd: </B>   My Lords, I shall not detain the House for many moments but there are some things that should be said before the Bill leaves this House. We express our appreciation for the way in which the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, has gone to pains to ensure that we can all understand the purpose of his Bill and for the commendable way in which the Minister explained the Government's support for it. However, it is important to recognise that there are certain points which still need consideration.
<P>

<a name="50703-04_para5"></a>First, all of us on this side of the House who have unqualified admiration for the work of the Commonwealth Development Corporation remain convinced that its role is to increase the number of people participating in the real economies of the third world countries in which it operates. Therefore, the way in which the Bill enables the corporation to function must be judged by how far that objective is or is not fulfilled. It is because of the assurances we received in that respect that we have seen fit to give the Bill a speedy passage through this House.
<P>

<a name="50703-04_para6"></a>One other point should be made at this juncture. Since we began debating the Bill the announcement of the name of the new chairman of the corporation has been made. I believe that all of us who have the privilege of knowing the noble Earl, Lord Cairns, and of his distinguished record not only as a merchant banker but as the chairman for many years of Voluntary Service Overseas and indeed also as a board member of the Overseas Development Institute will feel encouraged that he has the purposes of the corporation, as we understand them, very much at <P>


<a name="column_942"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 942</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>heart. Had we known of his appointment in advance I am sure that it might have encouraged us to give even speedier assistance to the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50703-04_para7"></a>However, we must learn two things from the experience of this Bill. First, if the Bill is so important to the corporation, why was it that Members of this House on all sides were only acquainted of the burning significance of the issues covered by the Bill when it arrived in this House? Why were those who were so well disposed towards the corporation not briefed long before that this was something about which the corporation was frustrated?
<P>

<a name="50703-04_para8"></a>Secondly, why was it that while the Government's own Bill on the future of the corporation was still before both Houses of Parliament we saw this Private Member's Bill brought forward, covering an essential element of the corporation's future which the Government had not seen fit to include in their own Bill, accompanied by protestations from them at every stage that the Bill was essential to the future of the corporation? It seems to us to display some confusions, which are not altogether reassuring, about relationships between the corporation and the Government. We have given a speedy process to the Bill despite our anxieties on that front.
<P>

<a name="50703-04_para9"></a>In recognising that the Bill now goes forward to an inevitably more hazardous phase before the other place, perhaps I may conclude by emphasising that the role of the corporation, as we see it, is a commitment to development, taking the disciplines of good business and the marketplace very seriously rather than being just another business with a development interest.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Trefgarne: </B>   My Lords, I am greatly obliged to the noble Lord for his friendly remarks towards me and the Bill. I hope that that friendliness is repeated by his honourable and right honourable friends in another place when the Bill comes to be considered there, as I hope it will. As regards the reasons why the Bill came forward as it did, rather than as part of the earlier government Bill, the noble Lord may recall that many of us had hoped that it would be possible to amend the government Bill to take into account the proposals contained in my Bill. Sadly, that was not possible within the rules of this House. Those circumstances gave rise to the Private Member's Bill which I have taken the liberty of bringing before your Lordships' House. I am most grateful to the noble Lord for what he said. I hope that your Lordships will now allow the Bill to pass. I commend the Bill to your Lordships.

<a name="50703-04_para11"></a>Bill read a third time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-04_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Blatch </B>   moved Amendment No. 1:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
Leave out Clause 1.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50703-04_para12"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving this amendment and speaking to Amendment No. 2, with the leave of the House I shall also use the opportunity to speak to the starred Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 in the name of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, which I know he will speak to later. Also, for the convenience of the House, I shall speak to government Amendment No. 12 to Schedule 2, which is simply consequential to government Amendment No. 2. Finally, I shall speak to Amendment No. 13 to Schedule 2, in the name of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner.
<P>

<a name="50703-04_para13"></a>The Government have tabled Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 to give effect to the intention, as we understood it, of the clause tabled by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, and others, which was supported by this House at Report stage, and which is now Clause 1 of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50703-04_para14"></a>They have been tabled because the Government take the view that the Bill should not leave the Lords in a technically unsound condition. However, I should make clear to the House that the tabling of the amendments has been undertaken without prejudice to the view that the other place might take of the matter. The Government's position in another place will be for my right honourable friend the Home Secretary to deal with when the Bill is further considered there.
<P>

<a name="50703-04_para15"></a>The current Clause 1 is technically deficient. In particular, it does not provide any mechanism for the hearing of an appeal or establish the powers which would be available to the Court of Appeal when dealing with such appeals.
<P>

<a name="50703-04_para16"></a>Our amendment would therefore replace Clause 1 of the Bill with a clause to amend the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 in order to establish a right of appeal for persons convicted of murder against recommendations made by the courts as to the minimum period which should elapse before the Secretary of State orders their release on licence. The new clause we propose would make clear that appeal lies with the leave of the court, or with a certificate from the trial judge, and would attract the relevant procedural provisions of the 1968 Act.
<P>

<a name="50703-04_para17"></a>We have taken the view that it would be preferable to create a new right of appeal rather than to define an appeal against a minimum recommendation as an appeal against sentence. The recommendation is not a sentence and we do not think that it would be right to suggest that it is. In particular, we take the view that the Court of Appeal should in these cases be able to declare a minimum period which appears to the court to be appropriate, whether this period is shorter or longer than the period originally specified by the trial judge. I had understood this to be the import of the question asked of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, by the noble Lord, Lord Monson, during our previous debate on the subject. We do not think it would be right for the court to be in a position whereby it could not state the recommendation that seemed to it to be right if that period were longer than the original minimum.
<P>


<a name="column_944"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 944</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50703-04_para18"></a>We have not included a power for the Attorney-General to refer unduly lenient recommendations to the Court of Appeal. I would say that we had not understood that that was the will of the House in supporting Clause 1. It is a separate and, I suggest, additional issue.
<P>

<a name="50703-04_para19"></a>That would, however, be the effect of the government new clause were the noble and learned Lord's starred amendments accepted. As I have said, this would not have been the effect of Clause 1; and our objections to such a power do go beyond the reasons I set out in opposition to the original clause.
<P>

<a name="50703-04_para20"></a>As the House will be aware, the Attorney-General's power of reference was introduced in the Criminal Justice Act 1988 to ensure that in the most serious cases it was possible for justice to be done where it appeared that an unduly lenient sentence had been passed by the trial judge. While the original power has been extended to apply to some categories of cases not covered by the original provision, this has only been after very careful consideration.
<P>

<a name="50703-04_para21"></a>In the case of an unduly lenient recommendation some remedy is, of course, already available without the introduction of a power for the Attorney-General to refer cases to the Court of Appeal. The final tariff is set by the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="50703-04_para22"></a>I made clear during Report stage that one reason for thinking that the new clause, which was supported by this House, would not result in the provision of better advice to the Secretary of State was that the holder of that office would be deprived of a second judicial view in any case where the convicted person did not appeal, including those cases where a lenient recommendation had been made. I accept that he or she could obtain a second judicial view in some of those cases if the Attorney-General had a power of reference.
<P>

<a name="50703-04_para23"></a>The Secretary of State finds a second judicial view very valuable. Its lack is, I believe, a necessary consequence of the decision made by your Lordships' House and cannot, with respect, be so easily overcome as the noble and learned Lord may have thought: nor, indeed, could it be the whole answer to the problem. The Attorney-General may well have a view on sentencing but he is not a part of the tariff setting process. He is accustomed to looking at sentencing matters but the minimum recommendations at issue here are rather different. Even if the Attorney-General were given such powers, unless he were to refer all cases which would be an inappropriate use of those powers, there would still be cases coming to the Secretary of State where he did not have the benefit of a second judicial opinion.
<P>

<a name="50703-04_para24"></a>This amendment is therefore not the answer to the problem which I put before your Lordships: indeed, I fear that it risks adding new issues which it would be unwise to attempt to resolve in haste at this late stage in the Bill's passage.
<P>

<a name="50703-04_para25"></a>As the amendment stands, the amendment itself and the practical procedures which lie behind it present unanswered questions. With great respect to the noble and learned Lord, we see some deficiencies in his drafting of his amendment to Amendment No. 2. It refers to,
<P>


<a name="column_945"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 945</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the danger to the public of such release".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50703-04_para26"></a>Those may be grounds why the Parole Board decide not to recommend release on licence of a prisoner at the end of the tariff period, but such grounds are not part of the tariff-setting process which relates to the retributive and deterrent element.
<P>

<a name="50703-04_para27"></a>The amendment is in terms of an appeal by the Attorney-General. In other comparable provisions the procedure is for the Attorney-General to refer the case to the Court of Appeal.
<P>

<a name="50703-04_para28"></a>We also have some reservations about the precision of the words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"if he considers that the recommendation substantially underestimates the gravity of the offence"</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50703-04_para29"></a>though we have not yet had time to reach conclusions on that.
<P>

<a name="50703-04_para30"></a>The Government are equally worried about procedural questions which neither the Government nor this House have had an opportunity properly to consider. In other cases where the Attorney-General has power to refer to the Court of Appeal, his inquiries into particular cases are triggered in practice, as I understand it, by reports from the prosecuting authorities, the reaction of victims or their families, and press reports. Such cases can then be considered by the Attorney-General in the context of established practice, including experience of comparable cases and Court of Appeal guidance, before he decides whether or not to refer the case to the court.
<P>

<a name="50703-04_para31"></a>The position would be distinctly different if the noble and learned Lord's amendment were passed. The amendment would take the Attorney-General into different territory: he would not be dealing with a sentence of a court which, but for his power of reference, would be final. He would be dealing with a recommendation which is not binding on the Home Secretary.
<P>

<a name="50703-04_para32"></a>That in turn raises questions about the respective roles of the Attorney-General and the Home Secretary in such a case. In the initial stages, until a body of Court of Appeal judgments built up, it is difficult to see on what criteria the Attorney-General would decide whether to refer a case. It would, I suggest, look very odd for him to take advice from the Home Secretary in such a matter: but in practice experience of tariff setting, and of the relationship between judges' recommendations and eventual tariffs in different classes of case, would be found only in the Home Office.
<P>

<a name="50703-04_para33"></a>I would not want to rely too heavily on arguments relating to the Attorney-General's workload, but I think the logical consequence of the noble and learned Lord's amendment would be that the Attorney-General would need to consider a reference to the Court of Appeal in every murder case where there was no appeal against the recommendation, if only to make absolutely certain that the Attorney-General was approaching such cases entirely independently rather than linking&#151;and some would say "confusing"&#151;his role with that of the Home Secretary of the day.
<P>

<a name="50703-04_para34"></a>There may be a way through these difficulties. My point is that we have not yet found it and, with great respect to the noble and learned Lord, his amendment <P>


<a name="column_946"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 946</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in relation to the Attorney-General does not give it to us. The Government have tabled amendments to give effect to the specific amendments for which the noble and learned Lord won support in this House, because we regard it as our duty to ensure that this Bill leaves this House in a workable form reflecting the decisions of this House at earlier stages of our proceedings. There was, I concede, a passing reference to the question of a role for the Attorney-General at an earlier stage but that was not an issue clearly before the House when the vote was taken and there are no amendments before the House which would confidently resolve the issue which the noble and learned Lord has raised.
<P>

<a name="50703-04_para35"></a>There are too few stages left in this Bill to risk adding new issues. The Government have gone to some lengths, as I hope the House will recognise, to give effect to amendments which, as your Lordships know, we would have preferred this House not to have passed. I suggest we should confine ourselves to that.
<P>

<a name="50703-04_para36"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, has also tabled an amendment to Schedule 2. That amendment effectively renders redundant&#151;as does government Amendment No. 2&#151;Clause 1 of the Bill. If the House accepts government Amendments Nos. 1 and 2, and whether or not it accepts the noble and learned Lord's starred amendments, Amendments Nos. 3 and 4, and the amendment to schedule 2 proposed here would also be redundant. I hope, therefore, that the noble and learned Lord will agree not to press this amendment to a vote.
<P>

<a name="50703-04_para37"></a>I hope that the House will accept government Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 which, as I have explained, simply seek to give effect to the spirit of Clause 1 of the Bill. The two government amendments to Schedule 2, to which I referred at the outset, are simply consequential on Amendment No. 2, and I hope that they will be accepted on that basis. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   My Lords, it will not surprise the House to know that any amendment moved by the Government which is in the interests of justice will be supported by the judiciary; per contra, any amendments which are designed purely for Executive convenience are likely to be strongly resisted. I put that into practice in regard to the proposed amendment by the Government before we come to my amendment to it. I am quite happy for the essential two differences which have been added by the Government; namely, that before one can appeal leave should be obtained either from the trial judge or from the Court of Appeal. That acts as a useful filter. We did not burden our amendment with that detail but, speaking for myself, I am quite happy to accept it.
<P>

<a name="50703-05_para0"></a>The other important difference is made in subsection (4) of Amendment No. 2, which provides for quite an unusual situation. If a defendant appeals to the Court of Appeal on the basis that the recommendation was excessive and too severe, he can end up not merely losing that appeal, but finding that the Court of Appeal says that the recommendation should have been even higher than it was. That has the nostalgic flavour of the days when one appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal at one's danger because the court had the opportunity not only of dismissing the appeal but of increasing the sentence. It is nostalgic of the days before <P>


<a name="column_947"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 947</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord Goddard. When he presided, one would listen with intense anxiety as to the fate of one's colleagues as they addressed the court and then hoped that one would be in time, if the wind was blowing in the wrong direction, to withdraw one's appeal before the court was able to deal with it. It gave one a sense of modified triumph when one saw the look of disappointment on the faces of the judges in that court. However, that is what is being proposed and I think that that is significant for a reason that I shall develop later.
<P>

<a name="50703-05_para1"></a>Again, speaking for myself, if a person attacks the recommendation as being excessively strong, I see absolutely no reason why the court (which is dealing with a recommendation) should not say, "Since we have to deal with a recommendation and we have guidelines on these matters, we end up saying what in our view is the right recommendation", which is something to which the Home Secretary attaches particular significance. In other words, today&#151;unlike last week&#151;he is saying to what extent the Court of Appeal can be of great assistance to the Home Secretary and he is inviting that assistance in a wholly unfamiliar way, as I have pointed out.
<P>

<a name="50703-05_para2"></a>I return to my amendment. The purposes of the amendment which I moved last Monday were as follows. It achieved open justice. It got rid of the behind-the-scenes activities of the trial judge and the Lord Chief Justice who, without much material to go on, advised the Home Secretary as to the penal part of the sentence, the tariff.
<P>

<a name="50703-05_para3"></a>Secondly, it equated, so far as it could, the procedure in regard to discretionary life sentences so that one did not have an odd contrast between the discretionary life sentence, often imposed in regard to more serious crimes, and the murder mandatory life sentence. Thirdly, as has happened in respect of the discretionary life sentence, it enabled the establishment of guidelines or clear open criteria, so that judges who are going to make, as they are obliged to essentially under the practice direction, except in rare circumstances, the recommendation after hearing argument in open court know what the criteria are and how to proceed with consistency. Those were the three aims to be achieved.
<P>

<a name="50703-05_para4"></a>The noble Baroness has overlooked the fact that the stimulus for my amendment was not some sudden change of tack. The noble Lord, Lord Monson, asked a most perspicacious question in these terms:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I wonder whether in winding up my noble and learned friend Lord Ackner will say whether his amendment will theoretically permit, in certain grave circumstances, the Court of Appeal to recommend an increase in the period which should be served before an individual can be released on licence".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50703-05_para5"></a>Before I answered that question in my reply, the House had the benefit of hearing the Minister. There appeared to be an echo of the noble Lord's anxiety in the following terms. The Minister drew attention to the cases where there would be no appeal by the prisoner against the recommendation. She said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"This might be a considerable proportion of cases&#151;and would certainly include those cases where the judge had erred on the side of an unduly lenient recommendation. This means that precisely in those cases where it would be patently right for the Secretary of State to consider imposing a longer tariff than that recommended, he would have no second judicial view to help him in reaching a decision".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 948</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50703-05_para6"></a>I believed, therefore, that when I replied to the question posed by the noble Lord, Lord Monson, I might, sub silentio, receive some applause from the Minister, because I said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"With regard to the question which was posed to me as to whether with this amendment the Court of Appeal would have the power to increase the recommendation made by the trial judge, I would have thought the answer is clearly yes. But the procedure which would be adopted would no doubt be by process of the Attorney-General seeking to move the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) as he does in other cases where it is alleged there has been under-sentencing".&#151;[Official Report, 26/6/95; cols. 547-553.]</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50703-05_para7"></a>In researching the matter, I found that there was a technical problem. Under the Criminal Justice Act 1988, which gives the Attorney-General his power to intervene where sentences are unduly lenient, he must find a "sentence" because he is operating against unduly lenient sentences. Therefore, given the success of the amendment that was tabled last Monday, he could not proceed to intervene unless and until one made the technical amendment so that the word "sentence", which is defined to cover a multitude of oddities in Section 50 of the Criminal Justice Act 1968, was extended yet further. Your Lordships may be interested to know that it already covers recommendations for deportation (which is not a sentence), confiscation orders and declarations of relevance under the Football Spectators Act.
<P>

<a name="50703-05_para8"></a>Therefore, in the naive conviction that I was serving not only the interests of justice but achieving what is not always easy&#151;that which the Government wanted&#151;I tabled a simple amendment, which your Lordships will see is now Amendment No. 13. It reads:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In section 50 (meaning of sentence), at the end of subsection (1), insert"&#151;</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50703-05_para9"></a>this will come under the definition of "sentence"&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"and a recommendation by the trial judge to the Secretary of State under section 1(2) of the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965 as to the minimum period".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50703-05_para10"></a>That amendment would have tied up the technicality.
<P>

<a name="50703-05_para11"></a>I used Schedule 2 because it dealt with minor and consequential amendments to a number of Acts, including the 1968 Act, which contains the definition of "sentence". I was therefore surprised to receive a long and, as always, immensely courteous letter from the noble Baroness. It was faxed to me at home last Friday and it contained a copy of the amendment which is being moved by her today. It also dealt with the position of the Attorney-General. Perhaps I may read what the noble Baroness stated in regard to the reintroduction in our legislation of power for the Court of Appeal to increase the severity of that which is being ordered:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In considering what I have said above, you will wish to note that the Government amendment"&#151;</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50703-05_para12"></a>that is subsection (4)&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"would ensure that the Court of Appeal was able to quash the minimum recommendation made by the trial judge and put in its place a recommendation for an alternative period. The Court would not be prevented from making a recommendation for a longer period than that recommended by the trial judge, if that seemed appropriate based on the facts of the case. Whilst the power to increase the minimum recommendation would be unlikely to be used with any frequency, we take the view that there might be cases where the Court of Appeal reached the view that the original recommendation was too lenient. In such circumstances, we do not think that it would <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_949"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 949</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>be right for the Court to find itself in a position whereby it could not ensure that the minimum recommendation made to the Secretary of State by the judiciary was the most appropriate one".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50703-05_para13"></a>That is sound thinking but, of course, it relates only to the case in which the appeal is brought by the prisoner.
<P>

<a name="50703-05_para14"></a>The only way of dealing with the situation in which the prisoner does not appeal, and therefore puts himself at risk, is via the Attorney-General who since 1988 has had the power, with the leave of the court, to intervene where sentences are unduly lenient. So why on earth not complete the circle and say that the Court of Appeal can make it clear to the Secretary of State what in its view is the right recommendation, not only when the prisoner appeals but when he, with some sense of wisdom, fails to appeal and the Attorney-General intervenes in order to ensure that judicially&#151;because the recommendation has been made by the trial judge&#151;the judicial recommendation does not run the risk of misleading the public in general and the Home Secretary in particular?
<P>

<a name="50703-05_para15"></a>Of course, that is all part and parcel, one would have thought&#151;naive though I am&#151;of the Government's policy of stressing how firm they are on law and order and that, so far as they can, they will not allow to be left a judicial recommendation which is clearly under-appreciating the severity of the offence or the danger to the public. That is as I thought was the case.
<P>

<a name="50703-05_para16"></a>According to the letter of last Friday, the consideration which moved the Government to resist is stated as follows:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"As you know, the Attorney-General's power of reference was introduced to ensure that there was a remedy available to the Crown in serious cases when unduly lenient sentences appeared to have been passed by trial judges and where justice demanded that the sentence be increased. With an unduly lenient recommendation a remedy is, of course, already available because the tariff is set by the Secretary of State"&#151;</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50703-05_para17"></a>I intervene there to ask why the Court of Appeal should be given power to increase the recommendation on an appeal by a prisoner&#151;I read on:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"and the Attorney-General's power of reference would not, therefore, play the very significant role which it does in the other cases to which it applies".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50703-05_para18"></a>The letter then states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Extending the power of reference in the way you propose would also have potentially serious implications for the workload of the Attorney-General. We could not extend the power without very careful consideration with him and a careful weighing of the merits of such an addition to his role".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50703-05_para19"></a>It does not need a careful weighing; it needs a simple telephone call to Master McKenzie, the Registrar of the Court of Appeal Criminal Division, which I made about an hour ago. For the past four years, since 1991, the Attorney-General has had the power, and therefore the right, to intervene in discretionary life sentence cases where the judge makes his recommendation in open court.
<P>

<a name="50703-05_para20"></a>Consistent with the practice direction in 1993, the judges have been obliged to make such recommendations in all but very rare cases. Therefore, over the years, there must have been a very large number of recommendations made by trial judges. My inquiry of Master McKenzie was very simple. I asked him whether he could tell me how many applications have been made by the Attorney-General&#151;the same judges would be dealing with the mandatory life <P>


<a name="column_950"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 950</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sentence cases&#151;for leave to the Court of Appeal on the basis that the recommendations were unduly lenient. Without a moment's hesitation, because all the applications come before him, he said that there had been none.
<P>

<a name="50703-05_para21"></a>Where is that heavy workload coming from? The same judges will be making the recommendations in the murder cases who make them in the discretionary life sentence cases. So far, their record is such that they have not apparently under-recommended or substantially under-recommended. Why should there be any difference in relation to the same judges going through exactly the same motions as regards murder cases? Why has that simple telephone call not been made?
<P>

<a name="50703-05_para22"></a>I suggest to your Lordships again that the main consideration in the Government's thinking on this subject is Executive convenience; it is not justice at all. It was the conflict between those two considerations which lost the Government the amendment which I moved last Monday. There is a risk that the Attorney-General may not take the same line as the Home Secretary. He may move in cases in which the Home Secretary wished he did not; or when appearing before the Court of Appeal, having obtained leave, he may put forward what he considers is the right recommendation cheerfully adopted by the Court of Appeal Criminal Division. Of course I speak only from a convenience point of view. But what will then be the situation when publicly the Home Secretary doubles that which both the Attorney-General and the Court of Appeal Criminal Division have endorsed? There may be inconvenience and there may be embarrassment, but if the Attorney-General is kept out of the matter so that it is a one-sided situation, that problem does not arise.
<P>

<a name="50703-05_para23"></a>There is a strange pettiness about the Executive's approach to this clear matter of justice. I invite your Lordships to take the view that there is no earthly reason why this amendment should not be accepted. To say that we are injecting something quite different from that which was contemplated by the House is quite wrong.
<P>

<a name="50703-05_para24"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Monson, raised the point. I did not raise it. I plead guilty to that for two reasons: first, I did not realise the technical problems which would have to be surmounted; and, secondly, I assumed&#151;hence the somewhat confident telephone call to Master McKenzie&#151;that the Attorney-General would not have been very active on this subject. Therefore, it had not entered my mind that it would be necessary. But, quite clearly, from a theoretical point of view the power should exist. It exists with regard to discretionary life sentences because when the judge makes his recommendation in those cases there comes into existence an order. Because that happens, power is given to the Attorney-General under the 1988 Act to intervene in relation to any sentence since a sentence is defined by Section 50 of the 1968 Act as including any order.
<P>

<a name="50703-05_para25"></a>As I have indicated to your Lordships, this is a simple, technical matter involving no form of major alteration. It is merely a tidying-up operation which I overlooked. I should tell your Lordships that I have spoken to my noble and learned friend the Lord Chief Justice, who endorses wholeheartedly my recommendation and my amendment.
<P>

<P>

<a name="50703-05_para26"></a>The noble Baroness has criticised the drafting of my amendment but she has not criticised the drafting of the amendment to Schedule 2. For my part, she may make her choice. The amendment to Schedule 2 achieves exactly the same objective. But when the noble Baroness tabled her amendment I thought, returning the compliment, that as a matter of tidiness it would be better if everything on this subject were dealt with in one place and that one should not look for the position of the Attorney-General in the schedule but that it should be found all in one section.
<P>

<a name="50703-05_para27"></a>I need not take the matter much further. This is not a filibustering speech, as I mentioned with regard to last Monday, but the sitting Law Lords are still, as one would expect them to be, sitting, although I have little doubt of their support. The retired Law Lords, genially known by their brothers as members of "the mothball fleet", are here in quite extensive numbers. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lane: </B>   My Lords, I am not quite sure whether this is the right time for one of the mothballs to stand up to support the amendment moved by my noble and learned friend Lord Ackner. However, I shall be very brief because my noble and learned friend covered all the points that seem to me to arise. Judges, being human, may make mistakes. They may make a mistake by sentencing over harshly, or they may make a mistake by sentencing too leniently. Hence the right of the Attorney-General, again after many years of argument, to apply to the court to increase sentences which he considers to be over lenient. That is in the ordinary run of the case. But it is just as important&#151;indeed, perhaps more important&#151;that he should have that right when making recommendations in life sentence cases. It is only by that method that the Court of Appeal will be able to produce a body of guidelines sufficiently based upon applications made to it.
<P>

<a name="50703-06_para0"></a>At present, in the way that the Minister mentioned, the only way that the matter of an over-lenient sentence can be rectified is if the defendant himself is rash enough to apply to the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division, to have his sentence reduced because it is too severe. If he has the sense to keep quiet and say nothing, as things stand and without the amendment of my noble and learned friend Lord Ackner, there is no method by which the matter can be considered by the Court of Appeal. It is that hiatus&#151;and it is a dangerous one&#151;which the amendment seeks to cure. I therefore support it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lowry: </B>   My Lords, deluded by my own inexperience, when I saw the Minister's amendment I thought for a moment or two that the Government were accepting the general principle of the suggested amendment moved by my noble and learned friend last week. Of course, that was wrong. I am not being sarcastic when I say that. I realise that when an amendment goes through it is the Government's duty to ensure that it goes to the other place in the most acceptable possible form, even if they do not like the amendment itself. Perhaps I may say, in parenthesis, that I very much hope that the other place will accept this part of the Bill in the state in which it finally leaves your Lordships' House.
<P>


<a name="column_952"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 952</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50703-06_para1"></a>I wish to support my noble and learned friends in what they said about the position of the Attorney-General. I believe that he should be able to appeal or to refer the matter, whichever phraseology one likes to employ. He already can do so with discretionary sentences, including discretionary life sentences. Frankly I did not like that provision when it was introduced. I tried to stop it in Northern Ireland, but I did not succeed. I had a feeling that when one achieved finality, even if occasionally the accused was rather fortunate in his judge, it should be an end to the matter. However, it is not. Therefore, I believe that we should be consistent about the role of the Attorney-General. I have much more heart in saying that because the Attorney-General would be trying to get a recommendation changed and not trying to interfere with something which had achieved finality.
<P>

<a name="50703-06_para2"></a>I have just five very short points to make. In being brief I hope that your Lordships will not, for that reason, consider them entirely insignificant. First, the role of the Attorney-General in looking at a life sentence is not quite the same as that of the Executive. That point was made very cogently by the noble Baroness when the point was last debated. Secondly, the Home Secretary is not considering only the same matters as the Attorney-General and the courts when he is coming to his final conclusion. He can take into account certain considerations and he can differ not only from the court but also from the Attorney-General without, indeed, showing disagreement.
<P>

<a name="50703-06_para3"></a>Thirdly, the Royal prerogative can now be exercised in a way which can exhibit a difference from something which the Attorney-General, or those acting on his behalf, have been arguing in court. For example, when an accused person appeals against sentence to the Court of Appeal and the Crown presents arguments the other way, what the Home Secretary might finally do may, to the untutored mind, appear to run counter to something which the Crown had said. That, of course, is also true when the Attorney-General refers what he considers to be an unduly lenient sentence to the Court of Appeal. Admittedly, I am talking about the Royal prerogative and not about the statutory procedure in dealing with mandatory life sentences.
<P>

<a name="50703-06_para4"></a>Fourthly, why should we not trust the Attorney-General to behave with good judgment and discretion? Why should we foresee that as a complicating factor? Further&#151;and this relates to something that I said last week but which I believe is still relevant&#151;is it not best that the Home Secretary should receive the greatest possible assistance before he has to apply his own mind to the subject?
<P>

<a name="50703-06_para5"></a>Fifthly, in deference to the noble Baroness, and confirming what I ventured to say about her last week, your Lordships will have been impressed by the way in which she put the point. I believe that the noble Baroness has a much easier brief this week, but not perhaps one in which she ought to prevail. However, I agree that this is a more open question than the original question of principle. But I still think that it would be very much better if both sides were able to go further if necessary.
<P>


<a name="column_953"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bridge of Harwich: </B>   My Lords, I have but a few words to say. It seems to me that the central issue here is very clear. Surely it must be quite illogical that the Court of Appeal should have power to increase the length of the recommended tariff, which has been made by the trial judge where the defendant has appealed, but no such power where he has not. No amount of technicality can hide that illogicality.
<P>

<a name="50703-06_para6"></a>My noble and learned friend Lord Ackner referred with nostalgia to the days when Lord Goddard presided in the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division. I do not regard those days with nostalgia at all. At that time, the power to increase the sentence when a prisoner appealed against it was simply used in terrorem of appellants to keep down the lists. That was most unsatisfactory and that is why it went. Surely the logical thing to do, if one is to allow an increase in the recommended tariff period when an appeal is brought, is to provide some mechanism to enable an inadequately recommended tariff by the trial judge to be corrected when a defendant does not appeal.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Allen of Abbeydale: </B>   My Lords, as a non-lawyer, I should like to say just a few words on the topic. I would prefer not to see the clause in the Bill. I find the repetition of the case for it that we have heard today no more persuasive than I found it last week. I thought the Minister's answer disposed of it pretty completely, but I know that that is not the issue today.
<P>

<a name="50703-06_para7"></a>I would just make two points. First, I have grave doubts about the drafting. I am not a lawyer but I have had a good deal of experience of drafting Bills. I have also had a good deal of experience of the unsatisfactory result of putting things in at the last possible moment without adequate time for consideration. I sometimes think there is some merit in the procedure in the other place where one cannot amend a Bill on Third Reading.
<P>

<a name="50703-06_para8"></a>Secondly, it seems to me that there is a much greater and clearer distinction between the discretionary life sentence and the mandatory life sentence procedure, and that in the case of the mandatory sentence the risk to which the Minister has drawn attention of confusing the role of the Home Secretary and the Attorney-General is considerable. For other reasons, too, I am against the amendment we are now considering.
<P>

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   My Lords, there is really no further argument that needs to be advanced. The case has been cogently and to my mind conclusively argued by my noble and learned friend Lord Ackner. It has been supported by a former Lord Chief Justice, and a former Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland. My noble and learned friend Lord Ackner says that his amendment also has the support of the present Lord Chief Justice. Further, your Lordships have heard from my noble and learned friend Lord Bridge, a former member of the Court of Appeal and&#151;may I also say?&#151;a former Treasury devil, so particularly cognisant of the viewpoint of the Executive.
<P>

<a name="50703-06_para9"></a>This amendment covers the responsibility of the Home Office, the Attorney-General and the judiciary. I hope that your Lordships will acquit me of egotism if I <P>


<a name="column_954"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 954</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>say that I support the amendment as a former Home Office Minister, a former Law Officer and a former judge. There is only one other thing that I would venture to say. The Minister seems slightly minatory about what might happen in the other place. It would be extraordinarily foolish if the Government encouraged the other place, using their Whip, to challenge your Lordships' view carried so strongly in numbers, particularly when one considers that there are 18 payroll votes in support of the Government, and, perhaps even more strongly, when one considers how the voting went in the Division Lobbies. It seems to me that the Government would be in danger of losing the whole Bill because I can conceive of no reason why your Lordships should change their view after such cogent argument and after such consideration. For the moment I support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-06_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone: </B>   My Lords, I wonder whether I could be foolish enough to intervene in this interesting discussion. I was not able for family reasons to attend the debate which was held on the occasion when the Government were beaten by five votes. However, I believe that I have read every word of the debate. I had the most intense sympathy with my noble friend Lady Blatch. She was given an absolutely unrelenting brief by the Home Office with no room for manoeuvre at all and without any technical knowledge of her own to bring to her support if she wished to relent in any way. Therefore no blame attaches to her either for the result or for the fact that she did not make any concession.
<P>

<a name="50703-06_para10"></a>I speak now not as someone with a professional background, although I suppose from the time when I was called to the Bar in 1932 to the time when I resigned as Lord Chancellor in 1987 I must have dealt, in one way or another, with 40 or 50 murder cases, even confining myself to that limited range of subjects. I think it is absolutely lamentable that the Government should find themselves&#151;I speak now as a politician&#151;in opposition to what is virtually a united judiciary. They really ought to listen to what has been said by this united branch of most distinguished lawyers speaking on their own subject. I have rather heretical views but I feel that the Government ought to have given way and ought to give way on the substantive issue which was discussed last time and as to which they have introduced what is virtually a drafting amendment but without commitment as to what they will do in another place. It is extreme folly on the part of the Government to disregard professional opinion to this extent.
<P>

<a name="50703-06_para11"></a>Having said that, I want to express my own perhaps more foolish view. It all arises from the mandatory life sentence itself. If there were no mandatory life sentence at all attaching to murder&#151;I have said this in both a judicial and a political capacity&#151;this problem would not arise. Why is there a mandatory life sentence? Murder is not a single crime; it is a bundle of crimes of vastly different culpability and wickedness. It includes the doctor who terminates the life of a dying patient in order to save pain. It includes the case which we have seen in the newspapers today of Private Clegg&#151;about which I shall say nothing other than to mention it&#151;who is being let out after four years only. In my opinion he ought never <P>


<a name="column_955"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 955</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to have been prosecuted at all. Murder includes the wickedest crimes. There are two factors which we must bear in mind when we deal with murder or indeed homicide of any kind. The first is that murder is, as I say, a bundle of crimes of vastly different culpability. There is also a sheer lottery about it because it all depends on whether the victim dies within a year and a day. If he does not die within a year and a day, it is not murder; it is an ordinary crime of violence and the offender is subject to the ordinary discretionary laws of sentencing for any other ordinary crime.
<P>

<a name="50703-06_para12"></a>Murder is a "result" crime which depends upon the chances of the criminal having been successful in ending the life of the victim within a year and a day. I wonder what possible justification there is in the light of those two facts for the existence of the mandatory life sentence at all. We must also remember that we are dealing in the case of the discretionary life sentence, which is a different apparatus of law, with another rather curious thing. That does not mean life. It can mean life and it has certain permanent consequences attached to it, but it is in fact a sentence of imprisonment for an indefinite period. It is not a sentence for 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 years, or for the whole of a life.
<P>

<a name="50703-06_para13"></a>I believe that the Government should approach the judiciary with a greater degree of respect than they have shown in this case. I do not think I have ever known such unanimity to be expressed from the noble and learned Benches as has been expressed in these two debates. I think a little more give and take ought to be displayed by the Home Office and the Home Secretary on both issues which have been discussed today. I shall not take up any more time by inflicting my variously heretical opinions upon your Lordships.

<a name="50703-07_para0"></a>Perhaps a non-lawyer may intervene briefly to try to establish what common ground there is and what it is we are arguing about. We are not arguing about the mandatory life sentence. That issue is not before the House today. There are two views on the matter, but it is part of the law and it has to be accepted. I do not believe that we are even arguing about the merits or otherwise of the amendment that was carried last Monday. There can also be two views on that issue. It was carried by the House, and in my view the Government behaved perfectly honourably by seeking to clean up the amendment to make it acceptable in legislative terms to go to another place. Though I very much respect the views of the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, on these matters, nevertheless the issue decided last Monday is not before us today.
<P>

<a name="50703-07_para1"></a>We are speaking today about a marginal issue. The issue is whether, in one type of case only&#151;a mandatory life sentence where there has been no appeal against sentence&#151;there should be an opportunity for the state (it does not matter whether it is the Attorney-General or the Home Secretary in this sense) to appeal against too lenient a sentence. I am very much opposed to excessive <P>


<a name="column_956"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 956</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sentences and I am rather opposed to the idea of appeals against sentences on the ground that the state believes that they are too lenient. I am encouraged in that view by the description given by noble and learned Lords of the lottery that existed in the Court of Appeal a number of years ago. I did not quite understand the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bridge, but I believe that he described it as a rule of terror. That horrifies me. I would hate to think that any amendment would take us back to that. But whatever we may think about it, that issue is not before the House today.
<P>

<a name="50703-07_para2"></a>The question before the House today is whether we are completing the object of the amendment which was carried last week by extending it to the power of the Attorney-General to appeal to achieve a more stringent or longer sentence. In pure logic, not emotion, I do not believe that there is an answer to the case put by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner. I do not believe that when he moved his amendment he had thought it out adequately, nor do I believe that he was prepared for the question put by the noble Lord, Lord Monson. I do not believe that it was implicit in what was said in that lengthy debate; but in logic, if that was what was carried last week, we have to carry something on the lines of what the noble and learned Lord has said today.

<A NAME="50703-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bridge of Harwich: </B>   My Lords, I should like to correct a mishearing of what I said. The phrase that I used in reference Lord Goddard's regime was that he used the power to increase sentences in terrorem to discourage appellants. If one appealed, one was in danger of having one's sentence increased.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I do not understand that. Is that a reign of terror or not?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bridge of Harwich: </B>   One uses the power in terrorem to discourage people from appealing. Perhaps it is a technical legal expression.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   It sounds bad enough to me.

<P>
<A NAME="50703-07_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Speaker   (The Earl of Listowel): </B>  The Question is that this amendment be agreed to. As many as are of that opinion will say Content.

<P>
<A NAME="50703-07_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone: </B>   My Lords, I believe that we are discussing the amendment proposed by my noble friend Lady Blatch, which I understand not to be opposed in any way. The words Not-Content which emerged from the Benches behind me&#151;I speak not in terrorem&#151;possibly resulted from a misunderstanding.

<P>
<A NAME="50703-07_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, I apologise. I believe that we are now terrified.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-07_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I believe that, as we have spoken so much about the amendment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, the House has become rather emotionally attached to voting upon it. The amendment <P>

(". After section 11 of the 1968 Act insert&#151;
<center><b>"Appeal against recommendation</B></center><center><b>Appeal against recommendation in case of life sentence for murder.</B></center><br>
11A.&#151;(1) Where under section 1(2) of the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965 a court has made a recommendation to the Secretary of State as to the minimum period which should elapse before he orders the release on licence of a person convicted of murder, the person may appeal to the Court of Appeal against the recommendation.

(2) Subject to subsection (3) below, an appeal under this section lies only with the leave of the Court of Appeal.

(2) Nothing in subsection (1) (b) (i) or (c) shall prevent the making of a reference if it appears to the Commission that there are exceptional circumstances which justify making it.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50703-08_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I understand my noble and learned friend's confusion, but Amendment No. 1 was voted on.
<P>

<a name="50703-08_para1"></a>Turning to Amendment No. 5, Clause 14(1), as drafted, sets out the broad criteria for the referral of a conviction, verdict or finding by the commission to the courts. Essentially it requires that there must appear to be a real possibility that the conviction, verdict or finding will not be upheld on appeal following a reference and that there is some new element, whether argument or evidence, for the courts to consider before they should be asked to look at the case again.
<P>

<a name="50703-08_para2"></a>These criteria are framed so as to enable the commission to refer possible convictions to the courts so as to discourage unmeritorious applications and references, while at the same time ensuring that cases which should be decided again by the courts are not prevented from going back there by what will be the only remaining avenue. We have always recognised that this is a delicate balance to strike; and so I listened very carefully to all that was said by your Lordships in Committee and last week during the Report stage of the Bill. As I acknowledged then, we saw the force of some of the concerns put forward by the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, the noble Viscount, Lord Runciman, and others. Clearly in setting reasonable criteria for references we must ensure that references are not precluded in circumstances where injustice would result. Although, given their width, the circumstances in which a case which does not need the present criteria but will nevertheless merit referral will clearly be rare, we must ensure that such a referral is still possible.
<P>

<a name="50703-08_para3"></a>I undertook at Report stage to bring forward the appropriate amendments today. My first amendment, Amendment No. 5, replaces subsections (1), (2) and (3) of Clause 14 with two new subsections. These enable the commission to refer a conviction, verdict or finding in the exceptional case where the existing criterion for there to be argument or evidence not already raised in any relevant proceedings is not met yet but there are nevertheless compelling reasons to justify its referral.
<P>

<a name="50703-08_para4"></a>The second amendment is purely a drafting amendment. It effectively divides Clause 14, as amended, into two new clauses, thus making its terms clearer and easier to understand. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-08_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Mallalieu: </B>   My Lords, I rise to support the amendment and in particular to thank the noble Baroness for having listened to concerns expressed in various parts of the House during the earlier stages of the Bill. I and others were concerned that the commission might find itself in a position where it considered that there was a possibility that a conviction was unsafe and was unlikely to be upheld if referred back to the court but felt unable to do so because the evidence or argument was not new and had been raised in some form, however rudimentary or unsatisfactory, at an earlier hearing.

<P>

<a name="50703-08_para5"></a>In her letter to my noble friend Lord McIntosh of Haringey, the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, was good enough to explain the amendments that she now proposes and to amplify her understanding of the expression "exceptional circumstances" in Amendment No. 5. She stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"These could include, for example, a case where the defence had failed to represent adequately the defence's case to the court at trial or on appeal, or where the court has developed the law by accepting an argument which it has previously rejected".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50703-08_para6"></a>Those were the main worries which I and others expressed at earlier stages of the Bill. We are glad to see that this amendment makes it clear that the commission now has wide discretion to refer appropriate cases.
<P>

<a name="50703-08_para7"></a>I accept the distinction that the noble Baroness draws between conviction cases and sentence cases and am grateful to her for bringing forward these amendments in this way.

<FONT SIZE=3>to the Secretary of State on the discharge of its functions. I said at Report stage, in response to an amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Greenwich, that I saw some merit in making it clear on the face of the statute that the commission could comment in its annual reports, if it chooses, on the sufficiency of its own powers and procedures and that I intended to bring forward an amendment to this effect. This amendment is the result. As your Lordships see, it empowers the commission to include in its annual reports to the Secretary of State any comments it wishes to make on any matters which have caused it concern, or whatever, in relation to the working of its functions and powers as set out in Clauses 10 to 25 of the Bill; and of course it may also make any recommendations relating to any of those provisions.

<A NAME="50703-08_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that the Bill do now pass.
<P>

<a name="50703-08_para23"></a>I said at Second Reading that this Bill is a measure of great importance for it is concerned with both the pursuit of justice and with public confidence: confidence that justice is done and is seen to be done. That this is true has been amply demonstrated by our debates both today and at earlier stages in our discussions. Perhaps I may say that I was greatly heartened by the warm welcome which the Bill received in your Lordships' House and by the constructive approach which has characterised our discussions.
<P>

<a name="50703-08_para24"></a>There have, I think, been three main areas on which our debates have concentrated: the criteria for referral, the commission's investigative powers and, lastly, openness and disclosure, and in particular the degree to which the commission will be able to disclose information to applicants.
<P>


<a name="column_963"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 963</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50703-08_para25"></a>The Bill places broad conditions on the power of the commission to refer convictions, verdicts, findings and sentences to the courts. Their purpose is to guide both the commission and those wishing to make representations as to the sort of circumstances in which it will be appropriate for the courts to hear a further appeal as a last resort. But the criteria must not exclude any case in which an injustice would result if it could not be referred. Following the very helpful earlier debates on this issue in your Lordships' House we have again looked at this. As a result we have extended the existing criteria in the Bill so that the commission may in exceptional circumstances refer a conviction, verdict or a finding to the courts even where the very broad criteria in Clause 14(1) (b) (i) are not met. I am grateful to your Lordships for your contributions to this debate at each stage.
<P>

<a name="50703-08_para26"></a>A number of your Lordships have rightly stressed the importance of putting in place procedures for investigating cases which are both effective and independent. To that end, the powers in the Bill for the commission to engage the assistance of police forces and other public bodies and the commission's ability to employ professional experts of all kinds are of the utmost importance. Here again your Lordships have been instrumental in strengthening the commission's powers. The commission will have various means of investigating at its disposal, and the police will play a vital part in helping it. The extent to which the commission's own staff or those it may contract from outside will take part in investigations has been the subject of much scrutiny and much helpful discussion. The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, and I have had a helpful further discussion since Report stage, and I am happy to confirm the position.
<P>

<a name="50703-08_para27"></a>So far as the power to investigate is concerned, Clauses 19 and 20 enable the commission to co-opt police officers or, if appropriate, members of other public bodies. They do not require the commission to do so. The commission will be resourced and equipped on the basis that it will make full use of its Clause 19 powers to request police assistance. But its resources will certainly allow it, if necessary, in an exceptional case to do itself or to commission others to do work that would otherwise normally be done by police officers. The commission will in any case do, or commission others to do, a good deal of investigating of a kind that is not specifically police-type work.
<P>

<a name="50703-08_para28"></a>Our debates focused very properly, too, on the accountability of the commission, which is a necessary counterpart to its independence. The Bill contains provisions that will require the commission to submit to my right honourable friend the Home Secretary an annual report on its work, together with appropriate accounts. Both will be laid by him before Parliament. The Bill also now makes it clear that its reports may include any matters which the commission may wish to bring to the attention of the Home Secretary with regard to the sufficiency of Clauses 10 to 25 once in force.
<P>

<a name="50703-08_para29"></a>But parliamentary scrutiny is just one aspect of the openness of the commission's work for which the Bill provides. The Bill requires a statement of the commission's reasons for referring a case to be sent to <P>


<a name="column_964"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 964</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the court where a case is so referred and requires that statement to be copied to all the likely parties to the resulting appeal. The Bill also requires that a fully reasoned explanation of any decision not to refer to be given by the commission to the applicant. We have further provided that the commission may disclose such information as may be appropriate in the individual circumstances of the case. Thus the commission will have full power to discharge its obligations of disclosure in the interests of fairness to the applicant within the framework determined by the courts.
<P>

<a name="50703-08_para30"></a>One issue not directly related to the main focus of the Bill has, of course, exercised this House; namely, the creation of a right of appeal against a minimum recommendation made by the trial judge under the terms of the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965. I would simply remind the House, as I made clear earlier, that the amendments tabled by the Government on this matter are without prejudice to the view that the other place might take. I think that we shall rue the day if we believe in this House that we can take a view that the other place should never be critical or take a contrary view simply because of the size of the majority in this place. When a matter is considered in another place, it is considered by another place entirely on its merits, and Members are entirely free of the elected Chamber and wholly accountable to members of the public outside Parliament to take a view independently of the size of the majority in this House.
<P>

<a name="50703-08_para31"></a>The Government are fully committed to putting in place the best&#151;the most effective&#151;criminal justice system that it is possible to provide. With this Bill, we have taken another major step towards achieving that aim.
<P>

<a name="50703-08_para32"></a>In conclusion, I thank all noble Lords on the Front Benches opposite who have been so constructive and helpful during the course of this debate. I also thank my eminent adversary, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, towards whom I promise I bear absolutely no malice. I have been daunted by the sheer weight of argument and legal support that have streamed in here after four o'clock on each of the afternoons that we have met. I hope again that we have been sufficiently constructive to open up a very healthy debate in this House.
<P>

<a name="50703-08_para33"></a>That leaves me only to thank my noble friend Lady Trumpington, who gave me enormous support on these Benches, as did my noble friends behind me. The Bill has clearly benefited from the attention that your Lordships gave to it and important improvements have resulted. The public will have reason to be grateful for the contributions made in our debates, just as I am grateful for the spirit in which they were all put forward.

<A NAME="50703-08_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Houghton of Sowerby: </B>   My Lords, the final stages of this Bill have been for us something of an intellectual ordeal&#151;and possibly, if I may say so with great respect, for the noble Baroness herself. You have to be a High Court judge to understand all the intricacies of the debate through which we just went. However, this <P>


<a name="column_965"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 965</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Bill in its original form received the full approval of this House. I re-read the debate at Second Reading and saw how unanimous was approval for the Bill in that form. It was only when the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, introduced on Report his amendment regarding life sentence recommendations that we got into controversial deep water.
<P>

<a name="50703-08_para35"></a>I hope that the Government will not send the Bill back to this House with the new clause in it. The noble Baroness reserved the Government's position on the principle of the matter, as I understood her remarks at the beginning. However, I hope, now that this House has accepted the technical dressing up of the amendment, that it will present no technical difficulties; and I hope that it will present no difficulties on grounds of policy. After all these years of controversy about the penalties imposed on those who are found guilty of murder, this House is entitled to take any opportunity of looking at experience and of trying to bring to bear a degree of humanity, if no more, upon a very difficult subject.
<P>

<a name="50703-08_para36"></a>I do not believe that all murderers are bad people. I believe that good people sometimes suffer from the passions and feelings of human beings which from time immemorial have occasionally governed human conduct. If we look at history in all its forms, we see the emotional reactions of the deeply embedded psyche of the living creature to a situation that dominates all attempts at reason or logical decision. One must sometimes deeply sympathise with those who get into this dreadful situation.
<P>

<a name="50703-08_para37"></a>We can at least, however, deal with some of the consequences of the actions taken in the past by Parliament in relation to this matter. Parliament said that capital punishment should end; and it has said more than once since then that capital punishment will not be reintroduced. I am sad to hear that one of the contestants for the leadership of the Conservative Party has taken on board, in his policy manifesto, support for the return of capital punishment. I regard that as a disqualification right away. It just shows that his political thinking is no better than that which existed 50 years ago.
<P>

<a name="50703-08_para38"></a>When we decide that we shall no longer kill those who are convicted of murder, we have to consider what are the consequences of the alternative that we adopt. Without repeating the remarks I made last week, I feel that the amendment to the Bill in its present form meets the desire for a little more humanity and a little more certainty about the sentence of life imprisonment. Life imprisonment is a sham. We all know that. Only in very extreme circumstances does anyone serve a sentence literally for life.
<P>

<a name="50703-08_para39"></a>Therefore, we must consider what we are doing to people. They are men and women. We have decreed that they shall be treated as human beings. We must do our best to give them the opportunity to earn some respite from the horrors of prison and re-enter their previous free life. Humanity must be uppermost in all matters relating to crime, which is one of those big subjects about which it would be unfair to release on the House a lot of philosophical considerations.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50703-08_para40"></a>Let me finish my pleading that the Bill as it stands now should be accepted by the Government. It should not be sent back. Despite the little difficulties over Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 we can feel that we have achieved something worthwhile in the Bill as a whole. We need have no reservations whatever about the wisdom of having put some hope in the minds of those who are sentenced to life imprisonment so that at any rate there exists a target to which they may work and, if they or those advising them feel that the sentence is excessive, there is the right to have it reviewed. That, uttered at the beginning, is the right of the prisoner. Therefore, in all the circumstances, I support the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, in case we are tempted to be too satisfied with ourselves as we come to the end of the Bill, we should remember the very serious problems with the criminal justice system that gave rise to the appointment of the Runciman Royal Commission and, following the Royal Commission, the first drafting of this Bill.
<P>

<a name="50703-09_para0"></a>The discussion document issued last year by the Home Office mentioned three objectives for what was then called a criminal cases review authority. One was that conditions which cannot be considered safe are quashed, leaving those which are safe to stand. The second was that there must be arrangements to ensure that doubts about the safety of a conviction can be considered and resolved at the earliest opportunity. The third was to ensure consistency of approach in criminal proceedings. None of those existed before the Royal Commission&#151;or, rather, before the rather horrific cases which gave rise to the appointment of the Royal Commission.
<P>

<a name="50703-09_para1"></a>It is a fact that, whether or not they were IRA terrorist cases&#151;many of them were not&#151;there were a number of cases where the procedures before and at trial in very serious offences were inadequate, where the investigations after trial and after conviction were inadequate, where the ability and sometimes the willingness of the Court of Appeal to accept the results of those investigations and the new information were wholly inadequate, and where there was a serious question about the independence of the review procedures which exist to correct miscarriage of justice. As a result, there was a whole series of cases of miscarriage of justice, which sometimes took 15 years or more after conviction to correct. Indeed, in my view, and in particular in the Bridgewater case, there are some which have still not been corrected. Let us be in no doubt about the seriousness of the issues which lie behind the Bill and its predecessor commission.
<P>

<a name="50703-09_para2"></a>Having said that, I pay tribute to the integrity of objective of the Government in the discussion paper last April. But before that I pay tribute to the Runciman Royal Commission, which must take precedence over all. I pay tribute to the discussion document in trying to implement the results of the Runciman Commission. I also pay tribute to those who persuaded the Prime Minister that it was possible to get the Bill into this year's legislative programme. Apparently it was only at the last minute, but we have it and we are grateful for that. Again, I pay tribute to those who have been <P>


<a name="column_967"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 967</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>involved in drafting the Bill, in the presentation of the Bill in this House, and in the discussions that have taken place.
<P>

<a name="50703-09_para3"></a>The Minister referred to three particular issues. One was the basis on which the commission might refer cases to the Court of Appeal. As we have heard within the last half hour, the ability of the commission to refer cases is not to be restricted to a very simple, and possibly over-simple, form of words. There are powers to make other referrals in exceptional circumstances. My noble friend Lady Mallalieu played a most valuable part in achieving that objective.
<P>

<a name="50703-09_para4"></a>The second issue to which the Minister referred was the investigative powers of the commission. We have always accepted that the majority of investigations should be carried out by the police or comparable bodies. After all, they were the ones involved in the original investigations. They start with greater knowledge than anyone else and it is common sense that in most cases the investigation should return to them. What has been achieved in the passage of the Bill, as the Minister rightly reminded us, is a considerable extension of the powers of the commission to direct investigations and, as she said in her reply a few minutes ago, to carry out investigations themselves. I am enormously grateful to her for the way in which she approached this issue and accepted the necessity for the integrity and independence of the commission as an investigative body to be maintained and enshrined in statute.
<P>

<a name="50703-09_para5"></a>The third issue to which she referred was disclosure. I must confess that we have not achieved the kind of changes that we wished. It is still the case that disclosure is the exception rather than the rule in what I think of as Clauses 22 and 23 but which no doubt are differently numbered now. It is still the case that there is insufficient protection for appellants to ensure that after their trial they have access to the information that is necessary for them to put forward an effective case. But, as we understand it, disclosure is to be the central subject of a major criminal justice Bill to be introduced probably in the next Session. Nobody can say what will be in the Queen's Speech&#151;if there is to be a Queen's Speech from this Government&#151;and therefore I am content to leave that issue until we come to the major debates on disclosure at that stage.
<P>

<a name="50703-09_para6"></a>I do not think that we have obtained all that we wanted on legal aid. I am sure that my noble friend Lady Mallalieu will agree on that. Nevertheless, there have been improvements in the conditions for legal aid.
<P>

<a name="50703-09_para7"></a>The Bill started off as a well intentioned and honourable Bill. It lands up as a good Bill. This House can be proud of the changes that have taken place. I am grateful for the collaboration of noble Lords on the Liberal Democrat Benches; the noble Lords, Lord Rodgers and Lord Harris. I am grateful to my noble friend Lady Mallalieu and to Ministers on the Front Bench.
<P>

<a name="50703-09_para8"></a>I found myself in the rather strange position of being a constant ally of the judges. That is not normally my position. Their interventions were constructive and, when I fully understood them, I tended on the whole to agree with them. I admire and respect the noble and <P>


<a name="column_968"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 968</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>learned Lord, Lord Ackner, and his colleagues for their persistence in putting forward those points. We end up with a Bill which will satisfy the noble Viscount, Lord Runciman. For me, personally, it is a Bill which would have satisfied my late father-in-law, Tom Sargant, who was the first secretary of Justice for a period of more than 25 years. On his behalf, I am proud to have played some part in the passage of the Bill.

<P>
<A NAME="50703-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank: </B>   My Lords, I associate myself with almost everything said by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, about the Bill and its progress through the House. I am grateful to the noble Baroness the Minister for dealing with what was an extremely complex Bill. I am delighted that I was not in her position, with her brief, and particularly delighted that I did not have to do battle with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner. I would have done much less well than she, and I say that irrespective of whether or not I agree with the Government's position on the matter.
<P>

<a name="50703-09_para9"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Houghton, referred to the latter stages of the Bill as being an intellectual ordeal. I prefer to think of them as having been an education. This is certainly the first experience I have had of the Law Lords in action, either retired or active. They are a formidable group and it is an interesting commentary on changes in our society that for many of us the Law Lords now speak as a radical voice whereas, once upon a time, they were essentially the voice of the status quo.
<P>

<a name="50703-09_para10"></a>One part of the Bill in which I expressed specific interest was the question of the investigative powers of the commission. I shall look carefully at what the Minister said following her discussion with the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh. In Committee she referred to the powers of the commission as being substantially prescribed, in so far as it would not be able to undertake investigations of its own because it would have no in-house team. However, on Report she said,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"an investigation can be undertaken by the commission".&#151;[Official Report, 26/6/95; col. 581.]</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50703-09_para11"></a>Those two points of view are reconcilable. I believe the noble Baroness was seeking to show that the commission had wide powers; that it would be independent; and that, although it may not have the resources to undertake an investigation on its own, it could go a long way in the direction of ensuring its terms and controlling it thereafter.
<P>

<a name="50703-09_para12"></a>I agree that the Bill is a useful addition to the statute book. I agree also with what other noble Lords said in expressing the hope that it will return to this House in its present form and that the Government will take no lead in seeking to amend it. The Bill has made progress here and has been improved during that time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   My Lords, in a few words I should like to add my congratulations to those already accorded to the noble Baroness on a quite outstanding grasp of a complex Bill&#151;and an important Bill too. She managed to achieve a great degree of co-operation and, as a result, significantly improved parts of the Bill.
<P>


<a name="column_969"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 969</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50703-09_para13"></a>My intervention, as I indicated at the start, was a modest one. It had nothing to do with the discretion of the Home Secretary to decide how long a prisoner stays in prison. I echo the words of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hailsham, and express the hope that the experience of the Clegg case may perhaps have persuaded the Government that it is not a happy situation when one mixes politics with the judicial function of sentencing.
<P>

<a name="50703-09_para14"></a>I associate myself also with the words of my noble and learned friend Lord Simon of Glaisdale with regard to the treatment in the other place of the clause resulting from our Amendment No. 2, which we debated today. Of course one does not decide whether to reject or accept what comes from this House purely on the basis of the size of the majority. Incidentally, I believe it was 16, and not as stated by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hailsham, who was referring to an issue that I lost rather than one that I won; that is, in relation to contingency fees. One must have regard to the weight of the argument.
<P>

<a name="50703-09_para15"></a>In this Bill the judiciary established a record. I have been in a number of debates where the number of Law Lords who voted against the Government reached 10. On this occasion, if we include my noble and learned friend the Lord Chief Justice and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson of Lymington, a former Master of the Rolls, as Law Lords, no fewer than 17 judges of that distinction voted against the Government, with not one in their favour. When one is dealing with a legal subject, if their advice is rejected in the manner which has already been threatened when this goes to another place, then it is a poor outlook for the triumph of justice over executive convenience. I hope that that situation will not occur. However, as I indicated, this was only a minor part of an important Bill to which tributes have been justifiably paid to the noble Baroness. I support the Motion.
<P>

<a name="50703-09_para16"></a>On Question, Bill passed and returned to the Commons with amendments.

<P>

<a name="50703-10_para0"></a>I am pleased to present to your Lordships' House what is inevitably a rather technical government Bill. The Bill is important because it seeks to remove the current source of uncertainty about who should pay for the services of a planning inspector who is appointed to hold an inquiry on the planning authority's behalf into objections to a development plan or some other similar plan. This applies in Wales and Scotland as well as England.
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para1"></a>I should like to refer briefly to the history of the matter. Since the 1970s, when the first local plan inquiry was held under what was then the Town and Country <P>


<a name="column_970"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 970</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Planning Act 1971, my department and local planning authorities assumed that it was lawful, on the basis of an implied contract, to impose a charge for making available the services of an inspector. That seemed entirely natural. The planning authorities were statutorily required, as they still are, to hold their development plan inquiry. All concerned therefore expected the authority to pay for the expense of that process, including the cost of an inspector whom the Secretary of State appoints independently of the authority.
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para2"></a>Late in 1992 and the following year, Birmingham City Council queried the amount it was charged by the Planning Inspectorate Agency for the inspector appointed to hold the council's unitary development plan inquiry. Subsequently, the council also questioned whether any statutory power existed to levy those charges. To support its argument the council cited the judgment of the House of Lords in the case of McCarthy & Stone (Developments) Ltd. v. Richmond upon Thames London Borough Council. If I may attempt to summarise it, that judgment held that there is no power for a public body to levy a charge for its services in the absence of an express or implied statutory provision. Moreover, I am advised that even though the Planning Inspectorate Agency and the local planning authority normally agree on the terms on which an inspector is to be appointed for a development plan inquiry, there is no implied power to charge the authority for that service on any contractual basis.
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para3"></a>When my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Environment and other colleagues were made aware of this legislative gap, the Government decided that the only reasonable course was to fill it as soon as parliamentary time could be made available. My noble friend Lord Arran announced, in a Written Answer on 21st February last year, the Government's intention to legislate on this issue in order to put the matter beyond doubt. I regret that we could not find an earlier opportunity to fulfil that intention.
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para4"></a>Following that announcement, the Planning Inspectorate Agency's chief planning inspector informed all local planning authorities in February last year that the inspectorate would collect no further charges for development plan inquiries until the proposed legislation had been enacted. In the meantime, any local planning authority wishing to claim a repayment of its charge would receive it, but authorities were also advised to make full budgetary provision for the amounts which would be due to my right honourable friend's department if the proposed legislation were eventually enacted. Authorities who were naturally concerned about these matters thus received a proper explanation of what was involved and were reasonably advised not to expect the benefit of a "windfall" payment. Prudent authorities have followed that advice.
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para5"></a>The sums at stake may not seem large in total local government public expenditure terms. The underlying principle is nonetheless important. In England and Wales, up to and including 1992-93, they amount to &#163;4.5 million. For 1993-94, &#163;1.4 million has been recovered from planning authorities and paid into a suspense account. A further &#163;2.6 million is owing to <P>


<a name="column_971"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 971</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>my department. For the year 1994-95, approximately &#163;3 million is due to the department. In future years, charges will amount to approximately &#163;3.6 million on average while the present development plans workload continues. The department has repaid some &#163;3 million to 100 local authorities together with interest payments of approximately &#163;108,000 to 28 authorities.
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para6"></a>The principle on which the Bill is based is that authorities should pay for the services which these charges represent and for which provision is made in the annual local government finance settlement. It is relevant at this point to mention the Royal Town Planning Institute's independent assessment of the Bill. In its observations, published on 11th January, the institute said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Institute has no fundamental objections to this Bill which essentially puts the law back to what it had been universally seen as being for 25 years until last year".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para7"></a>I turn now to the clauses in the Bill. Clause 1, applying in England and Wales, is the core provision of the Bill. The clause does two things. First, it enables the department to recover from planning authorities my right honourable friend's costs, through the Planning Inspectorate Agency, in appointing an inspector to hold what is called "a qualifying inquiry". These are inquiries into objections to local plans, or unitary development plans, or simplified planning zone schemes; to consider objections to such schemes; or to conduct an examination in public into structure plan proposals. Secondly, the clause enables my right honourable friend to provide by regulations the "standard daily amount" and the travel and subsistence allowances which planning authorities are to pay to persons, other than inspectors, who are appointed to conduct an examination in public into structure plans. My right honourable friend will lay the regulations in Parliament and bring them into force, subject to parliamentary process, as soon as practicable after Royal Assent to the Bill. The retrospective provisions of the Bill will validate the charges made up to the date of Royal Assent. Until regulations are brought into force, the provisions in subsection (2) of Clause 1, which refer to the amount being "determined and notified", will effectively continue to validate those charges until the regulations come into force. I appreciate that the provisions of Clause 1 may seem too lengthy and detailed. That is necessary to ensure that they do the job properly.
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para8"></a>Clause 2, also applying in England and Wales, deals with retrospection. The Government are persuaded that, exceptionally, retrospection is justified on this occasion for two main reasons. First, Clause 2 imposes no new financial burden on local planning authorities. It simply validates past payments which authorities made in good faith, believing, as did the department, that they were sought and paid lawfully. In this context, I remind noble Lords that general provision was made in the annual local authority finance settlement for the estimated sums planning authorities expected to incur by way of charges for inspectors' services at development plan inquiries. Secondly, without retrospection, the other provisions in the Bill would be unfair to those planning authorities which, through no fault of their own, have not yet reached the stage of holding an inquiry as part of their development plan process. We see no reason why <P>


<a name="column_972"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 972</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>planning authorities which have already passed that stage should receive a "windfall" financial benefit through not including retrospective provisions in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para9"></a>I shall briefly mention the comparable Scottish provisions in the Bill. I understand that the position has not been tested in the Scottish courts. In addition, planning authorities in Scotland have not so far pressed for repayment of the sums paid in the past. Nevertheless, because my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Scotland thinks similar problems may arise he considers it prudent to legislate now in order to remove any doubt about the basis of charges made.
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para10"></a>Clause 3 enables my right honourable friend to set charges by regulations. It establishes a firm statutory basis for payment by planning authorities in Scotland. This will apply in the case of both local plan and simplified planning zone inquiries. While this provides equivalent powers to Clause 1, there are a number of distinctive Scottish features. First, the reporters who hold local plan or simplified planning zone inquiries in Scotland are appointed not by the Secretary of State himself (as in England and Wales) but by the planning authority from a list provided by the Secretary of State. That list may include both full-time reporters and other suitably experienced people who are not officers of the Secretary of State. Secondly, examinations in public into structure plan proposals in Scotland are carried out on behalf of the Secretary of State; so the cost does not fall on the planning authority, as it does in England and Wales. Finally, the Scottish Office inquiry reporters' unit remains part of the Secretary of State's department and is not a Next Steps agency. Clause 3 reflects these distinctive elements but with the same underlying objective and effect as Clause 1 for England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para11"></a>Clause 4 makes retrospective provision with regard to local plan inquiries, held under the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Acts of 1969 and 1972. There have been no simplified planning zone inquiries in Scotland yet.
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para12"></a>As in England and Wales, neither of these clauses imposes any new burden on Scottish planning authorities. They are intended to put on a firm statutory footing the charging arrangements which have operated in practice for a number of years.
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para13"></a>In conclusion, this short Bill provides formal charging powers which everybody had assumed existed for some 20 years. Today we are concerned with the principle of the Bill. The Government consider that the Bill is soundly based on the principle that it is reasonable for the user of a public service to pay for it&#151;including, in this case, an essential provision for retrospective payment. I commend the Bill to the House.

<P>
<A NAME="50703-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My Lords, the House will be grateful to the noble Viscount for introducing what he rightly says is a short Bill. It is, nevertheless, an important Bill, as I am sure he recognises. I do not intend to move the amendment that I have tabled, not <P>


<a name="column_973"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 973</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>least because I tabled it at a very late stage and I do not think I gave the House sufficient notice. But the fundamental issues contained in the amendment are ones with which we shall have to deal when the Bill reaches Committee.
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para15"></a>The noble Viscount quite rightly said that there was a problem which the Government had to meet. With Clauses 1, 3 and 5 of the Bill&#151;looking at the future&#151;there seems to be no particular problem. We shall discuss in Committee whether the measures the Government are replacing are right or wrong, whether indeed local authorities should pay the planning inspectorate for the costs of inquiries when those are imposed by statute, whether local authorities should be invited to sign a blank cheque, which is effectively what it is, without any appropriate agreement between themselves and the planning inspectorate on costs, and so on. We shall pursue a number of detailed points in Committee.
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para16"></a>Had the Bill stopped there I do not think that there would be any point of major principle between us. There would be points of detail. But in Clauses 2 and 4 the Government have introduced retrospective legislation. The noble Viscount is quite right to say that the matter has not been tested in the Scottish courts and that therefore there has been no repayment. He was right in saying that under the Town and Country Planning Act 1971 development plan inquiries were mandatory and charges were levied, and have been levied since then. They were levied for approximately 21 years.
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para17"></a>This arrangement was challenged by Birmingham City Council in 1992 on the ground that the Government had no authority from Parliament to levy those charges. Birmingham City Council won the case. It was clear to the court that an implied contract did not constitute proper authority for the Government to levy charges on local authorities in this respect. As the noble Viscount went on to say, the Government decided that they would have to rectify the position. In the meantime, the money that had been paid by local authorities to government over those 21 years, was repaid. I have a figure of 97 local authorities. I believe that the noble Viscount said that there were 102, but the matter is not of great significance.
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para18"></a>The money was paid back to local authorities with interest on the grounds that it had been levied by government ultra vires. Since 1992 charges have either not been paid because local authorities realised that the court had decided that the Government were acting ultra vires in levying such charges, and such charges as were paid have been put into a suspense account pending the matter being cleared up in one way or another.
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para19"></a>As the noble Viscount quite rightly said, it is a question of transferring from one public pocket to another in the sense that, as long as one eliminates the council tax element of local authority revenue, it is the revenue support grant that supplies the bulk of local authority revenues. So if the Exchequer gives to local authorities with one hand it can take away with the other.
<P>


<a name="column_974"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 974</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para20"></a>But it seems that the reasons for retrospection&#151;and here I rely on the opinion of noble friends who are more expert than I am in constitutional law&#151;are not very convincing. First, the fact that there is no new financial burden on local planning authorities does not seem to me to be a reason at all, but the fact of the matter. Obviously, if there were a new financial burden&#151;and we shall discuss that later on&#151;then clearly the retrospective element would be intolerable.
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para21"></a>Secondly, the noble Viscount gave as the next excuse that the law now is where it was thought to be. I am advised, again by my noble friends who are more expert than I am, that that is a matter which is not necessarily justification for retrospection. Thirdly, the noble Viscount said that it would be unfair since those authorities who have yet to have their development plans approved by statutory inquiries, or tested by a planning inquiry, would be disadvantaged if Clause 1 is accepted and Clause 2 not accepted. Again, my noble friends say that that is often tried on&#151;that is, unfairness&#151;but the law is neutral in these matters.
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para22"></a>Therefore, unless the Government come up with some better answers, we shall have to have a serious debate in Committee on this matter. Furthermore, I am advised that the authorities which have commented on retrospective legislation regard it as being the special responsibility of the law officers of the Crown. The public at large quite rightly view retrospective legislation as undesirable. There is the matter of whether the law officers of the Crown have looked at this Bill and seen it to be expedient in one form or another; and if so, why?
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para23"></a>The reason why I ask these things is evident. Any form of retrospective legislation sets a precedent for future forms of such legislation. Let us suppose that instead of local authorities, which the Government can hammer as they wish, the victims were private sector companies. Can we seriously imagine that the Government would produce legislation validating charges that had been levied on private sector companies over 21 years, before a company had the nous to take them to court and say that they had no vires to do so? Can we seriously imagine that such a Bill would be presented to your Lordships?
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para24"></a>Then we come to precedent. What would happen if the same principle were to be applied to individuals, with payments levied over 21 years which we are then told are illegal? Can we seriously imagine that the Government would introduce retrospective legislation to correct that matter? What would happen if local authorities themselves made mistakes in charging for their services? Are we to assume that the precedent which the noble Viscount has introduced of no financial burden, etcetera, and that the law was what it was thought to be, will allow local authorities to ask for legislation to correct the mistake they had made in being ultra vires in levying charges?
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para25"></a>I ask all these questions because your Lordships are particularly sensitive to retrospective legislation and all that that implies. The noble Viscount will know that my right honourable and honourable friends in another place did not oppose the Second Reading of this Bill on the grounds that they would have a satisfactory explanation <P>


<a name="column_975"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 975</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the retrospection at the Committee stage of the Bill. That did not happen and my right honourable and honourable friends voted against the Bill at Third Reading precisely on the grounds that they had not received a satisfactory explanation. The explanation which the noble Viscount has given is exactly the same as that given by the Minister in the other place. We shall have the same view as my right honourable and honourable friends in the other place when we come to it.
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para26"></a>So my thesis is that we need much more information from the Government on why such retrospection is necessary. What are the precedents? Have the law officers of the Crown given their judgment on this? Have they put their names to any form of memorandum, opinion or approval that, on the face of it, this is a desirable principle to introduce into legislation? We must bear in mind that any precedents which are set by this Bill, however small the Bill, may be relevant to those matters which might arise in the future. I very much hope that the Government will pay attention to what I am saying and before we reach the Committee stage produce a report of some sort to the House which answers my questions.
<P>

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-10_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, the retrospective nature of the Bill is its most obvious attribute. When I read it I was struck by another word; namely, "reciprocity". The noble Viscount, Lord Ullswater, has told the House of the background to this Bill. It is a background with which I was personally involved&#151;that is to say, the issue of charging by local authorities for giving planning advice to prospective developers.
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para27"></a>Perhaps I may take a moment or two of your Lordships' time to explain that background because I believe that it is relevant to my objections to this Bill. It seemed to my authority, Richmond upon Thames, at a time when I chaired the planning committee, that it was not appropriate for prospective developers of large developments&#151;I do not mean people considering small, rear extensions to residential premises&#151;to receive free advice at the expense of local taxpayers; in other words, when they sought advice from the planning authority on what might be acceptable, the cost of the advice should be recovered. It is not a question of gaining a profit but simply of ensuring that developers, who, after all, stand to gain very considerably, should not be a charge to the local taxpayer. That seemed to be reasonably well accepted by many developers. That was welcome and we discussed their ideas with the planners until McCarthy & Stone challenged the arrangements. Therefore, your Lordships will understand that I feel particularly sore that, having identified a gap which, as the Minister said, should be filled, the only gap that the Government saw fit to fill was the lack of power on the part of central government not providing the power for local government.
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para28"></a>I have been led to believe that the Department of the Environment is not unsympathetic to the attempts made by my authority, which are being looked at with interest by other authorities. After all, in these tough days a certain market approach is generally appreciated by <P>


<a name="column_976"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 976</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>central government. As I said, I am sore&#151;perhaps my feeling goes a little further up the spectrum towards incensed&#151;that only one gap has been filled by the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para29"></a>There is another inconsistency in the approach taken in the Bill. I refer to the cost of the development plan and similar inquiries. As the House will be aware, we work now in a plan-led system where the most material consideration&#151;I do not use the term in an entirely technical sense&#151;is the development plan. That is the context in which planning applications are considered. I applaud that approach. However, it has meant that there are longer, more detailed inquiries at the development plan stage. It is now more important to landowners and to prospective developers to investigate fully the constraints that there might be on the development of major sites and to ensure, as far as they can, that the plan, having gone through the inquiry stage and eventually been adopted, provides the most favourable situation for their future applications. That has inevitably affected the length of inquiries and the work that is involved. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but it means that the development plan inquiry is to some extent taking the place of an appeal against a refusal of a planning application under the old system.
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para30"></a>The inconsistency seems to be this. As I understand it, on an appeal against a refusal of planning permission, the costs of the inspector are borne by the Government. If that is so, it seems that there is an argument which we should certainly explore as to whether the costs of the development plan inquiry should similarly be borne by the Government. I should add that there is a widespread view that in paying for the inspector, local planning authorities are paying the piper without being able to call the tune. By "tune" I do not mean the outcome of the inquiry, but comments have been made to me about the way in which inquiries are conducted, such as, "It went at a leisurely pace", and, "It was not a productive use of time". It is understandable that local authorities, having to pay the bill if time is not used productively, will comment to that effect.
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para31"></a>Before the debate I inquired about how the matter is dealt with in standard spending assessment terms. I was told that the cost of inquiries comes in the "other services" block. I would not attempt to identify that. I am glad to know that it is there, but one has to take it on trust. Perhaps the Minister will be able to tell the House how within that block the figure can be assessed, given that there will be such expenses in some years but not in others. As the Minister knows, one of the complaints made by local authorities is about the difficulty of budgeting for inquiries.
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para32"></a>As I have suggested, we need to address the relationship between local authorities and the inspectorate. If the inspectorate is to act more like a private sector organisation&#151;I believe that that is what the Government want&#151;the relationship between the inspectorate and the authority needs to be clear and even-handed.
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para33"></a>I have another question for the Minister. I apologise for not having given him notice of it, but I should be grateful if he could confirm either today or later what will be covered by the costs. I assume that by "the costs of the inquiry", we are to understand that it is not only <P>


<a name="column_977"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 977</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the costs of the inspector's time that will be covered but also the costs of the programme officer and the ancillary costs such as the reporting at a later stage.
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para34"></a>I return to the major issue, the retrospective nature of the Bill. I entirely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, that the Government have to make their case convincingly in suggesting that your Lordships should agree to retrospective legislation. I say that with a little less passion than would be the case if the Bill were not putting everyone into the position in which they thought they were in. However, the propriety of what is being done must be scrutinised if for no other reason than the precedent which the noble Lord suggested. As one of their reasons, the Government said that it would be unfair on authorities which had not yet reached the inquiry stage if they had to pay while other authorities did not. There is a simple&#151;I hope not too simplistic&#151;response to that: if each authority were given one "free" inquiry, there would be no unfairness towards those which came later in the process.
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para35"></a>On the question of precedent, the noble Lord asked about the position of a local authority that had been found to have made a mistake and whether the Government would agree to retrospective legislation to put right that local authority's position. As I have suggested, this Bill could have been an opportunity to allow for that. The Minister knows my views on the need for local authorities to have wider powers than they do and to have a power of general competence, which would not mean that each action taken by a local authority was scrutinised as to its vires. However, given that the Government have identified that gap and decided to fill it, I am sad that they have not filled it completely.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   My Lords, although my name is not down to speak in this Second Reading debate, perhaps I may ask the Minister a simple question. When he dealt with the Scottish aspects of the Bill, the Minister was kind enough to say that no money had been returned to any Scottish local authority and that no Scottish local authority had challenged in a Scottish court the right to collect that money. That being so, can the Minister explain why it is necessary to introduce retrospective legislation in relation to a situation in Scotland which simply has not arisen?
<P>

<a name="50703-10_para36"></a>It seems to me that the Government are obsessed with the retrospective aspect of the Bill to such an extent that they are introducing retrospective legislation even where it is totally unnecessary. No money has been returned to Scottish local authorities and the position has not been challenged in the Scottish courts. Therefore, it seems absolutely unnecessary to extend the retrospective aspect of the Bill to Scotland. It would make far more sense in legislative terms to introduce a measure to regularise the matter from the date on which the Bill becomes an Act. We certainly do not need the introduction of retrospective legislation for a situation which, on the Minister's own admission, has simply not arisen.

<A NAME="50703-10_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, for saying that he will not be moving his amendment this evening. Perhaps I should start by reminding noble Lords that my noble friend Lord Arran announced to your Lordships' House as long ago as 21st February last year in a Written Answer the Government's intention to introduce this Bill. My noble friend's Written Answer explained that the proposed legislation would be retrospective in order to validate payments already made and to secure fair treatment for all planning authorities irrespective of the timing of their individual local plan inquiry. That statement made the Government's intention plain. The noble Lord, Lord Williams, has not raised the issue until this moment&#151;
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   I thank the noble Viscount for giving way. The Government make many statements about the future legislative programme. Some Bills arrive on the statute book, some arrive before your Lordships and some do not. It is not until a Bill is produced by the Government, who have made a raft of promises about legislation, that we can actually concentrate on it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-11_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord tries to justify his position but I do not accept it. There have been plenty of opportunities for raising the issue by Oral or Written Question since the time of my noble friend's Written Answer.
<P>

<a name="50703-11_para0"></a>I understand the anxieties of noble Lords opposite about the inclusion of retrospective provisions in the Bill and I gave a full explanation of the reasons for those provisions. We recognise that there is a common law rule of construction that a statute should not be interpreted retrospectively so as to impair an existing right or obligation unless that result is unavoidable on the language used in the statutory provisions. I am advised that that common law rule of construction applies to statutory provisions where the retrospective effect is uncertain.
<P>

<a name="50703-11_para1"></a>That is not the situation in respect of Clauses 2 and 4 of the Bill where the retrospective effect is clear and deliberately intended. Here we are merely restoring the local planning authorities and the departments to the position that they had all assumed and acted upon for a long time. In short, we are restoring the validity of payments which authorities made in good faith for each department's services. I remind noble Lords opposite that authorities have already received the benefit of the services of a planning inspector to conduct the inquiries in question.
<P>

<a name="50703-11_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Williams, asked whether the Government had received the benefit of an opinion from the Law Officers. Regardless of which government are in office, it is a firm convention that they never disclose publicly whether the advice of the Law Officers has been obtained. That is so that any litigation in a court will not be prejudiced by the knowledge of any such opinion.
<P>


<a name="column_979"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 979</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50703-11_para3"></a>The provisions will also be thoroughly examined by the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee of this House. As regards the issue of precedents for retrospective provisions, each case must be considered on its merits. We are concerned here only with the validation of payments which were universally regarded by everyone involved as being lawfully made in respect of development plan inquiries. To that extent, there is no unfairness. Local planning authorities also receive sums in their financial settlements to cover the costs of such inquiries. That is very different from imposing a new and unforeseen burden, involving planning authorities in extra costs without the financial provision to meet them.
<P>

<a name="50703-11_para4"></a>Perhaps I may quote a precedent which the noble Lord, Lord Williams, may find intriguing. In the Bates case, Mr. Justice Gatehouse said in relation to Section 132 of the Financial Services Act 1986:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"To argue that Section 132 of the 1986 Act created a new obligation was, in his Lordship's opinion, not supported by the rationale of the decided cases which the House of Lords made clear in the Boucraa case was founded on the concept of fairness. His Lordship saw nothing unfair in restoring the parties to the contractual position they had both assumed and long acted upon".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50703-11_para5"></a>As I explained in my opening remarks, the Bill is necessary to remove the present doubt about the basis on which the long-standing charges for planning inspectors' services&#151;and, in Scotland, inquiry reporters' services&#151;to local planning authorities in holding their development plan inquiries are made.
<P>

<a name="50703-11_para6"></a>In return for putting these charging arrangements on a proper footing, planning authorities can rightly expect to receive an efficient and effective service. Since its setting-up in April 1992, the Planning Inspectorate Agency has striven to improve the standard of service it provides to all its customers.
<P>

<a name="50703-11_para7"></a>The inspectorate intends to offer a "service agreement" between the agency and individual planning authorities which will attempt to specify the level of service they can expect from the inspector appointed to hold their development plan inquiry. Following consultation which is now taking place with the Local Authorities' Associations, the agency will offer this agreement to individual authorities before each inquiry. We believe that this flexible approach is better than the legalistic basis of a contractual arrangement. As a Next Steps agency, the inspectorate intends to account as fully as possible to planning authorities for the charges they will be expected to pay for development plan inquiries if this Bill becomes law. In Scotland, although it is not a Next Steps agency, the Scottish office inquiry reporters' unit will follow the same approach, on which the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (CoSLA) is being consulted.
<P>

<a name="50703-11_para8"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ewing, asked why it was necessary to introduce the retrospective clause for Scotland. The Bill simply puts the position beyond the doubt of a possible future challenge. There are some occasions when putting Scotland on the same basis as England and Wales is perhaps a wise decision.
<P>

<a name="50703-11_para9"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Williams, indicated that somehow the payments which local authorities are expected to make have not been provided for and that if private companies or individuals had asked to reclaim <P>


<a name="column_980"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 980</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the money which they had paid we would not be taking these steps. The payments which authorities have been and will be expected to make are provided for in the overall total of the annual local government finance settlement. Provision has been made for them in the standard spending assessments and that will continue.
<P>

<a name="50703-11_para10"></a>Perhaps I may briefly explain to the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, that the SSAs are not built up from such small components as the sums which authorities spend annually on development plan inquiries. Planning services for which local authorities are responsible are included in a large group of local authority services categorised as "all other services". This year the total sum is approximately &#163;7,426 million. That compares with approximately &#163;3 million annually for development plan inquiries, or 0.03 per cent. of the total sum. The total amount is reached after taking account of estimated commitments and the scope for economies. In practice, planning authorities know in advance when they will incur expenditure for an inquiry. Therefore, they should be able to make budgetary provision for this commitment, just like any other. In future, improved administrative arrangements between the authorities and the planning inspectorate should remove the difficulties that some authorities have experienced.
<P>

<a name="50703-11_para11"></a>The noble Baroness asked about the costs, in particular the overhead costs. For the avoidance of doubt, I wish to clear up any misunderstanding about the reference to subsection (4) of new Section 303A to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the general staff costs and overheads of his department".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50703-11_para12"></a>This does not mean that the planning inspectorate's charges for inquiries will in future be loaded with an additional component representing the staff costs and overheads of the Department of the Environment's headquarters costs. What it means in practice is that the daily charge for an inspector's services will include a component representing the hypothecated cost to the Planning Inspectorate Agency of the agency's staff and administrative costs of holding development plan inquiries. We believe that that is entirely reasonable. It continues the previous arrangements for including this component in the charges that planning authorities have been paying. It is not a "hidden" extra cost.
<P>

<a name="50703-11_para13"></a>The noble Baroness also thought that she had found another hole in the Bill that she would like to have filled in relation to why the Government are not in favour of local planning authorities charging for pre-application discussions. Potential developers may be unfamiliar with the planning process&#151;we accept that&#151;or wish to obtain a local planning authority's initial reaction to the proposal. Therefore, we encourage them to approach planning authorities for informal advice before a planning application is made. That applies in particular to small businesses. Those preliminary discussions may produce a better understanding between authorities and developers. Charging for those discussions may deter applicants from seeking advice and may lead to misconceived applications and an increase in the number of appeals.
<P>

<a name="50703-11_para14"></a>I believe that the Government provided a great deal of information in the course of the debates on Clauses 2 and 4 of the Bill in another place. I have given the House a full explanation today and there will be a full <P>


<a name="column_981"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 981</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>opportunity to debate the matters during the remaining stages of the Bill, as indicated by the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel. However, I believe that I have answered all the questions which he raised.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-11_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Viscount sits down, perhaps I may take him back to one comment which he made when he talked about the service to be offered by the inspectorate. I do not think that he used the term "service level agreements" but that is what I understood him to be describing. He went on to say that the Government believe that that is better than having a contractual arrangement. I confess to being confused. I had thought that a service level agreement would amount to a contract. Perhaps the noble Viscount will clarify the matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-12_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   My Lords, I did indeed mention service agreements. I should have to inquire whether that is the same as service level agreements. I indicated that that approach may be better rather than having a legalistic contract. But what is extremely important is that local authorities should know exactly what they are to receive and costs of that. I believe that that is what the Bill does, and I commend it to the House.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para0"></a>On Question, Bill read a second time, and committed to a Committee of the Whole House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Stallard </B>   rose to ask Her Majesty's Government whether they have any plans to increase income support payments to meet in full the costs of care of older people.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the financial problems being experienced by older people in care are increasingly in the public eye. None of us can have failed to notice the press articles about people losing the properties for which they have paid over a lifetime of work in order to meet the costs of their care. In a number of cases, the families of older people are being called upon to meet the difference between the costs of care and the support which is available. That causes a great deal of heartbreak and hardship for families who wish but are unable to bridge the gap, which may mean the difference between quality care in a comfortable environment and care in far less suitable accommodation. I certainly would never wish to experience some of the problems about which I have heard from those families who have found themselves in that situation. However, I know exactly how they feel. Therefore, older people and their families are facing real problems in meeting the shortfall between the costs of care and the ability to pay for it.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para2"></a>In a very short debate it is difficult to cover all the problems, but I should like to bring to your Lordships' attention one particular issue which is beginning to affect the care available to many older, vulnerable people in residential care and nursing homes. A number of cases have been drawn to my attention of people who have been evicted or threatened with eviction. In <P>


<a name="column_982"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 982</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>general, the charities have managed, but only just, to cope with the problems of finding additional top-up fees which those people need to stay in their homes. But as the number of cases increases, as it undoubtedly will, we shall hear that large numbers of that group of particularly vulnerable people have been evicted from their homes.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para3"></a>People living permanently and voluntarily in a private residential or nursing home before April 1993 have preserved rights to higher rates of income support to help meet the costs of their care. Those rates are set by central government and take no account of local or regional cost differences. Age Concern has received a large number of inquiries from older people and those concerned with their welfare which indicate that there is a growing concern about the ability of older people who have preserved rights to meet the costs of the residential and nursing homes in which they live. Older people face severe difficulties in areas where preserved rights to income support are not sufficient to meet the costs of local care. Local authorities are required to contract with homes at the local rate and are expected to negotiate the best terms available. However, income support levels are still failing to meet the costs of care in many parts of the country.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para4"></a>Where there are shortfalls between the income support rates and the costs of care, only limited help is available. Local authorities can help residents with preserved rights over pension age who face eviction or the closure of a residential home only by making arrangements for them to move to another home. If the person needs to move into a nursing home or already lives in a nursing home, local authorities have no power to offer anything other than advice. They are not able to provide top-up money to enable a person to live in the same home. For people over pension age in nursing homes, there is no clear-cut statutory responsibility should they face eviction from or closure of the home. I could cite many examples of that.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para5"></a>Therefore, the situation is even worse for people in nursing homes who face eviction. Local authorities have no power to offer anything other than advice or guidance, although they have the power to make alternative arrangements for people under pension age who have preserved rights and are in nursing homes. Health authorities have responsibilities if they originally purchased the nursing home place. Otherwise, a health authority may have a responsibility only if the resident's care needs fall within their locally determined priorities as to those who should receive long-term National Health Service care and those who should not. Therefore, the onus for finding alternative accommodation for those people over pension age in nursing homes lies with the resident or his relatives, with perhaps some help from a home owner. That is because the pensioner will have arrived at the home as a result of private arrangements. That is laid down in government regulations.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para6"></a>The rules are complex and are far too complex to cover in detail, but they were issued as part of the Government's community care policy. I accept that the proposals were intended to prevent exploitation by less scrupulous providers of care homes by transferring <P>


<a name="column_983"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 983</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>people into their care to more expensive homes. I accept that that was a genuine intention. But, in practice, that has meant that older people are being moved to homes many miles from those in which they were resident. That may have a disastrous effect on the quality of life of very sick people.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para7"></a>Let us consider somebody who is in that unfortunate circumstance. He may be old, sick, or both. He is visited regularly by children, relations and friends and then suddenly finds that he is moved 50, 60 or 70 miles away, where he has nobody. He has been well-established in one place and has had set patterns of life, which are extremely important to older, sick people. In some cases a sudden move may have tragic consequences.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para8"></a>A number of charities have been extremely helpful in that regard. They are working together. I know that one charity is donating &#163;2,000 per year. But for obvious reasons we cannot rely on the charities to continue to bridge the gap. Charities have financial difficulties. They are unable to meet the increased costs of those people and we should not demand that they do so. We are in no position to demand that charities should take on that task.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para9"></a>Members of the all-party group on ageing issues met with representatives of Age Concern, the Association of Charity Officers and a provider of homes earlier this year. Members of that group were deeply concerned about the prospect of eviction hanging over that most vulnerable group of people. The numbers are not small. In a Written Answer in another place, the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security, Mr. Roger Evans, said that there were 116,200 people in residential care homes and 84,460 people in nursing homes who were in receipt of the higher income support limits. Those people will be at risk if they are unable to meet the difference between the cost of their care and the income support which they receive.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para10"></a>We also know from a Written Answer given on the same day by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health, Mr. John Bowis MP, that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Department does not collect information of fees charged, but Laing and Buisson have estimated on the basis of their latest&#151;November 1994&#151;survey of independent sector homes that the average weekly fees for elderly residents were &#163;234 and &#163;333 [per week] for residential care and nursing homes respectively. No information is available on the proportion of nursing home fees which relate to nursing care".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 26/6/95; col. 480.]</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para11"></a>However, the Minister failed to quote from the other part of that most important document which says that local authorities are in difficulty in negotiating fees at income support levels or below, or, indeed, anywhere near it. In fact, the report says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Many care homes ... particularly those in the more affluent areas of Britain, will have benefited from the upward flexibility in fees paid from state funding sources following the transfer of state funding from the Department of Social Security to local authorities in 1993".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para12"></a>But, as the report asks, how can that upward flexibility in local authority baseline fees be reconciled with evidence that nursing and residential home fees for elderly people have not kept pace with either income support upratings or the average earnings index between 1993-94 and 1994-95? The Minister could have quoted <P>


<a name="column_984"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 984</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the fact that nearly half of the local authorities which are negotiating costs with the homes have had to pay above, and are setting their baselines at above, income support level. That is a lot of people.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para13"></a>Age Concern has also produced an analysis of the financial shortfall between income support and the weekly charge of homes for elderly people. Its report shows that the number of people in care whose charges are above the weekly income support limits fell from 46 per cent. in February 1994 to 45.4 per cent. in 1994. None of us will be surprised at that, knowing the kind of people with whom we are dealing.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para14"></a>People with preserved rights to income support will have been resident in residential care or a nursing home before 1st April 1993. Their numbers will inevitably fall. Therefore, the cost of funding the difference is not a major long-term commitment. It cannot be. Indeed, the very nature of the thing indicates that such people will not exist for as long as that. In May 1994, 57,160 people in residential homes in Great Britain were in homes with charges above the weekly income support limits. That is not a large proportion of the ageing population. However, it is an unacceptably large number to be facing eviction.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para15"></a>Income support moneys may not meet the cost of care for a number of reasons. One area may be more expensive than another. We know of examples in London and the home counties where the charges are far in excess of those in areas such as Humberside in Yorkshire and such other places. There is a huge difference.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para16"></a>In those cases the resident has some limited options as regards what to do in attempting to meet the shortfall. First, such people can negotiate with the homeowner. But that could lead to a great deal of acrimony, delay and discussion, and in the end very few such cases are settled. Secondly, they could try to raise the shortfall themselves. However, in many cases that is impossible. Thirdly, they could see whether there was another home in the area with a vacancy at income support rates and then move. But, if there were such a place, those people would experience the same difficulties as they had experienced in the home that they were in. Therefore, it is unlikely that they would find a solution down that road.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para17"></a>Once those possibilities have been exhausted, the resident is left in the situation where he or she still does not have enough money to pay for the accommodation and care. Although many homeowners endeavour to maintain a resident for as long as possible&#151;indeed, some are very good at it&#151;there may come a point when that is no longer viable. At that point the resident may well face eviction. I recognise that that is an emotive term. It comes in many guises. It rarely appears as an eviction notice. The agreement with the home usually states that either party must give a period of notice which is often as little as four weeks. However, its effects are equally as devastating. If one receives such a letter after four weeks, it is obviously just as devastating as receiving an eviction notice. There are a number of examples of actual evictions which I do not have time to give your Lordships.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para18"></a>As I stated earlier, the "preserved rights" were issued as part of a move to community care. There was no malicious intent in their introduction. But, unfortunately, they have led to some of the most vulnerable members of our society being faced with the prospect of eviction from care homes. Again, Age Concern has raised a number of issues which it feels Ministers in the Department of Social Security should consider to alleviate the distress and financial burden which the preserved rights rules have placed on older people in residential care and in nursing homes and also on their relatives. I understand that those points have been delivered to Downing Street and the appropriate Ministers. I hope that the Minister who is to reply tonight will have something to say about the suggestions made.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para19"></a>However, if the noble Lord cannot think about all of those suggestions, I believe that he ought to be able to say tonight that the Government accept the proposal that the Secretary of State for Social Security should take into account and actually reflect the local variations in the amounts being contracted by local authorities in the uprating of preserved rates of income support, using the powers under Section 135 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. We raised that question many months ago. That section of the Act gives the Secretary of State for Social Security powers to take into account the differences in local authority areas as regards such costs. I believe that that is the least assurance that I could hope to receive from the Minister as a result of tonight's debate.

<P>
<A NAME="50703-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lord for introducing the debate in such a very complete way. The truth is that it is a very complicated question. Therefore, one is very glad, if one can, to avoid talking about the complications. As the noble Lord has dealt with them fairly satisfactorily and made it perfectly clear that things will not do as they are, I will move away from detail and make one or two generalisations largely based on personal experience.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para20"></a>I should like to thank various organisations who have given me information on the subject; for example, Help the Aged, the Citizens Advice Bureaux, the National Council for Hospice and Specialist Palliative Care Services and Age Concern. They are all charitable concerns which are mixed up deeply in the problem. They are all equally dissatisfied with what is going on.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para21"></a>Quite a number of people in this House are old enough&#151;although, I hasten to add, not all of those who are present in the Chamber tonight are anything like old enough&#151;to have a proper understanding of the misery and worry facing people of our age who, often as a result of painful bereavement, find themselves pushed from pillar to post in an endeavour to find somewhere to die in peace. Many of us are of an age when serious illness and eventually death of ourselves or of a loved one is to be expected. I want to report the fact that, if <P>


<a name="column_986"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 986</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>one has enough money to pay one's way, one will be helped at every turn and the nightmare period is made bearable as far as possible.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para22"></a>I believe that the noble Lord who introduced the debate is trying to ensure that this very hard to bear period in all our lives is made equally bearable for those less lucky than ourselves who cannot afford to pay their way as we can. When I say "we", I am speaking for myself and a number of colleagues. I believe that any government worthy of our support should struggle to find a way to help people less lucky than ourselves to meet such crises despite lack of funds to pay their way. My slogan is: we stand on the right of every citizen rich or poor, male or female, to die in his or her own home.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para23"></a>I wish to say a few words about the help available. First, of course, there is the GP, who will arrange visits as required in case of illness, even sometimes twice daily, from the local health authority district nurses. I have had to deal with two or three and each was first class. Then there is the hospital. Hospital treatment is expensive if you can pay, but rightly so. However, the hospital is anxious not to keep one longer than one's treatment demands. When the time comes for one to go, the question is whether one can go home if provided with some extra help, or whether one must go to a nursing home or hospice. Here carers come into the matter. Again, they are not cheap, but I have found them most excellent.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para24"></a>This brings me to the hospice movement, of which I cannot speak too highly. Associated with it are such charities as the Cancer Relief Macmillan Fund and Marie Curie Cancer Care. Once again, I have had experience of all these and I was astonished at their effective kindness and tact and their excellent educational influence on confused and unhappy people.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para25"></a>Some of these charities confine themselves to cancer cases, but not all. Therefore help can be obtained in all cases. There are over 200 day hospices which enable people who are terminally ill to spend time away from home and offer physical care and social support as well as respite to carers, many of whom are of course elderly themselves.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para26"></a>Let me recommend one simple and direct government action which would do a great deal of good and would not be too expensive, and that is to increase the existing National Health support to hospices, which now averages 38 per cent., to 50 per cent. of total hospice expenditure. I would like to add that to the various changes already recommended by the noble Lord, Lord Stallard.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para27"></a>I have been speaking of people who are not only old but also ill. Of course there are many&#151;I am one myself&#151;who are old but who are not particularly ill and who need carers in the home rather than trained nurses. I manage with a son and two daughters, whose help is never ending, and with two charming girls who are young mothers who come to my small house for half an hour twice a week and do all the washing, ironing, sweeping and cleaning for &#163;5 an hour each and who are out of the house before I have realised they are in it. The family help, of course, is fundamental and people without that help are in a much worse position.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para28"></a>The noble Lord has discussed in valuable detail the question of helping people who have too little money to avoid eviction. That is the hub of the question. It is a matter of cash being provided to avoid a desperate and disagreeable situation for someone who is old and probably already rather confused. I agree with the noble Lord that the situation has been allowed to get into a muddle and that elaborate objections are made to almost every course which may be suggested in difficult cases. As we have an energetic and clear-minded Minister who does not suffer from old age to reply to this debate, I hope that he will lay down clear directions to avoid the hard cases which have been mentioned, where unhappy people are sometimes evicted and do not know where to go. I stand by the slogan, "Every citizen must be allowed to die in his own home". I hope that the Minister will accept the slogan.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   My Lords, we are grateful to my noble friend Lord Stallard for the debate he has introduced. I am neither old nor a resident in care and therefore I have no personal interest in this matter. I have not been a recipient of the various briefings that other noble Lords have received. Therefore I shall stick to generalities.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para29"></a>I was pleased to note that the noble Lord, Lord Donaldson, pays a wage that is above the minimum wage as advocated by my party. Five pounds an hour is a good deal above the minimum wage&#151;and long may the noble Lord continue in his good Labour practice.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para30"></a>I want to examine why this situation has arisen, not only in terms of residential care for the elderly but also in terms of housing benefit. The Government want to introduce flexibility and choice in the provision of various services. As regards the housing market, they wanted to introduce much more private renting and greater flexibility. As regards care for the community they want to introduce flexibility. If one allows prices to be determined by the market&#151;it is not a fully free market but rather a quasi-free market&#151;and one has administratively determined uniform payments, one is bound to find that some people will find their money falls short, as happens with some elderly people. As regards housing benefit, if one is committed to pay whatever the market charges, soon one will find that one is paying too much. The panic that has arisen as regards housing benefit shows that there is an inconsistency in allowing the free market to determine private rents and having a commitment to pay housing benefit and then worrying about the budget.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para31"></a>A similar situation has occurred as regards the matter we are discussing now. If one wants flexibility in provision&#151;as I presume we do&#151;some care has to be taken and some arrangements have to be made to make the payments to people who are entitled to them not uniform but slightly variable. That is a tricky thing to do but it has to be done. Let us say that 16 out of 42 local authorities have agreed to pay care costs that are above income support level and they are in London. But, typically, those elderly who find themselves living in an inner city area will suffer a shortfall whereas people who are not living in inner cities will find that, by and large, they can manage. Because market costs are <P>


<a name="column_988"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 988</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>different in different locations and administrative payments are uniform, there is a problem. I can pay a different price for a hamburger in inner London as compared with a rural area. The market does not believe in uniform pricing; it believes in variable pricing. However, administrators believe in uniform payments and not in variable payments. That is the crux of the problem. It will be a tricky matter to reconcile those factors.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para32"></a>I note that the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, is in his place. He does a lot of thinking for the Conservative Party and perhaps I should therefore pass this problem to him. It may be possible to pay an inner city allowance or make it more age-related. The problem arises when old people cannot pay. In that situation it would be almost cruel to evict them. Many of the really elderly are women. Women represent a much larger proportion of those over 80 than do men. Typically in our society women have fewer assets to fall back on, whereas men may have some assets or may have earned something through their lifetime. Some subtle thinking is required to address this problem. I do not believe that a great deal of money is at stake here although when any sum of money is mentioned unfortunately people tend to throw up their hands in horror and say, "Oh my God, we cannot afford &#163;10 million. It is too much". If the shortfall is &#163;100 a week&#151;I am taking a figure out of nowhere&#151;and there are roughly 60,000 people at risk, to pay them &#163;100 extra would result in an expenditure of about &#163;30 million. The Minister may throw up his hands in horror and ask where my party is going to find &#163;30 million. I remind him that given the social security budget of &#163;90 billion, &#163;30 million represents a small fraction of that. If the party opposite can find &#163;5 billion out of nowhere for a tax cut, I am sure they can find &#163;30 million from somewhere; but I do not want to make a party political point.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para33"></a>There is a conflict between the free market provision of social services&#151;which may be perfectly welcome&#151;and an administratively fixed uniform payment. That issue will come up again and again, and some thought will have to be given to it in terms of a special concession, either age or location-related, or through other tax concessions that make it possible to meet this particular challenge.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para34"></a>A related matter has the opposite effect of what is intended. The Government have been very keen to take people away from SERPS and occupational pensions and into personal pensions. SERPS and occupational pensions are to some extent gender blind. They give men and women more or less the same pension. However, as far as personal pensions are concerned, a man who pays &#163;100,000 to buy an annuity and subscribe to a pension plan will receive &#163;10,000 per year for the rest of his life but, for the same amount of money, a woman will receive &#163;8,000 to &#163;9,000. Because it is a private pension plan it makes perfect sense as women live longer than men. Nevertheless, women have to save more money to get the same provision as men. Although it makes perfect sense for a profit-maximising private company to operate in that way, I believe that elderly women should have a tax concession or something like that to redress the imbalance. We shall find increasingly <P>

<A NAME="50703-12_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Sharples: </B>   My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Stallard, for allowing me to say a few words in this debate. I should declare an interest on behalf of my husband who died at home last month. When he became unable to do everything for himself early in 1994 I applied for attendance allowance and was duly granted the lowest scale after the statutory wait of six months. When it became obvious that he needed full-time care, in April 1995 I applied for a review of his case. Six weeks later I had not even received an acknowledgement of my request. After two further weeks I received a form which I returned immediately. When I pointed out the delay, the office in Blackpool apologised and was extremely charming. I had no argument with it. There had been a considerable upheaval in the whole system. The office explained that no increase in the allowance would be payable for another six months, even if there was a review.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para35"></a>Can my noble friend explain why, having been granted the original attendance allowance, a further six months' wait was needed following a review? My husband was not a wealthy man. What is left of his estate, having paid for private carers&#151;I wished him to stay at home, as he did until he was no longer aware of what was going on around him&#151;goes to my step-children, quite rightly. There must be thousands of people who find that further six-month wait very unfair. It is for that reason that I raise this matter today. When my noble friend comes to reply I hope that he will have plans to vary the extra six-month wait for the higher rates of attendance level.

<A NAME="50703-12_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, I apologise for the absence of my noble friend Lady Hollis who has unfortunately been called away on urgent matters. The need for this debate illustrates that the Government have not thought through the problems of long-term care for the elderly, particularly those in residential homes. I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Stallard for introducing the debate. I do not wish to repeat the arguments that he put so eloquently, nor do I wish to repeat the moving points made by the noble Lord, Lord Donaldson. My noble friend Lord Desai spoke about the problems of the free market when the bill was being paid by the Government or the local authority. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's response to that. In addition, the points put by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharples, demand a reply from the Minister.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para36"></a>As all speakers have pointed out, those with adequate money or a supportive family usually have little problem. The difficulty arises when there is a shortfall between income support and the charges made by the home. As my noble friend Lord Desai pointed out, when income support is enough to pay for the cost of care in some areas there are no problems. He told us that in <P>


<a name="column_990"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 990</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>other cases, however, income support was not enough either because the locality was more expensive or because the individual needed a higher level of or more specialised, care. When older people go into homes they and their families know that they will be expected to use up all their capital. There can be no certainty about how long they will live or the amounts by which the fees will increase. When those eligible for income support go into homes, fees might increase beyond the income support levels. When that happens, or the resident runs out of money, relatives can be in a desperate situation. Usually, they will try to keep it from the resident. Many are retired themselves and are not in a position to make up large weekly payments. They will write around to charities, or look at other homes to see if they can find one that is cheaper. That is seldom possible without moving away from the area. It is most unsettling because the home will have become the resident's home. The home may say that the resident will have to leave if the relatives cannot make up the difference between income support and the fee that the home currently charges. It is a process of attrition that goes on for months. Eventually, a conclusion will be reached, sometimes with charities coming to the aid of the resident, relatives paying a little extra, or the home reducing the fee. Sometimes, homes have no alternative but to evict. My noble friend Lord Stallard told us that eviction was a very traumatic experience and that residents could be given four weeks' notice.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para37"></a>Local authorities have power to help only when people are in residential homes, are evicted or are on the point of eviction. The last thing the relatives want is for the resident to have to move to another home. Local authorities have no power to help beyond giving advice to those who are in nursing homes. The problem is made worse because of the fragmented responsibility between the Department of Health and the local authority and the Department of Social Security and the local authority. All of us agree that it is inhuman to ask elderly people of 80 or more to move from one residential home to another.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para38"></a>A number of suggestions have been made. One is the Hartley Booth solution which would allow local authorities to intervene and help residents to remain in homes if there was medical advice that it would not be in their interests to be moved. Perhaps another interim solution is to give local authorities power, but not the duty, to top up to avoid unnecessary disturbance. That would enable local authorities to negotiate acceptable rates with home owners. The local authority would probably pay in the end anyway, but it would avoid a lot of unnecessary difficulty.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para39"></a>Older people and their families face real problems in meeting the shortfall between income support and the cost of care. We await with interest the Minister's proposals for a solution.

<A NAME="50703-12_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I too am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Stallard, for having given us the opportunity to debate an issue which is of concern to us all.
<P>


<a name="column_991"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 991</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para40"></a>The principle which guides the Government is that we are determined to do our best to ensure that older people receive a decent level of care. We are justly proud of our record in this area. In 1979 there were just 12,000 people in residential care and nursing homes claiming benefit to meet their fees at a cost of &#163;10 million. Since the introduction of the community care scheme, the numbers claiming income support with preserved rights to the higher limits has obviously fallen. However, there are still just over 200,000 receiving help through this old scheme at a cost of around &#163;2 billion. That is quite apart from the income support paid to nearly 80,000 people in homes under the new scheme and the large amounts of money paid by local authorities to support new residents.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para41"></a>There is, of course, other income from the state, such as retirement pension and attendance allowance, that is taken into account when calculating entitlement to benefit. The whole adds up to a vast amount of money which, I firmly believe, shows the Government's commitment to these very dependent people.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para42"></a>We believe that income support limits have generally kept pace with costs. Indeed, practically all limits have increased in real terms since 1985. The elderly limit for people in residential care homes increased by 16 per cent. in real terms between April 1985 and April 1994, and that in nursing homes by 38 per cent. Those real-term increases are significant, especially as we have to bear in mind the Government's overall public expenditure objectives and take decisions in the light of cash available for benefit uprating as a whole. Organisations like Age Concern will, quite rightly, pressure us to do more, and we will, of course, never be able to do everything that they ask.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para43"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Stallard, asks if we have any plans to increase income support payments to meet the full costs of care of older people. We already meet reasonable costs and charges for care. Our aim could not be to meet all fees however high they may be set. That would be an open-ended commitment, and we should bear in mind that fees can reach &#163;1,000 a week or more.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para44"></a>Perhaps I may now address some of the particular arguments that have arisen in this debate, setting them in the context of the 1993 changes.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para45"></a>In 1993 we changed the system of funding for care of elderly people from a national, income support-based system to a local, community care-based one. It is clear, in retrospect, that we were right to do so. The new scheme allows a much more flexible, innovative, appropriate response to the needs of individual people and, I hope, goes a long way to solving the problems outlined by the noble Lord, Lord Desai. It also achieves excellent value for money.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para46"></a>There is a general misconception that all local authorities are contracting for fees way above the level of the income support limits. In fact the level of contracts still tends to follow the limits, although I accept that there are local authorities which contract above the limits. Indeed, a small but increasing number of local authorities are contracting below the limits. Additionally, some authorities are continuing to contract at their 1994 levels and not increasing the level of fees they will meet in line with our increases. I hope that that <P>


<a name="column_992"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 992</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>information gives some comfort to the noble Lord, Lord Stallard, that income support levels are not greatly out of line with the levels under the new system. Although the contracting levels under community care tend to follow the limits, there are arguments why they should not. One has to bear in mind that the old income support system could only deal with cases in general while the new system assesses an individual's care needs and funds the appropriate care.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para47"></a>At this point I should like to associate myself with the remarks made by the noble Lord, Lord Donaldson, about people's desire to die in their own homes and about the sterling work of the hospice movement. Under the community care arrangements, the Department of Social Security made a transfer of resources to health authorities for hospice care. We fully support the work of the hospice movement.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para48"></a>When we changed the system we gave preserved rights to all those in registered residential care. That is to say, we guaranteed that they would remain within the old system, and continue to receive the income support limits. We did this to aid the smooth changeover to the new scheme; to reassure current residents and provide security for vulnerable groups; to remove the need for care assessments for current residents; and to reduce administration for local authorities. Noble Lords will recall that the idea of preserved rights proved immensely popular, and indeed there was a rush to enter residential care before the closing date.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para49"></a>Several noble Lords have asked us to make changes to the preserved rights arrangements. We shall listen to what has been said carefully and consider what might be done in response to the points raised, taking account of our responsibility to the taxpayer. However, I should warn your Lordships that most of the points raised are well known to us.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para50"></a>Age Concern and others have brought to our notice a very few cases where people have been forced to move home because their existing home would not continue to look after them at preserved rights levels. Even a few such cases are a few too many. The vast majority of homeowners are responsible, caring and committed. I am sure that local authorities would prefer to deal with those which live up to these ideals.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para51"></a>Perhaps I may give the noble Lord, Lord Stallard, some comfort. Local authorities now have new powers to provide a safety net in cases where someone is evicted. However, it was never anticipated that local authorities would have powers to top up income support limits.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para52"></a>We have thought long and hard about how we might deal with the problem and have considered, I believe, all the remedies proposed by noble Lords, along with many others. However, we have yet to find a remedy which will work and which will not lead to the kind of general escalation of fees that has been seen before. For example, in 1991 most income support nursing home limits were increased by &#163;45 a week. Instead of reducing the number of residents whose fees were met by income support, nursing homes simply increased fees by the amount of the benefit increase.
<P>


<a name="column_993"></a>

<B>3 Jul 1995 : Column 993</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para53"></a>Our best estimate is that to solve the problem faced in its ultimate form by perhaps a dozen residents out of 200,000 would cost the taxpayer at least &#163;200 million a year. The noble Lord, Lord Desai, had a good grasp of the magnitude of the problem. Even my noble friend Lord Skidelsky&#151;in his temporary residence on the Bishops' Benches&#151;would be hard put to find an answer to it. We shall continue to look for one.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para54"></a>Many people in residential care receive private and charitable help. We applaud that. However much the Government do, people will always want to do more for their own relatives and for those people with no one to help them. It would be quite wrong for the Government to act in such a way as to prevent relatives, friends and charities stepping in and assisting. Indeed, the benefit system deals generously with such contributions by disregarding payments intended to top up benefit levels to enable people to live in the home of their choice. Many people in receipt of such help would appear to be in a home above income support limits because they receive that help.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para55"></a>I shall write to my noble friend Lady Sharples about the problem she raised. I cannot give an adequate answer today.
<P>

<a name="50703-12_para56"></a>I trust that I have made the Government's position clear. We are determined to do our best to ensure that older people receive a decent level of care. However much we may disagree with some noble Lords about <P>

<UL>What is the present position regarding recruitment to the Civil Service and whether appointments to the permanent establishment are still being made; and what is the nature of short-term contracts and what are the recruitment arrangements for posts in the public services at present.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703w01_spmin2"></A><B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food   (Earl Howe): </B>  Recruitment to the Civil Service is a matter for individual departments, although they must comply with certain centrally-prescribed rules; for example that, with limited exceptions, recruitment should be on merit on the basis of fair and open competition. Just under 20,000 people were recruited to permanent posts in the Home Civil Service in the year ending 31 March 1995.
<P>

<a name="50703w01_para2"></a>There are five types of short-term temporary appointments in use in the Civil Service. Departments and agencies use these appointments where there is a management need to employ people for a short period rather than make a permanent appointment.
<P>

<a name="50703w01_para3"></a>Casual appointments are used only where there is a genuine management need to employ people for a short period rather than make a permanent appointment.
<P>

<a name="50703w01_para4"></a>Fixed term appointments are made for a specified period of time, normally less than five years. They are made only where there is a genuine management need to make an appointment of limited duration.
<P>

<a name="50703w01_para5"></a>Short Notice, Standby, and Recurring Temporary Appointments involve appointees making themselves available for short periods of work that arise, or have been scheduled. There are varying degrees of length and commitment as to the period of employment between these types of appointment.
<P>

<a name="50703w01_para6"></a>There are no centrally-prescribed arrangements for recruitment throughout the public services.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="50703w02_wqn0"></A><B> Lord Glenarthur </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What has been the outcome of the review conducted into the operation of the Civil Defence (General Local Authority Functions) Regulations 1993 introduced on 1st August 1994.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703w02_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Baroness Blatch): </B>  Following consultation with local authorities, we decided not to make any changes to the regulations (which were introduced on 1 August 1993 not 1994) for the time being. A further review will be carried out in about two years' time after local government reorganisation.
<P>

<a name="50703w02_para0"></a>Chief executives of local authorities were advised of the decision on 17 March 1995.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703w02_wqn1"></A><B> Baroness Lockwood </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What is the gross funding for teaching in each of the higher education institutions and whether they will indicate what the corresponding funding would be if uniform units of resource were applied to the various academic subject areas adopted by the funding councils in their resourcing systems.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703w02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   Information is not available in the form requested. The Government's policy is to encourage diversity in colleges and universities; the Higher Education Funding Council for England's funding arrangements allow for this diversity and are not based on uniform units of resource. The HEFCE Circular 6/95 gives details of the council's funding for teaching in each of the English higher education institutions for 1995&#150;96, and I have arranged for a copy to be placed in the Library. I have asked the chief executive of the HEFCE to write to the noble Baroness to give her such other relevant information as they have available.

<A NAME="50703w02_wqn2"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they will list in the Official Report in tabular form, the figures for each of the years 1993&#150;94, 1994&#150;95, 1995&#150;96, for area cost adjustment taken into account in the calculation of grants for the Courts Service in London (the Crown Courts and County Courts), the Probation Service in London, the Legal Aid Board in London, the magistrates' courts in Inner London and the magistrates' courts in Outer London.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50703w02_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor   (Lord Mackay of Clashfern): </B>  The method of allocating resources to the Inner London Magistrates' Courts Service, the Legal Aid Board in London and London area probation services does not involve the use of area cost adjustments. The method of allocating resources in the Court Service is not based on grants. The area cost adjustment factor for the Outer London Magistrates' Courts Committees in 1993&#150;94 was 1.10881 and in 1994&#150;95 it was 1.112385. In 1995&#150;96 the revenue grant allocation formula does not use area cost adjustments.

<A NAME="50703w02_spmin2"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Transport   (Viscount Goschen): </B>  This is an operational matter for the Highways Agency. I have asked the Chief Executive, Mr. Lawrie Haynes, to write to the noble Lord.
<P>

<a name="50703w02_para1"></a>Letter to Lord Harris of Greenwich from the Chief Executive of the Highways Agency, Mr. Lawrie Haynes, dated 3/7/95.
<P>

<a name="50703w02_para2"></a>You asked what was the average cost of handling each call to the cones hotline in the financial years 1993&#150;94 and 1994&#150;95, and the average cost of follow-up action on those calls. As this is an operational matter for the Highways Agency, I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="50703w02_para3"></a>Separate costs for running the cones hotline are not available for 1993&#150;94, as calls were then routed through the Department of Transport's general enquiry number. During 1994&#150;95, the cones hotline was operated on a dedicated local call rate number at a cost of approximately &#163;5,000. Other running costs are not easily identifiable since they were met within budgets agreed before the hotline was established. Our estimate of the average cost of handling each call in 1994&#150;95 is &#163;2.22. No figures are available for the average cost of follow-up action in 1993&#150;94 and 1994&#150;95.
