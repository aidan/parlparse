I also thank him for the very diplomatic reply to my Question, but perhaps I may ask him to be a bit less diplomatic in his answer to my next question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="07071866000016"></a>In the light of what happened last month at the fifth session of the UN Human Rights Council, especially the inclusion of only one situation for selective treatment&#151;that of the Occupied Palestinian Territories and Israel&#151;what, if anything, can be done to guarantee that the council ensures universality and is not guilty of double standards and politicisation in breach of its mandate? I reflect in that question what has already been voiced in the European Parliament.</p>

The new Human Rights Council is a work in progress, and you win some and lose some. British diplomacy has been very active in ensuring that nine country-specific and 28 thematic special procedures have now been approved as a result of the last session. Unfortunately, we lost the vote on retaining rapporteurs for Cuba and Belarus&#151;two countries that evidently deserve rapporteurs. The noble Lord is correct that, unfortunately, the only special arrangement referred to related to the Occupied Territories, but I hope that we will continue the fight to get more equal treatment for all cases.</p>

Given that, is it surprising that a recent opinion poll quoted by the <I>Economist</I> showed that 47 per cent of Iraqis thought that attacks on coalition forces were justified? Is it surprising that people ask what the point is of British forces fighting pitched battles with the Iraqi police?

As my right honourable friend the Secretary of State has been saying for some considerable time, we must expect as we go through this difficult transition process that our forces will increasingly become the target. We are doing everything that we can to provide them with force protection in terms of tactics and equipment, but as the senior military commander, Lieutenant General Graham Lamb, said on Friday:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="07071866000279"></a>&#147;We are increasing our strike rate against the militia. We have doubled our arrest rates and we must expect an increase in our casualty rate along with this&#148;.</p>

If the forces were to withdraw, presumably the violence&#151;in that area, at any rate&#151;would diminish and not increase. If there is still a job to do, of course the forces must stay and accept the risks, which are becoming considerable, but what exactly is their job today in Basra?</p>

The reason is that the militias want to take credit, as they see it, for forcing us out of Basra. However, we have shown our strategy to be successful in the other provinces that we have handed over&#151;for example, Al Muthanna province. Once the Iraqi security forces, in particular the Iraqi army, have the capability to take over responsibility for security, our forces are then able to withdraw and the level of violence decreases. So the solution to the problem in Basra&#151;the last province, for which we hope to see transition later this year&#151;is to get the Iraqi forces trained up and with the strength and capability to take over responsibility, and to make the transition at that point.</p>

A considerable number of seriously wounded servicemen are now coming back.

At some of the smaller stations, the ticket offices are not open at all. There is now a real fear among passengers that, in order to claw back some of the money from having overpaid for the franchise, the ultimate objective is to close all ticket offices. Coupled with the meteoric rise in fares since the new year and the no-holds-barred attitude adopted by travelling staff on the railways, do the Government agree that this is an open invitation to travellers to get back into their cars? Will the Minister invite the regulatory rail authority to leave its comfort sidings to go and talk to the franchises about these important matters? I should declare an interest as a regular traveller on South West Trains.</p>

The service that I enjoy has steadily improved over the last few years. In real terms the regulated fares are around 2 per cent lower than they were 10 years ago, the number of passengers travelling on the rail network is higher now than any time since the 1960s and, year on year, the number of passengers using the rail network continues to grow ever faster. The Government are investing increasingly in the rail network and will carry on with that work. As to the noble Viscount&#146;s point about ticket offices, it is true that some have closed. However, we are in the modern era and many people now pre-book using online or telephone options to secure the right ticket to travel at the right price.</p>

The replacement is Stagecoach, which has not exactly covered itself in glory on South West Trains.

He always makes his points about the rail network very well indeed. I do not think that we have transient Ministers. The current Rail Minister, Tom Harris, is doing an excellent job and has been in it for some time. He is a great advocate for the rail network; I suffer in his shadow. We are investing more. I cannot comment on the individual comparison that the noble Lord made&#151;to do that would be wrong of me as a Minister&#151;but we have a record to be proud of. We are increasing access to and use of the rail network. We have a long-term plan and later this summer will deliver the high-level rail strategy.</p>

There is no hiding from that&#151;it has been in the newspapers, so I suppose it must be true. However, if one books intelligently, one can buy advance fares very cheaply. I do not accept for a moment the absolute comparison made by the noble Lord. It is cheaper to use the railways if you ensure that you book early&#151;online, over the phone and in advance&#151;as many people do, instead of just using walk-on fares. Yes, that franchise has had some increases, but generally you can get very good deals if you use the network well and you think ahead.</p>

Some lines, particularly the journey from Paris to Nice, are a delight. However, in EU countries there are higher subsidies and direct taxation to pay for services. In this country the balance is something like 58 per cent funded by passengers and 42 per cent funded by the taxpayer. That has gone up and down over the years but has not changed much, and we accept that balance because we think it is right that we protect the taxpayer from excessive burdens from the rail network.</p>

The clause allows the new council to acquire an interest in a company with a view to that body exercising certain functions on its behalf. Following a useful debate in Grand Committee we accepted that it was appropriate for the new council to be able to exercise that power, subject to the consent of the Secretary of State.

Her Majesty&#146;s Government have brought forward improvements to the redress schemes following Conservative amendments in your Lordships&#146; House, but it is a shame that they have been unwilling to modernise the law, in particular the definition of &#147;estate agency&#148;, to reflect how the housing market works today. Nor, regrettably, has there been recognition by Her Majesty&#146;s Government that redress for residential lettings should be the same as for house buyers. It is a missed opportunity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="07071866000088"></a>Hot on the heels of the HIPs fiasco, it is clear that the Government will be wary of regulation in the housing market. But unlike Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s proposals for HIPs, our amendments&#151;to modernise the law, include residential lettings and increase fines for rogue agents&#151;did have the support of the vast majority of the industry and consumers. That amendment was presented in Committee in another place, and the Government accepted the principle in concession to the amendment tabled by my honourable friend there.</p>

I would like to register my thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Truscott, for his stewardship of the Bill in your Lordships&#146; House previously. It was constructive and thoughtful, and with his help many positive additions to the Bill were secured.

<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="07071866000095"></a>This group of amendments relates to the complaint-handling standards provisions in the Bill, an issue that was debated extensively during the passage of the Bill through this House previously. The debate that occurred centred quite rightly on how best to ensure that regulated providers in the electricity, gas and postal services sector have in place and operate appropriate and effective internal complaints-handling procedures.</p>

<a name="70718-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="07071866000096"></a>This is particularly important because, under the new arrangements for consumer representation being introduced as a result of the provisions in the Bill, there will no longer be a sector-specific consumer body with a complaint-handling function for the energy and postal services sector; therefore, regulated providers in these sectors will be required to take full and proper responsibility for handling their own complaints. The measures in the Bill are about empowering and protecting the consumer, and we need to have the right incentives in place to achieve this objective.</p>

<a name="70718-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="07071866000097"></a>The amendments would require regulators to make regulations prescribing standards for complaint-handling. This is the clearest and most certain way to ensure that consumer complaints will be dealt with to an approved standard by regulated providers in these sectors. Regulators have an important role to play here; they are best placed to determine what is appropriate and necessary for their sector; therefore, they must have a degree of flexibility in determining what standards are set, to which complaints they apply and how these standards should be enforced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="07071866000098"></a>Amendment No. 3 is included in this group to allow for future changes to the energy and postal services markets. It provides for the Secretary of State to make an order prescribing a date on which the duty on regulators to prescribe complaint-handling standards will change to a power to prescribe such standards. Before making the order, the Secretary of State must consult the regulator, the new council and other persons as appropriate. The amendment is required to allow for future changes in the energy and postal services market which may make the requirement for regulators to prescribe complaint-handling standards obsolete.

These aspects of the new framework for consumer representation and redress are an important part of the new arrangements introduced by the Bill. A direct consequence of the new provisions is that regulated providers in the energy and postal services sectors&#151;and potentially water, after consultation in 2008&#151;will be required to take full and proper responsibility for handling complaints from consumers of their services.</p>

In parallel, regulators will also be considering how best to introduce the new standards for complaints-handling.

From these discussions, it is clear that we face an intricate and challenging timetable to deliver the different aspects of this new structure, and that work on the detailed aspects of implementing these provisions needs to start now, even prior to Royal Assent. Therefore, we want to be able to make a start with building on the important background preparatory work which has taken place to facilitate the swift and successful introduction of these measures.</p>

<a name="70718-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="07071866000129"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, it is eight weeks since we last had an opportunity to debate the Government&#146;s proposals to introduce home information packs. Then, this ridiculous policy was having to be put on hold because of the wholly predictable fact that there were insufficient home inspectors trained to carry out either the home condition inspections or the energy performance reports. The Merits Committee had also issued a damning report on the whole project. The old regulations were withdrawn in May, new regulations were promised and laid in June, so here we are again.</p>

<a name="70718-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="07071866000130"></a>The new regulations maintain the insistence that there should be a home information pack when a house is sold, but the requirement for it will be phased in, starting on 1 August for four-and-more-bedroom houses. Here lies the first recipe for disaster. How are four-bedroom houses defined? What is to stop an owner altering the rooms and selling the house on a different basis, say as having three bedrooms, a study and a playroom? That would not require a home information pack. Four-bedroom houses also amount to less than 20 per cent of the housing stock and are unlikely to be sought by the majority of first-time buyers&#151;the people home packs are meant to help.</p>

<a name="70718-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="07071866000131"></a>The pack itself has to contain an index, an energy performance certificate, title extract and a seller&#146;s form. That is all; everything else that a house buyer might need to know, such as the condition of the property, or information on warranties or policies to guarantee against defects, leasehold interests, rights of access, sewerage, drainage, water, gas or electrical services, may or may not be provided. If it is not, the buyer will still have to find and pay for it himself. The mangled mandatory pack is to cost in the region of &#163;600, to be borne by the seller. It is blindingly obvious that this cost will find its way into the sale price of the property, so the buyer will pay for it anyway, as he will almost certainly have to do for an independent survey on the condition of the property&#151;one of a standard to satisfy him and his mortgage company&#151;as well as the searches and all the documents for the sale.</p>

<a name="70718-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="07071866000132"></a>Since we last spoke, the requirement to have a home information pack before a house could be put on the market has vanished. Now it will be sufficient just to have ordered a pack. But what buyer is going to sit around waiting for a pack to appear? At some stage, buyers will do what any buyer has always done&#151;commission their own searches and documents in case the pack never appears, and pay for them.  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_264"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 264</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Furthermore, is it really the Government&#146;s business to endorse a system that would circumvent the need for a home information pack if the property is being sold under the sell-for-free system run by some property finders, so that when estate agents must sell with a home information pack these businesses do not have to do so? That could distort the market.</p>

<a name="70718-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="07071866000133"></a>There is almost universal agreement on three points. The first is that the energy performance of a house is becoming an important piece of information. Under European law it will become a requirement to have that information in 2010, but it is unnecessary for a performance certificate to be attached to the sale of a property at this time. I am afraid that the Government have made up this aspect; it is gold-plating the directive, presumably to justify continuing with the packs. We believe that the requirement for the certificate could and should be detached from the home information pack and become a standalone requirement, carried out against the timescale of the directive&#151;once every 10 years&#151;and not, as currently, as not more than one year old on sale. This is not even particularly efficient. Delivery of energy performance certificates through home information packs will take about 15 years to assess the nation&#146;s housing stock, whereas if, for example, energy companies were encouraged to deliver energy performance certificates out of their budgets for energy efficiency, the same result could be delivered in a far shorter time.</p>

<a name="70718-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="07071866000134"></a>Secondly, since the first idea about having home information on houses at point of sale was considered, things have moved on. E-conveyancing is becoming a reality, the provision of seller disclosure forms is being considered, and the industry&#146;s various other initiatives to make house purchase and sale quicker and more efficient are really well under way and begin to make any suggestion of home information packs redundant. Their protracted introduction may have gingered up the professional organisations to think further about how to improve efficiency, but modern ideas are now taking off.</p>

<a name="70718-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="07071866000135"></a>Thirdly, home information packs are a con. What is now on offer is a million miles from where the Government first started, when they were going to consist of comprehensive documentation, including a home condition report, which would mean that a buyer would have all the information required to make a speedy assessment of a property and a decision on a sale. Bit by bit, that has fallen apart. Home condition reports, once compulsory, have become voluntary. Insufficient inspectors have been trained to carry them out. Concern that they would not be of a standard to enable mortgage lenders to rely on them has still not been resolved. In all, the whole pack has unravelled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="07071866000136"></a>Why are the Government persisting with this completely discredited policy? What is to be gained by continuing to pretend that it will benefit, in particular, first-time buyers and deter gazumping when every professional body, apart from those whose job it is to sell home packs, say that it will do neither? Why now justify these failed proposals on the only aspect of any value&#151;the energy performance certificate&#151;which is perfectly capable of being introduced on its own?

It has been panned by practically all the professional bodies associated with house sales. Despite warnings from this House and the other place on innumerable occasions that the policy was simply not going to work, the Government have, none the less, ploughed on. This is the Minister&#146;s opportunity finally to admit that the policy is badly flawed, should be withdrawn and either rethought or abandoned. We will gladly support the introduction of energy performance certificates as a separate and freshly considered initiative, but home packs must go. I urge the Minister to do everyone a favour&#151;buyers, sellers and professionals&#151;and abandon the packs this afternoon. If she will not, I will ask the House to support my Motion against her. I beg to move.</p>

It seems that for the past two years or so a debate on the latest saga on home information packs has become a regular feature of business in your Lordships&#146; House. The policy, which had some flaws when originally conceived and included in the Housing Act, has become worse. The Government, in a sense, have been a victim of being almost too obliging; by attempting to respond to many often conflicting pieces of advice from outside bodies, they have ended up with something less coherent and less consistent than it was when we started.</p>

<a name="70718-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="07071866000141"></a>These Benches have always been ambivalent about home information packs, essentially on the basis that it was difficult to imagine that a buyer could have full confidence in information provided by the seller. That fundamental flaw always made us concerned about whether home information packs would be viable.</p>

<a name="70718-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="07071866000142"></a>However, we have always supported energy performance certificates. They are a good way of helping householders to keep warmer, to save money and to reduce carbon emissions&#151;we know that 20 per cent of UK carbon emissions come from domestic housing. It is a pity that the Government did not take stock at some point and concentrate on how best to

All our concerns have been amplified by the Government&#146;s removal from the home information pack of its most significant element&#151;the home condition survey. Without that, the pack is, frankly, meaningless.</p>

<a name="70718-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="07071866000143"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness will address some of our concerns. First, on security checks, we have been told that domestic energy surveyors will not have to undergo as rigorous a criminal check as inspectors carrying out home condition reports. Can she confirm that and perhaps explain why different standards apply? Indeed, I understand that estate agents, who also have access to one&#146;s home, undergo no checks at all and that varying standards are required for utility inspectors. Perhaps the noble Baroness might consider whether there should be some consistency in approach, so that householders understand the background of the people whom they are letting into their home, particularly those whom they let in because they have to, as they have no choice about these inspections.</p>

<a name="70718-0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="07071866000144"></a>Will the noble Baroness update the House on the current standing of the judicial review, which was launched by the RICS some six or eight weeks ago? I know that the judicial review was put on hold in order to give the Government a chance to refresh their thinking. In a similar vein, could she tell us how the pilot studies are going? One of the points made by the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee in its last report was that not enough information about the pilot schemes was being made public; it asked how we were therefore to make a judgment.</p>

<a name="70718-0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="07071866000145"></a>We are in a difficult situation because there is no doubt that the industry, in its broadest sense, needs some clarity on how the Government will progress. A rather fetching document from an estate agent came through the door of my London flat. It is called <I>Getting HIP: The </I><I>L</I><I>ow-down on the </I><I>New Legislation</I>. It says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="07071866000298"></a>&#147;Home Information Packs will be with us soon&#151;well, we think so anyway ... after so much uncertainty, who knows whether they&#146;ll ever come into force&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071866000270"></a>It also says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="07071866000299"></a>&#147;The government has won few friends with how HIPs have been introduced but it&#146;s our role to help vendors through the chaos&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071866000146"></a>The Government cannot be happy that the industry is regarding the policy in that light. I am sure that the noble Baroness will want to assure the House that the Government are taking the situation very seriously and that they recognise that clarity within the industry is required.</p>

<a name="70718-0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="07071866000147"></a>As of 13 March, the Government had spent &#163;11.6 million on developing the policy. A reply to a Written Question that I tabled in July said that an additional &#163;8 million has been spent since then. The fact that almost &#163;20 million has been spent on a policy that has not yet begun and which the industry really does not understand is not, I suggest, a great success.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="07071866000149"></a>Our Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee is kept busy entirely as a result of the noble Baroness&#146;s department. For the second time this year, it has had to look at the package and, for the second time this year, it has had to report that the proposals will not achieve the policy objective in the way anticipated.</p>

<a name="70718-0003.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="07071866000150"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Scott of Needham Market, referred to the home condition survey, which I am delighted is not in the home information pack. I did the training for it. I would never have relied, as a purchaser, on a house that had had a home condition survey, because the survey did not cover the really important things in a house, such as drainage, electricity and water. These were expressly excluded and one would have had to do a proper survey of one&#146;s own to cover those matters.</p>

<a name="70718-0003.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="07071866000151"></a>My noble friend Lady Hanham referred to people coming into homes with the right qualifications and the right security checks, but perhaps there is no need for that. Estate agents are in and out of people&#146;s homes every day and they do not have to have any security checks. Anybody can set up as an estate agent&#151;any ex-prisoner, for example. The noble Baroness, when she loses her position at the next election, can set up as an estate agent the next day. We all trust her implicitly, but there are an awful lot of estate agents whom one does not trust at all.</p>

<a name="70718-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="07071866000152"></a>However, we have lost an opportunity, because the noble Baroness rejected my amendment that would license estate agents. One of the advantages of licensing estate agents would be to cover the important matter of the safety and security of the consumer. It is entirely the Government&#146;s fault that that problem, which has been highlighted over domestic energy surveyors, will be raised more and more often. It is a delight to see the government Deputy Chief Whip on the Front Bench. In, I think, 1978, he introduced what became the Estate Agents Act 1979. At that time, he, too, would have wished very much for estate agents to be licensed and for proper security checks to have been made.</p>

<a name="70718-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="07071866000153"></a>Energy performance certificates are very important but they are a fairly blunt instrument to achieve what the Government want to do. As my noble friend Lady Hanham said, they gold-plate the EU regulations; that is not unusual with government departments. I recall it happening very often when we were in government&#151;and that is not to our credit.</p>

<a name="70718-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="07071866000154"></a>There are many loopholes in this proposal. Not every house that is put on the market needs an energy performance certificate. The house may be marketed by a home-finder who is not an estate agent or the vendor and they may say, &#147;I am getting a pack prepared&#148;; in that case, an EPC does not need to be prepared at that stage.</p>

<a name="70718-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="07071866000155"></a>If the Government really want an energy survey of our homes, they need to include the houses that never

Quite a number of houses will never come on the market and never have an EPC. The Government&#146;s policy will therefore not achieve their objectives.</p>

<a name="70718-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="07071866000156"></a>I am delighted that the Government will now allow us estate agents to do first-day marketing, but that raises exactly the problem that the noble Baroness, Lady Scott of Needham Market, mentioned. The vendor will be able to say, &#147;I have commissioned a pack&#148;, and, in a housing market such as it is now, the house will doubtless have been sold before the pack is ever produced&#151;not that it will ever be of much benefit to the purchaser. In a bad housing market, the situation will be different. I expect that we could be in a bad&#151;or a very different&#151;housing market in the not-too-distant future. We will then get a different argument, which will involve all the additional costs that the Government are forcing on vendors by requiring them to have produced all this rather worthless information up front.</p>

<a name="70718-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="07071866000157"></a>I support my noble friend Lady Hanham. I ask the Minister once again to reconsider all of this; please take it away and please take it back to your Secretary of State, Mrs Balls, and say to her, &#147;This is not a policy that will work. You are a new Secretary of State; let&#146;s have a fresh look at this&#148;. The Minister will know that there was a big meeting yesterday at the RICS, at which it and the NAEA looked at the whole of housing policy. We should build on that and come forward with something that everybody in the industry agrees on and the public can live with and benefit from.</p>

In our debate on 22 May, many, including myself, belaboured the point that for more than 300 years there has been an inevitable time gap between the moment at which an agreement&#151;a meeting of minds in an oral agreement&#151;is made with regard to the sale and purchase of land and the moment at which that agreement becomes binding in law by the evidence in writing of the agreement. For the past 18 years, that has had to be in writing. That will remain the situation, and that is the essential problem.</p>

<a name="70718-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="07071866000159"></a>In that time gap, good and evil will operate. The good that will operate will be that the purchaser is able to negotiate fully a mortgage&#151;that is needed in the vast majority of home purchase transactions&#151;and he will be able to make full investigations into the physical state of the property and any environmental problems. That cannot happen overnight and it is the main reason why there is that time gap of three to six months between the oral agreement and the exchange of contracts. The room for manoeuvre by the Government&#151;by any Government, however committed&#151;is therefore limited.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="07071866000160"></a>I sought to belabour that point on the last occasion and I make no apology for doing so again, because it seems to be central. However, the Government, on  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_269"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 269</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>this occasion, are in a stronger position than they were on 22 May. At that time, I suggested, perhaps less than prudently, that the failure to make the home condition survey part of a compulsory scheme was a fundamental flaw. I have changed my mind. Even if it was made compulsory, a valuation would still be necessary. On what would that depend? It would depend on the property&#146;s physical condition. Therefore, a home survey that did not contain a valuation&#151;and it has never been suggested that it would contain one&#151;would inevitably be duplicated and, in practice, would not achieve anything on its own. For that reason, I have changed my mind.</p>

<a name="70718-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="07071866000161"></a>There is a case for the home information pack even if its effect is limited. One beneficial effect is the creation of a culture of acceleration in relation to that period of three to six months. There is some anecdotal evidence that constant pressure&#151;and the Government have been consistent on this for 10 years&#151;has brought about some change, because of that climate of psychology. Indeed, there is overt evidence that over 50 local authorities, being acutely conscious of the delay in issuing search results and of the cost of searches, have reduced both the time period and the cost by at least 20 per cent. What about the &#163;20 million spent on this over the years? If that money has been responsible for that result alone, as I believe it has, it will have been money well invested.</p>

<a name="70718-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="07071866000162"></a>The limitations are considerable. I am sure that anybody looking soberly and fairly at the situation will accept that. It is right and proper that the energy certificate should be an integral part of the home information pack. Obviously, I am not privy to the Government&#146;s thinking, but I do not know why they have gone so far in this direction, beyond the Brussels requirements&#151;maybe out of some obeisance towards Brussels, but I doubt it. I suspect that it has much more to do with the consideration that over a quarter of our energy emissions come from domestic premises and that, for a comparatively low rate of expenditure and with comparatively little interference with the rights and day-to-day manoeuvres of ordinary people, this proposal can achieve a great deal. If that can be brought about, that again will be a first-class investment.</p>

<a name="70718-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="07071866000163"></a>I appreciate that, since 22 May, there has been a vast improvement in the number of accredited inspectors. I am glad that that is so and that there is a gradual phasing-in of this system to avoid a potential big bang of bringing it in all at the same time.</p>

<a name="70718-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="07071866000164"></a>However, there remains considerable cynicism on the part of those sitting on the Conservative Benches and, to some extent, on the Liberal Democrat Benches. Far be it from me to pretend to sit in judgment on them in this matter, but I hope that they will accept that here we are dealing with a massive social problem, which has caused much frustration and much unnecessary loss to many people. The losses in financial terms alone must amount to well over &#163;500 million per annum. About 25 per cent of all sales fall through, many on account of gazumping, and there is little that we can do to change that. Even if we adopted a Scottish system of a series of

<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="07071866000165"></a>Therefore, we are left with a considerable social problem, as I am sure the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats accept. What is their solution? Are they prepared to ask the public to consider any alternative here? I say that not in any spiteful way or with a hectoring attitude, but I beg them to consider whether it is necessary to divide the House on this matter. If they do, whether they succeed or not, they will create confusion and uncertainty for the general public. I do not pretend for a moment that the situation is not already tainted by confusion and uncertainty, but they will add to that and I do not think that they will do the British public any service whatever.</p>

When we talk of the people who have influence in this matter, we should not forget that estate agents, surveyors and others, whose cosy club has existed for a long time, feel threatened. They are right; they are being threatened.</p>

<a name="70718-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="07071866000167"></a>The Government are accused of doing something, when for years nothing was done directly to tackle a problem that has affected most people&#151;including noble Lords, and I am certainly not an exception&#151;involved in buying or selling a house. Therefore, from my point of view, the Government are to be congratulated on doing something.</p>

<a name="70718-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="07071866000168"></a>The criticism levelled at the Government is that their grand plan of three or four years ago has been watered down. However, they have listened, rejected, changed and consulted, and they have finally come to the conclusion that the only additional procedure in buying and selling a house should be the requirement for an energy performance report. The case for such a report, taking into account the issue of waste, has not been denied. The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, said, without any caveat, that the report would cost &#163;600, but the cost that I have been given is &#163;300 to &#163;400. She may be right, but so might I. I got my information from a source whose briefing, I am sure, will have reached the noble Baroness. Given that the average cost of buying a house these days is over &#163;200,000, the additional cost of the report&#151;shall we say &#163;400?&#151;is a flea bite. No one will willingly subject themselves to being bitten by a flea; however, if that is what it boils down to, and there is a service, it is a good thing.</p>

The argument has rested on the unreadiness of the system to operate. I take the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, about defining a four-bedroom house. Yes, there are clever people who are prepared to twist things and to commit subterfuge. I do not just mean estate agents

If, for the extra cost, this piece of paper is produced, the 1,600 people who are ready now will shortly be increased to 2,000, which is an adequate number, I am told, to deal with that which the order seeks to do.</p>

<a name="70718-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="07071866000170"></a>The legislation is very limited compared to how it was. For the life of me I cannot see why the House is not prepared to give the Government the opportunity to put into practice that which noble Lords have always said they want; that is, to bring down the cost of selling and buying a house. Hitherto, these reports have had to be commissioned by the buyer; in future, they will have to be commissioned by the seller, so the cost to the first-time buyer will be substantially reduced. The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, shakes her head. She may be able to quote evidence to show that the cost will not fall on the seller but on the buyer. We all know that people buying and selling houses are often in a chain. What you win on one you lose on the other, but as a result the costs will be marginal.</p>

<a name="70718-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="07071866000171"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, made a powerful point about the cost of abortive sales that fall in early on. Hundreds of millions of pounds have been lost because of delay, missed opportunities and so on. The Government&#151;I do not use the words &#147;congratulate&#148; or &#147;persistence&#148;&#151;are seized, as I am, of the need not just to do something, but to do something positive and helpful for people who want to reduce the cost of buying and selling their houses.</p>

I am a great supporter of HIPs, not because of what they represent but because they include the EPC. We have discussed that with the Minister. It is an incredibly valuable aspect. Noble Lords on all Benches have said that they support EPCs, which is why no fatal amendments to the Bill have been tabled.</p>

<a name="70718-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="07071866000174"></a>Everybody has mentioned how this debate is being reported. In my local property paper, the <I>Avenues</I>, there was a whole section on how this debate in the Lords would lead to the death of HIPs. That is not the case. We should not forget that this is a non-fatal amendment. If it is carried, HIPs will carry on. Previous votes have led to a delay in respect of most properties until properly trained individuals are ready, but they have delayed only one section. I ask the Minister to make a clear statement that all the other aspects will come into force as the regulations state&#151;for the four-bedroom house, for example. I take issue with the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton: you do not have to be intelligent to work out what is a four-bedroom house; my seven year-old son could argue the case for what is a four-bedroom

<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="07071866000175"></a>We should not underestimate the Government&#146;s achievement in EPCs. They will save millions of tonnes of carbon. Because this has become a heated debate, I take issue with missives that we receive from lobbying organisations. The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors is a lobbying organisation, as far as I am concerned, when it sends me unsolicited e-mails&#151;which made me rather annoyed&#151;as if I agreed with every line and iota that it came up with. Members of that organisation are calling for an emergency general meeting to question whether the judicial review is in the interest of all their members. I know that the Minister will talk about the state of the judicial review, but the RICS has some internal issues that it will have to address.</p>

<a name="70718-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="07071866000176"></a>If I were an energy assessor and had paid the RICS to take the qualification, but it then launched a judicial review that meant that I was probably out of a job for the next three or four months, I would be very unhappy.</p>

<a name="70718-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="07071866000177"></a>I have one more issue to raise with the Government. Under EPCs, you can change two things that will change the energy rating of your house: the insulation in your loft and your boiler. Of course, changing a boiler is a major expense. However, the Government could use EPCs to indicate how inefficient a boiler is. If they then state that the boiler is inefficient, energy efficiency credits, which are issued by suppliers, could be used to reduce the amount of gas used by domestic suppliers, which is an obligation on the suppliers. That means that EPCs could be used to reduce the cost of replacing an inefficient boiler with an efficient one. That would be a massive step forward. I am sure that many noble Lords throughout the House, hand on heart, realise that they have tried to eke out the life of a boiler for five or six years past its real date of demise. If those boilers were changed in enough houses around the country, vast amounts of carbon could be saved.</p>

<a name="70718-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="07071866000178"></a>I very much hope that the Minister will consult boiler manufacturers and other organisations to make that happen. It could happen without regulation and would be a real benefit of EPCs. Notwithstanding the real concerns advanced by my noble friend, which we have all shared, about how the measure has been implemented by the Government&#151;I am not blaming the noble Baroness on this, but it has been a long and arduous process&#151;I ask the House to consider that in the vote we are seeing whether we think EPCs are important. Climate change is an issue. One way to address it is through EPCs.</p>

I want to take the House through the changes that we have made since we last debated the issue, in response to the points raised and  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_273"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 273</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to the consultation and conversations that we have had with stakeholders. I shall try to reassure the noble Baroness that we have done everything that we can to make the introduction of HIPs on 1 August as smooth, robust and certain as possible. That is what we intend to do. I hope that at best I can persuade her not to press her Motion to a vote because arguments have been made for that, but I certainly want to give noble Lords as much information as I think is tolerable to reassure them about what the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, rightly described as an arduous process, but one that is now in a good and strong position.</p>

<a name="70718-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="07071866000180"></a>It is worth saying that the Prime Minister made clear last week that housing is one of the Government&#146;s top three priorities. An essential part of that process is to ensure that people are able to buy and sell their homes in as open, modern, transparent and, we hope, stress-free a way as possible. On that I am indebted to the analysis given by the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, both in the previous debate and today that makes clear how long we have been wrestling with this complex legal situation. We particularly want first-time buyers not to be unduly hindered from entering the market, and we believe that HIPs are an important first step in the process. They will help to end frustration and reduce costs. We remain committed to their introduction, alongside energy performance certificates.</p>

<a name="70718-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="07071866000181"></a>As we have said many times, we believe that HIPs will improve the experience of home buying and selling for consumers by providing them with vital information collected at the start of the process, and for the first time provide them with important information about the energy efficiency of their home. First-time buyers will receive their packs free. It is also right to point out that we have already seen improvements. The price of searches has been driven down and processes are being speeded up. While I talk about it being a first step, we have already seen some changes in behaviour in the market.</p>

<a name="70718-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="07071866000182"></a>The last time we debated HIPs was on 22 May and I updated noble Lords then on the agreement that we had made with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, brought about by its judicial review against the EPC. I shall come back to that point with an answer to the questions put to me. I also set out our decision to revoke and then lay revised regulations for Parliament to consider. I made clear our intention to roll out HIPs initially for properties of four bedrooms or more. That pragmatic approach was also in part a consequence of the judicial review by RICS and the uncertainty that that had caused among domestic energy assessors in training, who were very reluctant to come forward. Today, as we debate the issue again, I want to explain briefly why we remain committed to both HIPs and EPCs, to tell noble Lords about the progress we have made in meeting the targets we set to achieve a successful rollout, to look at our plans for monitoring and evaluation of quality following the introduction of HIPs, and to dispel a few myths that have been accumulating around the process. Lastly, I want to look at the longer term picture.</p>

<a name="70718-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="07071866000183"></a>Noble Lords have once again expressed their opposition to HIPs in principle, described as cynicism  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_274"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 274</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by other noble Lords. All I say is that the whole motive behind this long journey has been to increase the transparency and predictability of the process by providing information early on and thus reduce the risk of problems that could be avoided surfacing later, at great cost in time and energy. HIPs will be of particular importance to first-time buyers.</p>

<a name="70718-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="07071866000184"></a>The inclusion of energy performance certificates is an absolutely vital tool in our efforts to tackle climate change. Many noble Lords have argued that HIPs and EPCs can be separated, but anyone who believes that climate change is an urgent threat&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, indicated that EPCs are extremely important&#151;would surely support the Government in trying to introduce them as speedily and urgently as possible, and that is what is the HIPs vehicle allows us to do.</p>

<a name="70718-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="07071866000185"></a>I cannot give the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, a birthday present today&#151;I congratulate him anyway&#151;but I will look at his suggestion in a very positive fashion. It is both logical and interesting. If he will leave it with me, I would be happy to take it away. My response to the argument that we are trying to gold-plate the arrangement is that it is not gold-plating to want to move urgently&#151;by sending a signal to homeowners that they can be helped to do something to reduce their costs&#151;to reduce our carbon use and lower the costs of energy. An EPC which is 10 years out of date is not going to influence behaviour and will not cut tomorrow&#146;s costs, which is why we are where we are. I remind noble Lords that carbon from our homes accounts for 27 per cent of all emissions.</p>

<a name="70718-0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="07071866000186"></a>Noble Lords have been rightly concerned with the process and the need for the introduction to be as smooth and as predictable as possible. On 22 May we announced that we were committed to re-laying the regulations, carrying on work to increase domestic energy assessor numbers, rolling out a pilot to look at EPCs and social housing, consulting stakeholders and running a consultation with RICS. We have done all those things. We could not have listened harder. Indeed, the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, said at one point that we had listened almost too hard.</p>

<a name="70718-0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="07071866000187"></a>We relaid the regulations on 11 June. We gave early notice to the industry to enable a full debate on the policy. The regulations were considered again by the Committee on the Merits of Statutory Instruments, which was supportive of the efforts made by the department in response to concerns both inside and outside Parliament in relation to HIPs, and of the opportunity given for further scrutiny. It welcomed the Government&#146;s response to stakeholders in holding a consultation on the age of the EPC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="07071866000188"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, said we had insufficient numbers of domestic energy assessors, but we have made progress and, as I predicted, the numbers have taken off. On 11 July, there were 1,603 fully qualified and accredited domestic energy assessors ready for 1 August, which is more than enough to deal with four-bedroom properties from 1 August. We are well on the way to rollout of three-bedroom properties. We have provided certainty to the industry by setting out on 11 June in our

<a name="70718-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="07071866000189"></a>We said that we would try to ensure additional opportunities for qualified inspectors to find work. We have done that. The social housing pilot announced on 22 May is progressing well. We have approved bids for more than 120,000 EPCs from more than 100 local authorities and registered social landlords. Successful bidders were informed earlier this week. We expect most EPCs to be undertaken over the summer. It is an excellent opportunity to test the process before it is introduced to all landlords in October 2008.</p>

<a name="70718-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="07071866000190"></a>I promised my noble friend Lord Graham that we would engage constructively with stakeholders and critics of the scheme, and we have done so; we have had extensive discussions with stakeholders over the past two months, including RICS. There is no uncertainty; they know that what we are putting in place on 1 August is a measured process. I am pleased to be able to tell the House that they have expressed a willingness to work with us on the next stage of reforms in this area.</p>

<a name="70718-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="07071866000191"></a>The judicial review has been stayed, of course, on terms which require the Government to undertake consultation on the maximum and minimum age of energy performance certificates. We agreed that we would consult on the maximum age when it is included in a HIP. We are planning to start informal consultations with RICS and other stakeholders ahead of launching a formal consultation over the summer. Pending the outcome of that consultation, we have amended the regulations to say that an EPC must be no more than a year old when a home is first marketed.</p>

<a name="70718-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="07071866000192"></a>I know that what noble Lords really want to hear from me is a guarantee that when HIPs are introduced on 1 August they will be acceptable and as positive a benefit as possible. Let me explain what we have done. To ensure that they are implemented with as little disruption to the current system as possible, the new regulations make it possible for people to market their homes without a HIP for a limited and temporary period, which will last until 31 December. However, before an estate agent or other person marketing the property does so, they will have to provide written proof that they have commissioned a HIP&#151;this could take the form of a letter to a pack provider company, for example, or a copy of the application form; a simple process&#151;and to show that they have either paid for it or agreed to pay for it, again with written confirmation.</p>

<a name="70718-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="07071866000193"></a>There are enough HIP providers in place to provide this service. There are standalone services or they can be found in solicitors&#146; offices, estate agents, search companies and e-conveyancing. If some sellers still have difficulty in finding some of the documents&#151;we know that leases, in particular, are quite difficult to get hold of&#151;all they will have to do is show that they have made all reasonable efforts to obtain the missing documents. Once sellers have received their EPC, they will have to produce a HIP. Since all these documents will be needed in any

That is the process that we have put in place. We are pleased that it will work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="07071866000194"></a>Moving to monitoring and evaluation, we are ready to launch on 1 August. How will we know if HIPs and EPCs are achieving the benefits that we expect? I will say a word about costs. The price of an EPC is about &#163;97, according to our initial trials. In practice, many will be cheaper. The price of the HIP in the area trial has worked out at between &#163;300 and &#163;400. Many are being offered more cheaply. We will be keeping a close eye on the market following the introduction of HIPs, to ensure a smooth rollout. As part of our work leading to the launch, we have had a number of discussions with stakeholders, which have helped inform our decisions on monitoring and evaluation. That means obtaining data at first hand from what is going on on the ground. We are receiving feedback from all parts of the HIP system&#151;estate agents, trading standards officers and so on&#151;to ensure that things are running smoothly.</p>

<a name="70718-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="07071866000195"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Scott, asked me about the pilots. Evidence from the area trials is continuing to inform the ongoing work, as it has already throughout the year. We expect this to continue as we receive more information. We will publish a report on the trials in the late autumn, when we have a sufficient and significant body of evidence.</p>

<a name="70718-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="07071866000196"></a>Finally, I will deal with the myths around HIPs. Inevitably, new announcements and innovations generate their own mythologies. There are still a few that we have to deal with, the first being the four-bedroomed house. The noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, said that his seven year-old could explain why you would not market a four-bedroomed house as a three-bedroomed house. It is very simple. Why would you want to put yourself at risk of losing &#163;120,000, which is the average price difference? The property editor of the<I> Times</I> does not think you would. She said the other day:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="07071866000300"></a>&#147;In a slowing market, with more properties for sale, being economical with the truth to save a few hundred pounds could mean that your &#145;three bedrooms plus study&#146; property is not first on buyers' viewing lists ... in some locations, space is an especially valuable commodity: Hometrack's average prices for a three-bedroom and a four-bedroom house in Wandsworth, South London, are &#163;460,000 and &#163;620,000 respectively&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071866000271"></a>That is a major difference.</p>

<a name="70718-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="07071866000197"></a>There have also been suggestions of loopholes in the current arrangements. I assure noble Lords that there are no such loopholes. We have deliberately put in place a more flexible system from 1 August, which enables a property to be marketed without a HIP, as I explained, provided that all the required documents are in place. There have been concerns about enforcements. Our concern is that we should have a light-touch regime. We have worked this out with the local authority co-ordinators, regulatory services and the Trading Standards Institute. We all think that HIP duties should be operated with a light touch during the first stages of the scheme, while it beds down. I am  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_277"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 277</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sure that everyone will observe our situation with common sense. However, trading standards officers will act on complaints and will penalise people.</p>

<a name="70718-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="07071866000198"></a>I was asked specifically by several noble Lords about security checks. The DEA checks will mean that anyone acting as an assessor will be a fit and proper person to practice. They will be CRB-checked at a basic level&#151;all offences of 2.5 years or more, spent and unspent, any offence within the last five years and any habitual offending will be recorded. The home inspector checks will be the same, except that the CRB checks will concern all offences, spent and unspent. I should say that the Association of Chief Police Officers has been consulted and is content. These checks are far more rigorous than, for example, for CORGI inspectors. They are more effective, as we heard, than for estate agents or even chartered surveyors. Accreditation schemes will not rely solely on criminal record checks; references will be followed up and so on. Why is there this difference? It is simply practical. Home inspectors will spend far longer in the home. They will not be accompanied, in the way that energy inspectors are when they search for the boiler. We felt it was proportionate to build in that slight difference while maintaining the absolute security of people in their own homes. I hope noble Lords will be satisfied by that.</p>

<a name="70718-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="07071866000199"></a>We move on to the wider reform of home buying and selling processes. Why do we need to do that? We believe that HIPs with EPCs will make positive differences to those processes. They are the first step, as I have said. The Housing Minister has already had a number of discussions with key stakeholders to consider ways to build on HIPs to achieve the change. She is chairing a stakeholder panel on buying and selling that is now going to consider broader issues. Stakeholders have already made a number of positive suggestions that will build on and complement what we have done; for example, the introduction of e-conveyancing and the provision of additional up-front information in the process to better inform consumers.</p>

<a name="70718-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="07071866000200"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Scott, asked for clarity. The whole House asked us in May to listen, to make changes and to be secure in what we were doing. We have tried exceptionally hard to do what we were asked. We have adapted our plans to deal with issues and problems that have been raised, and we will continue to monitor their effective implementation. The time has come to move positively to welcome practical implementation. The market is geared up for delivery. We have enough inspectors in place, who are eager for employment. The industry has all the infrastructure for producing HIPs; it is ready and waiting. Consumers continue to press us for reform, and they are expecting this to happen. There is real urgency about tackling carbon emissions.</p>

<a name="70718-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="07071866000201"></a>I urge the House to look forward. I know the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, will see the importance of taking this first step; we have debated the issue across the Dispatch Box so many times over the past two years. I hope she will not press this to a vote, because I seriously believe that it will send a destabilising signal to everyone outside who wants and expects this  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_278"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 278</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to happen and is committed to making it happen. I urge the House to think seriously about its decision.</p>

<a name="70718-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="07071866000202"></a>For all the reasons I have given, the Government remain committed to the commencement of HIP regulations on 1 August as planned and to the rollout to all properties shortly thereafter. Consumers, as well as all those who are committed to tackling change, are entitled to nothing less.</p>

<p><a name="st_76"></a>
<a name="07071866000203"></a><b><a name="70718-0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07071866000756"></a>Baroness Hanham:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. I note everything that she said about what has taken place since we discussed this issue last in May. However, the situation remains that HIPs are nothing without the energy performance certificate; the documentation required under a HIP is minimal and putting together that information does not take an enormous amount of time or effort. It is a survey that requires effort and brings comfort to the people who are buying property. As we have said all along&#151;and nothing that the Minister has said will change this&#151;a proper survey will have to be carried out by everyone who is buying a property. I have seen no information about the level of the home condition report on which mortgage companies will feel able to rely in order to lend money. The home condition report is now voluntary. We were perfectly happy with that&#151;it would have been a perfectly acceptable situation&#151;but it was never going to be what was required in the home-buying area.</p>

<a name="70718-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="07071866000204"></a>We have not moved against the regulations for the introduction of energy performance certificates. They will give valuable information about how much it will cost to increase the energy efficiency of a property. However, the inclusion of EPCs in HIPs will not increase the speed with which houses are sold. In fact, as I have suggested, their inclusion will hold the process up. If they were a requirement on their own, they could be introduced much more quickly than if they were limited to the sale of houses. The fact that the EPC is being introduced in social housing shows that it has nothing to do with the HIP and nothing to do with the sale of property. We have all been saying that this ought to be done as a completely separate entity. Without the EPC, what does the HIP give you? Remarkably little. It does not produce anything much and, despite all the efforts of the Minister and the Government, it still has not improved an enormous amount on the way through the system.</p>

<a name="70718-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="07071866000205"></a>There should be a complete rethink about the energy performance certificates. They should be introduced on their own. They should not be part of the HIP process, which does not look as if it will be of benefit to buyers. The noble Lord, Lord Graham, asked how much it will cost. I can assure noble Lords that the cost will be put on to the sale price. I cannot see that the seller will do anything other than make sure that he gets his money back.

<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="07071866000213"></a>I feel bound to say to the House that when Statutory Instrument 2007/1709, which we are now debating, appeared last month, it caused cavernous consternation among those of us who have an interest  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_282"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 282</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in and some knowledge of the use of physical restraints in secure training centres. We were shocked that there appeared to have been no, or almost no, consultation outside the Youth Justice Board and the Government before the statutory instrument was promulgated. The instrument appeared to reject in its entirety, and contrary to previous indications, the Howard League&#146;s independent report of January 2006, which I had had the privilege of chairing. It appeared to reject the well informed opinions of individuals and groups, including the Children&#146;s Commissioner for England, the Commission for Racial Equality, Inquest, the NSPCC, the Children&#146;s Rights Alliance, the National Children&#146;s Bureau and Justice.</p>

<a name="70718-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="07071866000214"></a>The sheer bareness of the text of the statutory instrument offers the spectre of turning back the clock several years in relation to the use of restraint on young offenders in custody. The frankly awful and inadequate Explanatory Note increased that concern. I regard the term &#147;Explanatory Note&#148; in this context as almost an oxymoron. In general terms, the Government owe a duty to the many people interested in this kind of subject to produce better explanations than that arid Explanatory Note.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="07071866000215"></a>If that note was to be taken at face value, physical violence towards teenage prisoners is to be permitted where, in the subjective opinion of what may be a fairly junior person in temporary charge of a privately operated secure training centre, to use that violence is necessary,</p>
<ul><a name="07071866000307"></a>&#147;to ensure good order and discipline&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07071866000216"></a>The effect of this, on the face of the statutory instrument at least, is to make the use of physical restraint one of the items on the menu of first choices available in any secure training centre, whenever there is a sign of trouble. That is simply unacceptable.</p>

<a name="70718-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="07071866000217"></a>The Explanatory Note was regrettably exacerbated by the Youth Justice Board&#146;s so-called stakeholder briefing of 27 June this year. That stakeholder briefing deserved the fate that its title implies&#151;to be burned, and quickly&#151;because it was so misleading in several respects. I gave a number of examples of these to the interim chair of the Youth Justice Board when I had the welcome opportunity of seeing him recently. Given the cohort of young offenders we are discussing, the approach as it appears from the statutory instrument is an extremely bad idea.</p>

<a name="70718-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="07071866000218"></a>Various experts on this subject, I believe without serious or informed demur, share some broad conclusions. I will cite five of these. First, some staff, albeit a tiny minority of a hugely dedicated cohort of professionals, are too ready to use violence. Unfortunately, rogue staff are persistent, devious and difficult to root out. Secondly, being restrained is seen as a mere right of passage by some detainees. I was told this on numerous occasions when conducting the Howard League inquiry. If I may be forgiven a mixture of metaphors, when staff rise to the bait, more violence is a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>

<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_283"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 283</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>taught by and find from the examples of adults that there are other ways in which to deal with tension and that it is possible to break the cycle of violence to which they are accustomed; they do not need to suffer yet more at the hands of rogue staff in secure training centres. Fourthly&#151;and unfortunately there is empirical evidence for this&#151;the use of even authorised violence can prove dangerous and even fatal.</p>

<a name="70718-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="07071866000220"></a>The fifth of what I believe are the shared conclusions is that, whereas in a generally unsuitable youth custody estate such facilities as exist for organised physical activity, if used fully, would lower the general level of violence, physical restraint does the opposite. In that context, I make a plea to the Minister and to his right honourable friend David Hanson to look at the physical estates of secure training centres. They are far too small, have practically no playing fields and hold groups of young men who need outdoor activity but are not receiving it.</p>

<a name="70718-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="07071866000221"></a>I turn for a moment to the statistics, which speak for themselves. The use of restraint in the four privately run secure training centres in England is an unpleasant secret of our overstuffed custody estate. There are only 250 or so children currently housed in the STCs, yet those children&#151;some as young as 12&#151;are subject to an extraordinary level of restraint. The STCs were originally designed for those children who were too young or vulnerable to be in Prison Service-run young offender institutions. Yet in the STCs physical restraint&#151;using what are called distraction techniques, which involve up to 10 staff restraining children and inflicting pain by bending the thumb forwards or down, hitting the nose from underneath and using the knuckles to hit into children&#146;s ribs&#151;is used disproportionately and often against the same children several times a day.</p>

<a name="70718-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="07071866000222"></a>Last December, I asked a Parliamentary Question that revealed that in the space of a year physical restraint had been used 3,036 times on a population of around 240. Of those incidents in which restraint was used, 1,245 involved girls, which meant that 41 per cent of all restraint usage was perpetrated on girls, who represent only about one-third of the STC population. Furthermore, the Commission for Racial Equality has highlighted a disproportionate use on young black males, with evidence of discrimination. We should sit up and take notice of those findings.</p>

<a name="70718-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="07071866000223"></a>The STC rules are clear that restraint should be used only when children are attempting to escape custody, injure themselves or others, damage property or incite other children to a violent act. A quick glance at the figures that I have given&#151;and there are many other figures available&#151;immediately suggests that, if these rules were being adhered to, the number of restraint incidents could be reduced dramatically.</p>

<a name="70718-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="07071866000224"></a>Recently there have been inquests into the death of Gareth Myatt while being restrained and the suicide of 14 year-old Adam Rickwood, who hanged himself with his shoelaces after being restrained by staff at an STC. It became clear in the inquest that restraint was being used routinely to secure compliance&#151;in Gareth&#146;s case because he refused to clean a sandwich toaster and in Adam Rickwood&#146;s case because staff  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_284"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 284</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>wanted him to go to his room. Once the lawyers for Adam Rickwood&#146;s mother raised this clear breach of the STC rules, the Youth Justice Board signalled that the rules would shortly be clarified. Yet what we got in response to those inquests was this statutory instrument. I am afraid that the impression has been left that this statutory instrument was introduced not to meet the criticisms of those inquests, but to evade them. I hope that the Minister will confirm today that the evasion is now over.</p>

<a name="70718-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="07071866000225"></a>The inquest into the death of Adam Rickwood concluded in May of this year. He was found hanging in his room in Hassockfield STC at around midnight on 8 April 2004. In the hours preceding his death, he was subjected to restraint by four male officers, including a technique designed to inflict pain known as &#147;nose distraction&#148;. This was said to have caused Adam to have a nosebleed that lasted for an hour. There was no suggestion that any of the criteria set out in the STC rules that could have justified Adam&#146;s restraint had been met.</p>

<a name="70718-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="07071866000226"></a>It became clear at the inquest that the circumstances in which Adam had been restrained were commonplace and that children were regularly being restrained as a punishment and to secure compliance outside the rules, which had been in existence for some years. Safeguards put in place to protect vulnerable children were not affording them the protection that they should have under the law, nor had the monitoring of the Youth Justice Board identified and acted on these unlawful practices. The inquest heard that, in the year leading up to Adam Rickwood&#146;s death, restraint was used in Hassockfield, which has a capacity of only 42 children, on 972 occasions. Gareth Myatt died while being restrained and in wholly unacceptable circumstances.</p>

<a name="70718-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="07071866000227"></a>Such events must not be repeated and loose rules should not permit such events. I hope, therefore, that the Minister, in a spirit that I know he will follow of trying to assist this House, will be able to provide clear ministerial guidance of the kind that will clarify in a Pepper-v-Hart-usable way&#151;in other words, usable in administrative judicial review proceedings&#151;that this new statutory instrument is not intended to dilute the rules at all. I hope that the Minister will tell this House loud and clear that the use of physical restraint remains a last resort and that what appears in these rules and the arid Explanatory Note are not to be taken at face value.</p>

<a name="70718-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="07071866000228"></a>I trust that the Minister will tell the House that physical restraint should be available only where it is necessary and when no alternative method is available to prevent escape, injury or serious damage to property by the person restrained or another. Within the past few days, an inquiry was announced into the use of restraint in STCs, although, I fear, without as much clarity as one would have wished. I first discovered it on the Youth Justice Board website in a press release that welcomed the inquiry, but without details. I hope that the Minister will clarify the scope and nature of the inquiry.</p>

<a name="70718-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="07071866000229"></a>I have conducted one independent inquiry into this subject and I suppose that I should be the first to welcome one more inquiry&#151;but perhaps only one more. This inquiry should not be seen as a major

The evidence, including the Howard League report, is sitting there, waiting to be acted on. To be of value, the inquiry announced this week must have a chair truly independent of government, of the Youth Justice Board and of the Ministry of Justice. To meet need, the inquiry should report quickly. It should truly involve the new Department for Children, Schools and Families. One of the thrusts of the Howard League report is that we are dealing with children and that this group of children fit more comfortably with a government department dealing with children than with one dealing with criminal justice. At the very least, there should be a clear partnership between the two departments in dealing with that question.</p>

<a name="70718-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="07071866000230"></a>The inquiry should look at medical issues. In my view, serious issues about the medical safety of restraint techniques need to be addressed. Above all, the inquiry should be prepared to consult widely, albeit over a short period, to call for papers and to consider the views of everybody who wishes to make submissions to it. In that, I include consultation with members of the client group&#151;I have done it and it is possible&#151;while they sit in custody in these places. They have a lot to offer; some of them are very bright but have a long way to go to put their ability to good use.</p>

However, there are much more important things than my personal disappointment because I chaired that review. Much more important is that we ask for reassurance today that the statutory instrument means rather more, in a positive sense, than it appears to say, and that we ask for a commitment from the Minister that the Government will look in an enlightened way at this most important question of public policy.</p>

I can understand the need for physical restraint when young people are likely to harm themselves or others, or to damage property, or are at risk of absconding. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, amply demonstrated, the number of incidents compared with the number in our secure training centres is deeply worrying: 10 incidents a year for every young person in a security training centre. As we heard in Adam Rickwood&#146;s case, there were 20 incidents for every person at Hassockfield.</p>

I am not sure how training and physical restraint go together. While physical restraint may be necessary sometimes, it is quite as likely to breed resentment, bitterness and further violence as

What we need instead is a fuller inquiry&#151;and I hope it will be the last&#151;into that aspect of our youth justice system. I add my voice to that of the noble Lord in pleading that this may be the very last inquiry but that it is one that considerably amends the so-called amended regulation.</p>

She said that the events of Gareth Myatt&#146;s death were &#147;harrowing&#148;. Noble Lords may agree that reading that debate is itself harrowing. Sally Keeble has been tireless in exposing what she calls the &#147;tragedy&#148; of the individual death and the scandal of the stonewalling when people tried to get improvements in the regime.

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="07071866000238"></a>We have been talking in this House for some time now about the regimes in secure training centres but we have been limited in what we could say by the sub judice rule, because the inquests of the two children who died in those centres were pending. The two inquests have just concluded with key verdicts that are very critical of current arrangements. We must recognise that, had these two children been living in Scotland, they would in all probability be alive today. If they had been placed in a local authority secure children&#146;s home, they would in all probability still be alive today. Since the inquest ended, there has been considerable concern, and even anger, about a system of youth justice that puts vulnerable children into such a regime. There has also been great concern about the Youth Justice Board and the arrangements that it makes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="07071866000239"></a>That concern has been shared by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, of which I am a member; it has raised questions many times about the compatibility of our system of detaining children with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of

Last year, the committee requested information on a three-monthly basis from the Government on staffing levels, the use of restraint, injury arising from self-harm and other non-accidental injury. No information has been provided for 2007, although it has now been requested. Information from April to December last year showed a truly disturbing picture. The minimum&#151;I stress that word&#151;staffing level was not met at Oakhill Secure Training Centre in any one of those three quarters. There were, in those three quarters, nearly 2,000 incidents of restraint and 500 incidents of self-harm. No one looking at the data would be surprised at the announcement made last week that the Youth Justice Board has taken a quarter of the children out of Oakhill Secure Training Centre. The Youth Justice Board must have been very concerned indeed about Oakhill, since the inspectors went in in May 2005 and found such low staffing levels that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a><a name="07071866000303"></a>&#147;Between 28 March and 24 April, there was not a single day when the STC was anywhere near reaching the minimum staffing levels&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071866000273"></a>The information provided to the Joint Committee on Human Rights, although skeletal, gives a picture of the sort of children locked up in secure training centres. That can be deduced from the figures showing injuries resulting from self-harm&#151;more than 500. These are the most vulnerable children. In the Adjournment debate, Mark Fisher MP, who was the MP for Gareth Myatt, said of him:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a><a name="07071866000304"></a>&#147;He was so small that he hardly existed&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report, </I>Commons, 12/7/07; col. 1717.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071866000274"></a>We do not have good information on the vulnerability of these children because a report commissioned by the Youth Justice Board on former abuse of the children held in STCs has been suppressed. I cannot imagine why that was done because what it contains is common knowledge to anyone with a basic grounding in social work or psychology.</p>

<a name="70718-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="07071866000275"></a>When the statutory instrument appeared, the Joint Committee on Human Rights wrote to the Minister questioning the need for it and asking why the Government felt they had to take this step. The Minister replied to the Joint Committee, setting out the arguments. I imagine that the Minister today might well have been advised to deploy some of them. They were: that the Government had to clarify the law; that this is, after all, only what is done in schools; that there is a training manual which is in the public domain, apart from the section that describes the holds, which is suppressed; that it will be used only as a last resort anyway: so what is the problem?; and that it will not be used simply when there is a refusal to comply with an instruction because Section 9 of the 1994 Act, which is the key provision, specifies that &#147;reasonable force&#148; may be used to,</p>
<ul><a name="07071866000308"></a>&#147;ensure good order and discipline ... where necessary&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07071866000240"></a>There is strong reliance on &#147;where necessary&#148;.</p>

<a name="70718-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="07071866000241"></a>I would like to briefly comment on each of those arguments. The Government certainly had to clarify the law. It is astounding that, in the wake of the inquests of two such small vulnerable children, the Government decided to allow a wider use of restraint, rather than tightening it up and bringing it into line  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_288"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 288</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with local authorities&#146; secure children&#146;s homes to prevent serious harm to the child or others. The Joint Committee was told that this is what is done in schools. There is no comparison with schools; they are not locked institutions, children can go home, parents can be called and teachers are trained for longer than seven weeks.</p>

<a name="70718-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="07071866000242"></a>The suppression of the part of the training manual that describes holds is bizarre and inexplicable. One can only imagine that the Minister foresees children in secure training centres reading the manual and conspiring with each other to thwart what the staff might do to them. I do not find that a credible interpretation.</p>

<a name="70718-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="07071866000243"></a>Finally, the Joint Committee on Human Rights was told that restraint will be used only as a last resort and that it will not be used just to ensure compliance, but only when necessary. Whose &#147;where necessary&#148;? Will it be the &#147;where necessary&#148; of the staff member who told the inquest into the death of 14 year-old Adam Rickwood&#151;this was the staff member who hurt Adam by grabbing his nose&#151;that:</p>
<ul>

<a name="70718-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="07071866000244"></a>Will it be the &#147;where necessary&#148; of the pressured staff at Oakhill, which is understaffed, with no trained social workers there at all some of the time and a population of children who keep cutting or injuring themselves? Whose &#147;where necessary&#148; will it be?</p>

<a name="70718-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="07071866000245"></a>The Minister may tell us&#151;I hope that he will&#151;that he is setting up a review. He can do no less after two such tragic deaths and so much information in the public domain that raises questions about the role of the Youth Justice Board, the effectiveness of its supervision and its monitoring of secure training centres, which were all raised in the inquests regarding these two children.</p>

I was also a director of social services for six years and I have worked with, and seen at very close quarters, many of the troubled and troublesome young people in secure children&#146;s homes, secure training centres and young offender institutions. The death of, or serious injury to, a child in any of these institutions is to be deeply regretted and is deeply saddening. We have to acknowledge that it is very saddening to many of the staff. It is easy to portray staff as callous in these circumstances, and I want to say a little more about the job that they do.</p>

<a name="70718-0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="07071866000249"></a>I have talked to many children in these facilities and have seen their care close up. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, that, if we have a review, it is very important that we hear what they have to say and that we consult them about their day-to-day experiences of the regimes. Only in that way will we improve the regimes in these institutions. However, we must recognise that most young people in secure training centres have deeply disturbing histories and very often were out of control in the settings in which they were living before they entered the STCs. Some&#151;perhaps as many as 20 per cent&#151;have a long history of violence towards others and, indeed, towards themselves through self-harm.</p>

<a name="70718-0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="07071866000250"></a>In my experience, the staff are usually dedicated but, of course, they are not saints. I acknowledge that there are some rogue staff, but the same is true in police custody suites, secure children&#146;s homes and YOIs. Some rogue staff will be found in many of these settings. I do not say that with any satisfaction, but it is the reality that we face. In my experience, most staff are usually dedicated, but they can be provoked by the children. Equally, I acknowledge that a minority of staff provoke the children, just as some prison officers provoke prisoners. In a closed institution, it is not unusual to see that kind of behaviour on occasion. That is why we have staff rules and staff disciplinary procedures, and we have to be robust in applying them. Some of us have had to sack people who abuse the duty of trust that they bear when they take on these jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="07071866000251"></a>This does not mean that we do not need this change. I shall not try to defend the process by which we have reached this statutory instrument; I do not know enough about it and I am perfectly prepared to accept the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, that it could have been done a lot better. However, I do not accept that we do not need to clarify the legal responsibilities of staff working in these institutions, and that is what this measure does. It does it in response to the inquest into the sad death of Adam Rickwood.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="07071866000252"></a>In considering the merits of this rule change, we need to go back a little in history. When the Youth Justice Board was set up in 1998, it was given responsibility for commissioning places for young people who needed to be detained in secure children&#146;s homes, STCs and young offender institutions. It was not given responsibility for running these facilities, but it did set standards. One of the most difficult issues it certainly wrestled with when I was involved with it is this area of physical control and constraint. One of the long-standing problems has been that  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_290"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 290</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>there are different systems in operation in the three establishments where the Youth Justice Board commissions places, but the board has no legal responsibility for physical control and constraint. The Home Office and the Home Secretary have continued to retain responsibility for PCC in secure training centres.</p>

<a name="70718-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="07071866000253"></a>Rule 38 of the Secure Training Centre Rules, made in 1998, makes clear that young people can be restrained only in circumstances and using methods approved by the Home Secretary, not the Youth Justice Board. In practice, the Prison Service training college has continued to fulfil the Secretary of State&#146;s function of training STC staff in methods of constraint approved by the Home Secretary on advice from the Home Office juvenile offender unit. We need to be clear where responsibility has lain in this area.</p>

<a name="70718-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="07071866000254"></a>However, the STC rules do not explicitly permit STC staff to use reasonable force to maintain good order and discipline in STCs; nor do they allow the YJB to intervene in this area. This statutory instrument will allow the staff of STCs to use physical intervention as a last resort to maintain good order and keep staff and residents safe and secure. I believe it is reasonable to put that point beyond legal doubt so that STC staff can use physical restraint as a last resort to maintain order in establishments which, we have to recognise, have a substantial number of residents with a potential to engage in disorder that is dangerous to themselves and others. That is, after all, what the coroner presiding at the inquest into the tragic death of Adam Rickwood was seeking.</p>

<a name="70718-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="07071866000255"></a>The question then for consideration is whether there are sufficient safeguards in place to deal with the potential misuse of that clarification of legal authority for staff. Here I take a different view from some people in the debate, although I have some continuing concerns that I wish to leave with my noble friend about the position in which the Youth Justice Board is left. Nothing in this specific change in this order makes it more or less likely that STC staff will abuse young people in STCs. Unjustified use of force by staff remains an assault. The evidence suggests that the use of restraint in STCs is, if anything, a little lower than in secure children&#146;s homes.</p>

<a name="70718-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="07071866000256"></a>In my view, nobody associated with the Youth Justice Board supports the use of force simply to secure compliance with instructions such as bedtimes. The YJB's own code of practice makes explicit that restraint should always be used as a last resort and never as punishment. Physical control and constraint has been developed specifically to avoid relying on pain to manage the behaviour of young people. However, there are extreme circumstances where staff are permitted to use a sharp burst of pain to the nose, thumb or rib where all other attempts to control a young person have failed and a serious situation is developing, or has developed, that has a material impact on the running of a centre.</p>

<a name="70718-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="07071866000257"></a>I acknowledge that judging in particular instances whether reasonable force has been used can be difficult, but the central proposition under which staff are operating does not seem unreasonable. Sometimes staff are dealing with volatile situations where they  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_291"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 291</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>could easily lose control if matters are allowed to escalate. Clarifying legally their ability to retain control is essential.</p>

<a name="70718-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="07071866000258"></a>Let us reflect on the alternative, which is to allow the situation to get out of control and to have to call in the police or the Prison Service to put down a riot. That is the alternative unless we allow staff legally to use judgment in handling particular situations. I do not think that the alternative is a road down which any of us want to go, in the best interests of children.</p>

<a name="70718-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="07071866000259"></a>However, I have some concerns that I ask my noble friend to consider with some urgency and report back on to Parliament. They relate to the legal accountability in the area of physical control and constraint. As I have said, the Youth Justice Board has no legal responsibility, but people seem to assume that it has. There are different arrangements for PCC in different establishments for which the Youth Justice Board contracts the services&#151;secure children's homes, STCs and young offender institutions. The YJB has no clear legal responsibility in relation to PCC in those areas. It has used its general duty of care&#151;wisely, in my view&#151;as the legal basis on which to issue a code of practice.</p>

<a name="70718-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="07071866000260"></a>However, its ability to ensure that staff are trained in what it regards as good practice is constrained by its legal position. That is not satisfactory and led to legal confusion in the tragic death of Gareth Myatt in April 2004 in an STC. The coroner&#146;s inquest seems to have been wrongly informed by lawyers acting for the Government that responsibility for advising on physical constraint had been transferred to the Youth Justice Board. It has not. It has remained with the Home Secretary and is now still with the Secretary of State for Justice. It is a Minister and a department, not the arm&#146;s length Youth Justice Board, who make the rules in this area. It is not a shared legal responsibility. It is my view that the Youth Justice Board has always been in an unenviable position in this area. That is why it has expressed its concern about that in the past.</p>

<a name="70718-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="07071866000261"></a>I feel that I ought to say that in this House, because it is jolly difficult for the Youth Justice Board to say so itself. An urgent review by the Ministry of Justice is required to put the accountability for physical control and restraint, including methods and training of staff, in the three areas for which the YJB has contractual responsibilities, on a much clearer legal basis. Personally, I have some reservations about the nose technique, which has been mentioned. There are certainly issues about the variable systems of training for staff working in those three different types of facilities, but we should not just concentrate on STCs if we want to improve training of staff looking after many vulnerable children.</p>

<a name="70718-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="07071866000262"></a>I ask my noble friend to consider an urgent review with his ministerial colleagues. Subject to that consideration, I support the order as a proper way to protect staff in STCs in the difficult job that they do on behalf of us all.</p>

Much of what I would have said has already been set out splendidly by him, my noble friend Lady Stern and others, so I will confine myself to one or two points.</p>

<a name="70718-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="07071866000265"></a>The amount of restraint used in secure training centres is quite astonishing. If, as the Government hope, the techniques of restraint are used only as a last resort, it seems extraordinary that they are used so often. It is most people&#146;s experience when dealing with children of this kind that they are indeed the most troubled and troublesome, and that almost all of them have profound long-term mental difficulties. Many, as we know, will go on to self-harm for several years and many will remain in institutions for the rest of their lives. They form a profoundly disturbed group.</p>

<a name="70718-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="07071866000266"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, said, we have stakeholder comments in the briefing from the Youth Justice Board about when such techniques might be used. He did not give us an example, but I hope that he will allow me to quote one provided for us in its notes on 27 June:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="07071866000306"></a>&#147;For example, if a young person on a house unit refuses to go to bed, a number of staff members may need to sit with him or her. If this means there are insufficient staff on hand in the unit to carry out duties such as monitoring other young people who may be at risk of self-harm, other young people may be at risk. PCC&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071866000276"></a>restraint&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="07071866000309"></a>&#147;may have to be used if all other avenues fail. Similarly if all young people on a house unit refuse to go to bed, there would be a breakdown of the safe operation of the unit&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07071866000277"></a>So we progress ineluctably from a simple refusal to go to bed to a violent act, albeit sanctioned, in the name of prevention when clearly there are a number of other ways in which someone might be able to intervene in such a situation. That strikes me as one of the worst circumstances in which to use techniques of this kind.</p>

<a name="70718-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="07071866000267"></a>If we look at the figures for the use of restraint in the four centres, there is a threefold difference between the use of restraint in one centre and its use in another. There are three possible reasons for this. The first is that incidents are being recorded in different ways. However, the guidance on how to record incidents suggests that that is unlikely. The second possibility is that there may be a different range of children with different problems in each of the four units. That is a real issue and the Minister may be able to tell me whether that is the case. However, I suspect, of course, that one unit is better staffed than another, has better training and leadership from its managers, and has staff who have learnt how to use their personal resources to control situations by spotting a potentially difficult one coming up and defusing it, thereby diverting the potential energy elsewhere.</p>

<a name="70718-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="07071866000268"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Warner, that I do not want to diminish the difficulties faced by the staff in  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_293"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 293</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>these units, or the challenges that these children pose for them. None of us knows how to deal adequately with these children. We have maintained a pretty old-fashioned approach. There has been no real shift in our understanding of what are the best techniques to handle difficult and violent children from what it was 20 or 30 years ago. We know that the more use of violence there is, the more it will be perpetrated in further acts of violence as the child grows up. As was said by the right reverend Prelate, violence begets violence. Too many of these young people will go on to live lives where their only relationship with other people is exercised through further violent exchanges.</p>

<a name="70718-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="07071866000269"></a>I hope that we will look seriously at reviewing the use of these techniques, and consider the point made by my noble friend Lord Dearing about the totally unacceptable and dangerous acts which are both difficult and dangerous for the person perpetrating them but far worse for the children on the receiving end, who are at serious risk of death from asphyxia or cardiac arrest, particularly when they are taking mental health medication. Further, we should look rather more closely at what research there is into how to manage these children. I suspect that we are putting them into secure training centres of the kind we have at the moment, into our criminal justice system youth offending institutions, and even local authority homes because we really do not know what to do with them. Let us take a closer look at this.</p>

Even by the crudest measurement of results, they have failed to deliver&#151;reoffending is over 80 per cent&#151;but it is the day-to-day management of the children which is the chief cause of our deep concern today. Before 1997 there were no STCs, but these children were contained, managed, treated and helped in secure children&#146;s homes, psychiatric units and other facilities in the community. Yet, with a similar clientele, Scotland has found it neither necessary nor desirable to go down this route&#151;thank God.</p>

<a name="70718-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="07071898000002"></a>It was confirmed in a technical amendment during the Offender Management Bill that STCs are indeed classified as prisons, something that has been unclear in many minds when the YJB commissions places at both STCs and secure children&#146;s homes for young offenders; of course, the latter are emphatically not prisons. The Bill also clarifies government policy that imprisonment is indeed the proper punishment for even our youngest, most difficult and troubled children, with a regime that will physically restrain them in the disturbing ways we are discussing. I take the view, along with most of the distinguished groups and organisations cited by my noble friend Lord Carlile, that penal custody is inappropriate and wrong for children.</p>

<a name="70718-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="07071898000003"></a>The profile of the children themselves, who are as young as 12, is very important. The most telling phrase which has been used to describe this group is  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_294"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 294</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that they have a &#147;disproportionate experience of loss&#148;. This includes, literally, loss through bereavement or loss of family ties, loss of education, loss of mental health and well-being, loss of any place in the world, and loss of love. To have lost or never to have had such things in life is a terrible thing. There is overwhelming evidence that these children have a disproportionate experience of abuse&#151;physical, emotional, sexual&#151;and neglect.</p>

<a name="70718-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="07071898000004"></a>What flows from this, inevitably, is that such children are extremely difficult, challenging and disturbed. Some are capable of terrible things and displaying truly awful behaviour, sometimes to themselves and sometimes to others. Skill and experience in the management of these children&#151;a hugely difficult task&#151;is essential; it is important that that skill and experience is present. They are crucially and centrally still children&#151;with all the needs and vulnerabilities, as well as the rights, of children&#151;to whom we have a particular duty of care, both legal and moral.</p>

<a name="70718-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="07071898000005"></a>Yet we have managed to create regimes in which not only are they being forcibly restrained but where the process for restraint can and does damage them, not only emotionally&#151;as we have heard, one child, Adam Rickwood, committed suicide following restraint&#151;but also physically, including broken bones. On one occasion, tragically, a death resulted from a restraint called the double-seated embrace. I agree with Ms Sally Keeble in the other place, who was mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, when she referred to a lack of sense of horror on the part of officialdom at the gruesome death of a boy and the catalogue of systemic failures on the part of various bodies, such as the YJB and the Home Office, which have taken years to come to light in an official inquiry.</p>

<a name="70718-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="07071898000006"></a>Tonight we are looking at the use of restraint and the extension of its permitted use from the specifically defined purposes of preventing harm, either to the child or to others, escaping, damaging property or inciting others to do the same, to include good order and discipline. PCC&#151;physical control in care&#151;includes restraints called distraction techniques, involving the nose, wrist or thumb, which can cause pain, sometimes bruising and nose bleeds. My noble friend Lord Carlile was absolutely right to say in his important report on restraint, segregation and strip-searching of children in STCs that such techniques should never be used to enforce compliance or as punishment. The fact that such techniques have been used over 3,000 times in one year demonstrates that they are commonplace and used in ways specifically ruled out by my noble friend Lord Carlile. A culture of restraint has developed. To allow the vague criterion of &#147;good order and discipline&#148;&#151;swearing or refusing to go to class are examples that have been given&#151;would be to condone and endorse restraint unacceptably.</p>

<a name="70718-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="07071898000007"></a>I have visited three of the four STCs, where I was welcomed and met staff whose commitment and good intentions were clear. I have even had the double-seated embrace&#151;the one which killed Gareth Myatt&#151;demonstrated to me. These are indeed places of imprisonment and, as the figures show, places of punishment&#151;not only by virtue of being in prison but because of the way in which the children are managed  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_295"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 295</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>when they misbehave. I have learnt only recently that metal handcuffs are used in STCs although they are not used in prisons.</p>

<a name="70718-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="07071898000008"></a>It is the underlying ethos, the management styles&#151;starting with the language of &#147;trainees&#148; and &#147;custody officers&#148;&#151;and the perception of roles and duties that demonstrate a failure to understand the extremes of damage and need of the children in this care. I have mentioned before in the House that there was once a chance to earn a teddy bear for good behaviour&#151;itself a graphic little detail&#151;but that has since been withdrawn at Medway. The minimal training is totally inadequate to meet the huge challenges of dealing with incidents in these STCs except, as so often, through force and inflicting pain. There is the lack of opportunity properly to review an incident with the child, the failure of the monitoring process or proper reporting and, finally, even the inspection process is through CSCI, which knows all about children&#146;s homes but not so much about prisons.</p>

<a name="70718-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="07071898000009"></a>It need not be like this. At a secure children&#146;s home in Scotland, St Mary&#146;s Kenmure, whose clientele is exactly the same as those in the STCs, the ethos, management styles, skills and philosophy are very different. A crucial difference is the belief that the size of the place is important and should not be more than around 30 to 40 at most&#151;half that of most of the STCs. All the large secure homes in Scotland are now closed. This is closely linked to the belief in the necessity of all the staff to really know and have a strong professional relationship with the children. For this, the whole environment must be small. To have a large place split into separate units is not the same and does not achieve the same thing.</p>

<a name="70718-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="07071898000010"></a>Part of the aim of the regime and the relationships is to bring the children to the point where they can start to control their own behaviour. The development of self-belief in the children grows from the understanding that the staff actually believe in them. From that comes the possibility of change and the child wanting to change. This is not just good thoughts and thinking, but in that place a reality. It is a different world from that of the STC. The idea of restraining children using painful techniques is anathema. That is not to deny that there are sometimes challenging and alarming incidents which the staff have to deal with, chiefly using TCI&#151;therapeutic crisis intervention&#151;techniques, a process of de-escalation, talking wherever possible through the event and always, after any incident, a restorative process of discussion. Importantly, the debriefing is also there for the staff. Training is a pre-condition with care staff, as you might expect. Care staff have a minimum of an SVQ or an HNC, the teachers have degrees and all staff have twice-yearly training and refresher courses. This is an acknowledgement of the challenging nature of the task of working with these children and of the skills required. By 2010 St Mary&#146;s Kenmure will be registered with the Care Commission, which also requires all staff to be properly qualified.</p>

<a name="70718-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="07071898000011"></a>If we believe in our duties to children and in the possibilities for change and if we believe that it is wrong to harm any child&#151;even our most difficult&#151;while we work towards change, then it is imperative

I would definitely welcome a review.</p>

<p><a name="st_84"></a>
<a name="07071898000012"></a><b><a name="70718-0007.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="07071898000109"></a>The Lord Bishop of Worcester:</b> My Lords, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, will not be embarrassed by an excess of prelatical support. There is something very attractive to Bishops about a Lord temporal proposing a Prayer, but that is not my reason for standing up.</p>

<a name="70718-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="07071898000013"></a>First, I reassure the Minister and the noble Lord, Lord Warner, that this is not a debate between people who think that looking after disturbed young people is easy and those who think it difficult. This is not a debate involving people who think that they could do it better. I am among those in this House who realise that such a task would be very defeating and would provoke emotions in myself that might well lead to the unacceptable use of violence, were I not myself restrained by a regime over which Parliament ultimately has jurisdiction. Secondly, the House should acknowledge an enormous debt to the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, for his consistency and measured raising of the issues. His report was probably the most difficult read I ever had while bishop to Her Majesty&#146;s Prisons. I could not manage it at a sitting, frankly finding it too distressing. However, if that was one of the most difficult things to happen at that time, one of the most hopeful was the restructuring of Ministries, and the appointment of the Minister who will answer this evening, as real opportunities for opening up a different direction and a view of justice that is fundamentally hopeful.</p>

<a name="70718-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="07071898000014"></a>Also, in the context of this debate, the use of &#147;clarification&#148; about these rules is positively Orwellian. I do not wish clarification&#151;which is certainly necessary&#151;to be used as a cover. Like all noble Lords, I will be listening with great care to what the Minister says about what further clarification&#151;real clarification of boundaries&#151;he will offer as reassurance to the House. I understand that it will be for the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, to decide whether those government responses are adequate to the Prayer that he is proposing, or whether he needs to press the matter. However, I am pretty disquieted even by the thought that these rules will be on the statute book, because one of the things that statutory frameworks do is to create ethos, climates of opinion or cultures. While it may be true that you can clarify those rules, say what you really meant and produce boundaries around them, the fact is that we shall have in this country rules that say this kind of thing about the possibility of using physical restraint where necessary for the purpose of restoring order. That not only introduces an element of subjectivity into the lives of these young people, but opens the way for &#147;rogue officers&#148; to feel that there is a sneaking level of public support for them doing what we believe to be unacceptable.</p>

<a name="70718-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="07071898000015"></a>The report of the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, gives us ample information. His speech this evening and those of other noble Lords and the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, give us ample evidence. I am not sure what a further review can be expected to unearth&#151;I

I had the privilege of being a member of his review. I remember with interest that some of the recommendations that we made about restraint were subsequently rejected by the Government, and here we are again. Therefore, I have to declare that I very much share the sentiment of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Worcester in wishing that we were here to discuss the annulment of this statute, when in fact as I understood it we are discussing it rather in the context of the offering of a review. All I add, because many noble Lords have put all the things that I would like to have said, are the words that I have seen today for the first time of his honour Judge Pollard, sitting as assistant deputy coroner for the county of Northampton. He was responsible for the inquest into Gareth Myatt. He has used his power under the Coroners Rules 1984 to report to those who have the power to take action to prevent a recurrence of similar fatalities. He has written a 17-page letter to the Secretary of State, particularly stressing the absolute need, as the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, said, to</p>
<ul><a name="07071898000099"></a>&#147;listen to the voice of the child&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70718-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="07071898000017"></a>I would like to quote from two paragraphs. The first states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a><a name="07071898000091"></a>&#147;I understand that there is now to be a &#145;joint review&#146; on restraint, involving Young Offender Institutions, STCs and Local Authority secure units, namely LASUs and LASCHs&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071898000080"></a>which are local authority secure units and local authority secure children&#146;s homes. Judge Pollard continues:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a><a name="07071898000092"></a>&#147;I trust that no-one will lose sight of the particular and very immediate problems of PCC and the STCs&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071898000081"></a>physical control in care and secure training centres. He goes on:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a><a name="07071898000093"></a>&#147;Earlier quests for a uniform solution as between STCs, YOIs and Local Authority units resulted in very serious issues being completely overlooked by the&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071898000082"></a>Youth Justice Board,</p>
<ul><a name="07071898000100"></a>&#147;the need for a review of PCC being the prime example&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70718-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="07071898000018"></a>Judge Pollard then says that, at the inquest:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="07071898000094"></a>&#147;The Jury concluded that one of the factors that caused or contributed to Gareth&#146;s death was the failure by the YJB and the Home Office (as it then was) to undertake a review of the medical safety of PCC. It would be a wholly unforgivable and a double tragedy, would it not, if the holding of this &#145;joint review&#146; was to obscure the clear and urgent issues raised by Gareth Myatt&#146;s death, or was to lead to any delay in learning from and acting on the lessons that result from his death&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071898000083"></a>That is why I am concerned that we have yet another review. As the Minister will find, an absolute torrent of evidence is available now to justify a firm decision that, as the coroner said, the methods that have been used are being overused for all the wrong reasons. That is something it is our duty to prevent.</p>

<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_298"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 298</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="07071898000020"></a>I have a specific question for the Minister. Will the review look at the professional framework within which officers in these settings work, which has been mentioned by several colleagues today? Before entering this work, many of them will have had no experience of working with children. After eight weeks of training, which will emphasise mostly physical restraint, they will be expected to work with, as my noble friend has said, some of our most vulnerable children and young people.</p>

<a name="70718-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="07071898000021"></a>We can move so far forward with this. In Denmark, 84 per cent of the staff in settings such as children&#146;s homes have degree qualifications for that work, while in Germany the figure is 50 per cent. In this country, only one-fifth of such staff have those qualifications; the others are less well qualified than those in these other settings, but they are working with far less vulnerable young people. I am sure that we accept that many of these incidents could be avoided if staff were given the right professional framework. It is to do with managing relationships with the young people, the expertise of the staff and the way in which they are supported.</p>

<a name="70718-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="07071898000022"></a>We also know that, historically, the turnover of staff in secure training centres has been high. I hope that that is now beginning to improve, but what my noble friend Lady Stern said about Oakhill suggests that that is not the case. When there is a high turnover in those settings, expertise and experience cannot accrue and be passed on to enable officers to respond in the most constructive way.</p>

<a name="70718-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="07071898000023"></a>I draw the Minister&#146;s attention to the welcome proposals in the White Paper, <I>Care Matters: Time for Change</I>, including those on residential care, which emphasise a more pedagogic approach and contain some thinking that would be relevant to any consideration of how the situation might be improved. For instance, will the Minister look at the supported supervision of officers in secure training centres, where they are given time on a regular basis to reflect on the work with their supervisor? He might wish to contact the National Centre for Excellence in Residential Child Care, based at the National Children&#146;s Bureau, where there is a great deal of expertise in terms of best practice in residential work with young people. I hope that we can move towards a far better professional framework for officers in these settings.</p>

The evidence is so considerable that we must all be waiting to hear reassurance from the Minister in his new role, to which we welcome him.

<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="07071898000025"></a>We have heard again and again that there is far too much use of this kind of restraint. It cannot be justified, even as a last resort. Whether it is justified at all is highly doubtful. As a chairman of a juvenile court for over 20 years, I know just how vulnerable so many of these children are. This is clearly not the right way to treat them. It is interesting, too, that so many girls have shown up as being subjected to this

<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="07071898000026"></a>Some of the new ideas that we have heard about smaller centres, where a completely new approach is taken, must surely be the right direction to go in. One thinks again of the Corston report, which talked about smaller units nearer children&#146;s homes when dealing with women prisoners. I wish that we had had time to discuss that in the recent end-to-end offender Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="07071898000027"></a>I am not going to say any more. I hope that the Minister will be reassuring. The noble Lord, Lord Carlile, with all the work that he has done in this field, deserves to be given a very clear answer about a new way forward.</p>

<a name="07071898000028"></a><b><a name="70718-0008.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07071898000113"></a>Lord Dholakia:</b> My Lords, a while ago in Grand Committee, the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, and I were talking about the impact of Section 9 on the children of destitute asylum seekers. Now here we are in the main Chamber, talking about the impact of some of the measures affecting children in our secure training centres.</p>

<a name="70718-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="07071898000029"></a>I listened carefully to the arguments advanced by the noble Lord, Lord Warner. I shall put my side and explain what I think are the problems. There are two central issues regarding the statutory instrument. The first is whether physical restraint should be used against children to reinforce staff instructions in circumstances that do not involve the risk of harm to people, damage to property or escape. The statutory instrument would allow the use of physical restraint when none of those issues applied, for reasons of &#147;good order and discipline&#148;.</p>

<a name="70718-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="07071898000030"></a>The second issue is whether techniques involving the deliberate infliction of pain to the nose, ribs or thumb should be used in circumstances where none of those risks applies. The statutory instrument would also allow that to happen. The Government argue that staff should be able to use physical restraint as a last resort to enforce staff instructions in some circumstances. To reassure their critics, they point to the Youth Justice Board&#146;s code of practice, which says at paragraph 10.4:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="07071898000095"></a>&#147;Restrictive physical interventions must not be used as a punishment or merely to secure compliance with staff instructions&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071898000084"></a>However, the code of practice does not have statutory force. The statutory instrument does, and its phrasing would allow the use of restraint merely to secure compliance with staff instructions. It would legalise the use of restraint to ensure &#147;good order and discipline&#148; without any further definition or restriction of the scope of that phrase.</p>

<a name="70718-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="07071898000031"></a>In a Written Ministerial Statement in another place, Bridget Prentice MP stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a><a name="07071898000096"></a>&#147;We would not anticipate that a refusal to comply with an instruction alone would constitute a breach of good order and discipline. However, where the circumstances of the refusal are such that the refusal to comply with an instruction has wider implications for the safe running of the centre, undermining the general authority of the staff or putting safety or security at risk in some other way, then a genuine concern about good order and discipline may arise&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 21/6/07; col. 113WS.]</p>

<p><a name="07071898000085"></a>However, none of that is spelled out in the statutory instrument, which simply legitimises the use of restraint to ensure good order and discipline. Even if the Government&#146;s view as reflected in that Statement were incorporated into the statutory instrument, it includes the phrase,</p>
<ul><a name="07071898000101"></a>&#147;undermining the general authority of the staff&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07071898000086"></a>which could be used to justify the use of force in just about any situation in which a young person refused to obey an instruction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="07071898000032"></a>In a stakeholder briefing on 27 June 2007 entitled &#147;Restraint in Secure Training Centres&#148;, the Youth Justice Board argued that in such circumstances a refusal to comply with staff instructions could put other young people at risk of physical harm. But those circumstances are already covered by the present law, which allows restraint to prevent injury to the young person or other people.</p>

<a name="70718-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="07071898000033"></a>The briefing then goes on to argue that restraint could be justified if a young person refused to stop swearing at a teacher because of the disruption caused to the education of other young people. This is an astonishing proposition. Pupils in urban comprehensive schools not infrequently disrupt the class by swearing at teachers, but their staff are not empowered to use physical restraint techniques against them as a way of preventing disruptions.</p>

<a name="70718-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="07071898000034"></a>Why does the Government&#146;s stance on this matter cause such acute concern to so many practitioner organisations, including Nacro, of which I am the president? The first reason is that dealing with young people in ways that involve the use of force in situations where they do not pose a risk to people or property seems a disproportionate response, as spelled out by many noble Lords. Secondly, it sets an example that force is the way to resolve situations, which runs counter to the messages that we should be imparting to young offenders. Thirdly, a high proportion of young people in secure training centres have suffered physical or sexual abuse from adults in the past. Manhandling them through physical restraint can cause them extreme distress, bringing back memories of what they have suffered at abusive adults&#146; hands.</p>

<a name="70718-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="07071898000035"></a>Let us turn to the specific issue of painful methods of restraint. The Youth Justice Board&#146;s stakeholder briefing appears to agree with its critics that painful distraction techniques should not be used where there is no risk of harm to the young people or others. The briefing says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a><a name="07071898000097"></a>&#147;Distraction techniques in particular may only be used when a person is at risk of harm&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07071898000087"></a>However, there is nothing in the statutory instrument to restrict the use of painful techniques to these circumstances. If the Government&#146;s stance is the same as that of the Youth Justice Board as stated in the stakeholder briefing, why do they not amend the statutory instrument to make it clear that distraction techniques cannot be used unless there is risk of harm to a person? It cannot be right to frame restraint powers in such a manner that they would legally allow practices of which the Youth Justice Board rightly says it does not approve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="07071898000036"></a>A number of noble Lords have talked about Adam Rickwood. His suicide followed a few hours after he was instructed, not because he was threatening to assault someone or injure himself, but because he was refusing to go to his room. Unless the statutory instrument is withdrawn or amended, it will enshrine in law the right of staff of secure training centres to behave in the same way to other vulnerable young people with predictable and potentially tragic results.</p>

<a name="70718-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="07071898000038"></a>The rules are defective in that they refer to &#147;good order and discipline&#148;. That phrase should be totally rejected because it gives the wrong impression and sends out the wrong statement about what the ethos of a training centre should be. I may be assisted by other Members of the House on this matter, but I am not aware of any criminal statute that refers to good order and discipline as such, or of any classic judgment that refers to it. I believe that the phrase laces the Queen&#146;s regulations for all the armed services&#151;it is none the worse for that&#151;but it is a catch-all provision, dealing with a plethora of offences, some of them very minor indeed.</p>

<a name="70718-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="07071898000039"></a>The idea that you should be allowed to use substantial force and pain as an instrument is quite wrong. Would you use pain to train a dog or horse? Why should you use pain to train a child? There will of course be circumstances when force has to be used. I accept that. But the bar should be set very high and the rules should be made absolutely clear, possibly by defining the circumstances or by giving illustrations of the sort of circumstances where such force would be justified and where one could act ejusdem generis with that list. Such a list would make it obvious that force could be used only where there was imminent danger of violent disorder or of substantial injury and so on. If we are talking about cases of minor infractions of good order and discipline&#151;nothing more than an institutionalised system of disobedience&#151;then most certainly this should be changed. That cannot be done in this debate tonight, but I suspect that the Minister will be able to say that, if the evidence convinces him&#151;and I agree with noble Lords who say that the evidence is totally overwhelming&#151;he will be prepared to replace the rules with something more humane and civilised.</p>

The fact of the matter is that the real implication of those words is that the rule of law will not apply in these institutions. It is quite impossible, given those words, for a court to know whether an individual applying physical restraint is acting within or outside the rule of law. That is an additional matter to which I hope that the noble Lord&#151;to whom I, too, express the sympathy that has been extended by so many of your Lordships when making their interventions today&#151;will address his considerable intellect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="07071898000041"></a>In the context of the tragic circumstances of recent individual deaths in STCs, the text of this statutory instrument is, on the face of it, inexplicable. Of course there will be occasions when restraint will be necessary. But they should be, as so many of your Lordships have stated today, only a matter of last resort; and then only if we are clear about what the consequences of any technique used are likely to be.</p>

<a name="70718-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="07071898000042"></a>In the case of Gareth Myatt, the jury expressly found that there had been an inadequate assessment of the safety of physical controls generally, and in particular an inadequate assessment of the technique of the seated double embrace used on him. They went on to say that that inadequate assessment caused or contributed to Gareth&#146;s death. What steps have the Government taken to make such an assessment of the existing techniques used; and have such assessments been made of the techniques foreshadowed in the statutory instrument?</p>

<a name="70718-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="07071898000043"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carlile, referred to a number of officers who were too ready to use violence. No doubt there will always be individuals like that. They do not belong in the secure training centre service. But most members of the service are fundamentally decent people who use certain physical restraint techniques out of ignorance. That ignorance flows partly from a lack of training and partly from the absence of a clear set of procedures that permit physical restraint only when all other options are exhausted. I turn again to the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, for I believe that that is fundamentally encapsulated in the remarks that he made.</p>

<a name="70718-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="07071898000044"></a>There is powerful evidence that there is a woeful lack of proper training in the service. As the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, said, a high percentage of the children inclined to violence were themselves the victims of violence as young people. This is, as your Lordships are so well aware, an exceedingly complex matter, which needs managing by individuals who are well versed in the origins of child violence. What steps are the Government taking to improve the quantity and quality of training? I should also be interested to learn from the noble Lord what non-physical control techniques are being taught to handle the behaviour of individuals who are potentially capable of violence. </p>

<a name="70718-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="07071898000045"></a>I must confess that, like the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater of Butterstone, I am uneasy about these children being in institutions run by the private sector, where the conduct of the supervisory staff is determined by the law of contract, not by the ethos of public service. STCs ought to be about making young people fit to return to society to play a constructive role. Their management ought not simply to be required to fulfil a series of contractual obligations as a response to levels of violence. I hope that the Minister can reassure your Lordships that the private sector is capable of playing the constructive role to which I refer.</p>

<a name="70718-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="07071898000046"></a>More transparency&#151;again, a matter underlined by the noble Lord, Lord Carlile&#151;would have exposed these deep-seated problems much earlier. As it turns out, it is tragedy that has uncovered them. The Government must now develop a strategy that will transform this sombre scene so that these harrowing losses of life will not have been in vain.</p>

I know that the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Worcester did not like the word &#147;clarification&#148; and thought that it had an Orwellian aspect, but the amendment to Rule 38 is being introduced because, in terms of the inquest, there is a lack of clarity. That is what the SI is designed to do&#151;nothing more. It is not an attempt to put back the clock or open the door to the inappropriate use of restraint.</p>

I was rather surprised when the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, referred to the use of the private sector, and I shall come back to that in a moment. He will recall that the Act provides for the centres to be run by either the public or the private sector and makes special provision for any centres that are contracted out.

<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="07071898000053"></a>However, the question of clarification arises because in the Secure Training Centre Rules 1998, in their original form, Rule 38, which deals with the use of physical constraint, does not include ensuring good order and discipline as one of the purposes for which physical restraint may be used.</p>

Is it the Minister&#146;s view that, as a matter of law, that third category of good order and discipline is then ejusdem generis&#151;in other words, to be construed as being of the same family as the other two categories, which are, let us face it, rather serious in any event?

I have not come across, nor been advised of, suggestions that a court would not be properly able to interpret it.</p>

<a name="70718-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="07071898000056"></a>Rule 38 of the Secure Training Centre Rules 1998 deals with the use of physical restraint. It does not include ensuring good order and discipline as one of the purposes for which physical restraint may be used. The purposes listed in those rules are to prevent a trainee escaping from custody, injuring himself or others, damaging property or inciting another trainee to injure himself or others or to damage property. Clarification is required on how Rule 38 relates to Section 9 of the 1994 Act. It has clearly been the subject of some confusion. That became apparent at the recent inquest into the tragic death of Adam Rickwood. The coroner highlighted the need urgently to clarify the interrelationship. That is why this statutory instrument has been laid. It adds to the purposes for which physical restraint may be used, set out in Rule 38, that of ensuring good order and discipline. It does the same to Rule 36, which concerns removal from association. Before this change, we consulted the Youth Justice Board and the directors of secure training centres. They were firmly of the view that those powers are essential if centres are to be run safely. I shall come back to that point in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="07071898000057"></a>I clearly understand the concerns raised here and in representations that my department and, I understand, the Youth Justice Board have received that &#147;good order and discipline&#148; is a catch-all expression that will enable custody officers to use physical restraint techniques on any young person who refuses to follow an instruction by a member of staff. While I completely understand why noble Lords are concerned, that is not the case. A threat to good

It must involve behaviour which puts the safe running of the wider establishment at risk. I emphasise to the right reverend Prelate that the power relating to good order and discipline is not catch-all. The right reverend Prelate said also, as did my noble friend Lord Warner, that some of the young people who are resident in secure training centres are very troubled and can sometimes be a danger to themselves and others. I do not think that there is any disagreement among noble Lords about that; nor is there any disagreement, I suspect, that it is critical that staff maintain effective control so that everyone in the establishment is kept safe. We have already heard about the duty of care, and I echo those remarks. I fully accept also that, in managing young people&#146;s behaviour in custody, members of staff must seek to influence them through their own example and leadership, and enlist their willing co-operation. That is stated in Rule 31. Equally, however, if good order and discipline are threatened, physical restraint may on occasion be necessary as a last resort.</p>

<a name="70718-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="07071898000058"></a>My noble friend Lord Warner said that many staff do an excellent job. It is right that we acknowledge that. It is important to understand, as I always do, that these are challenging situations in which to work. We must acknowledge also that many of the staff who work in those institutions are incredibly dedicated. Equally, however, none of us must surely be naive. My noble friend Lord Warner made it clear that there will be rogues, and we have to have safeguards in place to ensure that, as far as is humanly possible, they are contained and removed.</p>

<a name="70718-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="07071898000059"></a>I again make it clear to noble Lords that Section 9 of the 1994 Act states that reasonable force may be used, but only where necessary. That qualification is very important. Equally important is the stipulation in Rule 38 that physical restraint may be used only where no alternative method is available<I>. </I>It is clear in both the Act and the rules, therefore, that physical restraint must be used only as a last resort, when there is no alternative available or other options have been exhausted.</p>

<a name="70718-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="07071898000060"></a>In discussions with me in the past few days, the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, suggested that it might be helpful if the actual words &#147;as a last resort&#148; were included in the rules. Ministers have asked for advice on that. The advice that we have received is that the current wording,</p>
<ul><a name="07071898000103"></a>&#147;only where no alternative method ... is available&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07071898000090"></a>carries the same meaning as &#147;as a last resort&#148;.</p>

<a name="70718-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="07071898000061"></a>The code of practice is very important. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, expressed doubts about whether a contractual relationship between a public body and a private sector provider is appropriate and sufficient. He will know that I come from the healthcare field. It is not an unusual phenomenon for there to be a contract between a public sector commissioner and a private sector provider. Provided that the law is clear and understood, that the private sector provider is capable of providing the services that are required, and that the contractual process is  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_306"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 306</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>properly in place and adequate monitoring takes place, there is no reason why that cannot be a suitable arrangement. Clearly, the code of practice that informs the contracting process, developed by the Youth Justice Board, is very important. The code was introduced last year after extensive consultation. It outlines very clearly the Government&#146;s and the Youth Justice Board&#146;s policy on the use of restraint. I make it absolutely clear that an unjustifiable use of force in any environment is an assault, as the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, said. The Government and the Youth Justice Board have never accepted that force may be used simply to gain compliance with staff instructions, and we never will.</p>

<a name="70718-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="07071898000062"></a>Important questions were asked about the monitoring of the centres. I am the first to acknowledge that criticism was made in the inquest about the Youth Justice Board&#146;s monitoring policy. Some noble Lords will know that the Youth Justice Board expressed regret that, for example, PCC was not reviewed before 2004. My understanding is that the board has been very active since then in promoting improvements in behaviour management. Its 2006 code of practice emphasises the strict limits on when restraint may be used.</p>

<a name="70718-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="07071898000063"></a>A number of noble Lords asked what the alternatives are and how they are being developed. A range of other actions is being planned by the Youth Justice Board. They include trial and evaluation of a modified version of a control and restraint system used by the Prison Service, which emphasises de-escalation techniques, a new assessment of compliance with a code of practice, and a review of research literature on behaviour management approaches in different parts of the world. I fully understand the need for us to observe, understand and learn from methods that have been developed in other countries. The Youth Justice Board is also supporting the British Institute of Learning Disabilities to create a tool to assess the safety, effectiveness and social validity of restraint techniques. It is piloting therapeutic crisis intervention methods, which are clearly very important. Early indications from the evaluation of a pilot at Hassockfield secure training centre are that TCI has had a positive effect and that levels of restraint have been reduced. The board is also planning to convene a panel comprised of experts from the relevant medical fields to review the medical safety of PCC techniques and, as was mentioned in our debate, it is piloting restorative justice approaches to managing difficult behaviour.</p>

<a name="70718-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="07071898000064"></a>I acknowledge what the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, said about consultation. The Explanatory Note is short. However, I would refer noble Lords also to the Explanatory Memorandum. I pay tribute to the work of the Merits Committee. Following its request to the Government, Explanatory Memoranda are now produced for all statutory instruments, not just affirmative ones. It is fair to say that the Explanatory Memorandum gives more clues to what the statutory instrument is all about.</p>

<a name="70718-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="07071898000065"></a>I know that there is concern about the number of times that distraction techniques are used routinely on young people in secure training centres. The noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, referred to the 3,036  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_307"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 307</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>occasions when physical restraint was used in secure training centres between November 2005 and October 2006. That figure includes both restrictive holds and distraction techniques. The latter were used 169 times from February 2006 to March 2007. We want to see a reduction in their use, and that is why we have put in place the code of practice for behaviour management. Yet the level of restraint also reflects the scale of the challenge posed by some of these vulnerable young people and the problems faced by staff in dealing with them.</p>

<a name="70718-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="07071898000066"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, asked about the difference in figures between centres and also between secure training centres, secure homes and young offender institutions. Clearly it is important that these differences are monitored to understand what lies behind them. I am happy to write to noble Lords about our analysis of the monitoring, but my understanding is that monitoring shows that the level of restraint rises when particularly challenging children who are seriously disturbed are placed there, wherever the setting. I also understand, and the noble Baroness hinted at this, that secure training centres have not used the same counting rules for restraint. The Youth Justice Board has recently clarified the counting rules. I will write to noble Lords about that.</p>

<a name="70718-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="07071898000067"></a>Noble Lords asked about the training of custody officers. I accept that it is important. There is an initial training programme, there are refresher programmes, and staff required to use physical restraint or to instruct others in its use are trained by accredited instructors, approved by the authority during the initial training programme. In response to the noble Lords, Lord Kingsland and Lord Dholakia, the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, and the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, there can be no complacency about the training programmes. We must continually look at and refresh them. I accept the point made by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, about the supervision and structure, because training and the work of individual custody officers does not happen within a vacuum. In the end, we must come back to leadership, which is so critical in all these areas.</p>

<a name="70718-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="07071898000068"></a>I understand the comments about specific centres. The inspection reports are of course very detailed in that respect. It is important that we build on them. On the comments about Oakhill made by the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, she will know that a new director has moved into that centre in the last couple of weeks. We will be monitoring the situation there carefully.</p>

<a name="70718-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="07071898000069"></a>We have heard some negative remarks about secure training centres, and that is fair comment; yet there are also some good outcomes, and we must acknowledge that for the sake both of the young people there and of the staff. I met a young man at the centre I visited last week who had been through custody a number of times. As a result of the fantastic education he had been given, he was now going back to his community and a school place had been allocated. It is important that I acknowledge the good work that has been undertaken, particularly the emphasis on education and the record in raising the levels of literacy and numeracy, often from a low base.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="07071898000070"></a>On the power of a Prayer, this has been a wide-ranging and important debate. There are clearly issues much wider than this statutory instrument, relating to restraint and extending beyond secure training centres to young offender institutions and secure children&#146;s homes. I fully accept that we have to look at policy and practice across the board. It was announced in another place last week that we intend to set up a joint review of restraint issues with the Department for Children, Schools and Families. We took this decision after discussions with the Youth Justice Board, and we will use the review to build upon the extensive programme of work that the board has undertaken around both the specific issue of restraint and the wider issue of how best to manage the challenging behaviour of this group of young people.</p>

<a name="70718-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="07071898000071"></a>This review will certainly need to look at the operational efficacy and safety of restraint methods in juvenile secure settings, including physical control in care&#151;the system of restraint used only in secure training centres. It is likely to encompass the medical safety of the individual techniques, and it will also consider how we can ensure that there is cross-departmental knowledge-sharing on use of restraint across a range of secure settings. The details of the review will need to be worked out with other government departments and with the Youth Justice Board. Of course I will ensure that the comments of noble Lords tonight will be fed into that process of working through the detail of the review, and into the review itself.</p>

<a name="70718-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="07071898000072"></a>I confirm that the review will consult widely and that it will have an independent chair. I understand that noble Lords do not wish a review to be seen as simply a way of postponing decisions and responses for a long time. It is our hope that the report can be completed within about six months of the appointment of the independent chair. I hope that noble Lords will accept in good faith that we are keen to get on with this work.</p>

<a name="70718-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="07071898000073"></a>On the specific question that the noble Lord raised about cross-government working and the Department for Children, Schools and Families, that department now has a joint role in relation to policy and funding for youth offending and the Youth Justice Board. How this will be discharged in practice is being worked out at the moment, since we are all new to these particular roles. Given that restraint techniques are used in secure children&#146;s homes as well as secure training centres and young offender institutions, and that there are risks in all three settings, the involvement of the new department and my department in this particularly complex area provides an opportunity for us to look at these issues afresh.</p>

<a name="70718-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="07071898000074"></a>I do not know whether the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, is here. He does not seem to be, so I should not really respond to what he said. I understand that we have received the coroner&#146;s letter, and of course any recommendations that the coroner makes will form part of the consideration of the review.</p>

<a name="70718-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="07071898000075"></a>I understand the issues that my noble friend Lord Warner raised about accountability. They are important  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_309"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 309</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>issues, and he is right that the Secretary of State is legally accountable for approving systems of restraint for use in secure training centres. That is probably one of the answers to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, about the arrangements regarding the use of the private sector. I suspect that that was one reason why it was placed back in the original legislation. I understand the issues raised by my noble friend and will ensure that that issue is considered within the scope of the review.</p>

<a name="70718-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="07071898000076"></a>I apologise for speaking perhaps too long tonight, but I thought it important to respond in detail to this extensive and important debate.</p>

<a name="70718-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="07071898000079"></a>I have spoken for too long. I hope that noble Lords will accept that there is absolutely no complacency on my department&#146;s part; we think that clarification is necessary. I hope that this statutory instrument will be allowed to follow its course, but the review is very important. I am grateful to noble Lords for the way in which they have approached this debate.</p>

I also congratulate Sally Keeble, his honourable friend, on her contribution to the debate in another place.</p>

<a name="70718-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="070718100000003"></a>The Minister should not apologise for one moment for the length of his reply. His reply has dignified this debate by being so full and addressing the concerns of all Members of the House. This has been a detailed, informed, sombre and instructive debate that should be required reading for all those involved in the management of secure training centres. This was the House of Lords at its best, with contributions from the church, the law, psychiatry, the criminal justice system and the youth justice system, as well as experts in social policy, children&#146;s issues, the penal system, senior judicial experience, the voluntary sector and even Scotland.</p>

<a name="70718-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="070718100000004"></a>We have heard the contribution of two right reverend Prelates. I hope that the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Norwich will forgive me if I focus for one moment on his noble friend the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Worcester, who is retiring shortly. We had a typical contribution from the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Worcester tonight, and we shall miss in this House what I hope I shall be forgiven for calling his combination of a Socratic style and Aquinian principle. He can make what he wishes of that.</p>

<a name="70718-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="070718100000005"></a>A number of very important issues have been raised about staffing levels. That was a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Warner. On these issues, I would

<a name="70718-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="070718100000006"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, made a very powerful point that must be repeated again and again. We are talking about children&#151;and maybe we can learn something about how children who commit crime are dealt with in Scotland in a rather more constructive way.</p>

<a name="70718-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="070718100000007"></a>We heard brief and eloquent arguments from the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Norwich about keeping the numbers down, the importance of recording events and always presuming that there should be no violence. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, rightly emphasised the importance of the views of His Honour Judge Pollard, which were given today and should heavily inform the debate.</p>

<a name="70718-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="070718100000008"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, whose contributions on children&#146;s matters we always regard as important in this House, along with the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, emphasised the need for proper professional qualifications, experience and expertise among those working in secure training centres&#151;which, as the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, and the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, emphasised, should be smaller.</p>

<a name="70718-0009.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="070718100000009"></a>As to the Minister&#146;s response, I am very grateful for that. However, I do not resile from my point about the Explanatory Note, because I took the trouble today to look on the Government&#146;s excellent new statute law website. The Explanatory Note appears on the website but not the Explanatory Memorandum. If people are to understand what is meant by the legislation, please can the Government extend the website so that the manager of a secure training centre can see the Explanatory Memorandum as well as the Explanatory Note?</p>

<a name="70718-0009.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="070718100000010"></a>The Minister obviously listened with great care to all that was said during the debate, but he did not quite answer the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, perhaps because he couched it in a fine Welsh-Latin phrase, eiusdem generis. But it is important that we all realise that good order and discipline is not a phrase with a separate meaning and it is not a &#147;safety valve&#148;, to adopt the language used about another statute. It is simply part of the whole definition, which does not in any way dilute the last-resort principle. I am grateful to the noble Lord for making that point.</p>

<a name="70718-0009.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="070718100000011"></a>The Minister has made considerable and generous concessions to the concern expressed in the debate, which I have expressed to him and his right honourable friend in the past few days. He has placed an emphasis on de-escalation techniques, which are of the essence of this argument. He has provided a clarity of statement, which I can tell him will be pored over and used by all those who deal with legal cases involving violence used in secure training centres. I welcome his confirmation that the scope of the inquiry will be wide, its timescale short and that it will have a fully independent chair. I take it on trust that that inquiry will be appointed very soon indeed.</p>

<a name="70718-0009.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="070718100000012"></a>The Minister knows that I and others will return to this subject assiduously. I was reluctant not to divide the House on this subject but, having considered what

I know that he is now the Minister responsible for legal aid and I hope that he will show the same constructive spirit when soon he is invited, as he will be, to the Old Bailey Bar Mess, to talk to barristers about recent unilateral changes made by the Government in the legal aid fee system. I hope that it will not be regarded by him merely as an initiation rite but as an opportunity for the sort of constructive dialogue that we have had tonight.</p>

<a name="70718-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="070718100000016"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, these regulations make provision in respect of the establishment and operation of a database, ContactPoint, under Section 12 of the Children Act 2004. The regulations place a requirement on local authorities to participate in the operation of the database. They specify what information will be held, who must or can provide this data, how long it can be retained, who can be granted access and how accuracy will be maintained.</p>

<a name="70718-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="070718100000017"></a>ContactPoint is essentially an electronic directory of practitioners providing services to children and young people. It will enable all practitioners working with children to find out who else is supporting a particular child to deliver better co-ordinated support. Our <I>Every Child Matters</I> programme aims to improve outcomes for all children. ContactPoint will help facilitate this by supporting effective prevention and swift intervention when problems arise, ensuring that children and their families gain the support of the services that they need as early as possible.</p>

<a name="70718-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="070718100000018"></a>These regulations have been considered by the House&#146;s Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee, and we are grateful to it for its thorough report, whose findings will inform our implementation policy. In the course of the committee&#146;s deliberations, concerns were raised about the rationale for the scheme and about security, accuracy, data management, cost and universality. I will address each issue in turn.</p>

<a name="70718-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="070718100000019"></a>First, why is this database necessary? Practitioners have told us that the process of identifying and contacting other professionals working with any one child is frustrating, time consuming and very costly. A recent survey of nearly 3,000 practitioners revealed that, on average, practitioners need to make contact with other services 107 times a year and it takes an average of four hours each time to do so. ContactPoint  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_312"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 312</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will significantly improve on this situation, freeing up an estimated 5 million hours per year of time currently spent by professionals in pursuing information, rather than delivering expert services. This time saving alone is equivalent to at least &#163;88 million annually.</p>

<a name="70718-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="070718100000020"></a>On security, there has been a good deal of inaccurate comment on the amount of information that will be held on a child&#146;s record. I stress that ContactPoint will hold only basic information: name, address, date of birth, gender and a unique identifying number on children on England until their 18th birthday, together with contact details of their parents or carers, GP practice, those providing education and specialist or targeted services to a child. ContactPoint holds no case data, no clinical data, no subjective assessments and no judgmental statements about a child, their carer or parents. Details of practitioners providing sensitive services, which, for the purposes of ContactPoint, are defined as services relating to sexual health, mental health and substance abuse, may be added to ContactPoint only with the informed and explicit consent of the young person concerned or, where appropriate, their parents.</p>

<a name="70718-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="070718100000021"></a>Furthermore, these sensitive practitioner contact details will be hidden from view, except for the very small number of local ContactPoint management teams who will be responsible for brokering contact between practitioners. Let me also state categorically, that ContactPoint will not hold information about a child&#146;s school record or attendance, nor&#151;as was described in one extraordinary press report&#151;about how many portions of fruit and vegetables they may eat. Indeed, Section 12 of the Children Act 2004 specifically precludes such information being held. Nor will information be held about their parents&#146; circumstances, such as whether they have a drug or alcohol problem. Regarding parents, ContactPoint will hold only the name and contact details of any person responsible for the care of a child&#151;nothing else.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="070718100000022"></a>On data accuracy, each local authority in England will be responsible for the records of children in its area. Each will have a dedicated resource funded by my department to ensure that the data is accurate. We anticipate that when the system is operational, 300 people will be working specifically to ensure accuracy within local authorities. In line with the Data Protection Act, all organisations and local authorities must take reasonable steps to ensure that information supplied to, or held on, ContactPoint is accurate and up-to-date. Children and young people or, where appropriate, their parents or carers will have the right to see what is being held on their record and, where inaccuracies are found, to have them corrected. There will be a clear process enabling people to exercise that right, and fair processing notices will explain how the data may be used&#151;which is also a basic right under the Data Protection Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="070718100000023"></a>I now turn to safeguards to ensure the protection of the information collected&#151;the issue raised in the Motion tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton. The security of ContactPoint is of the utmost importance. The design and operation will adhere to ISO 27001, the new international standard for information security management systems. This  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_313"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 313</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>addresses physical, environmental and personnel security, communications and operations management. ContactPoint will conform to relevant government security standard and will be subject to review by independent security experts. Unauthorised access will be prevented by using a combination of methods.</p>

<a name="70718-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="070718100000024"></a>First, we are insisting on strong user authentication&#151;not merely a user name and a password, but four system checks: a user name, a password, a PIN number and a physical token. Secondly, all users will be trained in the importance of security and good security practice. Users will receive mandatory training and their use of ContactPoint will be audited at every stage. Their activity on ContactPoint will be subject to continuous monitoring. Any suspected misuse will be investigated and could lead to disciplinary procedures within their organisation. Where appropriate, an investigation may lead to prosecution that could result in a fine or even imprisonment.</p>

<a name="70718-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="070718100000025"></a>A range of existing legislation includes penalties for the improper use of data. The Computer Misuse Act 1990 states that unauthorised access or attempted unauthorised access to a programme or data held on a computer may be punishable by imprisonment or a fine. The Data Protection Act provides that personal data unlawfully obtained or disclosed without the consent of the data controller is a serious offence, with a penalty or fine up to the statutory maximum, or an unlimited fine if the case goes to the higher courts. The Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill provides for these penalties to be increased to include imprisonment for up to two years on indictment, and up to 12 months on summary conviction. These increased penalties would apply to misuse of ContactPoint.</p>

<a name="70718-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="070718100000026"></a>Controlling access to ContactPoint is an important part of ensuring that the information within it remains secure. Access to ContactPoint will be restricted to those who can demonstrate a genuine need for it to facilitate their work. User numbers are estimated at about 330,000, and will include practitioners from education, health, social care, Connexions, the voluntary sector, youth justice and the police. Before being granted access to ContactPoint, users will need a current, enhanced Criminal Records Bureau disclosure and must also have been trained in the safe and secure use of the system, in compliance with the Computer Misuse Act 1990 and the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>

<a name="70718-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="070718100000027"></a>These regulations require users to renew the enhanced CRB disclosure every three years. Any conviction for offences against children, or for offences under the Computer Misuse Act 1990 or the Data Protection Act 1998, are likely to preclude access. I also note that the Information Commissioner&#146;s office has offered valuable advice and comment throughout the development of this project. The commissioner&#146;s memorandum to the Merits Committee concludes,</p>
<ul><a name="070718100000028"></a>&#147;we are satisfied with the overall design of ContactPoint&#148;.</ul>

<a name="70718-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="070718103000003"></a>The issues of cost and universality were raised in the Motion moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. Why should ContactPoint hold records for every child? First, a universal system has no stigma attached; since every child is included, no judgment will be made about a child merely because they are on the database.</p>

<a name="70718-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="070718103000004"></a>Secondly, the system principally supports early intervention for children who, at some point in their lives, need additional services. This is not a small proportion. It is estimated that it will comprise about 30 per cent of children at any one time and 50 per cent during their lives. However, children move in and out of that spectrum of need, and it is not possible to predict who will need these services or when. Without a universal system, practitioners would have to make decisions about the needs or vulnerability of a child without all other available information. We would be faced with a continuation of the current system, where practitioners are often able to contact only those other practitioners whom they can easily track down. Holding records only for children judged at risk or to have a need for specialist or targeted services would prove very difficult. Judgments about whether a child meets the threshold for inclusion on the database would be subjective and inconsistent.</p>

<a name="70718-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="070718103000005"></a>Thirdly, the cost was also raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, in her Motion. We are advised that it would be more expensive to try to filter out records for different categories of children. It is proportionate to hold a small amount of information on all children rather than continually making threshold decisions, each of which would have to be input into the system, about which children should be put on it and which to take off.</p>

<a name="70718-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="070718103000006"></a>Our conservative estimate is that from 2009 ContactPoint will free up about 5 million hours a year for practitioners, which, as I said earlier, is the equivalent of investing an additional &#163;88 million a year in children&#146;s services. ContactPoint is expected to cost an initial &#163;224 million to set up and to have annual operating costs of &#163;41 million. Less than a fifth of the &#163;224 million is to set up the infrastructure itself. Almost half of the funding, &#163;103 million, is earmarked for local implementation, including workforce training, and the remaining investment is to fund project activity during the set-up period.</p>

<a name="70718-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="070718103000007"></a>The Motion tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, asserts that investment in ContactPoint would be better spent on front-line staff. However, in an important sense it is being spent on front-line staff: it will free up their time to do their job and it will enrich their knowledge of relevant practitioners also working with a child. Furthermore, improving children&#146;s services is not simply a matter of increasing staff numbers. Practitioners must also be able to work better together, and ContactPoint will support that much more effectively than under the status quo.</p>

<a name="70718-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="070718103000008"></a>In developing ContactPoint, we have worked closely with all relevant partners to ensure that the system meets their needs. All 150 local authorities in England are preparing to start using ContactPoint during 2008. An advisory group has been set up, with membership  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_315"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 315</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>drawn from professional and representative bodies and national voluntary organisations. The group meets regularly to provide input into the development of the project. We are also glad that a number of national charities&#151;Barnardo&#146;s, the NSPCC, NCH, the Children&#146;s Society and Kids&#151;together with the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre and the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, are working with us as national partners in implementing ContactPoint. When the system is in operation, they will be granting access and managing users within their respective organisations.</p>

<a name="70718-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="070718103000009"></a>Let me also stress that there is strong support for our proposals from children&#146;s welfare organisations, which I believe should not be lightly set aside in the debate. The Merits Committee hearing report includes, for example, written evidence from Barnardo&#146;s, which describes ContactPoint as,</p>
<ul><a name="070718103000031"></a>&#147;a challenging project, but worthwhile in that it harnesses the technologies of the 21st century in support of those who work with children in the interests of the children themselves&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="070718103000029"></a>The National Children&#146;s Bureau submission to the committee also acknowledged ContactPoint&#146;s potential,</p>
<ul><a name="070718103000032"></a>&#147;to underpin effective information sharing and joint working&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70718-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="070718103000010"></a>Consultation and engagement with children, young people and parents has also been invaluable. Using questionnaires, workshops and online consultation, and engaging organisations such as the former Commission for Social Care Inspection and the British Youth Council, we have consulted with more than 1,100 children and young people. At least 183,000 parents and carers have been provided with information by the trailblazer authorities, and we value greatly the feedback we have received from all these groups. With the Information Commissioner&#146;s office, the Children&#146;s Rights Director at Ofsted and the Children&#146;s Commissioner we are developing communication materials aimed at children, young people and families. These will describe what ContactPoint is, what data is to be held on it and how they can exercise their right to see their own data and, where necessary, to have it corrected. They will be developed nationally to ensure consistency and will be disseminated to local authorities so that local information can be added.</p>

<a name="70718-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="070718103000011"></a>To conclude, these regulations, in providing for the operation of ContactPoint, will significantly improve the safeguarding of vulnerable children and enhance the provision of information and support for the children&#146;s workforce in carrying out its vital responsibilities to our children and young people. I commend them to the House and I beg to move.</p>

Whatever aspect of government policy we talk about in whatever department we must ensure that the resources of time and money are focused and used effectively to support those who need them most.</p>

<a name="70718-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="070718103000015"></a>The Motion I have tabled goes straight to the heart of my deep concerns about these regulations, which set up a database to store the intimate details of millions of children. Doctors&#146; details, contact with practitioners dealing with sexual and mental health and substance abuse and contact details of parents are just some of the information fields that will be included. The legislative web surrounding these regulations renders them far wider-reaching and threatening than has been made clear. Even though the Department for Children, Schools and Families has claimed that the ContactPoint database will not contain information on cases, since 2000 under the e-Government Interoperability Framework, otherwise known as e-GIF, it has been mandatory for all public sector databases to facilitate the sharing of data across systems. Currently, a range of databases holding detailed information about children already exist in education, social care and youth justice. Can the Minister give a guarantee that ContactPoint will be exempt from the requirements of e-GIF? What steps will be taken to ensure that the child in question may not be identified by other associations in the information provided? Indeed, what protection will be provided for the list of names behind the numbers?</p>

<a name="70718-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="070718103000016"></a>My first and deepest concern is for the children whose personal information is stored on the database and, if accessed by fair means or foul, could result in them being placed in great danger and in deeply vulnerable situations. It will be extremely difficult to secure such large quantities of sensitive information. Eleven million children will have their details stored on the database, and upwards of 330,000 people will have legitimate access to it. While I hope that those 330,000 people will be trustworthy, function creep develops at an alarming rate in data systems, which is all the more disquieting given the wider context of online fraud, growing at 300 per cent a year. It raises serious questions about whether we can, in reality, trust in the assurances that we are given, even though they are given in good faith at the time.</p>

<a name="70718-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="070718103000017"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for confirming what training those handling the information will have and what checks they will undergo, including enhanced CRB checks. However, noble Lords will know that CRB checks only cover known criminals and fail to cover overseas workers, who now comprise a large part of the health and social care workforce. Has the Minister considered the danger of exposing such sensitive information to the extremely wide range of users, including many subgroups. Is the Minister at all concerned that employees of contracted-out services&#151;often temporary staff&#151;might be given access to the database?</p>

<a name="70718-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="070718103000018"></a>Above all, it is vital that we do not unwittingly provide a resource indicating children&#146;s whereabouts to anyone who is not acting exclusively in the very  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_317"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 317</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>best interests of the child or anyone who may, however unintentionally, fail to protect that information. The Information Commissioner&#146;s Office report to Parliament, <I>What Price Privacy?</I>, shows how easy it has been for private investigators to gain access to personal data by paying employees of the target organisation. Dr Ian Brown of University College, London, recently brought to our attention a report from the inspector-general of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, who earlier this year found that the digitised medical records of 1.3 million individuals had been mislaid. That shows yet again how easy it is for security safeguards to be ignored and bypassed.</p>

<a name="70718-0010.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="070718103000019"></a>I draw attention to the 27th report of the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee and I pay tribute to the committee for its customary diligence and excellence. It was noted that while the DCFS may be acting with good intentions, the huge number of users of the database will,</p>
<ul><a name="070718103000033"></a>&#147;inevitably increase the risks of accidental or inadvertent breaches of security, and of deliberate misuse of the data ... which would be likely to bring the whole scheme into disrepute&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70718-0010.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="070718103000020"></a>I am sure that the Minister will remember fondly the amendment that I tabled last year to the Childcare Bill which would have ensured that any information collected under Clause 99 would have to be destroyed within a year. It was my understanding then that the regulations were intended to provide safeguards against the collection and processing of disproportionate amounts of information and that they would include stringent security and safeguarding measures; yet only a year later, the regulations before us contain a contradiction on the vital point of safeguarding.</p>

<a name="70718-0010.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="070718103000021"></a>A particular concern is the drafting of Regulation 6. Regulation 6(2) places a duty on local authorities to ensure that no one can access sensitive service details, archives and ID numbers on other systems. However, Regulation 6(4) is so widely drafted that it appears to negate Regulation 6(2). In effect, when the two provisions are read together, they seem to say that a local authority must hide the details but can decide not to. To allow loopholes to rest in regulations of this importance and sensitivity is nothing less than unacceptable.</p>

<a name="70718-0010.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="070718103000022"></a>A survey of local authorities carried out by my honourable friend Tim Loughton MP shows the state of disarray on the ground. Authorities do not feel ready for the system. Moreover, in light of the appalling records around the country, as expressed in the Information Commissioner&#146;s latest report, councillors have expressed,</p>
<ul><a name="070718103000034"></a>&#147;practical and moral concerns at the mammoth task ahead of them&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="070718103000030"></a>The Government intend to use the system to improve the care of and provision for children. Their intentions are of the best kind and are shared in principle by all noble Lords. Yet it is the very system that they seek to rely on that risks stigmatising children and discouraging them from seeking help where necessary.</p>

<a name="70718-0010.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="070718103000023"></a>The Minister said that the regulations had the backing of many children&#146;s welfare organisations. However, the majority of young people and parents consulted

Noble Lords will have received the excellent briefing from the Independent Schools Council.</p>

<a name="70718-0010.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="070718103000024"></a>The ContactPoint system, we are told, is intended to prevent another Victoria Climbi&#233; situation. However, that is not quite accurate. The agenda for the collection of children&#146;s data began with the programme originally called &#147;identification, referral and tracing&#148;, which predates the Laming inquiry and does not mention child protection in its original criteria. Moreover, the child protection specialist Chris Mills has already ascertained that the system would not have applied to Victoria Climbi&#233;, given her temporary residency in this country.</p>

<a name="70718-0010.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="070718103000025"></a>We all wish to see an end to the horrors that befell Victoria Climbi&#233; and others. Inasmuch as the system will create a culture of over-reliance on what will always be a flawed database, it would divert attention from the children who most need protection from those who profess to care for them. It appears that the children of the rich and famous may be exempted if there is a risk of kidnap. While I fully understand why that should be the case, it strikes me as the most damning admission of the inability of the system to protect the details of children, not to mention the injustice of treating one set of children differently from the rest.</p>

Given the huge complexity of the system&#151;150 little databases wired into one national database&#151;the system, as much as any other, risks becoming yet another hugely over-budget IT white elephant, and a very dangerous elephant at that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="070718107000002"></a>We all agree about the desirability of multi-agency working and the best possible communication between the professionals involved with every child in the best interests of that child. We differ only in our view of how that can be best achieved. While we are delighted that the Government are prepared to invest additional funds in securing these ends, we question whether this very welcome money is being spent most effectively in the interests of the nation&#146;s 11 million children by setting up a gargantuan and dangerous database, at least half of which, by the Government&#146;s own admission, is unnecessary, since the children do not need any special services at any time up to the age of 18.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="070718107000003"></a>I have expressed on many occasions my concerns about the overall safety and value for money of the scheme. I did so most recently in the debate on large government IT projects on 21 June. I therefore thank the Minister for the letter that I received from him yesterday, following a little prompting from the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee, which asked whether he had written to me about the concerns that I had raised when it looked at the merits of the regulations on 10 July. I think that the Minister thought that by writing his letter he had pre-empted the issues that I might raise. In fact, he has really given me the skeleton of my speech, although I am reassured by a couple of his points, such as the fact that information about parents will not be put on the database. Many of the other points raise further questions.</p>

<ul><a name="070718107000075"></a>&#147;the Government have not in our view conclusively demonstrated that a universal database is a proportionate response to the problem being addressed. While the Government have taken the need for security seriously, the scale and importance of the scheme increase the risk that any accidental or inadvertent breach of security, or any deliberate misuse of the data, would be likely to bring the whole scheme into disrepute&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70718-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="070718107000005"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, has just ably demonstrated, the regulations are shot through with loopholes. The committee added in paragraph 23 that it is not convinced that,</p>
<ul><a name="070718107000076"></a>&#147;the additional benefits of a universal approach justify the additional costs and risks, as compared with a selective approach which would not include a child in the database unless or until the child&#146;s needs for specialist or targeted services became apparent&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="070718107000006"></a>That is why my amendment expressing regret&#151;in contrast with that of the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, which I support&#151;covers the system&#146;s cost benefit as well as its safety.</p>

<a name="70718-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="070718107000007"></a>We supported the 2006 regulations on data-matching trials, as it was only fair and reasonable to conduct trials. However, we have much greater concerns now that we have reached this stage. We are not convinced that the trailblazers&#146; results have been sufficiently analysed or that they provide an adequate basis for going ahead with this immense national project&#151;the biggest government database yet.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_320"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 320</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70718-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="070718107000008"></a>My worry is that the Government found it more convenient to set up a universal database, rather than investing in extra professional health visitors, social workers and the like who can focus on children in need, because they intend, at some time in the future, to use this information to feed into the national identity database. The Government propose to keep the data for six years after the child has reached 18 and is therefore ineligible for any children&#146;s services. Despite the Minister&#146;s assurances in his letter that there are no plans for data sharing or bulk transfer of data, it would be awfully convenient to plan for that and do it at some time in the future. When it happens, as I still fear it will, I will remind him of his reassurances at this time.</p>

<a name="70718-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="070718107000009"></a>The unnecessary attack on the privacy of at least half of the nation&#146;s children is another matter that concerns many of us. We are assured that the system will comply with the data protection legislation, but many of us consider that that is not enough. It is one thing for professionals to share information about a child where it is necessary to do so in the best interests of that child, but quite another to share information about all the other children in the country for no better reason than that it is more convenient to do it universally.</p>

<a name="70718-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="070718107000010"></a>I simply do not accept the Government&#146;s response, either to the Merits Committee or to me, that a universal database is better because it removes the need for thresholds and has less stigma and because it is not known when a child will need a service anyway. If we spent all this money on more professional staff, we would know earlier when children need help and would be able to provide it much sooner.</p>

<a name="70718-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="070718107000011"></a>Every child has to go through some sort of assessment and reach some sort of threshold anyway in order to qualify for any service. If there is any point at which stigma might be attached, although I hope not, it is at that point, and not at the point at which their private details are being entered on to an electronic database in the privacy of someone&#146;s office. Therefore, that argument does not wash.</p>

<a name="70718-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="070718107000012"></a>The committee expressed concern that the system will be used by 330,000 users. The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, and I are both concerned about the security of a system that is open to so many users. I am worried about the screening of the people inputting the information on the database, as is the noble Baroness. For example, the contract, I believe, is with Capgemini, which is expanding its operations offshore, in particular to India. Will the Minister give an undertaking that a clause will be written into the contract expressly forbidding the processing of any ContactPoint data outside the UK, since it is impossible properly to screen the people involved?</p>

<a name="70718-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="070718107000013"></a>I am also very much concerned&#151;this was pointed out by the committee in paragraph 11&#151;about the lack of support for this scheme from children, young people and their parents. The committee said that, during the consultations,</p>
<ul><a name="070718107000077"></a>&#147;approximately one third of the formal responses came directly from young people and parents. The majority of responses from this group expressed their opposition to the establishment of ContactPoint, raising concerns about the impact on their privacy&#148;.</ul>

<a name="70718-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="070718107000014"></a>A number of children&#146;s organisations have called on the Government to establish a major national communications campaign to inform children and their parents about the facts and their rights in this matter. I am most concerned that this should be effective, in particular the right to be asked for explicit consent to the inclusion of the fact that they are receiving sensitive services, such as contact with sexual health professionals. Frankly, I cannot imagine any child feeling inclined to give such consent. I am worried that children will not come forward for such services if they think that the information may go on the system without their consent, with the horrific consequences that that could have on sexually transmitted diseases and teenage pregnancy rates.</p>

<a name="70718-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="070718107000015"></a>I understand that there is best practice about this in organisations such as Barnardo&#146;s. Will the Minister assure me that the strongest guidance will be given to everyone inputting data into the system, to be absolutely sure that the child, not just their parents, has given consent to matters of this sensitivity? Will he say how this aspect of the system will be monitored? Will Parliament be told how many children have been asked for their consent and how many have refused it?</p>

<a name="70718-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="070718107000016"></a>The British Association for Adoption and Fostering and its partners expressed concerns that the scheme might even deter families who mistrust officialdom from coming forward for services because they do not want their details on a universal database. What evidence is there that this in an unfounded fear and how will this matter be monitored?</p>

<a name="70718-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="070718107000017"></a>There is also the matter of the system&#146;s enormous cost, which, as the Minister has said, is &#163;224 million for set-up and &#163;41 million annually to operate it. In his letter and this evening, the Minister claims that this money would support up to 13 additional front-line staff in every local authority in the country. I can imagine the celebrations all across the land if local authorities were told that they could have 13 more fully trained professionals to work in their children&#146;s services. Yet the Minister tells me that the trailblazers demonstrated that ContactPoint will free up between 16 and 24 staff per authority by reducing administration time. Therefore, why are local authorities not celebrating? Are these front-line staff child experts or are they administrators? The committee asked how this projected annual benefit would be translated into service delivery. I echo its question. Perhaps the Minister would tell us today.</p>

<a name="70718-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="070718107000018"></a>Surely it would be better to use these millions to reduce the social workers&#146; caseloads, thereby improving retention by providing more colleagues so that they have the time to communicate meaningfully with other professionals working with their clients and therefore do their job better. I would rather put the money into trained people than into hardware and software when we are talking about services involving one-to-one human contact.</p>

<a name="70718-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="070718107000019"></a>The Government claim that ContactPoint will reduce duplicated effort. However, they are only guessing and have shown us no evidence whatsoever. The system&#146;s security has to be a major concern. The fact that the Government plan to allow just the  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_322"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 322</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>location of high-profile children or those in danger of kidnap or domestic violence to be screened out from most users is a clear indication that they are not fully confident of its security.</p>

<a name="70718-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="070718107000020"></a>The Merits Committee is not, either. Hackers are clever and creative. That is why all anti-virus software is produced reactively not proactively. It plugs the holes once breaches have demonstrated their existence. Breaches of the security of ContactPoint will bring the whole system into disrepute and people will not use it. Parents will want their children out of it and the Government will have to think again. Is that what the Minister wants?</p>

<a name="70718-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="070718107000021"></a>Both the Merits Committee and I, in the Minister&#146;s letter, have received assurances about the systems in place to monitor usage. Every access will be recorded and patterns of usage scanned. Will that be by computer or by a human being? Potentially suspicious patterns of access are to be reported to the manager. The managers will also be monitored to ensure that they are doing all this. But do we have a monitor to monitor the monitors who are monitoring the monitors? I joke, but this is serious and it is getting ridiculous and expensive. If such a cumbersome system of safeguards is necessary, that makes it clear to me that the dangers are immense. Could not all this money have been better spent or is the hidden agenda that the Government really want a universal database because of its future potential for other purposes? We should be told.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="070718107000023"></a>I want to comment briefly on what is happening in the House in general. I see in this House an increasing interest in secondary legislation, and that is good. It is good for Parliament, it is good for the secondary legislation, it is good for departments&#151;it does not feel like it at times, but we get better performance from them&#151;it is good for the Government and, in this case, it is good for the children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="070718107000024"></a>I declare my involvement in this matter as a member of the Merits Committee. Indeed, the committee is so enthusiastic tonight that four of our 11 members are here. It is great to get lots of praise&#151;I thank noble Lords for that&#151;but it is extremely important to realise how limited we are. We 11 sad souls plod through 1,200 statutory instruments a year. Our terms of reference require us to make only two decisions. To quote our terms of reference, we have to make a decision about whether we should bring the instrument to the special attention of the House and we have to decide the reason for doing so. There are four such reasons: it imperfectly achieves the policy objectives; it inappropriately implements European Union legislation; the circumstances have changed since enactment of the parent Act; or, most generally of all&#151;it is under this circumstance that we brought this measure to the attention of the House&#151;it is politically and legally important or gives rise to issues of public policy likely to be of interest to

<a name="70718-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="070718107000025"></a>We then try to help the House by writing reports that will illustrate and help the subsequent debate. To be honest, we cannot spend too much time on them because of the sheer volume involved. Very occasionally, we call witnesses and publish their evidence, which we hope will also illuminate the debate.</p>

<a name="70718-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="070718107000026"></a>Because of that process, I have been exposed to this discussion at length and I have also been exposed to, and have been able to probe, the witnesses. I conclude that ContactPoint, the information database, will bring real benefit and will be safe. The whole range of new scrutiny means that the Government have had to up their act. I should like to speak briefly to the two amendments tonight and to share with the House my conclusions about the two issues raised.</p>

<a name="70718-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="070718107000027"></a>Noble Lords will know that, despite our wonderful reports, the Merits Committee is not as unanimous as it sometimes appears from our work. I am a dissenting voice. I failed to persuade my colleagues, and the report reflects very much the views of the majority. However, I took away these two areas and I should like to speak, first, to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, concerning the whole issue of security.</p>

<a name="70718-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="070718107000028"></a>If I have any professional skills left these days, they relate to an involvement in safety management systems. Those systems and security systems have very typical common characteristics. Broadly speaking, you cannot make anything safe. Ultimately, you reduce risk to as low a level as is reasonably practical and you get to that extremely low level by having multiple layers. I think that we should look at the five layers that I took from the witnesses, and I should be grateful if the Minister could either agree with me or write to me on some of the details. I believe that these five levels reduce the security risk to an acceptably and infinitesimally low level.</p>

<a name="70718-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="070718107000029"></a>First&#151;this cannot be said often enough&#151;the data held on the system are sparse. They include an identifier and details of who is in contact with the children. They say nothing whatever about the children other than the simple identifier and who they are in contact with. Because the details are so sparse, for most children the database will contain, other than the identifier, only details of the school and who is providing them with medical services.</p>

<a name="70718-0011.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="070718107000030"></a>Secondly, access to the system is not through a typical PC terminal in a connected system. We are talking about a dedicated terminal that is degraded with encrypted software so that it behaves as a dumb terminal. You can access the system only through a whole series of security measures and, when the terminal gives up its information, it cannot be used to store or manipulate the information. They are special dumb terminals and they exist only as necessary for the users.</p>

<a name="70718-0011.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="070718107000031"></a>Thirdly, use of the database and every activity on the system will be tracked and monitored. Noble Lords may ask who monitors the monitors but, ultimately, all security systems are about layers of tracking and watching how people behave.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_324"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 324</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70718-0011.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="070718107000032"></a>Fourthly, every time a practitioner uses a system, he has to explain and record on the system why he needs the information, so that the intentions of the users can be tracked and monitored.</p>

<a name="70718-0011.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="070718107000033"></a>Finally, you have to look at who will be using the system. It sounds as though a large number of people will be involved. However, not only will the users be screened in connection with its use, but they will be the very people who have already been screened because they are the practitioners to whom we presently entrust involvement with vulnerable people, such as the children whom this is designed to help.</p>

<a name="70718-0011.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="070718107000034"></a>I believe that those layers of protection will create the appropriate level of security. I hope that the Minister will be able to agree with me and reinforce that this will be a safe and protected system.</p>

<a name="70718-0011.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="070718107000035"></a>The second amendment, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, concerns proportionality. There is no word that I like more in legislation or regulation than &#147;proportionality&#148;. It is an absolutely key concept and we do not discuss it enough. The benefits must outweigh the costs. If only we applied that test with every piece of legislation and every regulation, we would be a better-run nation. It is the key idea.</p>

<a name="70718-0011.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="070718107000036"></a>Let us go into the question of how the measure is disproportional. At any point, 30 per cent of all children and, during their lives, 50 per cent of all children require some intervention and help from the caring services. I hope that there is universal acceptance that such intervention should be integrated. There is universal acceptance that the people providing those services should talk to one another and communicate. The only people to whom this system does not add value are the 50 per cent of all children for whom the only data that will be recorded, other than the identifier, will be their school or educational institution or how they are proceeding in their primary healthcare. The cost of holding that data is infinitesimal. It will be merely the overall cost of ensuring that the system is secure, so the disproportional cost will, in fact, be trivial.</p>

<a name="70718-0011.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="070718107000037"></a>Then we should look at the supporting evidence of the benefits. The department claims&#151;because we probed it on this, I believe it to be true&#151;that it will create &#163;88 million-worth of practitioner benefit. It will cost &#163;41 million a year to run and &#163;224 million to set up. That &#163;88 million-worth of benefit will relate to practitioners&#146; time. Practitioners who presently waste their time ringing up various agencies to try to find out who else is involved with a particular child will not have to do that in future. Instead, they can bend their efforts to supporting the child, which is what they are there for.</p>

<a name="70718-0011.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="070718107000038"></a>The database&#146;s other value is that it will facilitate very early intervention. Everyone who talks about this area of activity says that early integrated intervention is key, and the database facilitates that. Therefore, I do not believe that it is disproportional; I believe that it is sensible and proportional.</p>

<a name="70718-0011.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="070718107000039"></a>Finally, we probed the whole area of consultation. The original evidence that we heard contained some of the concerns that people have mentioned. Paragraph 7 of the memorandum from the department, on page  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_325"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 325</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>14 of our report, sets out how specifically it has gone out of its way to probe children&#146;s and young people&#146;s concerns after informed debate about what it is doing. When protections were explained, the children ended up in support of the system. They felt that it was valuable. For example, in the Sheffield experiment, only two out of 100,000 people refused to have their details on the database for the purposes of the trial. The children and young people asked for assurances, but they believed in the assurances that they received.</p>

<a name="70718-0011.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="070718107000040"></a>I believe that these regulations are safe. They will add real value, bring forward integrated intervention and be welcomed by the young people whom they are designed to help.</p>

<a name="70718-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="070718107000043"></a>I had the impression that those who came to give evidence to us were so steeped in&#151;I might almost say dazzled by&#151;the beauty and complexity of the universal database of children which they sought to create that they were losing sight of whether the universality of the scheme was proportionate to the needs of the children whom it was intended to benefit, and to the costs and risks inherent in it. For the sake of catching as quickly as possible the 3.5 million to 5 million children who may be in need of specialist and targeted services, they will include in the database 5 million to 7.5 million children who have no such need.</p>

<a name="70718-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="070718107000044"></a>The sheer size of the database, and the large number of practitioners who will have access to it, will maximise the costs and the potential risks of breaches of security which could be damaging to children as well as to the scheme, and the threat to privacy not only of the children who need the additional services, but also of those who do not. It is all in a good cause, no doubt, but I think that it is fair to say that the members of the committee were not convinced whether we really needed this universal sledgehammer to crack this partial, even if sizeable, nut.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="070718107000045"></a>The committee was told that it would be useful to include in the database the children who have no need of additional services, because it would enable the department to check whether they were getting the universal services to which they were entitled.

It would no doubt take longer to establish a child&#146;s situation and needs and provide practitioners with the information they need if the entry on the database had to be built up when the child&#146;s need for additional services came to be known. Is that delay a good enough reason for establishing a universal database? Is the elimination of that delay, perhaps of no more than a few days, worth all the additional costs and risks inherent in a universal database?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="070718107000047"></a>As I say, the members of the Merits Committee were, for the most part, not convinced. I do not mean to say that they were against it; I intend to say no more than they were not convinced of the need to go ahead with the universal database. I hope that the Minister will reconsider that decision, which I think, with some experience of bureaucracy, is a bureaucratic dream that could easily turn into a bureaucratic and political nightmare. In the light of the reservations expressed by the committee and by so many bodies in their evidence to us and in other submissions, I hope that he will re-examine the advantages of establishing a system more narrowly tailored to children in need of specialist and targeted services.</p>

I very strongly endorse what the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong, said, and what the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said earlier about the reaction of the Merits Committee to this scheme. It was called &#147;unenthusiastic&#148; or &#147;not convinced&#148;. Most of us&#151;I do not associate the noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, with this&#151;were very much less than convinced indeed about the merits of a scheme of this sort.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="070718107000049"></a>I find it very difficult to understand why there has to be 100 per cent inclusion of all 11 million children. I have listened to what the Minister said, and he had the benefit, I imagine, of reading the evidence of his officials who appeared before the committee. Really, he did not seem to have very much more to say tonight than they had to say when they appeared in front of us, which amounted to, as I heard it and as I heard him this evening, that it had to be 100 per cent because they did not want to hurt the feelings of those who were down because they had special needs, so you had to bring in the other 70 per cent, or 50 per cent, whichever way you look at it. I am not sure to what extent children would know whether they were on or off the register. If you have a partial register, I should have thought that it was not immediately apparent to them. It would be much less apparent, for example, than knowing in schools who had free school meals and who did not. But that is another matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="070718107000050"></a>I can see no sense, and a great deal of harm, in invading the privacy of 50 per cent, or even 70 per cent, of families in the country. The consultation has shown that there is no approximation to a broad consent from families and children for a scheme of this sort. The noble Lord, Lord Armstrong, in the

<a name="70718-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="070718107000051"></a>I am particularly concerned about the problem of computer access. I have heard from the Minister about the various provisions&#151;the layers which the noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, talked about&#151;but if a computer hacker can get into the computers of the Pentagon in Washington, it seems almost certain that hackers and those with malice in their minds would find little difficulty in getting into this computer system. As well as the abilities of hackers, there is also the possibility of using corrupt people&#151;and there will be corrupt people among the 330,000 people who will have access to this system. When we held our evidence session, I cited a piece of evidence put before us by an organisation called Young NCB, which said&#151;I think properly:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a><a name="070718107000073"></a>&#147;Computer systems are never ever completely safe. The threat of hacking is always there. Plus there is always the danger that a professional might use the system to gain personal details about a child or children&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="070718107000069"></a>Those who gave evidence to us in the hearing did not reject that evidence. I listened to the noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, who, to his credit, acknowledged that no system was entirely safe. I did not exactly hear that in the Minister's speech. He told us about hidden layers and all the rest of it, but I did not hear a clear acknowledgement that no system is entirely safe.</p>

<a name="70718-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="070718107000052"></a>Paedophiles and terrorists, in particular, will have all the expertise to hack into systems of this sort or use their friends and collaborators to find ways to get into them. The point was made by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton, in her excellent speech, that the fact that there is a screening-out process for those at particular risk shows the vulnerability of the whole scheme. I see ominous signs in the way that the computer system is presented to us, which reminds me of the computer system that was set up&#151;or that we were told was going to be set up&#151;for the Child Support Agency, which has proved to be a total disaster.</p>

<a name="70718-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="070718107000053"></a>I will not go on much longer but, because computer systems are not secure, I can only read out the conclusion of the evidence from the Independent Schools Council, which is typical of a lot of the evidence given to us. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a><a name="070718107000074"></a>&#147;If the system cannot be secured, it needs to be adapted to ensure that it can be. Otherwise, it will fail expensively, it will fail publicly, and, most importantly, it will fail the very children it was designed to protect&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="070718107000070"></a>I very much hope that the Minister will agree in his summing up to take the regulations away to think more about them, and to take notice of the evidence that has been given to the Merits Committee and in speeches tonight, and that we shall not be burdened with this bureaucratic sledgehammer. Of course, some good would come out of it, but overall it is not value for money and will not properly tackle the problems that it is intended to tackle.</p>

One day, as an adult, she rang the hospital where she was born and asked what time of day her mother gave birth to her. She was told that she could not have that

She put the phone down and rang back about 10 minutes later, asked the same person whether they could tell her when she was born, and she was given the time of day.</p>

<a name="70718-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="070718107000055"></a>I mention that to draw attention to a key point that lies at the heart of the debate. The way in which professionals decide to use information and the parameters within which they share information have never been fully clear. In debates on the primary legislation from which the regulations arise, we talked time and again to the Government about the need to recognise that the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Laming, in his inquiry into the death of Victoria Climbi&#233; was not that there should be a large database but that professionals should have a clear understanding of the Data Protection Act and their rights and responsibilities under it.</p>

<a name="70718-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="070718107000056"></a>As someone who sat through that inquiry, I think that the database is a way around trying to deal with those issues, which are ultimately those that make a difference to children. It will be no surprise to the Minister that I speak as someone who has an interest in records about children. I have an ongoing interest in the way in which adults formerly in care suffer because of incomplete records and their inability to access their records.</p>

<a name="70718-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="070718107000057"></a>It would be tempting to go back into a Second Reading speech but, because we should not, I simply want to ask the Minister to answer four questions that I do not see answered in the regulations. First, is the right to challenge information that is wrong or out of date enshrined and clearly understood? Who can do that? Can subjects do it?</p>

<a name="70718-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="070718107000058"></a>Secondly, what safeguards are there against the misinterpretation of information? That is a drawback of the system to which the noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, alluded: the information is so sparse that it can be interpreted in a number of ways. The fact that a child has been to see their GP four times in a year can tell you something or nothing. One does not need to be a genius in databases or the Children Act to look at cases where professionals have pursued their own lines of inquiry and have drawn into their net hundreds of children who should never have been included in investigations into abuse.</p>

<a name="70718-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="070718107000059"></a>My third question for the Minister concerns the responsibility of the organisations that hold the records. Social services departments regularly go out of business and new ones are created; so, too, in the health service. Very few elements of the health service other than GPs have been stable for a long time. What requirements will be placed on organisations that may go out of business because of legislation to ensure that those records continue to be kept and available for access?</p>

<a name="70718-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="070718107000060"></a>Finally, what does the Minister think of the figure of 330,000 staff, taking into account the number of people who leave the caring professions? There is huge turnover and high rates of temporary employment in social services. From my limited knowledge of databases, I am aware that it is often extremely difficult to get people off systems once they have been allowed on to them. What will be the protocols for ensuring that that

The only point I want to make centres on the dangers of breach of security, because I agree with so much that has already been said on this side of the argument that I need say no more. I acknowledge my indebtedness to a briefing prepared by the Independent Schools Council, which records that it is intended that retrospective tracking will enable local authorities to pinpoint abuse. The noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, also attached great importance to this point in his interesting speech. The council goes on to point out that,</p>
<ul><a name="070718107000078"></a>&#147;evidence presented last year to the management board of the Leeds NHS Trust showed that in one month the 14,000 staff logged 70,000 incidents of inappropriate access&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="070718107000071"></a>It concludes that,</p>
<ul><a name="070718107000079"></a>&#147;misuse of ContactPoint could run to 1,650,000 incidents a month; leaving the claim that such tracking will be effective incredible. It will simply not be possible to spot anywhere near all those who through commission or omission misuse the system&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="070718107000072"></a>That is deeply worrying, and I hope that the Minister will be able to offer some reassurance on this. If not, it seems to me to be almost decisive.</p>

<p><a name="st_107"></a>
<a name="070718107000062"></a><b><a name="70718-0012.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="070718107000090"></a>The Earl of Erroll:</b> My Lords, I should declare an interest as a member of the advisory board of the Information Systems Security Association. We have here a database which is supposed to provide proactive protection purporting to save time and therefore money and so on, and yet we have very sparse data on it. I do not understand how such a sparse dataset is going to save a huge amount of time. The data should be sitting in files already that could easily be exchanged at the local level with quite small databases, which would probably be more secure and easily managed.</p>

<a name="70718-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="070718107000063"></a>I have been thinking about this. If you have a big national database, how do you get it to work? There are some silly things in it. For example, when children go abroad for three or more years, they are taken off the system but archived for six years. But they may come back after eight or nine years, and then everything has to be found out about them and re-entered. There is some stuff in here that will go against its purposes.</p>

<a name="70718-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="070718107000064"></a>The archive will be enormous, at least half as big again as the main database&#151;although we do not think about that in the context of dealing with the whole problem. What use is the archive? It is to be restricted to only a few people, when actually CEOP, the child protection agency, probably should be the body with access to it because there could be some useful information for trying to find out about child abuse later on. Some things may not manifest themselves until later. I could not see why the agency was not included in the body of people allowed to look at it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="070718107000065"></a>I turn to setting security standards. ISO 27001 is the industry standard, but I hope that the department has also consulted CESG, which sets much higher standards. A good point was raised earlier about the people working on the database having access to it. Unless the database scheme is encrypted so that the data cannot be accessed by the programmers working on it, there is a huge security problem. Some people will be able to get in through the back door. I was always able to do so in the days when I wrote software and designed systems. Further, if the security systems are too cautious, the same problems will arise as those in one of the hospitals&#151;Nottingham or Northampton&#151;used in the trial runs. It took so long to log on to the system that all that happened was that one person would log on at the beginning of the day and everyone else used that one point of access. In effect, the terminal was left open. Care must be taken to make sure that the security is not unworkable. I warn the Minister about that, just in case.</p>

<a name="70718-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="070718107000066"></a>I am delighted to see that something will be done about increasing the penalties for leaking data and selling data. This has been long needed because something like 30 per cent of all lost data has nothing to do with hackers. That is not the problem these days; rather, the problem lies with people who are authorised to use the system. At the same time, we should look at the powers of the Information Commissioner to check that all the procedures and processes are correct and sensible. At the moment the commissioner has to wait until a complaint is filed and then pretty much has to be invited in by the data controller. Unless he has sufficient powers, he cannot find out what is going wrong.</p>

<a name="70718-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="070718107000067"></a>The Minister may have underestimated the cost of keeping the database up to date. If there are around 11 million children&#151;an average of 2.2 children in 5 million households&#151;it should be noted that some 40 per cent of London households change address every year. That would translate to something between 0.5 and 1 million changes of address to record on the children&#146;s database every year. If 300 people are monitoring the database for accuracy and a further 300 are trying to update it, I calculate that the 300 people in charge of updating it will have to handle something between 1,000 and 3,000 changes of address a day each, which will keep them quite busy. I am not sure that the Minister&#146;s money estimates are quite right, even with 600 extra staff. The temptation will be to link the database to the proposed &#147;Tell us once&#148; database, where someone tells the Government once about a change of address and the information ripples over everything else. My challenge on that rests once again on the law of unintended consequences in the security world. If you are an abused partner and trying to hide your new address, or you are in a witness protection programme, it is likely that at some point someone could access your address through the back door of one of these other databases where people do not realise that the address is sensitive. I am worried about having yet another database where parents&#146; addresses are to be maintained. Quite a few addresses will have to be kept on the database.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="070718107000068"></a>The point about the number of people who will have access to the database is very valid. I have worked out that during a child&#146;s life, it is theoretically possible that some 1.5 million people will have had access to that child&#146;s database&#151;although it is segmented into local authorities and so on. We have to remember that the turnover in social services is running at about 330,000 people a year. Lastly, some people will be needed to keep an eye on the project to see that it is going well and being run properly. The department should not fall into the same trap as HMRC did when it allowed the same company that provided the system to decide when the benchmarks were going to be run. The department should keep control of when the benchmarks will be run on the project.</p>

I have been asked a huge number of questions and I cannot possibly answer all of them. However, I will write to noble Lords with responses to questions that I am not able to answer now. Perhaps I may deal with a number of questions to which I have answers before turning again to the two major themes encapsulated in the two amendments&#151;one on the adequacy of the safeguards, moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris; and one on the proportionality, benefits and cost-effectiveness of the scheme, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley.</p>

<a name="70718-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="070718110000003"></a>I also thank all members of the Merits Committee for the consideration they have given to these regulations, both in the committee and in their contributions to the debate. I noticed that there were what is probably best described as a range of views expressed. I obviously agree with my noble friend Lord Tunnicliffe, who said that the scheme would bring real benefits and will be safe, more than I do with others, but I respect the views that have been expressed. I also note that all noble Lords who have spoken recognise the importance of child protection and seeing that information is available to practitioners where they deal with children who need additional services. They accept that this will be a very large proportion of children.</p>

<a name="70718-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="070718110000004"></a>The response I make to the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, is that when you are reaching proportions as high as 40 and 50 per cent, which are the kinds of proportions we are talking about, unless one has a clairvoyance&#151;which, alas, is rarely granted to bureaucrats, or even mortals&#151;and a universal system, there will be the huge job of adding and subtracting names constantly to and from a register. That in itself will introduce a big element of additional bureaucracy and cost and make the scheme less effective. The information will not be available until it is registered, so, by definition, it will not be available to practitioners before a child is entered on the register.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="070718110000005"></a>Perhaps I may now deal with some of the questions. The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, thought that there might be a loophole in the regulations, in that she detected an inconsistency between Regulation 6(2) and Regulation 6(4) in relation to access to data. I can reassure her that Regulation 6(4) provides only for those in ContactPoint management teams in local authorities to have access to the data set out in Regulation 6(3). It does not therefore negate Regulation 6(2), which was the concern that she had.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="070718110000006"></a>The noble Baroness also asked whether ContactPoint would be exempt from the e-GIF requirements on the mandatory sharing of information. I can assure her that ContactPoint information is limited by the Children Act 2004 to the purposes set out in Section 12. It will not be used for any other purpose.</p>

<a name="70718-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="070718110000007"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, asked about Capgemini, and whether the fact that it has contracts in other countries raises the possibility of information being disclosed abroad. I assure her that the Capgemini contract ensures that no data at all will be taken offshore.</p>

<a name="70718-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="070718110000008"></a>The noble Baroness asked what was the point of keeping information in the archive for six years. It is to support investigations or complaints. That period balances the Data Protection Act requirement not to retain information for longer than is necessary with the need to support and facilitate investigations. We have discussed our archive policy with the Information Commissioner&#146;s office, which is content that we have the balance right in this respect.</p>

<a name="70718-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="070718110000009"></a>The noble Baroness also asked about scope creep. The purpose and scope of ContactPoint has already been made clear very precisely in the Children Act 2004. It has a clear purpose linked to the duty to co-operate and to safeguard and promote welfare as set out in Sections 10 and 11 of the 2004 Act. The data held on ContactPoint are kept to a minimum, as I described, and will not include case information. For example, in response to the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, I say that they will not include details of visits to GPs. Those case data are not there. The only information that will be on the database is the identity of the GP; it will not include any of the data that she feared could lead to misinterpretation. Therefore, the data held on ContactPoint are in pursuit of the Children Act 2004.</p>

<a name="70718-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="070718110000010"></a>There has been very little change to the proposed contact of ContactPoint since the passage of the Children Act 2004, so there has been no scope creep in its development. Any amendment to the regulations, which are in pursuit of the Children Act 2004, will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure and therefore have the full scrutiny of Parliament. There could not be further scope creep without the consent of your Lordships and another place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="070718110000011"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, also asked about guidance to ensure that children and young people will give consent to sensitive services being included on the database. I reassure her that the guidance will address this issue and that consent must be, as will be made clear under the guidance, freely given and explicit. ContactPoint will not hold details of consent on the system, which was another issue she raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="070718110000012"></a>The noble Baroness asked whether the audit records of ContactPoint usage would be monitored by computers or by human beings. I assure her that audit records will be monitored both by computers and by human beings, each complementing the other. She asked whether shielding the records of children meant that the system was not secure, a point also raised by the noble Lord, Lord Jopling. We do not believe that the fact that some records will be shielded indicates that ContactPoint will be insecure. It is

The shielding mechanism is not unique to ContactPoint; it is already in place in a number of systems.</p>

<a name="70718-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="070718110000013"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, raised the issue of the views of young people about ContactPoint and whether we took them seriously. I assure her that we take their views very seriously, which is why we have taken considerable time and effort directly seeking the views of over 1,100 children and young people from a wide range of backgrounds. We have also looked at a wide body of research about the views of children and young people and taken on board the experience of local authority trailblazers, which developed local pilot systems and, as part of such development, consulted children, young people and families. I should stress that this consultation, as part of the development of the trailblazer pilots, generally showed that children understood the benefits of information-sharing and of ContactPoint. Understandably they wanted reassurance that the system would be secure and accurate. That is precisely why we are developing the system as we are&#151;to ensure those robust protections. We will continue to engage children and young people directly, particularly to inform the development of communications material. We are doing so in collaboration with the Information Commissioner&#146;s Office, the Office of the Children&#146;s Commissioner and the Children&#146;s Rights Director.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="070718110000014"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Armstrong, asked whether eliminating some delays&#151;he thought that they would be short delays&#151;when a child first exhibits a need for a service was not itself a justification for a universal database. The key issue, we believe, is that practitioners are not able to make good decisions in all cases about need when they do not have the full circumstances of the child available. It is not simply a question of the delay in making entries on a database, but the quality of the decisions that will be made by practitioners in the first place, whether or not they have this information available.</p>

<a name="70718-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="070718110000015"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, asked me a number of questions. Would children and families have the right to challenge information that is wrong or out of date on the database? Yes, they will. That right is enshrined in the Data Protection Act 1984. A child or their parent can ask to see their data and, if the data are incorrect, they must be corrected. She asked what safeguards were in place to prevent misinterpretation, such as children visiting GPs several times a year, but as I said, that kind of information will not be on the database. She also asked what processes would be followed to ensure that staff who left would have their access revoked&#151;the 330,000 are staff in service, with a right to see the information on the database. I can assure her that the accounts of users will be cancelled immediately the user&#146;s supervisor notifies ContactPoint. Staff debriefing will recover the access control token, so that the user will not be able to access the system thereafter.</p>

<a name="70718-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="070718110000016"></a>The first broader theme raised was adequate safeguards. I reaffirm the importance of security as a  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_334"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 334</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>priority in the development of ContactPoint. First, we will ensure that ContactPoint is built with robust and reliable software, which is configured to remove all known weaknesses. The system will then be tested before being put into use by licensed security testers approved by the Communication Electronics Security Group in Cheltenham, which is an arm of the Government. They will, in effect, try to hack into the system and will undertake software inspection. ContactPoint will not be put into live use until it has passed the security tests. The system will be actively monitored to detect attempted hacking or penetration, and any part of the system where such attacks are detected will be shut down.</p>

<a name="70718-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="070718110000017"></a>Secondly, all data are secured by encryption or scrambling while moving between computer systems, so that anyone trying to monitor communications will not be able to see the information. Thirdly, it will only be possible to access ContactPoint from computers that are either known directly to ContactPoint or connected to corporate or local networks approved by ContactPoint. The biggest risk for hacking is through the internet and from public access into computer systems; we are countering this by ensuring that any attempt to access ContactPoint from any system other than those known to be legitimate systems for access is rejected. Furthermore, we are taking active steps to ensure secure use. Systems that use passwords alone are vulnerable to misuse. ContactPoint users will therefore need to have an identifier, a password, a PIN and a physical token. We are restricting the user numbers, as I described in my opening speech. Finally, the ContactPoint system will monitor every user activity and record that securely in an audit log. The audit log will look for patterns of unusual or potentially suspicious behaviour, which will be reported to the user&#146;s manager.</p>

<a name="70718-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="070718110000018"></a>I also refer directly to the submission made to the Merits Committee by the Information Commissioner, in which he reported that he had had considerable involvement with my department during the development of ContactPoint. For noble Lords who have not been so closely engaged in discussions about the development of the scheme, I quote from what the Office of the Information Commissioner said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a><a name="070718110000093"></a>&#147;It is the case that we had reservations about certain aspects of early proposals for creating an index of Children ... However, we have enjoyed very constructive relations with those responsible for implementing ContactPoint. We are pleased that our suggestions concerning the privacy, transparency and security aspects of running ContactPoint have been taken on board ... we are satisfied with the overall design of ContactPoint ... We are pleased that the &#145;ContactPoint Guidance&#146;, which we have worked closely with DFES on, sets out a practical set of rules and procedures for those using ContactPoint. This guidance will provide a sound basis for developing the training that DFES will be carrying out, and which the Information Commissioner will participate in. It is also encouraging&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="070718110000087"></a>this takes up the point of the noble Earl&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="070718110000098"></a>&#147;that sanctions have been put in place to deter those having access to ContactPoint from abusing their access&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70718-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="070718110000019"></a>The Information Commissioner concludes:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a><a name="070718110000094"></a>&#147;We will, of course, continue to keep close contact with DFES, and with ContactPoint end-users ... We are prepared to devote the resource necessary to make sure that ContactPoint is

</ul>
<a name="70718-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="070718110000020"></a>On balance, our arguments in favour of the security of the scheme are justified. That is not to say that there is no risk whatever, in response to the noble Lord, Lord Jopling. No Minister could stand here and say that. However, we have taken all reasonable precautions against it. The Information Commissioner looked objectively at the safeguards we have put in place, and they are of the most robust kind. We must set aside the continuing risk that there may be on that front against the huge gain to be had from the database. The judgment of Parliament should lead us to want the gain that could be had from making the information on children available to practitioners to help those who may, at some point in their young life, be at risk.</p>

<a name="70718-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="070718110000021"></a>I dealt with most of the arguments about proportionality and cost in my opening remarks so, rather than rehearsing all those points again, I shall deal with some of the specific issues raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, to show that her concerns are substantially either unfounded or exaggerated. She queried the &#163;88 million annual saving, but a robust case for that saving is set out in the memorandum&#151;whose methodology she did not seek to undermine&#151;which my department submitted to the committee.</p>

<a name="70718-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="070718110000022"></a>The noble Baroness specifically asked, and this was a key point, whether the &#163;88 million and all the hours of practitioner time that would be saved would predominantly affect front-line practitioners. I assure her that it will. At the moment those practitioners&#146; time is often used or wasted in having to get in touch with other practitioners or in making duplicate referrals, which would not be necessary if the database was available and access could be gained much more quickly.</p>

<p><a name="st_109"></a>
<a name="070718110000023"></a><b><a name="70718-0013.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="070718110000361"></a>Baroness Walmsley:</b> My Lords, the &#163;88 million is only a gain if the figure of &#163;41 million is accurate, and the noble Earl has raised severe concerns that those are perhaps very optimistic figures for both the set-up and the annual running costs. You only have a gain if the figures for the running costs are correct.</p>

<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="070718110000024"></a><b><a name="70718-0013.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="070718110000362"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> My Lords, that is not the case. Even if the running cost figure is higher than &#163;41 million, that does not of itself undermine the &#163;88 million saving. Page 17 of the committee&#146;s report, which prints the relevant memorandum, identifies the practitioner groups whose time will be saved by the availability of the database. I shall read out the list: school nurses, health visitors, social workers, educational administrators, Connexions workers and youth offending teams. Those are front-line practitioners; we are not just dealing with back-office staff and functions.</p>

<a name="70718-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="070718110000025"></a>The alternative before the House is not no scheme at all but a partial scheme, a register for those at risk, which the noble Baroness supports. If it is not to be a national scheme, local schemes will need to be maintained for identifying those at risk. All our advice is that the cost of a partial scheme simply identifying those at risk would be higher than that of having a universal scheme. The cost in terms of time of having to make constant decisions about the addition and subtraction of names on the list would  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_336"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 336</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be great, and we would need to support systems and staff engaged in the filtering of data input case by case to decide what was appropriate in respect of individuals. That is not the case with the universal scheme. The result would be a substantial increase in the implementation cost, adding &#163;20 million to the existing &#163;240 million cost, and a significant increase in the per capita cost of ContactPoint.</p>

<a name="70718-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="070718110000026"></a>The point made about Victoria Climbi&#233; was quite telling. The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, quoted somebody who said that Victoria Climbi&#233; would not have been identified on the universal register, as she had been presented to some services as only being in England on a temporary basis. I am advised that she would have been on the register. It is important that we understand that, as a good deal of the concern that has motivated the development of this database was precisely that very harrowing case and what could happen in future if we did not safeguard against it. The aunt of Victoria Climbi&#233; was claiming child benefit and had registered Victoria with two GPs, so she would have been on the database if it had been available. In weighing up the costs, benefits and fine judgments that noble Lords have to make this evening, that is a factor to be considered.</p>

<a name="70718-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="070718110000027"></a>I conclude by quoting the memorandum submitted to the Merits Committee by Barnardo&#146;s, an organisation respected in all parts of the House. Its final conclusion was as follows:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a><a name="070718110000095"></a>&#147;Having ready access to the wider network of care around a child will mean that all practitioners are better informed about the range of services being provided, and any gaps that there might be, such that an early intervention can be effected if needed, rather than costly remediation once something has gone wrong. The system&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="070718110000088"></a>that is the system that we are proposing&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="070718110000099"></a>&#147;will support integrated delivery of services, help prevent duplication, and help practitioners in the wider ECM reforms&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70718-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="070718110000028"></a>Barnardo&#146;s concluding judgement on the scheme that we are putting before the House was:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a><a name="070718110000096"></a>&#147;This is a challenging project, but worthwhile in that it harnesses the technologies of the 21st century to the support of those who work with children in the interests of the children themselves&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="070718110000089"></a>That is the case that we put before the House this evening. I invite the House to approve the regulations.</p>

<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_340"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 340</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Administration will be more positive than previous Administrations on this subject. I am delighted at the number of noble Lords taking part and I regret that, due to this hour and other commitments, a number of those who put their names down have had to withdraw. It is a great pleasure to welcome to the debate the noble Baroness, Lady Vadera, the new Minister responsible for development matters, who will be making her maiden speech. She could not be better qualified to speak on the Commonwealth, because she was born in Uganda, educated partly in India and, after the age of 15, has lived and worked in this country as a British citizen.</p>

<a name="70718-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="070718110000048"></a>Within my 10 minutes, I wish to focus on the strategy that should be adopted for the Commonwealth. In the past 60 years, we have seen the most remarkable transformation from the British Empire to the Commonwealth of equal nations. Throughout this period, the Queen has provided a common link in her capacity as head of the Commonwealth. Coupled with this change has been a substantial migration of people within the Commonwealth, thus contributing to today&#146;s multi-cultural and multi-faith community in the United Kingdom. All this is essential history for any schoolchild to understand today&#146;s British society.</p>

<a name="70718-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="070718110000049"></a>What of today&#146;s Commonwealth? What is its composition? It is a total cross-representation of the world&#151;the world through a microscope&#151;with 53 nations making up a quarter of the government of the world, a third or 2 billion of the world&#146;s population and a fifth of the world&#146;s trade. The Commonwealth ranges from the smallest nations&#151;some 32 of them&#151;to the largest. It ranges from the poorest&#151;a third of its people live on less than a dollar a day&#151;to the wealthiest, and it has fast-emerging states, such as India, which is the fourth largest economy in the world today. It represents almost all faiths and cultures in the world. For example, there are 500 million Muslims living in the Commonwealth.</p>

<a name="70718-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="070718110000050"></a>The Commonwealth faces all the problems that the world as a whole faces: international terrorism; illicit migration; drugs and crime; climate change; multi-faith and multi-cultural issues; fragile democracies; poverty; and education and health issues. We share common aspirations and values, as well as the commitment that we have made at summit meetings to democracy, the rule of law, freedom of press and expression and the important role of civil society. We share a common language in English and we have many common institutions, legal systems and business practices.</p>

<a name="70718-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a><a name="070718110000051"></a>The Commonwealth is a vast network of contact&#151;of Governments, people, professional bodies and non-government organisations. There are over 80 professional bodies of the Commonwealth, ranging from the universities and architects to magistrates, nurses and the press. The Commonwealth work is supported by a range of other bodies: the Secretariat; the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation; the Commonwealth Youth Fund; the Commonwealth Foundation, of which I had the privilege of being chairman for five years and which focuses on the non-government of the work of the Commonwealth civil society, culture and so on;  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_341"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 341</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Commonwealth of Learning, which facilitates distance learning throughout the Commonwealth; and the Commonwealth Business Council, which deals with the private sector and economic development. I will also mention a new organisation, which I welcome: the Ramphal Centre for Commonwealth Policy Studies. All those and many other bodies are supplemented by other activities, not least the Commonwealth Games and the usual Government-to-Government contact.</p>

<a name="70718-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a><a name="070718110000052"></a>What is the Government&#146;s attitude to all that? Successive Governments in this country have paid lip service to the Commonwealth. We have tended to turn our backs on the Commonwealth. The result is a remarkable lack of interest and knowledge in the United Kingdom of the Commonwealth. We have concentrated, of course, on the European Union and NATO and relations with the United States.</p>

<a name="70718-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a><a name="070718110000053"></a>There still lingers in this country a measure of guilt complex about the past and sometimes we still see things in rather colonial and patronising ways. Equally, other Commonwealth countries are still inclined to blame the United Kingdom, as their former colonial power, as a diversion from their own problems. I need only cite Mr Mugabe to make the point. Now is the time to make a psychological adjustment in our attitude to the Commonwealth. To get rid of these outdated concepts and cobwebs of the past, we must, of course, know our past, but we must also recognise that a gem has now emerged that can bring great benefits to all its members, including the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="70718-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a><a name="070718110000054"></a>This is the age of multilateralism and here is a unique forum for confronting and helping us all to solve international problems and for the United Kingdom to benefit from membership. The Commonwealth complements other groupings, such as the United Nations, the European Union and NATO, as well as bilateral relations with other countries. It is not a substitute; it simply complements. As Sir Shridath Ramphal, the former Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, said once:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a><a name="070718110000097"></a>&#147;The Commonwealth cannot negotiate for the world, but it can help the world to negotiate&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70718-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a><a name="070718110000055"></a>It seems to me that policy has evolved over decades from the summit meetings in Singapore to the summit in Harare. The policy of the Commonwealth that has evolved reflects the view that democracy and good governance on the one hand and development on the other are interdependent&#151;the two must develop hand in hand to help to create more prosperous and coherent societies.</p>

<a name="70718-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a><a name="070718110000056"></a>Let us look for a moment at these two issues. First, on democracy, we have organisations now such as the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, which plays a vital role in monitoring persistent violation of democratic principles. It has looked at a number of countries, from Nigeria and Pakistan to Fiji.</p>

<a name="70718-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a><a name="070718110000057"></a>It would be remiss of me not to mention Zimbabwe. It was suspended in 2003 by Mugabe&#151;the decision was taken by him and not by the people of Zimbabwe. Others will no doubt speak about Zimbabwe in this debate but the test case here involves the credibility of the Commonwealth. The  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_342"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 342</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Commonwealth was active in trying to help to end apartheid in South Africa and return her to the Commonwealth, and the same must happen with Zimbabwe. The Royal Commonwealth Society, of which my noble friend Lady Prashar is chairman, has taken an admirable lead in discussing ways in which the Commonwealth can start to hold out hope for the people once Mugabe has gone.</p>

<a name="70718-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a><a name="070718110000058"></a>The Commonwealth needs to establish links with civil society. The Commonwealth Foundation is a very good organisation for taking the lead on that. We need to work with moderate nations in Africa, such as South Africa, Botswana, Ghana and Tanzania, to help the people of Zimbabwe to move towards a better solution. The Commonwealth Heads of Government need to stand ready with contingency plans to rehabilitate that failed state. There are many other ways in which democracy is supported in the Commonwealth, not least through the admirable work of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association.</p>

<a name="70718-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a><a name="070718110000059"></a>The other aspect in this regard is development. It is interesting to note that trade within the Commonwealth has increased from US$2 trillion to $3 trillion in the past 10 years. Economic development is crucial to stability in these countries and the Commonwealth is equipped to promote favourable trade terms, to help small and developing nations and to help work for the liberalisation of trade. The Commonwealth provides an ideal forum to develop integrated and realistic approaches to economic expansion and wealth creation in each of those countries. I hope that the Minister will feel able to say something about the role of the Department for International Development in this area and the priority that it gives to the Commonwealth.</p>

<a name="70718-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a><a name="070718110000060"></a>I conclude by saying that I would like Her Majesty&#146;s Government to commit the United Kingdom to adopting a positive, imaginative and vigorous approach to the Commonwealth in a non-paternalistic spirit and as an equal partner. To achieve that, the Prime Minister needs to show personal leadership on this issue and secure the commitment of Ministers, supported by a proper Whitehall machinery, to implementing the Commonwealth&#146;s multilateral policies. This would benefit the Commonwealth and serve Britain&#146;s own interests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_396"></a><a name="070718110000062"></a>I speak to you as a child of the British Commonwealth and as someone who has lived her adult life as a citizen of the Commonwealth. Many would say that that is not much of a difference, but appearances can be deceptive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_397"></a><a name="070718110000063"></a>The transition in the title highlights the ever-changing nature of the institution as history has buffeted its boundaries, structure and procedures. Its status as successor to the British Empire similarly reflects a long historical process as conquered territories sought to assert their independence from the metropolitan hub. It is no secret that countries that were initially the most successful in this process contained a large settler class drawn from the metropolitan country. It was only after the Second  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_343"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 343</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>World War that other imperial territories were able to seriously challenge the iron grip exerted from the centre on the conduct of their affairs. The relaxation of that grip was achieved after inhabitants of lands scattered throughout the globe struggled valiantly for the freedom to exert control over their destinies. Many did so after returning from battlefields where they had fought&#151;some had died&#151;to protect the freedoms enjoyed by the citizens of the metropolis.</p>

<a name="70718-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a><a name="070718110000064"></a>The past 50 years have witnessed the arrival of a variety of settler classes into this country from the countries once conquered by it. This apparent historical inversion masks the wholly different nature of the relationship enjoyed by the outgoing settlers with those among whom they settled from that which greeted incoming settlers with those in this country. The role of the latter was to repair, invariably at a menial or minor level, the infrastructure, to man the often shattered remains of the country's industrial base and to oil the wheels of what we now call our service industries.</p>

<a name="70718-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a><a name="070718110000065"></a>This they have done, and many look back in their retirement with pride at their achievement, against considerable odds, in assisting in Britain&#146;s revival of its status in the world. However many also look with alarm, as Britain seeks to realign itself with other groups of nations, such as the European Union, at the effects that these associations will have on the Commonwealth.</p>

<a name="70718-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a><a name="070718110000066"></a>I would like to draw noble Lords&#146; attention to that arc of islands which form the Caribbean membership of the Commonwealth, among which is the country of my birth, Grenada. As with so many Caribbean islands, many of its citizens are scattered among the populations of nations that dwarf them in both geographic and economic size. Those who are here, and their children, feel that their mother countries have become at best the home of hazy memories of golden beaches and eternal sunshine and at worst almost forgotten specks in a far distant ocean.</p>

<a name="70718-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a><a name="070718110000067"></a>People do not starve in the Caribbean. Coups are not a feature of our recent memories. As we do not have large mineral resources, we are not subject to the mass excavation of our soil for what lies underneath it. However, we do have some real problems that deserve far more attention than they attract.</p>

<a name="70718-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a><a name="070718110000068"></a>I realise that the clock has beaten me. I will end quickly by saying that I would like to enter a plea that Britain should not, in its rush to join new families of nations, forget its obligation to that family that ensured its economic pre-eminence for so long.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_403"></a><a name="070718110000070"></a>I too will talk about Zimbabwe and the Commonwealth, as the noble Lord, Lord Luce, has done. If noble Lords have doubts about the propriety of doing so in a Commonwealth debate, because  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_344"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 344</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Zimbabwe is no longer in it, they can be reassured. All that they have to do is look at section B of the 1995 Millbrook declaration, made in New Zealand, when it was head of the Commonwealth. That will reassure them of the propriety of not only talking about Zimbabwe but doing things&#151;but that is another question.</p>

<a name="70718-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a><a name="070718110000071"></a>When South Africa was outside the Commonwealth, the member countries treated it in the same way because the Commonwealth did a great deal to help South Africa to get rid of apartheid. Conditions in Zimbabwe are appalling, so bad that I do not want to get into a discussion about them now. I think that all noble Lords know how indescribably awful it is.</p>

<a name="70718-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a><a name="070718110000072"></a>After the savage attacks on a peaceful prayer meeting about three months ago, there was an urgent meeting of the SADC summit, which appointed President Mbeki to facilitate dialogue between the Government and the opposition in Zimbabwe. Almost all the SADC countries are members of the Commonwealth. Since that proposal for dialogue, about three and a bit months ago, no agenda has been fixed. Mugabe&#146;s representatives failed to turn up to the latest meeting called. That shows us how President Mbeki is treating that proposal. Therefore, the world should not expect any good news from that direction.</p>

<a name="70718-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a><a name="070718110000073"></a>What else could be done? I doubt whether linking the Zimbabwean dollar to the rand would be acceptable to South Africa. That has been suggested but it has not been discussed publicly. However, it is an idea that is floating about. The responsibility to protect is a subject that is being talked about more and more, largely in United Nations terms, but such action requires UN consent and tends to assume the use of troops, if only for peacekeeping; therefore, I doubt whether that is relevant to Zimbabwe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_407"></a><a name="070718110000074"></a>My proposal that the G8 should use its influence with Africa resulting from its partnership for aid and debt relief in return for good governance has received no response, so at the moment I do not see a future for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_408"></a><a name="070718110000075"></a>The Commonwealth Secretariat is said to be thinking hard about what should be done. I hope that that is so, but I have one important point for the secretariat. At present, Zimbabwe is not on the agenda for the CHOGM in November this year in Kampala. Obviously, I am not calling for Zimbabwe&#146;s presence under the current regime or anything like it, but I am sure that Zimbabwe is important enough to be discussed in Kampala.</p>

<p><a name="070718110000091"></a>The Statute of Westminster gave that some legal force, and it is in that spirit that the Commonwealth continues to exist. It is an extraordinary ideal to live up to, one that is not exactly easy when member states vary so much in economic power, resources and wealth. But the value of the Commonwealth is expressed not least in the equal dignity accorded to all members, whatever their size, wealth, culture or religion, and, in the time available, I want to refer to a single current threat to that.</p>

<a name="70718-0014.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a><a name="070718110000078"></a>I believe that the proposed economic partnership agreements will be discussed at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. They are in the process of being negotiated between Europe and African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, many of them members of the Commonwealth, and they should be completed by the end of the year. There is real anxiety in ACP countries&#151;inevitably, as the EU is, overall, both the biggest trading partner and the biggest aid giver to many of them&#151;therefore, it is hard for this negotiating process to be even-handed when the odds are stacked so much on one side. The Cotonou agreement, on which all this is based, said that no ACP country should be worse off as a result of the process, but many Commonwealth countries fear that they will be, as EU aid will be dangled as a carrot and waved as a stick if African countries, in particular, do not open up their markets to European companies in the area of service provision and government procurement.</p>

<a name="70718-0014.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a><a name="070718110000079"></a>The African Union has recently pleaded for transitional measures to safeguard the continued entry of African exports to the EU market beyond the end of the year. I believe that our Government&#146;s stated position is that ACP countries should have alternatives to these partnership agreements, and I want to know whether that is still the case.

<p><a name="stpa_412"></a><a name="070718110000080"></a>This is really an area where our commitment to the Commonwealth is a necessary counterbalance to any misuse of the economic power that we enjoy as part of the European Union. I know well that the teaching in the Sermon on the Mount is that the poor are blessed, but we do not increase their blessing by making them poorer. A high doctrine of the Commonwealth may prevent us doing just that in this case.</p>

<a name="70718-0014.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a><a name="070718110000083"></a>The Commonwealth has a particular contribution to make to development, because of its ease in sharing expertise through the secretariat and its myriad professional associations. This kind of partnership is all the more important now because development is changing. It has always needed more than aid, but now there is an urgent need for strategies to go wider, on climate change, on fair conditions for trade, on human rights and human security.</p>

<a name="70718-0014.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a><a name="070718110000084"></a>Aid is still the starting point for basic standards of health and education, so I would like to ask my noble friend first about the leading cause of death of children under five: pneumococcal disease. I declare an interest as vice-president of a new all-party parliamentary group to raise awareness of it. It kills nearly 1 million children, of whom 90 per cent are in developing countries. Those who do not die are often disabled.</p>

<a name="70718-0014.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a><a name="070718110000085"></a>There is a safe vaccine, but it needs to be developed. UNICEF&#151;of which I am a UK trustee&#151;and DfID are aware of the problem, and with the advance markets commitment system, an innovation which my noble friend has had a great deal to do with, DfID has undertaken to get results. Can she also arrange for this underknown dread disease to be given more prominence in DfID's public thinking on health? In the excellent document <I>Working Together for Better H</I><I>ealth</I>, the goal of reducing child mortality mentions only measles immunisation, which would do this by two-thirds. Successful pneumococcal disease vaccination would probably achieve the millennium development goal on child mortality by itself. How will this be considered in DfID's biennial review of its health strategy?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_417"></a><a name="070718110000086"></a>In education, the UK has worked within the Commonwealth to ensure that more children, especially girls, go to primary school. In Tanzania, where I was last summer, abolishing school fees increased enrolment from 4.4 million to 8 million, about half of whom were girls. Now there is more need to support local capacity for training teachers; and it is in the area of training and professional education that we can work with the Commonwealth to most advantage.</p>

The African Union&#146;s policy of peer scrutiny, because it is voluntary, has effectively inhibited any action, and we have chosen to respect this. There is, however, one potentially powerful and entirely legitimate source of support for Zimbabwe&#146;s civil society, and that is civil society in the Commonwealth. The SADC countries, Zimbabwe&#146;s neighbours, are members of that Commonwealth. Their economies are deeply vulnerable. We do not know the result of the economic report that they were mandated to make at the Tanzania conference in March.</p>

<a name="70718-0015.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a><a name="0707192000003"></a>We should be encouraging the lawyers, trade unionists, teachers, doctors and students within Zimbabwe by funding initiatives&#151;some of which are already contemplated&#151;to take them to Commonwealth countries for training. Those initiatives could be used to encourage Commonwealth leaders to move to the next, vital step of putting Zimbabwe on the agenda in Uganda in November. Nothing could send a clearer signal to the people of Zimbabwe, and to the world, that we believe that their country has a future. Our country and the US are generous givers to the many aid programmes inside Zimbabwe. Let us now give for the future of a country well able to restore its economy and its society by its own efforts, once it is free.</p>

As my noble friend Lord Blaker said, both the Harare declaration and the Millbrook agreement require us to do the same for Zimbabwe. Let us not forget that the Commonwealth countries united could do much to secure action in and by the UN, as they did at the time of the Falklands. I rejoice to hear that our Prime Minister has already sent one encouraging signal by telling the Portuguese Prime Minister that if President Mugabe is invited to the conference in November, he will not be there. Today, a country is being destroyed from within before our eyes. The Commonwealth must now set a bright light in the window for the people of Zimbabwe to see.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_422"></a><a name="0707192000007"></a>The main thing that I want to talk about in this debate is the need for the Commonwealth to pay attention to Pakistan, which was readmitted to the Commonwealth in 2004. That country is walking a tightrope between its own extremists and the demands of America and is still under military rule, which we reluctantly condone. Its close neighbour is Afghanistan and the warlords. I was condemned by my party and many others in 2001 when I said that we should be dropping food and aid on famine-stricken Afghanistan, not bombs. It seemed to me then and now that bombs would make a poor country even poorer and more dangerous, and that bombs would scatter Osama bin Laden and his merry men all over the world, but especially to the northern territories of Pakistan. Of course, that has happened. Pakistan is now in great danger.</p>

That should be the Commonwealth&#146;s greatest task in Pakistan and it should be NATO&#146;s greatest task in Afghanistan. Properly fed and educated people with hope for their children&#146;s future are less likely to become extremists. A Taliban-controlled Pakistan with nuclear weapons is the alternative, and is one of my nightmares. Urgent economic development must go hand in hand with the steps towards democracy that we want Pakistan to take. The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group should make support for that country its priority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_425"></a><a name="0707192000011"></a>Change in the leadership of the Commonwealth Secretariat, the forthcoming publication of the Sen commission report and the report on the new membership rules for the Commonwealth, and of course our new leadership in the UK under Prime Minister Gordon Brown, as well as the upcoming 60th anniversary in 2009 of the London declaration, all provide an excellent opportunity to consider the future role of the Commonwealth and that of the UK within it, particularly in the context of our own international priorities. This is an opportunity to make an unsentimental assessment of where the Commonwealth can make a difference. It is an opportunity to review the factors that may stand in the way of a better understanding of its benefits and potential, and its relevance to our internal, national concerns, because these overlap with our external concerns.</p>

<a name="70718-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a><a name="0707192000012"></a>There are several areas in which the Commonwealth can make a difference. The first is as a consensus builder. As my noble friend Lord Luce said, this was very well put by the former Secretary-General, Shridath Ramphal, when he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a><a name="0707192000031"></a>&#147;The Commonwealth cannot negotiate for the world, but it can help the world to negotiate&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0707192000029"></a>The Commonwealth&#146;s diversity is an advantage. It provides energy and dynamism not just in the international context but also nationally, because it provides a healthy framework for complex societies grappling to work with difference. Its core values and attitudes provide the ability to develop consensus through dialogue and ideas rather than a quest for power politics.</p>

<a name="70718-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a><a name="0707192000013"></a>The Commonwealth is unrivalled among international organisations because it can realistically aspire to be a Commonwealth of democracies. Time is running out. We have heard about the Commonwealth&#146;s economic advantage in the sense that it has within it the 13 fastest-growing economies along with the poorest 14. It can make a difference in these areas, as it can in development. I would like to suggest that we in the UK should take steps to make a realistic assessment of the potential and develop an agenda for meaningful engagement with the Commonwealth. To that end, I should like to know whether Her Majesty&#146;s Government would consider undertaking such an assessment through a process of wide consultation in preparation for the 60th anniversary in 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_429"></a><a name="0707192000016"></a>To generate the international understanding and global solidarity that is so essential to security, education at all levels is vital. That includes informal education. On this, there has been a recent, very exciting development. It emerged at the Commonwealth People&#146;s Forum in Malta in 2005, was taken up by the Commonwealth Education Ministers meeting in 2006 and is to be developed further at the next People&#146;s Forum in Kampala, where it is hoped that it will cover inter-faith work.

There are some very positive cases of how the Commonwealth has among its membership some of the most influential countries in the world, such as Canada, India, Australia and New Zealand. These countries have sustained economic growth and have established long-standing democratic processes. While it is true that these are the success stories, unfortunately the cases of countries not succeeding should and must remain a worry to the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="70718-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_431"></a><a name="0707192000019"></a>Can the Minister tell the House what plans the Government have to strengthen the voice of the Commonwealth? It is time that we considered aiding the poorest of our Commonwealth members by looking beyond monetary aid as the solution. It clearly is not working, as we are told that there are still over 660 million people in the Commonwealth who are living on less than a dollar a day. Life expectancy for the poorest of the world in the Commonwealth is in decline, and fewer than 35 per cent of children are receiving complete primary education. The millennium development goals are becoming distant dreams, as the targets for halving poverty and eliminating preventable infant deaths are unlikely to be met by 2015, as previously predicted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_432"></a><a name="0707192000020"></a>The obsession with setting and meeting targets is failing. The restructuring and empowerment of these failing countries must be in local development by local organisations, supported fully with structures, leadership and accountable systems.

<p><a name="stpa_434"></a><a name="0707192000022"></a>As mentioned, Zimbabwe presented a defining moment for the Commonwealth, as it was left grievously wounded and unable to deliver the principles on which it rests. In Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe has sunk his country and its people into atrocious inflation and desperation. The aid that we provide needs to be tracked. Development and accountability are key factors that should be linked with aid. Capital flight should be curbed, and powerful individuals in Africa should be prevented from transferring money into foreign bank accounts. Keeping money in Africa is crucial in assisting funding with local investment and development and health and education programmes. As it stands, preventing capital flight is a key part of achieving some of the millennium development goals on reducing poverty.</p>

They fear unfair competition from globalisation, displacing local producers and capping industrial development. They expect a loss of revenue from the removal of import taxes, inevitably leading to cuts in public services. Article 1 of the Cotonou agreement stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a><a name="0707192000032"></a>&#147;The partnership shall be centred on the objective of reducing and eventually eradicating poverty&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0707192000030"></a>It is an unequal partnership. The EU is not only the biggest trading partner but the biggest aid donor. That was recognised by DfID last time we debated this. As I recall, it was an uphill struggle for the UK to remind the Commission of its stated objectives. However, it may be that, since then, DfID has had to give way to other foreign policy considerations. I am therefore much looking forward to hearing in due course about the UK&#146;s latest position. Meanwhile, I welcome the Minister to the House and to the debate, for which I also thank my noble friend Lord Luce.</p>

These are serious charges, which show the degree of exasperation on both sides. These concerns have been voiced by ACP officials on numerous occasions; the Commonwealth Secretariat has provided legal advice in their favour. The African Union, in Accra on 29 June, urged the EC to consider putting in place transitional measures that would safeguard the continued entry of African exports beyond December 2007. Would the UK, therefore, in view of its previous support for the ACP, now support the latest appeal of the AU heads of state and put in place transitional measures? That would also be in line with the UK&#146;s own position in 2005, which was that the ACP should have alternatives available if requested.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_439"></a><a name="0707194000002"></a>In my last appearance before the Foreign Affairs Committee in another place, before I left the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, I was rightly taken to task for agreeing an annual report of the FCO that made no mention of the Commonwealth. I pleaded guilty with genuine contrition, because I share others&#146; views that the Commonwealth has a crucial role to play and that its role is frequently and usually underestimated.</p>

<a name="70718-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_440"></a><a name="0707194000003"></a>I want to make three short points, one political and two developmental. The political point echoes the point of the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, about the role of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, CMAG. I was very struck, upon attending the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Brisbane in 2002, by the number of Commonwealth countries, often small and isolated, which showed huge appreciation of the peer group pressure put on them for good governance by the Commonwealth Secretary-General and by CMAG. Britain is a member of CMAG, and I share the hope of the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, that the Government, both in the run-up to and after the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Uganda, will give real impetus to CMAG&#146;s work.</p>

<a name="70718-0015.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_441"></a><a name="0707194000004"></a>The first of my two development points is as follows. Last week I was in South Africa and Zambia, two Commonwealth countries in which the positive effects of good governance, effective economic management and economic growth are clear to see. I

In that context I should declare an interest as chairman of the trustees of Merlin, the NGO that provides essential medical help to many of the poorest people in the world, including in Commonwealth countries.</p>

<a name="70718-0015.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_442"></a><a name="0707194000005"></a>My third and last point is on Zimbabwe. The contrast between South Africa and Zambia, which I saw last week, and the situation in Zimbabwe could not be more striking. Others have spoken about the politics of Zimbabwe. I hope that DfID will, albeit discreetly, be making the necessary preparations to work with others, particularly Commonwealth neighbours of Zimbabwe and the Commonwealth Secretariat, to ensure that, when the Mugabe regime finally ends, that country can realise its economic potential and we can end the wholly unjustified and unnecessary misery of its people.</p>

I congratulate the noble Lord on his initiative, and thank him particularly for mentioning the sterling work of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, the UK branch of which I had the privilege to chair for four years.</p>

<a name="70718-0015.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_443"></a><a name="0707194000007"></a>Time permits only to mention some of the leftovers from the Valletta CHOGM two years ago and to ask what new initiatives Her Majesty&#146;s Government propose for that. The consensus is that Valletta was very positive on the political agenda and on good governance and democracy, as well as in trade and development, but questions still arise from it. First, we think of the Commonwealth as a wonderfully informal organisation, yet at Valletta we had the longest communiqu&#233; ever: 103 clauses. Who bothers to read those? Is it worth the effort? I hope we can bear that in mind.</p>

<a name="70718-0015.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_444"></a><a name="0707194000008"></a>Secondly, the Commonwealth is not just about governance but about peoples. The 85 Commonwealth civil society organisations have already been mentioned. What further proposals do the Government have at Kampala to engage civil society, remembering that civil society has been increasingly mainstreamed? One of the excellent initiatives at Valletta was the valuable meeting between the Foreign Ministers and the business and civil society forums.</p>

<a name="70718-0015.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_445"></a><a name="0707194000009"></a>Three matters were leftovers for the Secretary-General. One was paragraph 26 of the communiqu&#233;, asking the Secretary-General to explore initiatives to provide mutual understanding and respect among all faiths. We look forward to the Sen commission report on that. Another of those matters was paragraph 101, on future membership. CMAG has been something of a disappointment. Do the Government now see that there should be limits on new members? Lastly, with regard to paragraph 17 of the Valletta statement strengthening intra-Commonwealth dialogue and networking collaboration on trade and economic

<a name="70718-0015.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_446"></a><a name="0707194000010"></a>Brave promises were made about increasing the contributions to the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-Operation by 6 per cent per annum in real terms over the next five years. Has anything happened further to those promises?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_447"></a><a name="0707194000011"></a>One postscript: at Kampala, the Commonwealth will be saying goodbye to Don McKinnon, the Secretary-General. Someone at least should pay tribute to the sterling work he has done in his term.</p>

<p><a name="st_125"></a>
<a name="0707194000012"></a><b><a name="70718-0016.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0707194000033"></a>Lord Selsdon:</b> My Lords, while I was waiting rather impatiently for this great debate tonight I was having a pea and ham soup with Martha in the Bishop&#146;s Bar and we were saying that it is funny that the Ethiopian flag and the Jamaican flag are the same. I got out my book of flags and I had a look. I then said that it is strange that military power is becoming less and less important in the world, absolute wealth is becoming less and less important, and the most important thing is influence&#151;that strange, mystical, airy bit that no one knows how to put together. If you are too strong, you have enemies.</p>

<a name="70718-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_448"></a><a name="0707194000013"></a>So I thought we would look at the Commonwealth again. I have always been brought up on the Statute of Westminster, I have roamed the world around the Commonwealth and I said let us see what we have got now. We have 53 countries, which represent roughly 25 per cent of the world; add to that 20 dependent or overseas territories and the odd island here or there and we are pretty important. We have 2 billion people, which is a very significant 30 per cent of the world. We have roughly 12 million square miles of land, and if you add to that the territorial rights of 12 miles out to sea and airspace we are again pretty influential. And of course we have Her Majesty the Queen, probably one of our greatest assets, who is head of state in 19 countries.</p>

<a name="70718-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_449"></a><a name="0707194000014"></a>It does not stop there. We still control 90 per cent of the cricket in the world. While people may suggest that it was the Commonwealth that effectively brought South Africa to heel, I can tell you it was the Gleneagles agreement. I remember sitting with President Bush&#151;he was not president then&#151;in Jamaica, talking about boycotting Grenada, when suddenly Eddie Seaga turned to me and said, &#147;Is it true that Boycott is going to play cricket in South Africa?&#148; That was a momentous occasion.</p>

<a name="70718-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_450"></a><a name="0707194000015"></a>Now we are losing out on the rugby side. We have only 70 per cent of the rugby in the world, but what have the Americans got besides baseball and American football? Hardly any sporting influence. If you look further, you realise that it was effectively Cuban music that helped develop the Caribbean and you see that rap and other music has spread right across the world to create that form of culture.</p>

<a name="70718-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_451"></a><a name="0707194000016"></a>This adds up to the observation that the Commonwealth has greater value than any of us appreciate&#151;and probably more than it appreciates itself. It is a remarkable collection of people who have taken over from when the sun never set on the British Empire. They are probably playing rugby in some of the Pacific Islands even at this minute.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_452"></a><a name="0707194000017"></a>We could then look at some of the strange joint ventures, including the joint claims on Antarctica, and involving Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Australia, New Zealand and ourselves. It is how we put it together. I have always felt that the House of Lords should set out to represent the Commonwealth. No greater leader could we have than the noble Lord, Lord Luce, who was one of the best and most honourable Foreign Office Ministers that we have ever had. So I sit down saying: we have influence; let us use it.</p>

As a recently independent former colony such feelings were of course completely understandable. However, through the Commonwealth, India chose to remain connected with Britain along with many other former colonial countries. The British Empire&#151;the largest empire the world had ever known, larger than the ancient Persian, Greek or Roman empires&#151;was no more. Yet the vast majority of the countries of the empire that demanded their independence also chose to retain their links with Britain and with each other. That is amazing. It speaks so much to the strength of the common ideals, values and principles that the diverse members of the Commonwealth share: the English language, respect for democracy, human rights, institutions, legal systems, the rule of law, dedication to trade and solid business practices. These qualities, which have often been referred to as the Commonwealth factor, are a major advantage in our globally competitive world.</p>

<a name="70718-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_453"></a><a name="0707194000019"></a>As my noble friend Lord Luce mentioned in his superb speech, there is significant trade between Commonwealth members. However, this is happening in the absence of a major trade agreement like those behind the North American Free Trade Agreement, the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation and the Association of South-East Asian Nations. We could be doing so much more to encourage trade between member nations and the Commonwealth on top of, and supplementing, the existing regional trade blocs to which many members of the Commonwealth already belong, such as the EU, in Britain&#146;s case. Questions are being asked around the globe about the effectiveness in today&#146;s world of multilateral institutions such as the UN, the World Bank and the IMF. The WTO Doha development round is at a standstill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_454"></a><a name="0707194000020"></a>I welcome our new Minister, the noble Baroness, Lady Vadera. I say to her and to the Government: would it not be wonderful if a Commonwealth trading bloc, with a free trade agreement, existed? The more nations trade, the more stable and peaceful their relations with other countries. I believe that if an effective Commonwealth FTA trading bloc existed, it would attract prospective new members, such as the former British territories in the Middle East. Just look at the European Union. Who would have thought 60 years ago that France and Germany would be the best of friends today?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_455"></a><a name="0707194000021"></a>The Commonwealth already has such a great role in development, but it can do so much more to aid its members, particularly those with smaller economies.

I had the pleasure of working with her when we were both trustees of Oxfam. There I developed a great respect for her incisive intellect and the purposeful contribution she made, not only to Oxfam but, more importantly, in her years at the heart of the Treasury. She will surely make a significant contribution to this House and to DfID.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_457"></a><a name="0707194000024"></a>The Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, an independent international NGO, reported in its spring newsletter that President Museveni&#146;s Black Mamba Squad, which operates in secrecy at the behest of the president, raided the Uganda High Court in Kampala on 1 March this year. There they arrested five members of the opposition, who had just been released by the court on bail after being charged with treason and terrorism. In the process, they brutalised not only the suspects but their lawyers as well.</p>

<a name="70718-0016.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_458"></a><a name="0707194000025"></a>This is not an isolated incident and it seems increasingly clear that the Ugandan Government are using the police and military to crack down on political dissent and opposition. Bearing in mind the Commonwealth&#146;s aim to promote democracy, good government, human rights and economic development, it is ironic that its Heads of Government meeting in November is to be held in Uganda, where the opposite of all these objectives appears to be taking place. It will be interesting to see whether the abuses of human rights in Uganda are raised at this meeting or whether they will be papered over. It will be a sad day for the Commonwealth if President Museveni follows in the path of Robert Mugabe and the Commonwealth ignores this because of pressure from some African leaders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_460"></a><a name="0707197000006"></a>I declare an interest as chairman of the Council of Commonwealth Societies. One of that council&#146;s tasks is to be involved in the organisation of the Commonwealth Day Observance service in the abbey just across the road from here in March each year. That service illustrates something extremely important about the Commonwealth: that it has a unique ability to create an inter-faith dialogue. Although the service is within the abbey, it is not Anglican; it is an inter-faith dialogue. I hope that the Minister will tell us that the Sen commission report on respect and understanding will take us forward at CHOGM&#151;that it will not just be a report, but that there will be action subsequent to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_461"></a><a name="0707197000007"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, mentioned Nigeria, albeit briefly. The Commonwealth observer group report on the elections in Nigeria this year was gloomy reading. That report has gone to the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, but will CMAG do anything about it? These reports on failures of democracy in the Commonwealth seem somehow to vanish into the air. Something has to happen as a consequence of them. I would be grateful for anything that the Minister could tell us about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_462"></a><a name="0707197000008"></a>The right reverend Prelate made a point about trade issues at CHOGM. I know that the agenda is not yet fixed, but there is great concern among the Africa group in the WTO that trade should be high on the agenda and not trailing down below. Important issues such as the EU partnership agreements need to be discussed. Will the Minister reassure us that trade will be at the top of the agenda? If we do not discuss trade, all that will be left for us to discuss is aid.</p>

We wait to see what will happen, but the idea that the best interests of this country and Madagascar can be looked after part-time from 1,000 miles away in Mauritius is frankly nonsense. Will the Minister assure us that the closure in Madagascar is not the beginning of a long list of others?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_465"></a><a name="0707197000012"></a>Earlier this year, the Prime Minister identified the Commonwealth as one part of a new, three-pronged foreign policy, complementing our American alliance and our strong links with Europe. On these Benches, we have always supported such an approach, yet the latest Foreign and Commonwealth Office departmental annual report makes only one passing mention of the Commonwealth in more than 150 pages. Can the Minister explain that? The summit is a great opportunity for the Government to set out their proposals on how to support democracy and good governance throughout the Commonwealth. How are the Government helping Uganda to hold free and fair elections in December? What support are they giving the Ugandan Government in the peace talks in south Sudan and with the Lord&#146;s Resistance Army?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_469"></a><a name="0707197000017"></a>As noble Lords from all sides of the House have said, the Commonwealth brings together countries not because of what they want but because of what they are. The Commonwealth&#146;s unique and underestimated strength but also in part its limitation is the fact that it is not an exclusive club of the most powerful like the G8. Nor does it generate tension between developing and developed countries, as sometimes occurs in the IMF and World Bank. Nor, like the UN, does it have regional groups competing to advance their agendas. Its members speak for themselves with an equal voice, whether they are small island states or global players. I am intrigued by the suggestion from the noble Baroness, Lady Prashar, that we should have an unsentimental assessment of the Commonwealth, and I will investigate that.</p>

My life will have come full circle as I join the British delegation going to my birthplace, Uganda. I welcome the theme of the meetings, transforming Commonwealth societies for political, economic and social development. There are new challenges facing this development, not least climate change, which we have helped to secure on the CHOGM agenda in the run-up to Bali in December. But the old challenges remain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_471"></a><a name="0707197000019"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, rightly emphasises economic development and business formation. The Commonwealth Business Council creates very similar networks to those that she mentioned. I view aid not as charity or welfare, nor as the creation of permanent dependency, but as an investment in equitable growth and the individual&#146;s dignity of economic independence. With reference to the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, and the noble Lord, Lord Jay, in most poor countries aid is necessary, but in no country is it a sufficient catalyst for development. Wealth creation, economic growth and good governance must be central to poverty eradication.</p>

<a name="70718-0016.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_472"></a><a name="0707197000020"></a>The Commonwealth has extremes of experience to learn from in this regard. Over the last 20 years, India has saved 100 million people from poverty, and within the next 20 is expected to become the fourth largest economy in the world. But while its GDP is growing at 8 per cent, it is creating jobs at only 3 per cent a year. That inequitable growth has meant nearly one-half of all Indian children are undernourished&#151;a far higher level than in most of sub-Saharan Africa. Nevertheless, India&#146;s ability to benefit from an international services market shows the importance of trade for growth and reducing poverty. I can tell the noble Lord, Lord Watson, that trade will be right up there at CHOGM.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_473"></a><a name="0707197000021"></a>In response to the concerns expressed by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Norwich and the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, I can say that the UK has argued its position on the flexibility of economic partnership agreements consistently since 2005, and that has not changed for any other strategic reason. We believe that the Commission has accepted many of our arguments and is showing more flexibility in order to conclude negotiations by the end of the year, but we continue to monitor these negotiations closely.</p>

<a name="70718-0016.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_474"></a><a name="0707197000022"></a>I am delighted to see present my noble friend Lord Joffe, who introduced me last week. In response to his question and that of my noble friend Lord Judd, I should say that education is going to be a central agenda going forward, both at CHOGM and generally for development. Across the Commonwealth, 26 million children&#151;nearly two-thirds of them girls&#151;do not go to school. Education is the best investment that the world can make and, together with health, the best way to break the transmission of poverty from one generation to the next. For every year of schooling in the poorest countries, incomes grow by more than 10 per cent. For every extra year that a mother went to school, the chances of her children dying fall by 8 per cent. In large parts of the world, poverty has a woman&#146;s face; empowering women is both a means and an end for transforming societies.</p>

<a name="70718-0016.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_475"></a><a name="0707197000023"></a>The UK has committed &#163;8.5 billion over 10 years to get every child, especially girls, into school. Our commitment was ground-breaking, not just in its magnitude, but in its understanding of the need for patient capital to get a generation into productive economic activity. The 10-year results-based commitment gives the certainty of funding that countries need to plan and develop sustainable education systems with the ability to train, as well as continue to pay teachers and to make education free, and therefore universal.</p>

<a name="70718-0016.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_476"></a><a name="0707197000024"></a>With respect to health, I wish to assure my noble friend Lady Whitaker that pneumococcal disease will be addressed in the reviews of our health strategy. There is a significant market failure in research and development for diseases that affect poor countries due to their weak purchasing power. Only 10 per cent of global health research is devoted to conditions that account for 90 per cent of the world&#146;s disease burden. If successful, the advanced market commitment that we launched will result in a relevant strain of pneumococcal vaccine, which could save up to 5 million lives over the next 25 years.</p>

<a name="70718-0016.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_477"></a><a name="0707197000025"></a>It was disconcerting enough when the noble Baroness, Lady Park, used to question me as principal at Somerville College. I cannot begin to tell you how disconcerting it is to be questioned by her now, in your Lordships' House. I am grateful to the noble Baroness for her contribution to my education and her graciously selective memory of my undergraduate years.</p>

<a name="70718-0016.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_478"></a><a name="0707197000026"></a>The noble Baroness raised the subject of Zimbabwe, as did many other noble Lords. My family&#146;s experience of a ruthless dictator left me with no tolerance for those who abuse their citizens and destroy nations in the name of anti-colonialism. As will be discussed in another place tomorrow, we agree with noble Lords that Mugabe is not going to be a part of the solution for Zimbabwe&#146;s future. This Government will continue  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_361"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column 361</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to work with SADC and the Commonwealth to ensure that the people of Zimbabwe can exercise the right to determine that future. I agree with noble Lords that the Commonwealth has a duty of care to assist the people of Zimbabwe, as it assisted South Africans during apartheid. This Government stand prepared to assist in what tragically, but inevitably, will be an extremely fragile state, with its economic base and social fabric destroyed.</p>

<a name="70718-0016.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_479"></a><a name="0707197000027"></a>In the mean time, the people of Zimbabwe face a humanitarian crisis. A quarter of the population have fled to neighbouring countries and half those remaining need urgent food aid. More than 3,000 people die of HIV/AIDS every week. To help those immediately at risk, I am able to announce to the House today that DfID is committing &#163;50 million to extend the protracted relief programme for the next five years. The programme will be delivered entirely through local and international NGOs and will provide seeds, fertilisers, livestock and access to HIV/AIDS care to assist 2 million of the country&#146;s most vulnerable.</p>

I am conscious that many in this House share this view and have exercised much effort and expertise toward this end. I hope that in my position as Minister for International Development I can build on your Lordships&#146; strong platform. I was rather optimistically named Shriti, which means &#147;knowledge&#148; in Sanskrit.

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="070718113000345"></a> After Clause 17, insert the following new Clause&#151;</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="070718113000346"></a>&#147;Withdrawal of support: repeal</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="070718113000347"></a>Section 9 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 (c. 19) (failed asylum seekers: withdrawal of support) is repealed.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="70718-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000010"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment, like the two amendments we considered at the end of the third day&#146;s proceedings, concerns the despicable policy of trying to force asylum seekers to return to their countries of origin by making them destitute. It approaches the question simply and straightforwardly by repealing the infamous Clause 9 in accordance with existing statutory powers.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000011"></a>The director of the BIA case resolution directorate acknowledged in a witness statement to the High Court at the end of May that there were still 400,000 to 450,000 incomplete asylum cases on the books&#151;the same number that the Home Secretary gave in July 2006. She said that these were cases where an asylum claim had been made but the case record had not been concluded, due to errors in recording information or because there were outstanding actions that still needed to be taken. Some of the 400,000 files relate to persons who have left the country voluntarily or who were citizens of countries that subsequently became members of the European Union. However, a significant number in the backlog&#151;the National Audit Office&#146;s estimate was 283,000 between 1994 and 2004, an estimate which the Home Secretary has appeared to accept&#151;were applicants who had exhausted all their appeal rights yet remained in the UK. The case resolution directorate has the job of examining every one of the 400,000 files, deleting the duplicates, updating the remainder and giving top priority to removing those who prove to have criminal records. Your Lordships may be surprised to know that at the beginning of May this work still had to be undertaken, 10 months after it was acknowledged by the Home Secretary.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000012"></a>In the context of this amendment, it is the people who have not committed any offence who are of prime concern. These people are to be contacted and asked to provide current reasons for seeking to remain in the UK, and in the light of that information  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC56"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column GC56</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>consideration will be given to granting leave, if appropriate, or to effecting removal. The implication is that although no general amnesty is contemplated, some people will be eligible for discretionary leave, which applies when a person&#146;s ECHR rights would be breached or, in the case of a child, where inadequate arrangements exist for the child&#146;s care and protection in the country of origin. There were also some 30,000 cases of applications made before 31 December 1995 where special conditions were applied in accordance with the 1998 White Paper <I>Faster, Firmer and Fairer.</I></p>

<a name="70718-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000013"></a>We need a progress report from the Government on how the case resolution directorate is tackling this enormous backlog of files and, in particular, whether they have a better idea of how many they think will be left on the books when the sifting of the files and the removal of the criminals has been completed. It is this total, which includes the families, to which the infamous Section 9 could be applied and which the Government want to keep as a sword of Damocles hanging over their heads. We objected to it at the time. At Report stage of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Bill, in February 2006, we persuaded your Lordships that the Secretary of State should have power to repeal it by order. To summarise very briefly, we said that Section 9 breached the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child; that the pilots had already caused enormous distress and terrible destitution; that a number of families had vanished under threat of being separated from their children; and that it was an inhumane way to coerce vulnerable families.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000014"></a>There are countries to which families are not normally returned and this at the very least should be acknowledged by the law. If Section 9 is retained as a power of last resort, it ought not to be capable of being used against those families. The list would have to include: Zimbabwe, to which no one is being returned pending a decision of the courts; Somalia but not Somaliland; Iraq, with the exception of the Kurdish region; Afghanistan, the DRC and Darfur. It would be manifestly unreasonable to dump families in war zones and I hope that the Government will agree at least with that.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000015"></a>The Government have spent a lot of money in the courts upholding their right to return Zimbabweans to a country which they acknowledge is a ruthless and brutal dictatorship which&#151;according to the UN&#151;in Operation Murambatsvina made 700,000 people homeless and affected another 2.4 million people countrywide. It seems to me that, with the endgame rapidly approaching for Mugabe's rule, we should grant all irregular Zimbabwean migrants now living here one year's leave to remain with permission to work. That would send a signal to Africa that we consider Zimbabwe to be a uniquely dreadful place for anyone to live whether they are directly persecuted by the ZANU-PF dictatorship or deprived of all means of living a normal life by the catastrophic mismanagement of the country. One-third of the population has fled into neighbouring countries. Last week, the noble Baroness, Lady Royall of Blaisdon, said that a further 2 million people were expected to flee in the not-too-distant future. It is unthinkable that, as long as Mugabe lasts, anyone, let alone  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC57"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column GC57</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>families, should be forced back to the hopelessness and starvation that he has created. On the contrary, they should be allowed to work here, contributing to the economy and developing the skills that Zimbabwe will need when it is liberated.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000016"></a>When the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton of Upholland, accepted our amendment allowing the repeal of Section 9, she said that the pilots were being evaluated together with the exploration of other options that could encourage failed asylum seekers to leave the UK. Assisted voluntary returns are already having some effect and the better management of asylum applications is expected to deliver faster outcomes, resulting in improved chances of a speedy removal. After a delay of nearly 18 months, during which the Home Office sat on the results, the BIA&#146;s report on the pilots was finally published in June 2007, with an update to that month. It confirmed that,</p>
<ul><a name="070718113000386"></a>&#147;a significant number of the families may have absconded ... because of concerns about the section 9 process&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="070718113000326"></a>at least 32 according to the Refugee Council and Refugee Action in their joint report, <I>Inhumane and Ineffective</I>.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000017"></a>Local authorities said that they had difficulties reconciling conflicting principles of child welfare in Section 9. That point was reinforced in a letter I received from the chairman of the LGA Asylum and Refugee Task Group, dated 2 July, in which he said the following:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="070718113000348"></a>&#147;We have consistently highlighted this apparent contradiction between the implementation of immigration legislation and the accepted principles of childcare legislation. This is particularly evident in Section 9 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment Of Claimants etc) Act 2004. The Task Group recognises the need to remove failed asylum seekers and their families but is keen to ensure that the removal process is an effective and human one but ... there were a number of issues that the implementation of Section 9 created that proved extremely difficult for local authorities in pilot areas to overcome&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70718-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000018"></a>The report on the pilots finds that Section 9,</p>
<ul><a name="070718113000387"></a>&#147;did not significantly influence behaviour in favour of cooperating with removal&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="070718113000327"></a>but it fails to point out that only one family&#151;I stress only one&#151;out of 116 in the cohort to which Section 9 was applied, was actually removed by the end of the study, with nine families leaving voluntarily under the scheme run by the IOM. In the control group, of the same number of families, nine were removed and two left voluntarily. After two years&#146; work which, according to the chairman of the LGA task group,</p>
<ul><a name="070718113000388"></a>&#147;placed significant demands upon local authority resources&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="070718113000328"></a>one more family out of the control group left the country than in the cohort. Yet instead of admitting that the exercise was a dismal failure, both inhuman and ineffective, the BIA wants to keep Section 9 on the books for use against targeted families who are not co-operating in their removal. How it imagines that it is going to coerce individual families to co-operate when it has been able compulsorily to remove only one family out of 116 over a period of two years passes my comprehension.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000019"></a>The JCHR has added its voice to the long list of voluntary agencies that have called for Section 9 to be  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC58"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column GC58</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>repealed. In the reply to their report published last Thursday, the Government said that they were still conducting the Section 9 review. Can the Minister explain how that has happened? The Government said that it would be premature to repeal Section 9 before the completion of the review, implying&#151;as they have all along&#151;that if the review showed that coercion was a total failure they would strike it out. Never in the dozens of debates and questions in both Houses has it been suggested that, even if the pilots were a disaster, social and financial coercion might be kept for use against particularly recalcitrant families. I can hardly think of a more hateful and controversial idea, and one which reinforces my view that noble Lords should not have agreed to take this Bill in Grand Committee. If we cannot get rid of Section 9 altogether now with the consent of the Minister, we will certainly have to put it to the House on Report.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000020"></a>On support for asylum seekers generally, we are particularly concerned about the burdens which have been arbitrarily laid on particular local authorities. In their carefully argued response to the consultation paper on UASC, the LGA, its Scottish and Welsh counterparts and the directors of social services, through the UASC reform steering group, warn that the present crude grants regime needs to be reformed to take account of the changes in care needs at the age of 16, for instance. Clearly local authorities are not going to volunteer to become specialist authorities as envisaged in the consultation document unless they are assured of full cost recovery and that asylum support will be funded separately from the general grant settlement. There is also a particular issue with the funding arrangements to cover the provision of services to UASC post-18, where the spend for 2006-07 is estimated to have been &#163;50 million while the government grant was only &#163;12.3 million. It would be sensible for the Government to err on the side of generosity, making the grant offer to ensure that candidate specialist authorities can enter into detailed discussions with the Government without fearing that council tax payers in their area will be required to subsidise the scheme or cut existing services to pay for it. If they pay slightly more than the cost, this may well assist the local authorities when selling the idea to their residents. I beg to move. </p>

I suggest that it is time that the Government weighed this up in the most serious way possible. Under the previous Prime Minister we saw policies seemingly driven by tabloid pressure&#151;if the Murdoch press said this or Fox News said that, then the Government seemed to go that way. With a new Prime Minister we may get a more open approach on these matters.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000022"></a>Let us dispel some of these media myths. People who come here&#151;asylum seekers or not&#151;often suffer extreme poverty. The Penrose report of 2002 said that 85 per cent of asylum seekers regularly experience hunger, 95 per cent are unable to buy clothes or shoes and 80 per cent are unable to maintain their health. It estimated that 2,100 refugee children are out of school in London alone. These people are already in a desperate situation. Some will say, &#147;People come here

I spoke to a former commissioner who was well versed in European Union politics. He told me that, in his time, 363,000 people came from eastern Europe to the UK and only 16 claimed benefits. That destroys for ever the myth that people come here just to take unfair advantage of our system. If that impression is put forward by the media, some people will always go with it.</p>

<p><a name="070718113000023"></a>The Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 applies to people already in a desperate situation. The Minister at the time, Beverley Hughes, in evidence to the House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="070718113000349"></a>&#147;The proposals are not intended to make all families destitute&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="070718113000329"></a>I do not know whether there was a reason to say, &#147;all families destitute&#148;. Perhaps it was just a slip of the tongue. She continued:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="070718113000350"></a>&#147;They are intended both as a deterrent but also an incentive ... I want to ... persuade as many families as possible ... to go back in a dignified way, with support, on a voluntary basis&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="070718113000330"></a>Possibly, that was the intention.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000024"></a>The category of &#147;failed asylum seeker with family&#148; came into being and immediately those people lost entitlement to financial or material support. This was in contravention of the Children Act 1989, the Human Rights Act 1998, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child 1991, the European Convention on Human Rights 1991 and the 1954 United Nations convention on the rights of refugees. The Joint Committee on Human Rights also was deeply concerned. There was total contravention of all these Acts and conventions to which we have signed up.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000025"></a>I thought that there was a wee bit of light on 25 June 2007 when the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland of Asthal, speaking on Section 9, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="070718113000351"></a>&#147;In the form piloted, Section 9 did not significantly influence behaviour in favour of co-operating with removal, although there was some increase in the number of applications made for travel documents. This suggests that the Section 9 provision should not be seen as a universal tool to encourage departure in every case; therefore, we do not propose that it should be used on an indiscriminate basis by Border and Immigration Agency case-owners in the future&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 25/6/07; col.  <I>WS 50</I>.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="070718113000026"></a>That is an admission of failure. There is a desire to keep Section 9 on the statute book just in case there is a family somewhere who can be sent from these shores in any other way. As my noble friend Lord Avebury mentioned, there was only one case in which the provision was effective. There are three trial areas&#151;West Yorkshire, Manchester and parts of east London&#151;but there has been only one such case. Surely with such a record of failure, this provision is not only irrelevant but clutters up our legislation. It should be wiped out of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act once and for all.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000027"></a>Let us put ourselves in the shoes of these asylum seekers&#151;and that includes little children. I have a grandson who is two years old today. These children are just like our children. They need to be loved, cared for and supported. They need to be given hope and

Yet we are depriving them of that. It is a blot in the copybook of our nation. We are supposed to have a record of compassion and care. That is an aberration and it destroys our image. We are ready to cause terror and harm to totally innocent people. At the time of the invasion of Iraq, some of us wore t-shirts saying, &#147;Not in my name&#148;. To think that my name, and our name, is associated with causing harm to little children&#151;it is our name, your name and my name! It is in the name of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. I have mentioned before that we gave wholehearted support to Make Poverty History. This is one thing that we can do today to make one aspect of poverty history in our country. I urge the Government, by the time this amendment is debated at a later stage, to say that they can see that this position is a blot which should be removed.</p>

There is very little that I can add, given the eloquent and passionate presentation of the amendment, but I feel so strongly about it that I have to speak. I was present when the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, and many others, sought to persuade the Government on a previous Bill of the ill-advisedness of this measure. I thought that they had been successful, and I am deeply disappointed to see the measure being brought back again. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, pointed out the failure of the pilot of Section 9 of the Act and how that demonstrated how harmful the provision can be.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000029"></a>The Border and Immigration Agency&#146;s intention to do more to ensure that families are made fully aware early, and throughout the process, that they will be unable to integrate and that steps will be taken to deport them if their asylum application is rejected, and the BIA&#146;s strengthening of financial incentives&#151;referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury&#151;in voluntary return packages, are welcome and well-advised measures. Families that fail in their application already experience the sanction of reduced benefit and denial of access to work. Pushing further than that only increases the risks of families vanishing, as they have done, or children possibly being taken into care. I am glad that Her Majesty&#146;s Government have sought to increase the support for immigration officers, and I look forward to further information in due course from the Minister on how far that has progressed and on plans for future development. I welcome that.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000030"></a>The power to make a family destitute is a remarkable one to vest in any individual&#146;s hands. I wish that the people making those decisions were superhuman; but I fear that they may be as fallible as any one of us. I recall that 20 per cent of initial decisions on cases are rejected on appeal. Those people make mistakes. I urge the Minister&#151;</p>

I urge noble colleagues to apply some precision to the debate.</p>

The point that I was trying to make is that we are depending on the judgment of the case managers. Is that not correct?</p>

At the initial stage, a decision is made on whether to accept an asylum application. When those go forward to appeal, in 20 per cent of cases the people judging the appeal decide that the judgment of the case manager was wrong and that the person should not be removed. I understand that that is to be the position. I welcome the fact that the Government are seeking to support them better and are improving their recruitment in this area, but they are human beings, just as you and I are, and are deciding whether families should be made destitute. I therefore urge the Minister and the children&#146;s champion at the Border and Immigration Agency to think again and to withhold this power for immigration officers. I strongly support the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="070718113000035"></a><b><a name="70718-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="070718113000418"></a>Lord Hylton:</b> Will the Minister say whether I am correct that Section 9 was applied only in three areas to a small sample of 116 families, or do case managers across the country even now have discretion to apply it to individual families? I await his reply with interest. Moreover, the size of the asylum backlog is nothing less than a national scandal. The fact that some people&#146;s cases have been undecided for perhaps 10 or even more years must surely deny them their right to proper consideration under the UN convention on refugees.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000036"></a>It is good news that some of the families caught in the backlog may be eligible for some form of discretionary leave to remain. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said that 30,000 cases go back to before December 1995. What is key for these people is the right to work here. I hope that that will be made possible for the greatest possible number of people, particularly for the non-returnable families who will have to stay here in some shape or form for an unknown period or indefinitely. Will the Minister confirm that benefits cannot by themselves be a magnet to attract people from other countries to the United Kingdom? It must by now be very widely known that the full rate of benefit is not paid; they are at a discount to British citizens.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000037"></a>In conclusion, I initiated a debate on destitution in your Lordships&#146; House on 14 December last year. I am sorry to say that the replies given then and subsequently have not been very satisfactory. Nor has it been possible to arrange a meeting between the

<p><a name="070718113000038"></a><b><a name="70718-gc0001.htm_spmin4"></a><a name="070718113000419"></a>The Earl of Sandwich:</b> I spoke in favour of the amendment in a sense when I spoke to the last group of amendments on a previous occasion. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, knows that I support it, and the Joint Committee on Human Rights made it one of its very strong arguments. I have two points to make. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, made a connection with international development. I would so like the Home Office and the Department for International Development to have some common cause in future. The noble Lord&#146;s point is such a good one. This really is about joined-up government. I refer particularly to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees&#146; resettlement quota, which the Minister may remember I mentioned before. We are very behind other countries, and this is another very good example of development going hand in hand with asylum.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000039"></a>I have only one other point&#151;to pick up a point that the Minister made toward the end of the last group of amendments. He made quite a lot of the advantages of Section 4 hard-case support. My figures, based on the statistics from the last quarter of 2006, show that 6,555 cases received Section 4 support, which is only 2 per cent of refused asylum seekers in the UK. So it is no great panacea to refer to that section. As we all know, most of the so-called refused asylum seekers&#151;I really object to that term coming from a Government&#151;will be supported by friends and members of their own community as well as mainstream charities.</p>

<p><a name="070718113000040"></a><b><a name="70718-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="070718113000420"></a>Lord Dholakia:</b> I support my noble friend Lord Avebury&#146;s brilliant analysis of the situation on Section 9. This is not the first time that he has spoken to the issue; we have taken up these issues in previous legislation. I start with the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which, as early as March 2007, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="070718113000352"></a>&#147;We believe that using both threats and the actuality of destitution and family separation is incompatible with the principles of common humanity and with international human rights law and has no place in a humane society. We recommend that section 9 be repealed at the earliest opportunity&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70718-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000041"></a>That is precisely what my noble friend is saying. When the matter comes up on Report, he can bet that we will divide the House on the issue.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70718-gc0002.htm"/>


<a name="70718-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000042"></a>I was taken aback by the Minister&#146;s challenge to the case made out by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, who I think was right in his analysis and conclusion. If there is one noble Lord to whom I listen carefully on children&#146;s issues, it is the noble Earl. I was delighted by the way in which he presented his case. The issue boils down to a simple fact. We go round the world producing reports on Africa and the third world and saying that we want to eliminate poverty and the factors leading to destitution, but here we are using destitution as a punishment. That is unacceptable and cannot be a value held by a civilised country, and that is what the amendment is saying.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC63"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column GC63</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="70718-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000043"></a>The evaluation of the pilot scheme, so ably explained by my noble friend Lord Avebury, confirms our suspicion about what is going on. The scheme is ineffective and the Government have ruled out its full-scale implementation. But they do not stop there. We waited some time for the scheme. Now that it has been demonstrated that it does not work, they say that it will be left to the case worker to decide whether an individual is trying to avoid deportation and benefits should be withdrawn. One thing is clear: it is one thing to support destitution, although that should not be one of our values; but it is unacceptable to use it as a punishment. Deciding the matter on a case-by-case basis will result in many children falling within this network.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000044"></a>Asylum seekers include not only men and women but the many children who accompany them. By trying to punish the parents we will be punishing the children. Has the Minister consulted the Children&#146;s Commissioner on the implications of the Government&#146;s proposals? Is the Children&#146;s Commissioner happy that we should punish children through the way the Government intend to use this legislation? It is very clear that the Government&#146;s proposals are incompatible with the Children Act 1989. There is no getting away from that. The Children Act is very clear about the duty to promote the welfare of children. I very much hope that the Government will indicate whether consultation took place with the commissioner.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000045"></a>Further, the people who are to implement this policy objected to it. Social workers have objected to it, as have directors of social services, who ultimately have to bear the brunt of it. There is a very clear inherent conflict between Section 9 and children&#146;s legislation.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000046"></a>I am grateful to the Refugee Children&#146;s Consortium, which produced an excellent brief on this matter. If the Minister does not have it, I shall be delighted to send him a copy. I refer to one or two issues in that briefing. It makes an excellent suggestion as regards an alternative approach that the Government could take. It supports the development of an alternative approach to the return of families who have exhausted all appeal rights. It contends that putting in resources at the outset to engage families would result in more dignified and sustainable returns and that, through this, the Home Office&#146;s aim of reducing long-term costs to the taxpayers would be met. That is a sensible suggestion. It further states that the new asylum model&#146;s case ownership framework provides an opportunity to engage families and keep them informed throughout the process, leading to more effective and dignified returns models&#151;models such as the work of the Hotham Mission asylum seekers project in Melbourne Australia. The briefing also refers to other interesting projects.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000047"></a>The Joseph Rowntree Trust recently held an inquiry which reached the clear conclusion that the pilot has caused widespread fear among the children of families who have been removed. This is likely to encourage families to distance themselves further from the Home Office and refugee agencies, and

<p><a name="070718113000048"></a>The RCC comprises people who are working hard with these children. It concludes that Section 9 has resulted in families being made destitute&#151;as we know&#151;that it places children&#146;s welfare, health and development at risk; that it has the potential to separate children from their parents and family; and that it has resulted in uncertainty and confusion and will eventually inevitably lead to costly and time-consuming litigation paid for out of public funds.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000049"></a>I sum up with the conclusion of the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. It stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="070718113000353"></a>&#147;We believe that using both threats and the actuality of destitution and family separation is incompatible with the principles of common humanity and with international human rights law and has no place in a humane society. We recommend that section 9 be repealed at the earliest opportunity&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="070718113000331"></a>We shall do everything in our power to make sure that that happens.</p>

We went through much of this debate in Committee last week. The arguments that were made then and those made today have varied very little. That is not to say that the sincerity, passion and genuineness of the arguments put by noble Lords on the Liberal Democrat and Cross Benches are not as well meant as they always are because they are always coming from the right place. We simply take a different approach on some of these matters&#151;although not as regards our humanity&#151;and to how hard cases that occur from time to time in the asylum process should be dealt with.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000051"></a>Many arguments have been poured on us this afternoon as to why we should repeal Section 9, and I have heard most of them before. However, my mind has not shifted on this issue. I entirely understand the comments about the pilot and its success or otherwise. I confirm that it was conducted only in Leeds, London and Manchester, and that the numbers to which the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, referred are accurate. Obviously we have learnt a great deal from it.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000052"></a>Noble Lords seek to extend their arguments about the pilot trialling of Section 9 across the whole range of decisions on judgments on asylum seekers and the process at large. I shall not deal with those arguments because they are broader and do not have too much bearing on the amendment, and it would not serve the Committee well if I simply repeated them. However, I assure the Committee that we will not use Section 9 lightly or indiscriminately. We do not think that it would be suitable for blanket use, but it is important that we retain an ability to withdraw support from families who are wilfully not co-operating in the process of return. We should remember this simple fact: the point at which we might apply Section 9 is the very point at which the persons who are affected by it have exhausted pretty much every avenue open to them to advance their case to stay in the United Kingdom. We are talking about hard cases at the end  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC65"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column GC65</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the process. We may criticise that process, but it is rigorous and has been very well worked out.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000053"></a>As I said, we are talking only about the hard cases where there is wilful non-co-operation. A judgment must be made by those who manage those cases. I also assure noble Lords that further guidance will be provided to case owners before Section 9 is used in any new case. It is also worth reminding your Lordships that Section 44 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act, as argued before in 2006, provides for the repeal of parts of Section 9 by order. If a future Government wish to exercise that option, they will be able to do so without recourse to further primary legislation. It is an important part of the process&#151;a tool in the armoury, if you wish, although that analogy might not be the most attractive to all those involved in the debate. However, there may well be cases&#151;I cannot say how many, although I do not think that it will be used in a blanket fashion&#151;in which we must apply that section.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000054"></a>Noble Lords made other points that were more relevant to the amendment, and I will try to respond to some of them. The noble Lords, Lord Avebury and Lord Roberts, talked about returning people to Zimbabwe. We are closely monitoring the position in Zimbabwe, and a key case is going through a tribunal. I assure noble Lords that there are currently absolutely no forced removals. Asylum support generally is available from the beginning to the end of the process for those who would otherwise be destitute.</p>

<p><a name="070718113000055"></a><b><a name="70718-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="070718113000422"></a>Lord Roberts of Llandudno:</b> How will a family which is to be deported because it has failed in every way to stay in this country be treated if its destination is Zimbabwe or any other country where life is impossible for it?</p>

We would have to consider each case on its merits, and there would have to be detailed consideration. It would depend on whether the family wanted to return voluntarily or was seeking to stay here for a long period. It would require case-by-case consideration and depend very much on the personal circumstances of the family. If the noble Lord&#146;s point is that we would seek to use Section 9, it is extremely unlikely that we would use that section because we would be going against the other part of our policy, which is that currently there are no enforced removals to Zimbabwe.</p>

Zimbabwe is an illustration of it, but there are other countries to which we do not return people at the moment. We do not return anyone to Baghdad, although we send them back to Erbil in northern Iraq; and we do not return anyone to Somalia, but we return them to Somaliland. In all those cases, where there is a de facto policy of not returning people to their country of origin, will the noble Lord give a guarantee that Section 9 will not be applied to families from that group? Will the instructions that have been given to immigration officers cover that matter?</p>

I return to my earlier point that I do not think that would be right, and I think the Committee would be badly advised by me if I were to make that kind of commitment. It depends on the nature of the case; it depends on the individual circumstances; and it depends on whether there is a desire in the household to leave voluntarily. All of those matters may have an application. So I shall not make that absolute commitment, and I do not think that it would be right or proper to do so.</p>

Yes, of course, the issues raised in the debate by noble Lords from the Liberal Democrat Benches and others are exactly those kinds of issues&#151;we are dealing with hard cases at the extreme end&#151;that will need to be considered by case workers.

Will he have to have a discussion with social services? Will he have to have a discussion with medical services? Will he have to have a word with his supervisor before he takes the decision? I imagine that will, as a matter of course, be in the guidance, but I look forward to hearing that.</p>

There will obviously be discussions with senior case workers or supervisors. There will have to be some discussions with those involved in the welfare of children, because that is proper and right. I have made the point before that many years ago I was involved in social work. I would have expected that sort of good practice to apply, and we want to ensure that good practice applies in all these cases.</p>

We have tried to help him. My noble friend Lord Dholakia made the excellent suggestion that we should know what is in the code of guidance, because at least it would limit the damage caused by the Government&#146;s decision to apply Section 9 on a discretionary basis to individual cases. It is repugnant to me that a social worker should be put in the position of having to do that. Whatever the circumstances are, he is going to have virtually a power of life and death over a particular family, which may have been recalcitrant or may have been obstinate in resisting attempts by the Government to persuade it to go back voluntarily. They have always got the power of compulsory removal; nothing was said about that. Why should we exercise the power of making someone destitute when there are plenty of provisions in the statute book, throughout the immigration Acts, for removing people compulsorily?</p>

<p><a name="070718113000068"></a>The Minister did not respond to the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, who said that only 6,500 so-called failed asylum seekers received emergency support, and that was 2 per cent of the total. Already, 98 per cent of people are being cut off at the end of the process, and anyone who has met these people will know how difficult it is for them. I was talking on Sunday to a failed asylum seeker who is a citizen of Nepal. He is going to depart voluntarily, and the Home Office knows that perfectly well. He has been in negotiation with the International Organisation for Migration with a view to helping him depart for Hong Kong, where he has a job offer. It is a matter of sorting out, first, the renewal of his Nepalese passport, which has expired since he has been here and, secondly, getting the visa on the passport, which has been promised him by the Hong Kong authorities. In the meanwhile, even though he has a wife and

<a name="70718-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000069"></a>Are we going to say that every failed asylum seeker, as he is, is to be put in the position of depending on cousins or, even worse, of sleeping on the streets, such as in the case of Janipher Maseko, which I quoted earlier? The noble Lord may raise his eyebrows and look aggrieved, but the fact is that there are thousands of these people already.</p>

In the case that the noble Lord is drawing out for the attention of the Committee, it may well be that the individual could have applied for Section 4 support. I do not know, because I do not know precisely his circumstances. Section 9, on which we have had a tremendously long discussion, is really only there for very hard cases; for very few cases indeed.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000071"></a>Noble Lords are trying to create a picture of us applying this provision to thousands of people across the board. The provision itself would in future only be applied to cases already managed under the new asylum process. It is not there to be applied to the 450,000 cases that have been referenced at an earlier stage of this debate. Noble Lords should try to understand exactly how we intend to use these powers under the circumstances. Otherwise, one could develop a nightmare vision of how our system works that is quite a long way removed from the reality.</p>

But I make the point that there will be hard cases&#151;very few over time&#151;where we will need to apply this provision.

I again challenge the Minister to produce one example of a case where it is impossible to use the normal procedures for removal of a family to their country of origin where this provision would be necessitated. Otherwise, as my noble friend Lord Dholakia said earlier, we know that we are not going to get anywhere in Committee this afternoon, but we are determined to strike this provision out of the statue book on Report.

<p><a name="070718113000083"></a>The noble Lord said: Clause 19 deals with exceptions to the rule that new evidence may not be submitted to the AIT relating to in-country appeals under the points-based system. The general rule under Section 85 of the NIA Act 2002 has been that at the hearing of an appeal, the AIT can only consider the circumstances as they were at the time of the decision to refuse, although there is nothing to stop the person from making a fresh application later on.</p>

<p><a name="070718113000084"></a>The Home Office told ILPA that this has caused difficulty where evidence has been submitted close to, or even in some cases on, the day of the appeal, making it difficult or impossible for officials to consider in time what evidence has been supplied and to respond to it properly. This argument would be reasonable were it not for the fact that the AIT has  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC70"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column GC70</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the power in Rule 45(4) of the 2005 procedure rules to give directions on when evidence must be submitted and to exclude evidence where directions have not been followed, admitting that evidence may unduly prejudice a party, including the Home Office. It also has the power to adjourn the hearing or put it at the end of the day&#146;s proceedings to give representatives time to consider the evidence. ILPA contends, and we agree, that these powers are more than adequate for the AIT to manage the appeals process.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000085"></a>We have particular concerns about the effect of the exclusion in the clause on appeals under the points-based system, against which it is aimed. That system has yet to be fully rolled out, but there is inevitably a risk at the beginning that an applicant or his representative may miscalculate points or misunderstand certain criteria, with the effect that an appeal fails simply because of an error of fact which there would be no means of correcting. This could be particularly disastrous for people applying to extend their leave to remain in the UK, who are the appellants dealt with under the clause. It could be too late for someone to submit a corrected application after the appeal has been dismissed because his permitted leave to remain might then have expired, with the result that he would have to return to his country of origin and make a new application to enter. In the mean time, it could have a severe effect on, say, his studies at a university, or it could mean the loss of his employment or the disruption of his business relationships.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000086"></a>We recognise that the Home Affairs Select Committee in another place recommended a restriction on new evidence similar to that provided in Clause 19. However, the Select Committee added that there should be a further stage at which the case worker issues a minded-to-refuse notice for an extension of leave, giving an applicant an opportunity to counter the draft refusal by submitting further evidence that would be considered by officials rather than by the AIT. However, Clause 19 would preclude the consideration of evidence submitted in response to a minded-to-refuse notice. We therefore suggest that the AIT should be obliged to consider only evidence submitted up to the date on which the appeal is lodged, giving the BIA plenty of time to consider it before the hearing. If there is to be a minded-to-refuse stage, applicants would have the chance to address points made and to correct errors arising from a misunderstanding or miscalculation. It would also accommodate the Home Office&#146;s concern that new evidence should be considered by the BIA before it goes to the AIT.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000087"></a>So although we are satisfied that the procedures rules afford the AIT adequate powers to deal with the problem that exists, we have accepted, following consultations with ILPA, that a solution can be found within the framework of Clause 19, and we hope that, without necessarily committing himself to the precise wording of our amendment, the Minister will agree that reasonable opportunities must be given to applicants to submit further evidence related to the circumstances at the time of their application in good time to be considered by the BIA at a stage before the hearing. I beg to move.</p>

We were certainly aware in our briefing meetings with all the organisations before the Bill was laid that Clause 19 was a matter of some concern. I hope that the amendment gives the Government the opportunity to clarify how they expect the process to work. I do not believe that the Government are trying to be difficult in preventing proper information coming forward, which would mean that there would be a satisfactory adjudication made in each case.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000090"></a>I hope that the Minister will explain more clearly than we have seen in the Explanatory Notes why the Government have felt that it is appropriate and necessary to change the rules. We do not want to end up with a new system, which, by lack of clarity, means that there could be a longer procedure during appeals and more difficulties put in the way of appeals by those who feel that they are being badly treated. What exactly will be the time constraints within which evidence can be submitted? Why have the Government decided that they should no longer consider substantive evidence if it is available only after the original immigration application has been made?</p>

Members of the Committee have raised some important issues. Issues relating to processes surrounding appeals tribunals and so on are very important because we need to get the processes right. So I am grateful to noble Lords for tabling this amendment and for giving me the opportunity to explain a little of the Government&#146;s thinking. As I understand the amendments, they would negate the purpose of Clause 19 by allowing new evidence on any matter to be submitted in any appeal under the points-based system&#151;PBS&#151;subject to the sole condition that the evidence must have been submitted no later than the notice of appeal.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000094"></a>If accepted, the amendments would move the points-based appeal system away from what we regard as its purpose, which is to allow the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal to decide whether the appellant&#146;s application was correctly refused. Allowing new evidence would mean that the tribunal would be making its own decision on a different basis to the decision of the Border and Immigration Agency. In effect, the appeal process would be looking at a different case. It would not be reflecting on whether an error in judgment had been made when the case was first considered, which is the nature of the problem.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000095"></a>Clause 19 contains enough safeguards to ensure that it is fair. For example, new evidence will be allowed in order to challenge an allegation by the Border and Immigration Agency that a piece of evidence is not genuine, or to refute a reason for refusal that is not based on the acquisition of points. On those issues, new evidence will be allowed. However, subject to those exceptions, the principle that new evidence will not be allowed in points-based system appeals is, in the Government&#146;s view, correct. The amendments are not compatible with that, so, for those reasons, we cannot accept them.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000096"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, referred to the Home Affairs Select Committee&#146;s recommendation that we might consider introducing a minded-to-refuse stage into the application process. As we said in response to the Home Affairs Select Committee, we agree that there may well be some benefits to a minded-to-refuse procedure. However, we need to weigh them against the financial implications of adding another stage to the decision-making process. Our preference is to make changes that simplify the decision-making process. That is not just in the interests of the state but also those of the applicant, because over the many years that I have been dealing with this subject, a constant complaint has been the labyrinthine and complex nature of the process. I think we all agree on that. Over that time, we have been trying to make the process more transparent and simpler for those caught up in it. We are not currently convinced that the introduction of a minded-to-refuse process will aid simplification, which is another reason for not going along that route.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000097"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, also posed a question about whether the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal has the power to exclude evidence through the procedure rules. That is correct, but the aim of the points-based system is to ensure that the criteria are so clear that there will be no need to put evidence in at the appeal stage.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000098"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, made the point that frequently there is not proper representation.

I was trying to respond to various points, including that made by the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, on the Law Society briefing on the Bill. I think that the point related to Clause 19 and the notion that it might lead to an increase in applications for judicial review, requests for assistance from MPs, and so on. I suppose that it could lead to more judicial reviews. However, in cases where an applicant is refused for not having submitted the required evidence but then obtains it later, they should make a fresh application. The merits of their case could then be properly considered by the case workers rather than by means of the appeals process. It would be wrong to turn the appeals process into a second-form case consideration at tribunal level. We do not think that that would be a good or intelligent use of the appeals process. That is essentially why we think it right to rely on case analysis rather than tribunal analysis. Obviously we want to get to the point where the case workers make the correct decision in as many cases as possible.</p>

Under the points-based system there will be fewer areas for dispute because the applicant will be guided to ensure that the right information is supplied. If the applicant provides the specified evidence, they will get the points. There will therefore be less scope for challenging the BIA decisions. It will be a much more guided process and clearer. What the applicant has to provide and the evidence required will be clearly identified for those who are in the process. As an outcome, there should be fewer calls on MPs&#146; time for assistance and fewer judicial reviews.</p>

To tease him a bit, I note that the Government are considering changing the way in which the Court of Appeal considers cases. If they bring forward some of the proposed changes, the Court of Appeal will hear cases ab initio and there may be some parallel arguments to be made by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, regarding the Bill&#151;but long after I have finished this brief. That is not quite my legacy to the Minister.</p>

<p><a name="070718113000103"></a>I would be grateful if the Minister could give an assurance on the record regarding one matter which has been raised with me by noble Lords on my Benches who act as vice-chancellors to universities.  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC74"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column GC74</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>They hope that there is a circumstance that would come within the permitted part of Clause 19 that says that if a document is not valid it may be presented later. The circumstance that I have in mind is where someone under the points-based system seeks to come here and presents evidence of having achieved a certain level of educational attainment&#151;which carries with it particular points. The document has been sought in all honesty, and that person has attended and completed a course satisfactorily, but when the institution issues the document it makes a simple error, whereby perhaps the wrong date is given for the attendance of that person at that course. If that is discovered during the proceedings and the person is accused of having an invalid document, can the Minister assure me that the person who has to seek a new document setting out the correct information would not have to go back and start the whole process over again but would be able to bring the information later?</p>

<p><a name="070718113000104"></a><b><a name="70718-gc0003.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="070718113000450"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I am grateful to the noble Baroness for her comments. I understand the tease; different policy, different area, not for me. It is an interesting point. Proposed new Section 85A(4)(c) allows evidence to be submitted at the appeal to rebut a decision by the BIA that a document is not genuine or is invalid. I think I made this point earlier. We would envisage evidence being produced by the applicant to correct that kind of clerical, typographical or administrative error. I think that it would fall within that exception. The interpretation is sufficiently broad to enable that to be the case.</p>

<p><a name="070718113000105"></a><b><a name="70718-gc0003.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="070718113000451"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> The point raised by the noble Baroness was by way of example and was maybe not unique. Documents that are submitted with the application may turn out to be invalid for one reason or another, and she has given a particular instance of an incorrect date being given that could well have been corrected once attention had been drawn to it. Supposing that there are other instances of a similar kind&#151;not leaving universities&#151;and pursuing the line of thought introduced into our debate by the noble Baroness, I suggest that in many cases it would be critical to the student to have his application considered on the proper date, which it would not be if he had to submit a fresh application. If he misses that opportunity and by submitting a fresh application is out of time for the university term, he may lose the right to attend a particular course. That was the reason why&#151;without suggesting, as the Minister put it, that we introduce a new stage into the process&#151;there could at least be consideration of evidence that was submitted up until the time of the appeal. That would give the BIA an adequate opportunity to look at the evidence before the appeal was heard, and it would not be faced, as it says sometimes happens now, with evidence coming in at the very last minute or on the day of the appeal.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000119"></a>The noble Lord said: As we have been discussing, Clause 19 further restricts the right to appeal. In appeals against refusal of leave to enter or of variations of leave to enter or remain, the AIT will be prevented from considering evidence adduced by the appellant which was not submitted at the time of making the original application where that application was made under the new points-based Immigration Rules. Representations have been made to the Minister that this clause will affect applicants who have not had the benefit of sound immigration advice when they submitted their original application, because they would not be able to adduce evidence crucial to the case at the appeals stage simply because the evidence was not submitted at the time of the application.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000120"></a>Our application would give Parliament a role in examining how this new restriction operates. It would, as the amendment makes clear, require the Secretary of State to lay before Parliament within 12 months of the commencement of the clause a report on the way in which the new restriction has operated. I appreciate that the Minister will claim that a report on these matters will be part and parcel of the report made by the Border and Immigration Inspectorate, but it is important at this stage in our debates that the Minister explains just how he expects the restrictions in Clause 19 to operate fairly when they appear to disadvantage those who do not have access to legal advice. I beg to move.</p>

The Minister, Joan Ryan, said then that there would be reports to Parliament on the operation not only of Clause 19 but of every other clause, and that the independent inspectorate would look at the points-based system, including its appeal system, and the operation of Clause 19, as the noble Lord, Lord Henley, has just acknowledged. The Secretary of State would then lay its annual report before Parliament. Then, in accordance with Cabinet Office guidelines, there would also be a post-implementation review of the Bill, including Clause 19 itself. So although my honourable friend the Member for Rochdale supported the Conservative amendment in the Public Bill Committee, having

<p><a name="070718113000122"></a><b><a name="70718-gc0003.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="070718113000459"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> The arguments have not moved on greatly since that consideration. I listened very carefully to what the noble Lord, Lord Henley, had to say. He is right to anticipate my response that the role of the chief inspector for the Border and Immigration Agency, which Clauses 47 to 55 introduce, will of course include the operation of Clause 19 as part of the inspector&#146;s duty quite properly to consider the treatment of appellants. This would introduce a disproportionate and unnecessary, even overburdening, reporting requirement, and would make the whole process rather more bureaucratic than it needs to be. We are often upbraided for introducing disproportionate and unreasonable reporting requirements on those who are involved in monitoring or law enforcement. I am sensitive to those issues. We should apply those duties with care. It is also worth saying that, in accordance with Cabinet Office guidelines, our regulatory impact assessment in any event commits us to conducting a post-implementation review of the whole Bill, including Clause 19. A copy of that report will be placed in the Library of each House.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000123"></a>The further report demanded by the amendment would be unnecessary, and it would not justify the resources required to prepare it. It would also introduce unnecessary duplication. I hope that the noble Lord will consider those points and withdraw his amendment.</p>

He told us that the arguments have not moved on, but went on to assure us that a regulatory impact assessment will be made by his department and copies of it will be placed in the Library. When is that likely to take place? Will it be a one-off assessment or will further regulatory impact assessments be made in later years? I would not want to overburden the Home Office, which has a great deal to do, particularly when it is not passing further legislation, but it might be that such large parts of the department have been hived off to the Ministry of Justice that it has a little more spare time on its hands. Before I withdraw the amendment, I will be grateful if the Minister will let me know a little more about the timing.</p>

The noble Lord teases me about the Home Office, but it is a not-infrequent tease. It will not have escaped his notice that in the next parliamentary timetable there appear to be fewer Home Office Bills than we have been used to. I cannot say that that is going to be the case for ever, but it will free a bit more time so we can give issues of this sort more consideration.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000134"></a>I want to draw attention to Section 51 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006, which allows the Secretary of State to charge a fee in connection with any application or claim in connection with immigration or nationality. In the Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Order 2007 which was discussed in your Lordships&#146; House on 8 March, the Government set out the range of services for which fees would be charged under Section 51, replacing those which had previously been set under various pieces of legislation. That order prepared the ground to set fees for most of the services provided in connection with nationality and immigration at levels that reflect the benefits that the Secretary of State thinks are likely to accrue to the person making the application or for whom the process is undertaken in accordance with Section 42 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004. </p>

<p><a name="070718113000136"></a>When the Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Order was debated on 8 March, we said that we had no objection to charging fees as such. On the other hand, when the enabling clauses were debated in the proceedings on the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Bill in early 2006, we had no idea that in some cases the fees were to be almost doubled. We said that it was unfair to load on to current applicants for the services of the BIA the heavy costs of transforming the immigration system over the next four years. I wrote to the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, drawing her attention to the charges that were to be paid by a British citizen for his foreign wife&#146;s visa, her permanent residency and her citizenship. Under that order, the total was increased from &#163;1,102 to &#163;2,059. I pointed out that legitimate entrants are already contributing to the economy under the tax system. It was clear that although the Government had been through the motions of consultation on the charges, they had not listened to what some of the respondents had said.</p>

<p><a name="070718113000137"></a>With that unfortunate experience of the way in which the Government used the power in Section 42 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 to levy extortionate fees on certain applicants, we urge the Committee not to give carte blanche to charge sponsors whatever the traffic will bear. Universities are already losing students to foreign competition because of the fees that they have to pay to come here. Now the sponsoring universities are going to be charged and they will have to recover that cost in the fees that they impose on the students. The person who wants to bring a spouse here will be confronted with an extra bill on top of the &#163;2,059 already imposed. The employer will have to find an unknown amount on top of what he is paying now.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000138"></a>As we saw with the order mentioned earlier, once the order reaches Parliament we have no option but to accept whatever increases the Government decide to impose. All we could do on that occasion was to call attention to the discrepancies between the responses to the consultation and what was in the order. In the case of the fees to be charged under Clause 20, there is not even a consultation. We beg for that as a small mercy. Realising that there is no chance whatever that the Minister will accept the amendment, we beg that the Government will engage in a consultation. Not in hope or expectation, I beg to move.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000141"></a>I know from experience that a fee of &#163;750 is &#163;200 more than the monthly basic state pension in the United Kingdom. How much do the Government hope to realise from this large increase? Are Home Office accounts subject to strict audit? I am sure they are. Is the Audit Commission involved in any way? Is there an independent inspectorate that says, &#147;Yes, this jump from &#163;350 to &#163;750 is justified&#148;?</p>

<a name="70718-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000142"></a>I am very suspicious of the financing of the Home Office at present. People probably think that I am very boring on this subject. There are to be 69 passport personal interview offices, of which three&#151;I am glad that the figure is now three: Newport, Belfast and Glasgow&#151;are active. Last week I received a Written Answer from the noble Lord, Lord West, in reply to a Question on the cost of the 69 passport personal interview centres. I was absolutely astonished. The cost is &#163;69 million&#151;&#163;1 million per office. However, as only three offices are currently active, the cost per office is much higher. Are the Government satisfied that their bookkeeping is of the highest order? Today we are talking of an increase from &#163;350 to &#163;750. That was not simply decided by the Minister; it was worked out. We must realise that the very poorest could never meet that amount.</p>

Do the figures quoted by the noble Lord, Lord West of Spithead, include both the capital costs of the new offices and the current cost of running them for a year? I do not know. I would dissent ever so slightly from what the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, said, because I do not consider that this country is one of primary immigration, as the United States was in the last century and perhaps still is to some extent now. However, I have always stood up for the principle of family reunion. By that I mean that when a person is entitled to reside in this country, he should be allowed and encouraged to have with him his wife and children&#151;his close family. I am also strongly in favour of the principle of monogamy. That would perhaps prevent people who are entitled to be here having a plurality of wives.</p>

It is amazing what can be squeezed into a Lords Committee debate. I congratulate noble Lords on their ingenuity.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000145"></a>The amendment has been tabled in response to the scale of the fee increases that were introduced in April. It is worth registering that there are no fundamental objections to the principle that those who use the immigration system should pay most towards the costs, including fees that are set above normal cost-recovery levels. We believe that the safeguards in the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004&#151;that is the Act that Clause 20 seeks to amend&#151;are sufficient. Those safeguards require the Secretary of State to consult with such persons&#151;those whom she deems appropriate&#151;before making an instrument prescribing fees above cost-recovery levels and that the instrument is subject to the affirmative processes in both Houses.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000146"></a>The Act also states that fees set above cost should reflect the benefits that the Secretary of State thinks are likely to accrue to a successful applicant. I think we should focus some of our attention on that. We believe that in order to set fees at fair and sustainable levels in the future we need to maintain flexibility. The measure in the amendment proposing an acceptable increase to the fees would not, of course, allow us to amend the fees to reflect wider policy changes that affect the entitlements and benefits of a successful application. It would also limit our ability to correct anomalies in the charging structure, should those arise over time. For those primary reasons we are not able to accept the amendment.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000147"></a>Members of the Committee asked for further and better particulars. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, asked why we thought that the increase from &#163;335 to &#163;750&#151;in this example, for postal applications&#151;was right. We did it to bring us more into line with similar fees charged in other countries, as we are considerably less costly than most, and to reflect the administrative costs of determining settlement and to ensure compliance with our immigration laws. I make the comment that settlement brings with it rights to access the labour market and the benefit system for applicants and their dependants. We think that the fees charged to users of the system, who benefit from the services that we offer and from living in our country, reflect a good offer. It is right that the charge is a fair reflection of those benefits.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000148"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asserted that we were not listening to consultation. The majority of respondents agreed that the fees should reflect the value of the entitlements to a migrant from a successful application and should support the Government&#146;s position. It is certainly not the case that we did not undertake consultation&#151;that much is clear. There is a statutory duty to do that, as I have already said. The consultation ran from 30 October to 22 December last year. The consultation document was sent to over 3,000 people and stakeholder groups and was published on the Home Office website. We received some 340 written responses: 51 per cent were educational establishments, 35 per cent employers and 14 per cent arts and entertainment organisations.

Over 400 people attended one event: 87 per cent agreed that we should set fees flexibly to take into account wider policy objectives and 79 per cent agreed that fees should reflect a range of factors, not only those of value to migrants.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000149"></a>I believe that I have answered most of the points. If there are any other issues that Members of the Committee feel I have not touched on, I shall happily endeavour to respond to them.</p>

I wrote to the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland, pointing out that the consultation to which the Minster has referred included no persons or groups that were representative of spouses and that when spouses discovered the level of the fees, as given by my noble friend, for indefinite leave to remain, they were horrified. I cannot imagine how the Secretary of State determined that the level of benefits accruing to someone who brought a spouse into this country had suddenly increased from &#163;350 to &#163;750, irrespective of the means of the applicant.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000151"></a>The Minister has said that they compared this fee with comparable levels in other countries. I challenge him on that, and I challenged the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland. I sent her a list of countries which I had checked. In every case, the fee was less than the &#163;750 that we were charging. I could not find a single country where the fee for indefinite leave to remain was more than &#163;750. I am afraid that the Minister has been wrongly briefed, and he should go back to the department and find out what fee levels are charged for indefinite leave to remain in a number of other countries.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000152"></a>The point of raising this was that, by giving the Secretary of State carte blanche, we have absolutely no idea what he is going to charge under Clause 20. The fees are not to be paid by the applicants, but by the sponsors. Here, for example, we have a spouse who is bringing his wife into the United Kingdom. He is already going to pay &#163;2,059 when, suddenly, another fee is going to be charged on top of that; but nobody has any idea what it is. I urge the Minister to at least try to find some organisations representing the interests of spouses so that they are not missed out of the consultation that he undertakes on this occasion. However, I am pleased to hear that he will consult other interests. The universities may well have something to say about this; it may be the straw that breaks the camel&#146;s back. I pointed out that the universities are already anxious because the fees paid by incoming students are already making them less competitive than some of the institutions in, say, the United States. If the universities are now to be asked to pay a sponsor&#146;s fee on top of the rest of the

<a name="70718-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000153"></a>I appeal the Minister to ensure that, when he undertakes the consultation on the level of fees to be charged under Clause 20, he brings in both universities and organisations representing families&#151;not just spouses, of course. As the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, said, this applies also to people bringing in elderly dependent relatives.</p>

I am prepared to accept that there might be something of a mixed picture in terms of overseas applicants to UK universities, but I think that the case is broadly that we are competitive and we have been extremely successful over the past few years in attracting overseas students to the UK. We certainly operate competitively against our main competitors in the field, which are US and Australian universities.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000155"></a>I remind the Committee that when the announcement was made&#151;it is worth putting on the record&#151;Universities UK said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="070718113000363"></a>&#147;We welcome today's announcement of special initial visa fees for international students. It is an acknowledgment of the considerable benefits that international students bring to the UK and the investment they make to come here. We&#146;re pleased that the Minister has listened to a number of our concerns in this area&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="070718113000335"></a>The National Union of Students also commented on the announcement:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="070718113000364"></a>&#147;We are grateful that the voice of international students has been heard, as many see fees as an additional barrier to come and study in the UK ... We believe it is right students should pay less as they are not coming to the UK to work but to study. International students are already faced with the cost of exponential international students&#146; course fees. We are welcoming the on-going discussion with the Government surrounding the points-based system. NUS is glad the Government has recognised the value of international students&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="070718113000336"></a>They may not absolutely like everything we done and said on this, but they recognise, first, that we consult, secondly, that we look at the broader international case and, thirdly, that we listen to representations when they are made to us. I cannot entirely accept what the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, has said on that issue. It is important that we focus on what is actually said and what actually happens as a product of policy and how we approach these issues.</p>

Does the Minister have any information on that? I saw it suggested&#151;admittedly in the press&#151;that those people are finding a way of coming into this country and then not going to university. Will the university have paid for them? One university talked about several hundred such people. Does the Minister know anything about that, or has he not been briefed on it?</p>

I do not think that the cost of a visa will be the most determining factor. I would have thought that all the other costs, such as the cost of living and the cost of travel, would play a more important part because they are larger costs to the individual. However, we have been, and continue to be, extremely successful in education in comparison with our international competitors in that field. Not only do some of our universities work with foreign students here, but they are locating abroad and are extending their range of services in that direction, which I am sure we all welcome.</p>

However, because the Government have limited the number of approved institutions for overseas students to come to, and because they are very rigorously checked and must sponsor a particular applicant, people are far less likely nowadays not to take up the places that they have been granted.</p>

I am talking about specific universities to which students have applied and to which they have been accepted and who come to this country to attend the university but do not turn up. One very well known university in Scotland quoted the figures.</p>

The noble Baroness will recall that, in earlier legislation, we also obliged universities or institutions of higher education to report students who did not attend their courses. A student must attend a minimum number of hours a week&#151;I think it is 20&#151;to qualify as a student in higher education. If for any reason, even sickness, the person does not turn up for a particular percentage of the lectures or practicals, the university must report them to the immigration authorities. So although what the noble Baroness describes might have happened in the old days, she will find that the steps that have been taken to reduce abuses of the system have been reasonably successful. One institution in Scotland may have had a particularly unfortunate experience, but I hope that it has collaborated with the BIA in ensuring that those people who have abused the system by coming in, ostensibly as students, and then disappearing into the woodwork, have been reported and removed from the country.</p>

One such university was Newcastle. A large number of students had applied to it and did not show up, and it looked very much like an immigration scam. If the Minister is not briefed on this, his department should be aware of it and should be aware of the allegations that have been made. He and the department should respond on whether this is happening. Certainly, it is a very serious allegation about what was happening in this field.</p>

This question is a long way wide of the amendment, which concerns the fees that a sponsor pays to bring someone into the United Kingdom. While it is perfectly legitimate for the Minister to be asked questions about irregularities in universities, that should be done offline and not as part of the proceedings of this Committee.</p>

It is being dismissed by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, but he should probably wind up his amendment now.</p>

It might assist the Committee if I ask the officials to provide more background to circulate to Members of the Committee who are interested in this issue. I can see that security in universities is of concern, not least because of recent events. Perhaps it is just worth putting on the record that there is a contact point for universities to seek proper advice, to provide information to the BIA and to report students who have not turned up for courses and who are failing to attend. The noble Lord is reminding me that he has made that point, which is fair enough. That process is in train. We take this issue extremely seriously because, clearly, it is in our interests in terms of security.</p>

Before we leave universities altogether, like the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, I have read the papers and looked at the consultation, and I am perfectly well aware of what the universities said. I point out to the Committee that all the responses to the consultation were given before people knew the level of the fees. While universities may have been satisfied that the students coming to them would not be deterred by those fees, that certainly is not applicable to everyone else covered by the previous order.</p>

That applied in particular to dependants, who were mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton.

It is my fear that, having given the Government a blank cheque through Clause 20, we will find that, in particular, for the poorest of the Africans&#151;mentioned by my noble friend Lord Roberts&#151;or in the case of an elderly grandmother coming from the Indian subcontinent, for example, the sponsor, a working-class individual on a minimum wage in this country, will suddenly be faced with a bill that makes it impossible for him to look after the elderly dependent relative.</p>

<p><a name="070718113000176"></a>The noble Lord said: I express my appreciation at the outset to the Refugee Children&#146;s Consortium for its insight and advice which has led me to table this amendment. I do so to press the Government on the current situation that denies many unaccompanied children a right to an appeal while they are still children.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000177"></a>Article 2 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child requires states party to it to &#147;respect and ensure&#148; the rights enshrined in the convention,</p>
<ul><a name="070718113000391"></a>&#147;to each child, without discrimination of any kind&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="070718113000337"></a>and to ensure that a child is protected against all forms of discrimination on the basis of status, including national origin. I obviously hope that the Government intend that refugee children should not be subjected to a lower standard of justice than other children in the UK. I cannot believe that the Government intend otherwise.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000178"></a>Section 83 prevents those granted leave for less than one year from making an appeal against the refusal of their asylum claim. Unfortunately&#151;again, I cannot believe this was the Government&#146;s intention&#151;in practice, this applies disproportionately to unaccompanied children who frequently receive less than a year&#146;s discretionary leave. Following the recent Home Office policy change, which lowered the age to which discretionary leave will be granted from 18 to 17 and a half, many more unaccompanied asylum-seeking children are going to be caught by the Section 83 provisions in the future.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000179"></a>Currently, 46 per cent of unaccompanied children arriving in the UK are 16 or 17 years old. This amounts to some 1,500 children. As the majority are likely to be over 16 and a half by the time they receive an initial decision on their claim, they will therefore be denied access to the appellate system. Young people are of course able to make an appeal at a later stage if their application to extend their leave is refused. However, this will possibly be some years after the initial application. Such a delay can prejudice the outcome of the appeal in a number of ways. Experience suggests the following examples of how it can do so.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000180"></a>First, when the events relevant to the appeal occurred a significant time ago it can be much harder  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC88"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column GC88</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to gather evidence either because the child finds it difficult to recollect important details or because it may be impossible to trace important witnesses. We should remember that we are dealing with children who may have been through traumatic experiences.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000181"></a>Another significant problem is that children and young people often lose contact with their lawyers before their appeal is heard, which results in many being unrepresented at the hearing. The Refugee Children&#146;s Consortium reports cases of children and young people in these circumstances being forced to represent themselves at appeal hearings.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000182"></a>Finally, if the length of delay means that the young person&#146;s appeal is heard after they become 18, this may well put them at an even greater disadvantage because children benefit from a more generous application of the merits test legal aid funding. If they are merits tested as adults, they may be denied representation at their appeal.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000183"></a>I further believe that the proposed amendment makes sense in the light of the Government&#146;s plans for reforming the support system for unaccompanied children. Their proposals place significant emphasis on the need to prepare young people to return to their home countries on reaching the age of 18. However, while Section 83 remains in force, it is very difficult for social workers to do this because the young people with whom they are working have not been able to bring finality to their claim; that is, a decision which includes an appeal. Without this they are likely to retain the hope that they may have the decision to refuse asylum overturned at a later stage. I hope that the Minister can respond to these anxieties. They are very genuine anxieties among those with real experience of working in the front line. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="070718113000184"></a><b><a name="70718-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="070718113000483"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> On 30 March the Home Office issued APU Notice 3/2007, entitled &#147;Amendment to Discretionary Leave Policy relating to Asylum Seeking Children&#148;. This policy deals with children who do not qualify for asylum or humanitarian protection and who up to then were granted discretionary leave for three years, or until their 18th birthday, whichever was the shorter. The APU notice provided that from 1 April, discretionary leave was to be granted to the age of 17 and a half, if that was less than three years. This means that, because under Section 83 of the NIA Act 2002, only an asylum seeker who has been granted leave to enter for more than a year has a right of appeal, a child making an application at the age of 16 and a half or over will have been given a year or less and will have no right of appeal.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000185"></a>The notice says that this provides more clarity to the young person about their future, meaning that they can look forward to removal at the age of 18. Somewhere around half of UASC will be 16 and a half by the time they get the initial decision on their asylum claim, and, as the noble Lord, Lord Judd, explained, their only recourse will be to submit an application for an extension of leave to remain as they approach the 17-and-a-half watershed, and then if that is refused, as inevitably it will be, to appeal against that decision. Since by the time the appeal is  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC89"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column GC89</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>heard, generally at least a year and a half will have elapsed since the child&#146;s original application, it will be much harder to assemble the evidence required, as the noble Lord said, and to prove that the circumstances at the time of the appeal, which the immigration judge has to consider, are the same as those which applied when the asylum claim was made.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000186"></a>As the noble Lord also said, there is the additional disadvantage that since the child will almost certainly have turned 18 by the time the appeal is heard, the adult merits test will be applied to the application for legal aid funding, and since this is less favourable than the test for children, the young person is in greater danger of being denied representation altogether at the appeal. So much for the clarity about the child&#146;s future.</p>

<p><a name="070718113000187"></a><b><a name="70718-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="070718113000484"></a>Lord Hylton:</b> I realise that the amendment is technically about appeals. Nevertheless, it provides an opportunity to raise issues about the policy of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. We may be talking about 6,000 such children already in this country. The Local Government Association believes that the cost of maintaining them here is of the order of &#163;50 million a year and it points out that the government grant which goes to local authorities undertaking the care amounts to only &#163;12.3 million. Therefore, there is a huge burden on local authorities up and down the country which, in my view, should be borne as a national expense.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000188"></a>I also inquire about what is supposed to happen at the end of the period in which the child can stay here. Is the age 16, is it 17 and a half, as was suggested, or is it 18? At the moment no one seems to know the answer to that question. To what extent have the Government considered whether such children will be safe if they are returned to their countries of origin on reaching the predetermined age? In the case of Vietnam, I think there are very serious doubts about that and the same may be true of Cambodia.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000189"></a>Suppose a child ceases to be unaccompanied because, in the interim, other members of his family have arrived here. Is the intention still to return that child? Whatever the answers to these questions may be, it appears to me that by the time they reach the age limit, we will have invested large sums in each child. Therefore, why not let them stay in this country, if they wish to do so, as we have an ageing population here, which urgently needs more young workers to support it? In general, I am strongly in favour of the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="070718113000190"></a><b><a name="70718-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="070718113000485"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Judd, who makes a good case. I listened to his argument with great care. I shall try to explain the Government&#146;s reason for sticking to their policy on asylum appeals and for resisting this amendment, despite some of its attractions.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000191"></a>An asylum claimant whose claim for refugee status is refused, but who is, none the less, granted more than 12 months of leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom, can appeal to the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal against the rejection of his

Where someone&#146;s asylum claim is refused and they are granted 12 months or less of leave to enter or remain, they may not immediately appeal. We believe that strong policy reasons still exist for the 12-month restriction which this amendment is proposing to remove. It is important to point out that where a period of leave of less than 12 months is granted there will still be a right of appeal once leave expires and a decision is made to enforce removal. Where someone is granted a period of leave of 12 months or less, we expect that person to return to their home country after a period of short stability in the United Kingdom and without the need for an enforced removal.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000192"></a>The main reason for introducing an upgrade appeal for those people who are refused asylum but are granted a period of leave of less than 12 months was to ensure that such people were not prevented from appealing the finding on their asylum application for a lengthy period of time should they choose not to leave the United Kingdom. Our view remains that, if a period of leave of 12 months or less is granted, it is reasonable to expect the applicant to wait until the expiry of that leave before he or she is entitled to bring a statutory appeal.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000193"></a>I am sure that Members of the Committee will agree that great strides and progress have been taken in speeding up the immigration appellate system in recent years, but appeals still take time to conclude. The length of time that it takes from lodging an appeal to receiving a tribunal determination takes less than 12 weeks in 95 per cent of cases, which, given where we started from, is a real sign of improvement. </p>

<a name="70718-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000194"></a>Once an appeal has been determined, the tribunal will be asked to consider an application for reconsideration in 49 per cent of cases. Most applications are refused, but this application process takes further time to conclude the appeal. Thus, if someone refused asylum but granted a short period of leave was able to appeal straightaway, the appeal could still be running when that leave expired. Assuming the appeal was dismissed, enforcement action would commence which would attract a further right of appeal. The Government&#146;s one-stop policy on immigration appeals says that there should be one appeal which considers all arguments that someone may have for remaining in the United Kingdom. If accepted, Amendment No. 41 would increase the numbers of persons who could qualify for two appeals, which runs contrary to the one-stop principle that the Government believe is perfectly sensible and has attracted widespread support.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000195"></a>In making his argument, the noble Lord, Lord Judd, suggested that we discriminate against people on the basis that they are asylum-seeking children. There is no discrimination on the basis that someone is an asylum-seeking child. The availability of an upgrade appeal depends on the period of leave granted. We feel that if a period of 12 months or less of leave is granted, it is not unreasonable to expect the person granted leave to wait until the expiry of this period before he or she can bring a statutory appeal.

It is for reasons of practicality, good process, simplicity and a tidier appeals process, and&#151;I would argue&#151;in the interests of the appellant, that this policy is the right one. Having heard that, I hope that the noble Lord will reflect on it and withdraw his amendment.</p>

We could debate this at great length. I thank the noble Lords, Lord Avebury and Lord Hylton, for their interventions. To the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, I simply would say that his interesting, adjacent point about the cost to local authorities is even more of a burden for some local authorities. They are often the very local authorities which have the largest amount of social issues and problems with which to deal already. This becomes the sort of straw that could almost break the camel&#146;s back.</p>

<p><a name="070718113000197"></a>My noble friend has referred to how long appeals take on average and the rest. I refer to a very important point made on an earlier amendment. When you are talking about the human situation, in real stress and, on occasion, in times of considerable mental anguish, to believe that the argument about averages will be convincing is pie-in-the-sky. It is a theoretical argument that does not relate to ordinary people in the immediate situation.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000198"></a>The organisations with which I have been dealing are particularly concerned by the cases with which they have had to deal. They see real challenges and problems in what the Government have now laid down. I said that I wanted to press the Government on this. I would feel more encouraged if my noble friend were to recognise that there is an issue here. Justice has to be seen to be done, and justice demands equality before the law. In both those contexts, there are difficulties around what is happening. I would feel more encouraged if my noble friend were to say, &#147;Okay, I can see there is an issue and that it is an issue that organisations doing a lot of exacting work in the front line really care about. I will ensure that there can be meetings with my department to go into the implications of what has been raised in greater depth and how they might be resolved&#148;. Can my noble friend give me an assurance on that point before I withdraw the amendment?</p>

<a name="70718-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000203"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of this amendment is to correct what is now almost universally seen as an anomaly in our nationality and immigration law. The amendment confers not citizenship, for reasons that I shall explain later, but rights of entry to the United Kingdom on people who were born abroad between 1 January 1949 and 7 February 1961&#151;just over 12 years&#151;and who are children of a foreign father and a British mother. The amendment adds new matter to the Bill and has no effect on anything now in it.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000204"></a>I raise this issue because in February I received a letter from Mr Kenneth Luke of Houston, Texas. He is the son of an American father and a British mother and was born in the USA. He was 56 at the date of his letter, so he was born in 1950 or early 1951. He wants British citizenship. He knows that had the nationality of his parents been reversed&#151;had his father been British and his mother American&#151;he would have been entitled to British citizenship, even if he had been born in the USA. He knows that if he had been born after 7 February 1961, he would have been entitled to British citizenship, even with his actual parentage and place of birth. I shall read a short extract from his letter:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="070718113000378"></a>&#147;Those of us with British mothers who are still seeking UK citizenship do so because we have deep cultural and family ties to the country&#151;ties that the passage of time has done nothing to diminish. We are not seeking citizenship for a better economic life or because we want to live in &#145;cool Britannia&#146;. We are seeking citizenship because Britain is the land of our mothers, and as such, it is our motherland. This relationship is immutable, and if we should all die without ever having been allowed to live in Britain, it will not be because we did not remain steadfast until the end in our desire to come home and in our belief that our claim to be British by descent was warranted and genuine&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70718-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000205"></a>I was particularly interested in this letter because Mr Luke&#146;s position bears some similarity to my own. I, too, have an American father and a British mother, although, because I was born in the United Kingdom, I am a British citizen by birth. My mother was not a British citizen at the time of my birth because she was stateless. This matter is relevant to the amendment and its history needs some explanation. At the time of my parents&#146; marriage in 1924, United Kingdom law assumed that a woman marrying a foreigner would automatically get her husband&#146;s nationality, and therefore she lost her British nationality. However, under American law, a foreign wife did not acquire American citizenship on marriage until she had been resident in the USA for a year, which my mother never did because my father&#146;s career was in this country. By 1933, this statelessness had affected enough British women to lead to a change in the law. Under the Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1933, women retained British citizenship if they did not acquire their husband&#146;s nationality on marriage, but  


<notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2007" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC93"></a><b>18 July 2007 : Column GC93</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not if they did. My mother at that point became British again. It was not until the British Nationality Act 1948 that British women who had lost their nationality on marriage were given it back, and even then they were not given the same right as British men living abroad with a foreign wife to pass on citizenship to a child.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000206"></a>I am not seeking by this amendment to give any rights to anyone born before 1 January 1949&#151;the date when the British Nationality Act 1948 came into force. That would raise a difficult question whether rights could be given to children of mothers who were not British nationals at the date of their child&#146;s birth but nationals of some other country, and the practical difficulty of identifying the status of the applicant&#146;s mother at the time of the applicant&#146;s birth. Therefore, 1 January 1949 has real logic as a cut-off date for granting the right to British citizenship; 7 February 1961 has none.</p>

<p><a name="070718113000207"></a>Under the British Nationality Act 1948, the Home Secretary had discretion to register a child of a British mother as a British citizen while the child was under 18. That presumably was originally intended for cases where the mother was widowed or divorced and wanted to return to live in the United Kingdom with her child. On 7 February 1961, the Government decided to register any child under 18 of a British mother on application. There was no formal change in the law; it was simply described as a concession. The next step, under the British Nationality Act 1981, was that women became entitled to pass on citizenship to future children on the same basis as men, but that was limited only to children after the 1981 Act came into force.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000208"></a>In April 2003, new Section 4C was added to the 1981 Act by the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. That backdated the citizenship rights to all children born to British mothers after 7 February 1961 even if they had not applied for registration before becoming 18. New Section 4C resulted from amendments tabled by my noble friend Lord Avebury in Committee and on Report. He has also added his name to this amendment. Those amendments in their original form would have backdated the 1981 Act to 1 January 1949, which is what I seek now.</p>

That is reported at column 269 of <I>Hansard</I><I></I>for 9 October 2002. They did so, but to an unnecessarily and unjustifiably limited extent.

<p><a name="070718113000338"></a>What is this logic? It is hard to see.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000210"></a>Why not make the commencement of the British Nationality Act 1948 the cut-off point? I accept that 1 January 1949 is, for reasons I have already explained, a justifiable cut-off date. Why exclude people born in that relatively short period between 1 January 1949 and 7 February 1961? So far as I can see, it is wholly impossible to justify that distinction. Refusing to back-date citizenship to children born before February 1961 was simply continuing unjustifiable gender inequality. It does not matter whether the children affected are male, as Mr Luke is, or female. It preserves discrimination against mothers because they are women and not men. It is also at least arguable that it is ageist because there is a wholly irrational discrimination between those born on or before 7 February 1961 and those born afterwards.</p>

<p><a name="070718113000211"></a>I can see no detriment to the United Kingdom from allowing people in this class right of entry to the United Kingdom. The class of people affected by this amendment is now closed. It can apply only to those born abroad between 1 January 1949 and 7 February 1961 whose mother was a British citizen and whose father was not. There may be no more than a few hundred, certainly no more than the low thousands, of people in this class. All must be at least 46 years old and, no doubt, the great majority of them will be well established in their present home countries. They would welcome the right&#151;when visiting the United Kingdom as tourists, on business, for family reasons or, as some may wish, to live here&#151;to entry on the same basis as UK citizens.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000212"></a>The costs are negligible. I cannot see that the correction of this anomaly would give any precedent for other groups; it is a unique situation. There is no reason to suppose that the children of United Kingdom-citizen fathers exercising their undoubted right to UK citizenship impose any serious burden whatsoever on the state. Why should the children of UK-citizen mothers be different?</p>

<a name="70718-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000213"></a>The simplest way of dealing with this problem would be a further amendment of the British Nationality Act 1981 to give rights of citizenship to children of UK-citizen mothers. My amendment does not do that because this Bill is about immigration and not nationality. A further amendment of the British Nationality Act 1981 would therefore be outside the Long Title. This amendment does the next best thing: it amends the Immigration Act 1971 to allow children of British-citizen mothers the same rights of access to the United Kingdom as if they were British citizens by descent. Accepting this amendment would remedy what is now seen as an anomaly which preserves an old-fashioned rule of gender inequality. It does so in favour of a small, closed class of people. It would not throw any perceptible burden on the state, and there is no justification for the Government objecting to it. I beg to move.</p>

This was one of the wrongs of history, which the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, said five years ago one could go only so far towards righting.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000215"></a>When the matter was raised last week by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, who I am glad to see in his place, the Minister&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Bassam&#151;merely repeated that formula, which is a meaningless argument that can be used against any reform. In a number of debates, as well as in two meetings with Ministers in the summer of 2002, we never had any objective justification for the refusal to eliminate this wrong. In the British Nationality Act 1981, provision was made for the child of a British mother and a foreign father born abroad after 7 February 1961 to be registered as British by his parents while a minor. That had already been the subject of an administrative concession, as my noble friend Lord Goodhart explained. It became apparent that some children who might have benefited from that concession who, when they became adults, wanted to be British had forfeited their entitlement because their parents were unaware of the change or, for one reason or another, failed to act in time.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000216"></a>During the debates on the 2002 Act, we persuaded the Government to enact what is now Section 4C of the 1981 Act, allowing those children to register of their own volition when they became adults. The effect of this change was that in families where children were born before and after the cut-off date, the younger children were entitled to British citizenship and the older ones were not. Michael Turberville, the leader of the NGO, Children and Maternal Parents Against Immigration and Government Nationality Situation&#151;CAMPAIGNS&#151;tells me that he has fewer than 300 pre-1961 children on his database, which conforms with the estimate that my noble friend gave of a few hundred people who might be covered by his amendment. My correspondent, Michael Turberville, thinks that there may be a few more who would like British citizenship but are not aware of his efforts over the years. We are not talking about a large number of people.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000217"></a>Mr Turberville points that when the concession was made for post-1961 children, not a great number of them took advantage of it. He also tells me that only one of the pre-1961 children on his database would not benefit from the amendment of my noble friend. As it happens, that person has probably acquired a right to register through length of residence in the United Kingdom. On learning of this amendment, Mr Turberville wrote to me:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="070718113000379"></a>&#147;CAMPAIGNS would gladly welcome any movement on the cut-off date that would incorporate any decrease in the current disenfranchisement of British women in their ability to pass on their nationality to their children both in other countries and to non-British fathers. This is the 21st century and discrimination in nationality and identity on the basis of gender should cease. Children of British fathers have not had to endure years and decades of being denied their birthright; it is time to put equality into the national identity of what it means to be British. Equality before the law and Parliament should be paramount in all aspects

<p><a name="070718113000218"></a>When we discussed this problem on the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Bill in February 2006, the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, responding on behalf of the Home Office, rightly observed that this problem was,</p>
<ul><a name="070718113000393"></a>&#147;sexism and nothing else as far as I am concerned&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 7/2/06; col. 630.],</ul>
<p><a name="070718113000340"></a>and paraphrased the mantra that was repeated by the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, and by the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, the other day that we cannot undo everything that went before. Parliament can and does amend older legislation that is incompatible with our international obligations&#151;in this case, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. The Government were proud to announce the ratification of the optional protocol to CEDAW in December 2004, which ostensibly gave women who wanted to complain against general discrimination by the Government the right to approach the UN Committee on CEDAW. However, when Mrs Constance Salgado tried to complain about the law, she was told that her complaint was inadmissible because of the Government&#146;s reservations on nationality and immigration. Mrs Salgado has read the exchange that we had on the Question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, and she comments:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="070718113000380"></a>&#147;It appears that the Government is still entrenched in the old philosophy, that when those affected by the discrimination die ... the whole problem will be solved&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70718-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000219"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bassam, was unable to give any rational explanation for refusing to eliminate this sexism from our national law, and his estimate that 3,000 people a year might be affected is wrong by about two orders of magnitude. The suggestion that the victims of this discrimination can become naturalised by length of residence in the United Kingdom is also wrong, because at present they have no right to enter the UK. Since he thinks that they already have the right of abode, he ought to have no problem accepting the amendment.</p>

I appeal to the Minister to discard his brief and promise the Committee that he will draw her attention to what has been said today, as well as to what was said in 2002 and 2006, and will at least ask her to meet us before Report so that together we can eliminate this discrimination from the statute book.</p>

<p><a name="070718113000222"></a>We find ourselves in an extraordinary situation. The Government have persisted in maintaining their position with a totally incomprehensible series of arguments. At Question Time the other day, the Minister quoted the statement by the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, that we can only go so far towards righting the wrongs of history. The noble Baroness, Lady Ashton of Upholland, on the then Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Bill, paraphrased his remarks by saying,</p>
<ul><a name="070718113000394"></a>&#147;we cannot undo everything that went before&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 7/2/06; col. 630.]</ul>
<p><a name="070718113000341"></a>We cannot undo everything that has gone before, but we do not have to go on doing it. That is what we are doing, and there is no reason why what has happened in the past, sad though that may be, should not be put right for the future. It seems to me that what has happened is very strange. The Government have made one minor concession after another; it is the opposite of a death by a thousand cuts. It is gradually getting better, but we still have not come to the end. We really are at the end game.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000223"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Ashton of Upholland, speaking in the debate reported at col. 630 of <I>Hansard</I> on 7 February 2006, seemed to get involved in the most extraordinary and convoluted argument about whether it was right to give these people nationality  or right of abode depending on whether they  were children or adults, and that is the crux of the matter.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000224"></a>It occurred to me on a previous amendment that there is a confusion here. That amendment states that,</p>
<ul><a name="070718113000395"></a>&#147;&#145;child&#146; means an individual who is less than 18 years old&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="070718113000342"></a>But as far as the relationship with the parent is concerned, they remain the children of that parent regardless of their age. It is a totally different concept. The concept that is relevant in relation to this amendment is that they are the children of a particular person. In the extract to which I referred, the noble Baroness got in an even bigger muddle as she somehow got mixed up with the question of siblings and so on. It is the relationship with the parent that is relevant, not the relationship with a sibling. However, as has been pointed out, the way the deadline is set, some siblings are one side of it while others are the other.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000225"></a>But quite apart from all these arguments, it seems to me that the time has come to put the matter right. As the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, pointed out, this measure is concerned with abode rather than citizenship, which was what I dealt with the other day. None the less, it is a move in the right direction. I am

<a name="70718-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000226"></a>I have a terrible feeling that what is really happening is that somewhere deep down in the Home Office an official is determined not to change his mind. It is time for the Minister to get hold of that official, or collection of officials, and bang their heads together, but not at this very moment. The officials sitting behind him may well not be causing the problem. However, we really ought to sort this matter out.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000227"></a>My final point cuts away from all these technical matters. Over the years the granting of citizenship has changed totally and there have been many controversies. The other day the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked whether there was a hidden agenda. We were assured by the Minister that there was not. I suspected that that was the case at first but we take the Minister&#146;s word for it. The reality is that a huge number of people are being granted British citizenship. It was reported in the press the other day that a convicted terrorist had been granted British citizenship. This large number comprises asylum seekers and immigrants of all kinds.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000228"></a>The numbers game is only partially important, but surely when we are giving citizenship to a very large number of people who have absolutely no prior connection whatever with this country, it is wrong to deny it to the category of people mentioned in the letter that the noble Lord quoted. I have received a similar letter. These people are desperately anxious to be British because their mother was British. I believe that the time has come to accept this measure. There are no big financial implications and there is no question of setting precedents. Certainly, we have not heard a single good reason why we should not accept this amendment.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000234"></a>I shall summarise our case. Clearly, this matter will not be resolved today. Before 1983, British women were unable to pass on their citizenship in the same way as men, but there was discretion within the British Nationality Act 1948 to confer citizenship on any minor by registration. As noble Lords have said, on 7 February 1979 the then Home Secretary announced that he would exercise this discretion in favour of any child of a UK-born mother who applied for registration before his or her 18th birthday.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000235"></a>We recognised that some will have learned of the 1979 policy change too late to benefit from it. We therefore changed the law in 2002 so that there is now provision in the British Nationality Act 1981 for a person to be registered as a British citizen, on application and payment of the prescribed fee, if he or she would have been registered in accordance with the policy announced in 1979 had the necessary application been made while he or she was still a minor. In other words, the person concerned must have been a minor on 7 February 1979.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000236"></a>We were not persuaded that it would be right to go any further than that. This was in light of the principle that an adult seeking to be granted British citizenship should normally be able to demonstrate on the basis of his personal connections with this country why his application should succeed. It is also the case that those who would benefit from any further relaxation of the requirements in the 1981 Act are at least 46 years old. Therefore, they are, one assumes, well-established elsewhere. Their situation may be the legacy of legislation that most of us now consider otiose, repugnant and unacceptable, but it is a legacy that cannot simply be ignored.</p>

<p><a name="070718113000243"></a>The amendment seeks to avoid the restriction on eligibility for registration as a British citizen by conferring the right of abode in the United Kingdom, whether or not they wish to have it, on any person who would qualify but for his or her date of birth. Many such people, if they are Commonwealth citizens, will already have the right of abode here as they will be covered by Section 2(1)(b) of the Immigration Act 1971. It is our view that the rights associated with British citizenship, including the right of abode, should in future be limited to those with close and continuing connections with the United Kingdom. To create an additional category of people who held a right of abode without having acquired British citizenship would be inconsistent with this principle.</p>

It was accepted that that discrimination was there and that it needed to be corrected. In the end, it comes back to the point that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, made originally, which is that the further back the cut-off point goes, the less likelihood there is that somebody will be caught and discriminated against.</p>

The Minister has not explained why we now need any cut-off point. Why do we not simply give right of abode or citizenship to those who have a foreign father and a British mother? The noble Lord gets all tied up in dates and when we did this and when we did that, but he has not explained&#151;I am sorry if it is not in his brief&#151;why we need a cut-off point.</p>

I think we probably had in mind a wide range of circumstances that needed to be catered for had the provision been more extensive when my noble friend Lord Filkin dealt with it back in 2002. The historic discrimination in the nationality legislation affected not only women who were British by birth in the United Kingdom but those whose citizenship derived from a connection with some other part of the former British Empire. In some families, several generations may have been excluded from our citizenship through a combination of the statutory discrimination itself&#151;that is what it was&#151;and certain life choices that were made as a consequence of it. I return to the point that any geographical or temporal limitation in the new registration provision would have produced hard cases, whether the issue is 7 February 1961 or 31 December 1948/1 January 1949. The Government at the time felt that they were justified in drawing a line around those who, had they applied in time, would have registered as citizens under the terms of the policy announced in 1979. That was one of the anomalies that was corrected at that point. I accept that there is an element of discrimination wherever there is a cut-off point, but there was some logic originally to having a cut-off point, as I have explained, and that was the logic that was adduced then.</p>

I tried to explain earlier in my speech why I did not go back to before 1 January 1949. The reason is that, until that date, the great majority of British women who married foreigners would have acquired their husband&#146;s nationality and lost their British nationality on marriage. Before 1949, the right to British citizenship might have been available only in a very small and rather random collection of cases, so I do not intend to change that outlook.</p>

I simply think that giving British citizenship to the child of a couple, neither of whom had British citizenship on the date of the child&#146;s birth, would present serious problems and would not be acceptable. If we were to back to before 1949, we would have to limit the right to citizenship to the relatively small numbers of people who have a foreign father, a mother who was a British citizen on the date of the child&#146;s birth, and who were born abroad. That would give rise to anomalies. However, this is far from being the most important issue in this matter.</p>

The Minister said that the legacy cannot be ignored. Of course the legacy cannot be ignored, but where the legacy is itself an unfair and unjustifiable one, as here, then surely what we mean when we say, &#147;the legacy cannot be ignored&#148;, is that we must correct the injustice done by the original legislation.</p>

No one in the Committee can complain that they have not seen it or had an opportunity to read it. It is very useful.</p>

Therefore, I must be given leave to suspect that there are people in the Minister&#146;s department who were not aware of its existence. That report was endorsed at the time by an ad hoc medico-legal committee which consisted of representatives of the BMA, the TUC, law centres, regional health authorities, the JCWI and individual lawyers and doctors.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000270"></a>In the Government&#146;s consultation document, <I>Planning Better O</I><I>utcomes and </I><I>S</I><I>upport for</I><I> Unaccompanied Asylum Seeking Children</I>, there is a discussion of the problem of age determination, so that eligibility for children's services and for enhanced access to legal aid, which we were discussing a few minutes ago, can be decided. It is also necessary, as we discussed on Amendment No. 41, to determine whether a child is over or under the age of 16 and a half at the date of his original application. The Government say that in 2005, 2,425 asylum seekers claimed to be under 18, but were initially deemed by immigration officers to be adults. Some of them were later reclassified as children following more thorough assessment by social workers, but the document claimed that the number of age-disputed cases was illustrative of a serious level of abuse of the system. While not disputing that some pretend to be younger than they are, the fact that social workers frequently have to correct the initial assessment by immigration officers may be said to indicate that a systematic misjudging by those officers is built into the system.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000271"></a>I very much welcome the proposals by ILPA in their report, <I>When is a </I><I>C</I><I>hild not a </I><I>C</I><I>hild</I><I>?</I>, launched in Committee Room 17 on Tuesday, for reducing the number of age disputed cases, and for referring all those cases where agreement is not reached between the asylum seeker and the immigration officer to a regional age assessment centre, independent of the local authorities. The head of the BIA, Ms Lin Homer, who must be given her due for poking her head into the lion&#146;s den by attending the launch, said that the BIA was interested in the idea, which might be related to the Government&#146;s proposal for specialist authorities to whom UASC will be directed in the future, subject to the agreement of the authorities concerned, as we were discussing earlier. The Government envisage that there would be 50 to 60 such authorities, each caring for about 100 UASC, all outside London and the south-east, and all having previous experience of dealing with a reasonable number of UASC. That probably limits the choice to authorities in five regions, so there would be about one regional age-assessment centre to 20 specialist authorities.</p>

However, I believe&#151;the Minister may confirm this&#151;that they have already invested in some equipment and have been surreptitiously trialling the concept at some entry ports. I received no answer to the question of whether they had proactively asked the BMA, the BDA and the Royal Colleges on the matter, but Sir Al Aynsley-Green, the Children&#146;s Commissioner, who was scathing about the idea in his foreword to the ILPA report, said that none of the professors of paediatric endocrinology to whom he had spoken were in favour of the use of X-rays, and he could not imagine any scenario in which dental X-rays might supplement other methods of age determination.</p>

<p><a name="070718113000273"></a>We recognise that procedures for age assessment are necessary to ensure that, as far as possible, children are treated as children, and adults who claim to be children are not. This is a problem facing every jurisdiction, and there is no best practice.</p>

This has been approved by the courts and is now being used by most SSDs, but the ILPA research showed that none had been given training on how to use it.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000275"></a>The way forward would be for the Government now to take powers to enact statutory guidelines by order, building on the experience since the Merton judgment in 2004, with the flexibility of being able to vary them from time to time as further experience may suggest. In this way, the process of age determination can be improved and standardised without returning to the unethical and inaccurate subjection of children to ionising radiation, which was abandoned by a Conservative Government more than 25 years ago. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="070718113000278"></a>We have to look very carefully at what the noble Lord has said. We must have procedures for age assessment. They have to be robust, safe, human-rights compliant and proportionate. Above all, they must ensure that those who seek to come here by pretending that they are not the age they say are screened out. It is not fair on children who wish to come here, if the system is abused. I wonder whether the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, or the Minister, can assist me in saying what the practice and procedure is elsewhere in the EU, and whether there is any proven practice that appears to be more successful than ours.</p>

We must ensure that children whom we would wish to enable to have the right to be here are not put in a position of being treated in a way that is injurious to their health, and we must not find that the system does not work.

Some years ago, just after the Ethiopian famine, I met with some of the survivors and I held some of the young babies in my arms. They were so different from children in the United Kingdom.

In Ethiopia&#151;not today&#151;and in other places such as Darfur, children do not have the nutrition and support that they have in the United Kingdom. So we come to how we determine a child&#146;s age. Do we do it from documentation? A child from that sort of area may have no documentation. A birth certificate could be a counterfeit. We do not know, so we have to look at another way.</p>

<p><a name="070718113000285"></a>In 2005, 2,965 child applicants for admission to the UK had their age accepted, but in 45 per cent of cases&#151;2,424 applicants&#151;there was a dispute about age. We suggest that an immediate assessment is not reliable or fair. When a child comes here, he is traumatised and vulnerable. His background is so difficult, and the new culture that he will experience in the UK is so vastly different from what he has had in the past that we must give him time to settle in. A continuous assessment should be made while the child is settling in the UK. If we put consideration of age on hold, we could have regional age assessment centres where skilled social workers and medical professionals could see how the child develops and could more reliably assess age.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000286"></a>We suggest that an immediate decision is not needed. We need to realise how sensitive this issue is and that that child needs support and love, which he may not have had in the past. As time goes on, the age of the child can be assessed. That might be more reliable, although I do not know whether it would be 100 per cent reliable because we look at people of different ages in our own House and say, &#147;Is he really 103?&#148;. Age differs, so we must take our time and not decide immediately. We should let the child settle down, and then skilled people will be able to make a fairer assessment.</p>

I certainly understand that there are concerns about proposals in our recent consultation paper, <I>Planning Better Outcomes and Support for Unaccompanied Asylum Seeking Children</I>. One of our proposals&#151;it is just a proposal&#151;is to make greater use of dental X-rays to assess the age of young asylum seekers where that is in doubt. I do not think that there is a great deal of argument&#151;</p>

I think it would be helpful if I set out the background. I do not think that there is much of an issue here about the importance of age determination, because there is evidence of very serious abuse of the asylum and support system by adults claiming to be children. I believe that all Members of the Committee would accept that that can lead to very serious child protection issues, as it can result in adults being placed in accommodation designed for children, with all the potential that that opens up for abuse. There are also cases of children having been incorrectly assessed as adults, and thus having been placed in adult accommodation, thereby placing them at possible risk. Both the Government and local authorities need to work together to improve age assessment procedures, which is precisely why we have been considering this proposal.</p>

<p><a name="070718113000296"></a>We remain of the view that a social worker&#146;s assessment of age, drawing on that person&#146;s professional experience in dealing with children, should remain the primary means of assessing age. However, we believe that a dental X-ray can be a useful additional tool in the overall decision-making process. As the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, has said, some local authorities already arrange a dental X-ray and subsequent report by an expert in the field to assist in their final decision. It is entirely up to the individual to decide whether he or she wishes to undergo such an X-ray. Nothing that we propose will

We do, however, wish to standardise the arrangements, so in a sense we agree in part with what the noble Lord says. We can then ensure that the procedures for obtaining informed consent are applied consistently.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000297"></a>X-rays cannot determine age absolutely precisely; indeed, no procedure can give that certainty. We do believe, however, that they can provide a better means of narrowing the range of possible ages than other techniques, and can thus assist the decision maker. It is true that any X-ray procedure involves some exposure to ionising radiation, but we have been advised that the risk of harm is extremely small. Most children, regardless of their immigration status, are likely to undergo dental X-rays as part of routine healthcare checks.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000298"></a>It is our policy, in the absence of any credible documentary evidence or other persuasive evidence to demonstrate the age claimed, to accept a social worker&#146;s assessment of age. This is widely supported by most stakeholders, including the main children&#146;s charities and, importantly, by refugee organisations. This amendment, if accepted, would make the operation of that policy very difficult. It would appear to mean that an immigration officer would not be able to take into account a social worker&#146;s assessment if it depended in any way on dental analysis. Equally, it would appear to prevent an individual from obtaining an expert opinion on his age through a dental X-ray. Therefore, it could work both ways.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000299"></a>The establishment of a code of practice to keep children safe from harm, which we debated on the first Committee sitting, will provide additional safeguards to those which will be included in the arrangements for dental X-ray. We are committed to finding ways to improve the current process for age assessments and to minimise the serious child protection issues that arise following incorrect assessments. Many EU member states, for example Denmark, France and the Netherlands&#151;I believe that I mentioned those countries at Question Time&#151;use dental examinations for the purposes of age assessment. However, there is variation between EU member states. We have commissioned a review of existing research in response to some claims that there might be ethnic variations in dental development. It is right that we should consider these findings and responses to the consultation before taking any further action.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000300"></a>I have dealt in part with the point raised about the accuracy or otherwise of dental X-rays. I explained that we have commissioned a further review. As for why the Government have changed their position on the use of X-rays since the 1981 report, the answer is twofold. First, the number of people claiming to be children has risen dramatically since 1981 because the level of claims for asylum has gone up dramatically. Although the general asylum intake figures have reduced in the past five or six years, the number claiming to be children has remained constant, at

Therefore, it is now, more than ever, vital to ensure that we have the right age assessment&#151;</p>

<p><a name="070718113000301"></a><b><a name="70718-gc0008.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="070718113000538"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> I think that the noble Lord gave figures for the years up to 2005. As he knows, the immigration statistics for 2006 are not yet published and are not due until August. It would be very useful if the noble Lord could give us the number of children whose age was disputed in 2006 and, if possible, in the months up to June 2007, because I believe that the numbers are reducing and that the 3,000 a year mentioned by the Minister in previous debates is no longer applicable.</p>

<p><a name="070718113000302"></a><b><a name="70718-gc0008.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="070718113000539"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I certainly undertake to find as current data as we possibly can. The noble Lord may be right; I do not know. It is likely that he is. But my point is that, given the criticality of age in the assessment process generally for consideration of asylum cases, it is right that we should have proper procedures in place. The heightened concern about child protection issues underpins that.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000303"></a>Further, it is right that we should explore the medical and technological advances made in the past 20 years, which have been mentioned, with a view that X-rays may be able to contribute to an overall holistic and more scientific approach to age assessment. That would be in everyone&#146;s interest. As I say, we have committed to review ethnic variation in the development of teeth. We have commissioned a leading ordontologist to research ethnic variation issues relating to tooth development. Of course, we will be willing to share the findings from that report with the Committee.</p>

<a name="70718-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000304"></a>A question was also asked about who we had consulted about the use of dental X-rays. As I have explained, we published a paper earlier in the year. The consultation period ended on 31 May and we are carefully considering the responses received. There have been more than 100, from a number of local authorities, NGOs, and children&#146;s and refugee organisations. The consultation paper included the proposals to use dental X-rays for the purposes of age assessment. Separately, officials have met with the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, the Healthcare Commission and the Department of Health. We have spent some time on this and are approaching the subject with considerable care. It is a serious issue, as we all appreciate. The age assessment issue is important for a number of reasons, not least child protection and making a proper assessment of entitlement to reside in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="070718113000305"></a><b><a name="70718-gc0008.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="070718113000540"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> First, there is no argument between us about the necessity for having as reliable a procedure for determining age as is technically and scientifically possible, while always bearing in mind that this is not an exact science. However you refine the procedures, there is always going to be a residue of children whose age is indeterminate, where one would suggest that the immigration authorities should give the benefit of the doubt. The consequences of a child being wrongly classified as an adult can be immensely

<a name="70718-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="070718113000306"></a>We are not aiming at perfection. The Minister will concede that nobody claims a great deal of accuracy for the assessment of age by dental X-rays, even within the populations of western Europe and North America. The techniques used&#151;the Tanner-Whitehouse atlases and the Greulich-Pile atlas, developed in the United States and imported into this country&#151;refer to well fed, middle-class American children. As my noble friend was trying to point out, when you are looking at populations of Ethiopian children, you have no idea whether the mean and standard deviation of a particular development in a child&#146;s skeletal or dental structure are the same as those in the host population. In spite of what the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, was saying to contradict my noble friend about paediatricians coming into the family courts and making age assessments of malnourished children in the United Kingdom, those would certainly not be applicable to populations, let us say, of Somali or Afghan children. You have no knowledge whatsoever of the mean and standard deviation of the dental and skeletal developments in those populations.</p>

As the Minister has said, the use of dental ionisation X-rays is just one part of the way in which an age assessment is made. It may be a useful part. It is right that we have had the debate today, from the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, to put in context how valuable or not that X-ray system may be. That is the important thing.</p>

I hope that that will be referred to the Royal College, which, when I last asked, was opposed to the use of X-rays, and so were the British Medical Association and the British Dental Association. The Minister said that 230 organisations responded to the consultation.</p>

Not long ago, when I asked the BMA, the BDA and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, they said that the use of ionising radiation for non-clinical purposes was not ethical.

I was not referring to dental X-rays; I was talking about the science of interpretation of medical evidence and trying to argue&#151;although not to the satisfaction of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury as I knew I could not&#151;that there is a variety of methods of providing medical interpretation of evidence. It is useful to have this debate because it is important to understand what methods are available to assess children&#146;s ages.

Meanwhile, I refer to the comments made by the Children&#146;s Commissioner in the foreword to the ILPA report, <I>When is a child not a child</I><I>?</I>. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="070718113000384"></a>&#147;Of serious concern to me is the Home Office&#146;s proposal that the assessment of skeletal maturity by x-rays of the teeth or skeleton be used routinely to determine &#145;age&#146;. I base my condemnation of this proposal on the fact that for 30 years I have been a full-time paediatric endocrinologist, that is, a specialist in the role of hormones in the mechanisms of growth and sexual maturation in children and young people. There is substantial normal variation in the speed with which young people attain sexual and skeletal maturity.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="070718113000385"></a>&#147;The proposed x-rays demand specialist interpretation, and it is naïve to argue that they can determine the child&#146;s chronological &#145;age&#146;&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="070718113000343"></a>and so on. That remark is made by an expert, and he reinforced it in the discussion which we had in the Committee Room upstairs last week. I imagine that that view would be reflected if the noble Lord cared to consult the Royal Colleges, the BMA, the BDA and so on. I hope he will do that.</p>

Before I finish, I want to challenge the noble Lord&#146;s assertion that there had been enormous advances in medical and technological assessment of age by the use of X-rays.

I am today publishing guidance that explains how the new role of TfL in the franchise specification, letting and management process under the Railways Act 2005, will work in practice.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="07071862000027"></a>There were over 6,000 responses to the consultation, the great majority highlighting concerns over the sustainability of biofuels. The Government have already indicated how they intend to strengthen the RTFO's environmental safeguards in the light of these concerns, as set out in a Written Ministerial Statement on 21 June (<I>Official Report, </I>cols. WS 45-46). The changes we proposed in that Statement put the UK at the international forefront of work to promote sustainable biofuels.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="07071862000028"></a>The Government have given careful consideration to the issues raised by stakeholders, and the document I have published today, summarises how we intend to take them into account in finalising the RTFO order which is due to be laid in Parliament in the autumn.</p>

The caseload forecasts are driven primarily by changes in the estimated recipient populations for other benefits to which entitlement to housing benefits is related. There are no direct assumptions made for changes in the take-up of housing benefits.

BiH's politicians need to reach agreement on police reform and achieve full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague so that BiH can sign its stabilisation and association agreement with the EU. Constitutional reform will also be necessary if BiH is to deliver effective governance for its citizens and carry out the reforms that the EU accession process will require. Over the past year, we regret that BiH's political leaders have not made more sustained efforts to work together constructively to move BiH closer towards the EU and NATO. We regularly express our concerns about the lack of political progress bilaterally, through the EU and in conjunction with the Office of the High Representative/EU Special Representative (EUSR). We welcome the recent appointment of Miroslav Lajcak as High Representative and EUSR.</p>

These annual service levels are expressed mainly in terms of units of dental activity, which measure courses of treatment according to their relative complexity. Dental providers who under-deliver by up to 4 per cent may carry this forward and make up the activity in the following year. Where a provider has delivered less than 96 per cent of the agreed annual service level, it is at the PCT's discretion whether the undelivered activity is carried forward to the following year or an appropriate proportion of the annual contract sum is refunded to the PCT. This is a matter for PCTs to decide locally in the light of individual circumstances, and their decisions are not collected or held centrally.</p>

We have seen Judge Melo's report and welcome the steps announced by President Arroyo in response to recommendations made in the report and are waiting to see how these measures are implemented. We also welcomed the visit by Philip Alston, UN special rapporteur on extra-judicial killings, to the Philippines in February and will encourage the Philippine Government to follow both his initial recommendations and those in his final report when it is published. President Arroyo has requested technical assistance from the EU to support the Philippine Government's efforts to address extra-judicial killings. The EU sent a needs assessment mission to the Philippines in June to identify what areas of technical assistance might be required. The UK supported the mission by providing a UK expert in witness protection and prosecutorial systems.</p>

However, we share the view expressed by UN special rapporteur Philip Alston that the number is much too high. As he also made clear, the problem of extra-judicial killings in the Philippines does not just affect left-wing activists. Political violence associated with the recent national elections led to the deaths of politicians from all parties, as well as supporters, innocent bystanders and election officials. Other groups who have been targeted include journalists, lawyers and judges, while in some towns there are allegations of vigilante death squads targeting criminals. Many of the killings are attributed to private actors, with motives allegedly including land and business disputes, political rivalry and the protection of criminal interests.</p>

In 2006, most people (around 99.9 per cent of the population) were already breathing air that complied with the limit values. In those areas where improvements in air quality can be made, local authorities are required to designate air-quality management areas under Section 83 of the Environment Act 1995 where air quality objectives are not being, or are unlikely to be, met. Around 200 local authorities have designated air quality management areas to date.</p>

<a name="70718w0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_95"></a><a name="070718112000238"></a>The department has made sustained efforts to identify and remove barriers to access to nicotine replacement therapies for smokers wishing to quit.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_96"></a><a name="070718112000239"></a>To this end, the department has worked with the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and the pharmaceutical industry and has revised the licensing rules on the use of NRT. This means that young people from 12 to 18 years of age, pregnant women, people with heart, kidney or liver disease and diabetics are now instructed that they can now use NRT and get it free on prescription from the National Health Service in line with the rest of the smoking population.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_99"></a><a name="070718112000242"></a>Although the best option is to quit smoking abruptly, if this is not possible, smokers may use some NRT products to cut down before stopping smoking altogether. In addition, some NRT products are also available to manage cravings in situations where smoking should be avoided such as:</p>
where second-hand smoke may damage others, especially children, eg in enclosed spaces such as private vehicles or in the home;before surgery; andon a flight or during hospital stay.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_100"></a><a name="070718112000243"></a>We expect the take-up of NRT to rise significantly following 1 July when the &#147;smoke-free&#148; law took effect in England, as it did in Scotland when &#147;smoke-free&#148; was introduced there last year.</p>
