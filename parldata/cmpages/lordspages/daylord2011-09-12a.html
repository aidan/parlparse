Local authorities should regard them as of great importance, because being local is the essence of the thing. As the author Alan Bennett said the other day, it is no good people having a library if they have to go on an expedition in order to access the books. Does the noble Baroness agree that the public libraries Act imposes a statutory duty on the Secretary of State-and therefore, I suggest, Ministers and not just officials-to ensure that local authorities provide an effective and efficient library service?</p>

The public libraries Act 1964, which the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, mentions, does say that there is a public duty to keep comprehensive and efficient libraries open. Of course, we know how important libraries are because we have the wonderful Library-even though it is private-here in the House of Lords, which is a treasured privilege. Most people understand that libraries are special places and not just facilities. They provide access to considerable electronic information as well as books.</p>

I declare my interest as executive councillor responsible for the public library service in the London Borough of Sutton, where no libraries have been proposed for closure. Would the Minister agree that public libraries are an extremely important community resource? In any discussions with library authorities and local authorities, will she urge them first to consider what other facilities can be provided in public libraries? Indeed, will she urge them to consider whether public libraries can be located in other facilities and their services extended far beyond simply the loan of books? These measures should be realised so that libraries are used far more effectively, as a first consideration, as a proper community resource.</p>

Libraries are a very important resource and could be used for other facilities. Every authority in England is required to provide a comprehensive and efficient library service under the Public Libraries and Museums Act, but it is for each authority to determine at local level how much it spends on libraries and how it manages to deliver that service to meet the needs of its library users, bearing in mind the resources available.</p>

The ability of libraries to reach out and be involved with communities means that they have a vital role in delivering the big society.

Over the past 10 years we have seen an increase in the number of people volunteering in libraries. Volunteers regularly help to deliver homework clubs for schoolchildren. They contribute to projects, they digitise items in library collections and they provide buddy support for people new to using computers. It is important to remember that authorities remain accountable to their communities for the changes they make, and that includes the use of volunteers.</p>

What it does is measure the improvement in mortality over a period and then assess the cost-effectiveness of that improvement, which is a very different thing. Yes, the NHS has made great strides in improving mortality rates, but that is the only metric that the report deals with. It completely ignores other measures of quality. It is also completely silent about anything that happened after 2005, so recent years are not covered.</p>

A Written Answer was published in <I>Hansard</I> recently that tracked the changes in productivity of the NHS between 1996 and 2008. He will know if he read it that there was a decrease in productivity over that period of around 3.1 per cent. The pressures on the NHS are increasing. In order for it to respond to the needs of the future, including an ageing population and the cost of new technologies, it needs to adapt to new ways of working that reduce cost pressures while delivering improved outcomes. The measures that are before Parliament seek to do just that.</p>

The difficulty with all these reports is comparing like with like, particularly with different health systems.

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="11091210000072"></a>Anybody with experience of development corporations, such as the London Docklands Development Corporation and other development corporations outside London, will recognise their hugely important role in urban regeneration in often very run-down areas. One essential characteristic that led to the success of these development corporations, not least the LDDC, was the provision that they had to be planning authorities and therefore had full authority over planning in their areas. In the 1980s this enabled my noble friend Lord Heseltine and my noble and learned friend Lord Howe of Aberavon to trigger what we must all agree has been the most amazing regeneration of what was then the almost derelict area of London docks. My role came later, as Secretary of State for the Environment, and with my late friend Nicholas Ridley, then Secretary of State for Transport, we were responsible for promoting both London City Airport and the Docklands Light Railway. These have transformed the Docklands area and indeed much of east London. Therefore, it is no surprise that the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, supported by the Greater London Assembly, has persuaded the Government to include mayoral development corporations in the Bill. This is what Chapter 2 of Part 7 of the Bill  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_506"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column 506</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is all about. As with all those who are concerned with the development and future of London, I warmly welcome most of this chapter but I have a few points to make.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="11091210000073"></a>I note in passing that the origin of this suggestion related to the Olympic legacy, for which these clauses will be of great value, but if it had been confined to the Olympic legacy, that would have made the Bill a hybrid bill. Therefore, the Government very wisely accepted that this proposal for development corporations in London should cover the whole of the area. Of course, they may not be confined to single boroughs, and indeed one of the attractions is that they could well cover an area that extends over more than one borough. The combination of this and the fact that they will be planning authorities in their own right has caused some anxieties on the part of the 33 London boroughs and the City of London. I remind the House that I have declared an interest at each stage that I am a joint president of London Councils.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="11091210000074"></a>There are two issues: first, whether the London boroughs should be represented on the mayoral development corporation boards, committees and sub-committees; secondly, what appears to be in the Bill an inadequate consultation of the boroughs on the formation and operation of a mayoral development corporation. I tabled the amendments in this group and I very much welcome the support of the Official Opposition in the name of the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie.</p>
<a name="time_9"></a>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="11091210000075"></a>My noble friends on the Front Bench have gone quite a long way to meet our concerns, and I will turn to that in a moment. The boroughs have these concerns because they are acutely sensitive to the possibility that there may be a conflict of interest between the ambitions of this, or indeed a future, mayor and the borough councils in which the mayor might propose an MDC. Councils have in most cases developed their local plans, and many will have secured much local support for those plans. If a proposed MDC failed to take proper account of those plans, or indeed cut right across them, this could give rise to serious disagreements. That is why this Bill needs to include measures hopefully to avoid this as far as possible, or to be able to deal with it if it should arise.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="11091210000076"></a>I will take the two points in turn. With regard to representation, our Amendment 98, which states that an MDC board should have at least one elected member from each council affected, seems to us to make an unanswerable point. Happily, my noble friend, with her Amendment 97, has met this point very satisfactorily, so when it comes to moving the amendments, I will not need to move Amendment 98. But Amendment 97 does not go quite far enough. A few moments ago I mentioned not only membership of the board, but also of the committees and sub-committees of the board, and as yet there is no provision to ensure borough representation on these. That is what my Amendment 101 is about: first, that there should be at least one elected borough representative on every committee and sub-committee; and, secondly, that if it is concerned with planning functions, it must draw half its membership from the London boroughs  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_507"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column 507</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>concerned. Why cannot this, too, be accepted by Ministers? Borough councils are responsible, elected bodies, which have a very real interest in what goes on in their areas. I would have thought that representation on the committees and sub-committees is an entirely reasonable thing to ask for.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="11091210000077"></a>It is so important that there should be wide consultation and a proper follow-up of the consultation. In the Bill, it is stated that when designating area and when exercising the MDC planning functions, the mayor has to consult a wide range of bodies, including the Greater London Assembly and the London boroughs. That, of course, is very welcome. However, in the event that comments are made by the Greater London Assembly, if the mayor disagrees he has to make a statement explaining why he disagrees with the Assembly. When one looks at the consultation for the boroughs, one sees that there is no such obligation. He does not actually have to make a statement explaining why he differs from the boroughs, and in my view, I cannot see why these should not be given equal weight. I had this amendment down before the recess, and I received a letter from my noble friend Lady Hanham, who suggested that should a borough's representations to the mayor not have been properly considered, it will have the option of escalating its concerns to the London Assembly.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="11091210000078"></a>I have to say, with great respect, that is just not good enough. Of course, for the most part, the boroughs have a very good relationship with the Greater London Assembly. But I do not think that it is appropriate that borough concerns, which have been the subject of consultation, should be addressed only if taken through the representatives of the regional government. The boroughs have a legitimate and distinct voice, and this should not be crowded out. Amendment 96 relates to MDC designation; it would ensure that following any comments by a London borough council on a proposed designation, if it contains any part of the proposed MDC and if the mayor did not accept, he would have to publish a statement of his reasons for non-acceptance. Amendment 103, which relates to the MDC planning functions, would also ensure that if the mayor did not accept the borough's view, he would have to publish a statement for non-acceptance. As he has to do that for the assembly, why should he not do so for the boroughs? My amendments simply put the boroughs on an equal footing to the London Assembly.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="11091210000079"></a>We believe that these amendments are wholly reasonable, should be uncontroversial and are entirely in keeping with the legitimate role that the London boroughs have in representing and shaping their communities. These are very reasonable amendments. I beg to move.</p>

We thank the Government for responding to at least one of the amendments, which means that the noble Lord will not have to introduce that one. The issues, as the noble Lord has explained, seem to be extremely straightforward and clear-cut. The consultation simply seeks for London boroughs parity with what happens to the London Assembly and for them not to have to go through the indirect route for the reasons that the noble Lord has  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_508"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column 508</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>explained and to make sure that there is fair representation. The Government have recognised that there should be representation for the boroughs on MDC boards. It seems a natural and reasonable extension to that that there should be representation on committees and sub-committees. Having said that, I fully support the amendments tabled by the noble Lord.</p>

<p><a name="st_76"></a>
<a name="11091210000081"></a><b><a name="110912-0001.htm_spnew73"></a><a name="11091210000434"></a>Lord Palmer of Childs Hill:</b> My Lords, as regards the mayoral development areas, reference is made to consultation with a number of bodies, including the Greater London Authority or local councils. But consultation is different in the minds of different people. In local government, we have seen many consultations, the results of which have been ignored. It worries one that a London borough may be only one part of the decision-making process and may only be consulted.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="11091210000082"></a>In particular, the government amendment refers to local borough councils having a "relevant" interest if the mayoral development area in any way impinges on the area of that local borough. The boundaries of London boroughs do not fit neatly into developments. For example, the Brent Cross development, which was built more than 30 years ago, is expanding, with which I agree. It is right on the borders of the boroughs of Barnet, Camden, Brent and Harrow. It seems to me that when this situation arises in the future, "relevant" local authorities should be those that have an interest and are affected by the proposed mayoral development areas, and not only those where the mayoral development area would be situated within that local borough. I invite the Minister to consider whether the word "relevant" is correct in this case and whether adjoining local boroughs should also be in some way incorporated in this Bill.</p>

I thank my noble friend the Minister for the moves that have been made to address some of the legitimate concerns put forward at the previous stage. Having said that, my noble friend Lord Jenkin of Roding eloquently put the case for further consideration of some of the minor details-some of which are not so minor-in clarifying how this will work. Rightly or wrongly, there is suspicion among leaders of London boroughs about the risk of the mayor imposing policies on areas of London. Further safeguards and assurances would be desirable in that respect.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="11091210000085"></a>The other brief point I wish to make is that, as my noble friend Lord Jenkin said, recourse to the London Assembly, with all great respect to that body, is not a fully local response. In the Bill we already have to contend with the fact that regional government is continuing in London and that the local element of the Bill is somewhat deficient in London. Geographically elected members of the London Assembly represent quite large areas-less local than London boroughs-and are less urgently concerned through wards with local

The London Assembly Members who are elected under proportional systems do not have that kind of local connection.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="11091210000086"></a>I hope that my noble friend, in considering the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, will tell us that he will be able to consider further the noble Lord's points before the next stage.</p>

<a name="11091210000087"></a><b><a name="110912-0001.htm_spnew76"></a><a name="11091210000437"></a>Earl Attlee:</b> My Lords, this group of amendments addresses concerns raised about borough councils' representation on an MDC's board and committees. I am grateful for all noble Lord's contributions. We have thought carefully about this and have tabled government amendments.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="11091210000088"></a>Amendment 97 would ensure that a borough council, including for this purpose the Common Council of the City of London, whose area forms part of an MDC, will have an automatic seat on the board by requiring that the mayor must exercise his power to appoint members to the MDC so as to secure that the members of an MDC include at least one elected member of each relevant council. Such appointments will still be subject to the same safeguards as other appointments. Amendment 99 would allow the mayor to remove a borough council member from an MDC's board if that member ceases to be a borough member and the mayor wishes to appoint another member of that borough in the original member's place. Amendment 102 is a consequential amendment to rules about the validity of proceedings and simply ensures that the absence of at least one elected member of each affected borough council will not affect the validity of an MDC's proceedings.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="11091210000089"></a>Amendment 100 removes the stipulation that the majority of members of a committee or sub-committee of an MDC must be members of the MDC. These are significant concessions. My noble friends have suggested in Amendment 98 that one-sixth of the members must be from the boroughs, but that is not necessary. For example, with the proposed Olympic Park Legacy Corporation the four borough members would be likely to constitute rather more than one-sixth of the board. On that basis I ask my noble friends to withdraw their amendment. The House may recall the amendment the noble Baroness, Lady Grey-Thompson, tabled for Committee, which was not debated. That sought to provide that an MDC's committees and sub-committees should not, as is currently the case, require a majority of MDC members. I am delighted to say that we have brought forward Amendment 100, which secures the aims of the noble Baroness.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="11091210000090"></a>Amendment 101, tabled by my noble friend Lord Jenkin of Roding and the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, also relates to membership of committees and sub-committees but seeks to prescribe membership. It states that there should be at least one elected borough representative on both committees and sub-committees from those boroughs whose areas are affected by a designated mayoral development area, and, where those committees are concerned with planning, that at least half of the membership should comprise representatives from affected boroughs. I hope the House will agree that the existing provisions regarding committees and sub-committees, bolstered by Amendment 100, will  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_510"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column 510</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>give an MDC maximum flexibility over the make-up of its committees and sub-committees. I hope that deals with the point raised by my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway. For example, an MDC will be able to appoint one or more relevant borough council members to its planning committee and, should it wish to do so, have a majority of non-MDC members on that committee.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="11091210000091"></a>I turn now to Amendments 96 and 103 which address a borough's comments on, first, the proposed designation of a mayoral development area and, secondly, designation of an MPC as the local planning authority. It is clearly right that an affected borough council must be consulted on both these issues, just as it is right to offer the opportunity to the London Assembly, relevant Members of the other place and other statutory consultees as the Bill provides. It is also the case that the mayor will be obliged to consult affected borough councils and other statutory consultees were he to propose that an MDC should offer business rate discounts. The Bill provides that, should comments be made by the London Assembly and the mayor not accept those comments, he is obliged to publish a statement giving reasons for that non-acceptance. Amendments 96 and 103 would extend that requirement to comments of the borough councils. However, there is no need to do this. As I have said, an affected borough council must be consulted by the mayor, so it could make its views known to him by that route. But a borough council could also make representations to its London Assembly constituency member who, in turn, could feed those views to the Assembly as a whole, as a result of which the Assembly could, if it wished, relay those representations and any of its own to the mayor. I suggest that this is a sufficient level of scrutiny.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="11091210000092"></a>I would ask noble Lords to withdraw their amendments and accept Amendments 97, 99, 100 and 102 in their place.</p>

That is not a proper or, indeed, a dignified treatment of independent elected authorities which have made substantial comments on the mayor's plans. I really am quite disappointed about that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="11091210000094"></a>I understand the point made by my noble friend on the question of representation, and in particular on the question of numbers. What we are asking for is that they should at least have representation on committees and sub-committees, but all my noble friend has been able to say so far is that it would give maximum flexibility if this were not in the Bill because there is nothing to prevent the mayor making sure that there are such representatives. However, it does not oblige him to do so; the Bill merely says that this can be done. So I have to say that I am a bit disappointed.</p>

The boroughs are concerned because while at the moment no other mayoral development corporations are planned beyond the Olympic Park Legacy Corporation, there will be, so we need to guard against the possibility of there being a serious conflict of interest, and the Bill ought to provide a proper machinery for dealing with that.

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="11091210000098"></a>The government amendment seeks to enable the greatest sharing of back-office services across the GLA group. The mayor has an ambitious shared services programme for the GLA group utilising existing powers under the Greater London Authority Act 1999, which enables the GLA and its functional bodies to share administrative, professional and technical services with each other.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="11091210000099"></a>We are conscious that there are several legislative gaps in the existing legislation, with a number of bodies in the GLA's ambit not covered, potentially restricting further opportunities for savings and efficiencies. That is why, following discussions with the mayor, we introduce the new amendment as part of the London reform package to extend the powers to three further statutory entities; namely, the Commissioner for the Metropolitan Police, the London Transport Users' Committee and the London Pensions Fund Authority.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="11091210000100"></a>The amendment also gives the Secretary of State the power to add other persons or bodies performing public functions in London, other than wholly national bodies, to the list of entities covered by Section 401A, following consultation with the relevant person or body. This will allow the inclusion of unique bodies such as the Lee Valley Regional Park Authority or the Museum of London, if there is an appetite in London for their inclusion. We will be discussing further the extent of any order with the GLA, the boroughs and other relevant partners over the autumn.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="11091210000101"></a>Finally, Amendment 104 amends Schedule 22 to classify a mayoral development corporation as a local authority for the purposes of the Local Authorities (Goods and Services) Act 1970. This will allow a mayoral development corporation to share administrative services and supply goods to local authorities on the same basis as other functional bodies, again in support of the mayor's shared service agenda. I therefore beg to move.</p>

<a name="11091210000105"></a><b><a name="110912-0001.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="11091210000447"></a>The Commercial Secretary to the Treasury (Lord Sassoon):</b> My Lords, I shall now repeat a Statement that has been made in another place by my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Statement is as follows:</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="11091210000106"></a>"Mr Speaker, I should like to make a Statement on the final report of the Independent Commission on Banking. The report is an impressive piece of work-broad in scope, incisive in its analysis and clear in its recommendations. The commission has done what we asked it to do. It has come up with an answer to the question of how Britain can be the home of successful international banks that lend to families and businesses without exposing British taxpayers to the massive costs of those banks failing. Frankly, it is a question that should have been asked and answered a decade ago.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="11091210000107"></a>We should all thank Sir John Vickers and the other members of the commission-Clare Spottiswoode, Martin Taylor, Bill Winters and Martin Wolf-for a job well done. But this commission and this report have not come about by accident. It was set up by this coalition Government to learn the lessons of what went so catastrophically wrong: a decade long debt-fuelled boom that ended in a dramatic financial crisis, a deep recession and a debt overhang that is still holding back our economy; a regulatory system that totally failed to spot enormous imbalances building up and proved incapable of dealing with the crisis when it first broke; and, most importantly in the context of this report, huge global banks that turned out to be "too big to fail", so that taxpayers were called upon for many billions of pounds in order to prevent a financial  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_514"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column 514</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>meltdown. We still do not know, and may not know for many years, how much of that money will ever be recovered, despite irresponsible promises made at the time that not a penny would be lost.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="11091210000108"></a>We are fundamentally changing the system of regulation and tackling the debts but this bailout for banks is the element of the crisis that has, justifiably, caused the most anger. It is an affront both to fairness and to the very principles of a market economy. It is not available to any other sector of the economy, and nor should it be. It breaks the principle that those who take risks should face the consequences of their actions and, as a result, it played an important role in encouraging the excessive risk taking that caused this crisis.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="11091210000109"></a>Of course, taxpayer bailouts did not only happen in this country. An international regulatory response to the crisis is now emerging, with the new Basel rules and the anticipated new additional requirements for systemic banks, but here in Britain we cannot rely only on the international reform process to make our banking system safe. The scale of the challenge we face and the risk for our taxpayers is on a different scale from most other countries.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="11091210000110"></a>The balance sheet of our banking system is close to 500 per cent of our GDP, compared to just over 100 per cent in the US and around 300 per cent in Germany and France. Only Iceland, Ireland and Switzerland had larger banking systems relative to their GDP, and they have now all taken action that goes well beyond new international standards. As the report says,</p>
<ul><a name="11091210000322"></a>'part of the challenge for reform is to reconcile the UK's position as an international financial centre with stable banking'.</ul>
<p><a name="11091210000111"></a>This is what I have called 'the British dilemma'-how to remain a successful global centre of finance without asking taxpayers to bear unacceptable risks or put the broader economy at risk. We set up the Banking Commission to help us solve the British dilemma. Let me set out its recommendations and how we propose to respond.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="11091210000112"></a>The first proposal is the introduction of a ring-fence around retail banking. The Government have welcomed this recommendation in principle. As the report says,</p>
<ul><a name="11091210000323"></a>'the objective of such a ring-fence would be to isolate those banking activities where continuous provision of service is vital to the economy and to a bank's customers'.</ul>
<p><a name="11091210000263"></a>In other words, the provision of key domestic retail banking services, such as taking deposits from individuals and small businesses or providing them with overdrafts. The central benefit of a ring-fence is not to end large universal banking groups but to make them more easily resolvable in a crisis. The costs should fall on shareholders and the wholesale debt holders, not small depositors or taxpayers. A successful ring-fence will be able to ensure the continuation of vital payment services that are crucial to preventing an economic collapse. This directly addresses the perceived implicit taxpayer guarantee which is at the heart of the too-big-to-fail problem.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="11091210000113"></a>The commission has also proposed a more flexible ring-fence. In terms of its scope, it says that,</p>
<ul><a name="11091210000324"></a>'domestic retail banking services should be inside the ring fence, global wholesale/investment banking should be outside, and the provision of straightforward banking services to large domestic non-financial companies can be in or out'.</ul>



<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_515"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column 515</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="11091210000114"></a>Many will see this as sensible and it will reduce inefficiencies resulting from any mismatch between customer deposits and business lending within an individual bank.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="11091210000115"></a>On the strength-or height, if you like-of the ring-fence, it recommends that the retail subsidiary should have what it calls 'economic independence'. In other words, it should meet regulatory requirements on a stand-alone basis and its relationships with other parts of the group should be arm's length and regulated in the same way as relationships with third parties. A great deal of detailed work will now be required to see how that principle can be put into practice.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="11091210000116"></a>Secondly, the commission has also made important recommendations to ensure that banks have bigger cushions to withstand losses. These are that the large retail ring-fenced banks should have equity capital of at least 10 per cent. It also recommends that retail and other activities of large UK banking groups should have primary loss-absorbing capacity of at least 17 per cent to 20 per cent, including long-term debt that can be written off, so that, unlike last time, both shareholders and bondholders bear losses, not the taxpayer. Within this, it recommends some regulatory discretion about the composition of this loss-absorbing capacity. Again, many will see that as sensible.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="11091210000117"></a>Thirdly, the commission recommends the introduction of depositor preference. I repeat again that the Financial Services Compensation Scheme covers 100 per cent of eligible deposits up to the new European limit of €100,000. The depositor preference proposals would bolster this scheme by ensuring that other bank creditors are subject to losses first when a bank goes bust, minimising the cost to the FSCS and ultimately to the taxpayer.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="11091210000118"></a>The fourth set of recommendations relates to competition in the banking sector. They have not got as much attention as the other recommendations, but they are as important to families and businesses. I agree with the commission that the best way to ensure a reliable and affordable supply of lending to our families and businesses is through competition. The collapse of banks such as Bradford &amp; Bingley and the merger of Lloyds and HBOS, welcomed by the previous Government, mean that there is too little competition and switching bank accounts remains difficult. I welcome the recommendations to change this. On the divestment of the Lloyds branches, the commission has said that the key test should be the emergence of a strong and effective new challenger bank. I agree that that would be very much in our country's interest.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="11091210000119"></a>Those are the recommendations. Let me now turn to the implications for the wider economy, the implications for Britain as a global financial centre and the timetable for the Government's response. The report is clear that the right solution, implemented properly and to the right timetable, will help our economy, not hinder it. Let us remember that the mistakes made by poorly regulated banks ended up costing the economy many many billions of pounds. The commission notes that some of its recommendations could reduce the profitability of some banks' investment banking operations. That is largely because we would be removing the subsidy that comes from any perceived implicit taxpayer guarantee. We should not confuse the interests of bank shareholders  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_516"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column 516</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with those of British taxpayers. It is also critical that reforms of this kind do not lead to a worsening of credit conditions in the economy. Indeed, Vickers says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="11091210000276"></a>'Banks with more robust capital, together with the creation of the ring-fence, would provide a secure and stable framework for the supply of credit to businesses and households in the UK economy'.</p>

<p><a name="11091210000264"></a>Indeed, the commission believes that its proposals could help to rebuild the culture of relationship banking that has been so sadly lost over the past decade and would help banks understand the credit needs of their customers better.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="11091210000120"></a>Let me turn to the UK's role as a global centre for finance and banking. I will be very clear. This Government want Britain and the City of London to be the pre-eminent global centre for banking and finance. We want universal banks headquartered here, with all the advantages that that brings. The Vickers report explicitly addresses this issue, and for those investment banks with credible recovery plans, it has not recommended higher equity requirements than those agreed at an international level. This would mean that the global investment banking operations of UK banks can continue to be as competitive as any in the world. We will continue as a Government to keep the City as a whole internationally competitive, as was clear last week when we welcomed, with the Chinese Government, the development of the offshore renminbi market in London.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="11091210000121"></a>Let me end by explaining to the House how we will now take forward the commission's report. We welcome the recommendations in principle. They would require far-reaching and complex changes. John Vickers is the first to say that they cannot be delivered overnight. The detailed work will start immediately. We will consult on the costs and benefits of the most appropriate way to implement these changes. We will provide a response by the end of this year, so that there is no uncertainty hanging over the industry.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="11091210000122"></a>We will legislate in this Parliament to put the needed changes into law. We will consider which changes can be in the existing Financial Services Bill and which will need a new Bill, and we will discuss these changes with international partners to ensure consistency with international agreements and EU law. We will follow the advice of the independent commission and ensure that any changes to the British banking system are fully completed by 2019. This is a sensible timetable that fits with the international regime. As Vickers himself said this morning,</p>
<ul><a name="11091210000325"></a>'short-termism got us into this mess and we need long-termism to build a more stable system for the future'.</ul>
<a name="110912-0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="11091210000123"></a>The question of how Britain can be the home of successful, global banks that lend to British families and businesses but do not have to be bailed out by British taxpayers should have been answered a decade ago, but it was not even asked-and that failure means this country is still paying the price for that failure. Billions of pounds have been spent and hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost as a result. It is this Government who set up the banking commission-not just to ask the questions but to provide the answers. Today represents a decisive moment when we take a step to a new banking system that works for Britain. I commend this Statement to the House".</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="11091210000124"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.</p>

<a name="11091210000125"></a><b><a name="110912-0001.htm_spnew86"></a><a name="11091210000448"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for repeating the Statement made in another place earlier this afternoon. Of course, we are grateful to all who contributed to the Vickers report, particularly the chairman. After all, this is probably the most important report to come before this Government during their time in office. Therefore, it is important that we recognise the points that the Minister made about the time necessary for full consideration of the important issues involved. However, if we have a clear anxiety about the Government's response-I recognise that it is an initial response at this stage-it concerns whether it has the urgency which the nation demands. The report proposes significant reforms to an industry that contributed substantially to a huge rise in job losses and caused great uncertainty among our fellow citizens. Hundreds of thousands are seeing their living standards decline. At the root of this is the catastrophe in the financial sector that we have lived through.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="11091210000126"></a>Of course, the report is concerned with the UK position, UK banks and the United Kingdom Government's response and contribution to finding a solution. However, I hope that the Minister will give greater reassurance as regards the urgency of taking the earliest possible action. I am not clear why the Government have not indicated that they look upon the financial legislation before both Houses as a vehicle for at least establishing a basic framework of the response. That would at least translate fine words into early and clear action. That is the very least that we can ask of the Government in response to a situation which has been so catastrophic for our nation.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="11091210000127"></a>My second point, in somewhat lower key, concerns the international dimension. Of course, we are concerned about United Kingdom legislation but it is important that the Government, particularly the Chancellor, should recognise that the solution to the financial problems which face banking in this country has to be consonant with the solutions which are put forward and engaged in by all the major economies in the world. That is why it is so important that the Chancellor should recognise the international role which he has to play in respect of the reform of the world's financial provisions, particularly regulation.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="11091210000128"></a>Thirdly, I hope that the Minister will not dwell too much on the past.</p>

However, I hope the noble Lord will recognise that it occurred not just in this country but constituted an international financial failure. Regulation failed in the United States of America and other countries. That international dimension is crucial to finding a solution. If the Minister merely looks on this as an opportunity for point scoring and berating the previous Government, that would ill fit the present situation and the problems that we all face, to say nothing of the fact that he would have to quote chapter and verse those senior Conservative politicians who, during the build up to the events of 2007-08, warned of the impending difficulties

If evidence of that kind emerges at any stage, I for one would be glad to see it. However, I would be amazed if it existed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="11091210000131"></a>Today's Statement provides an opportunity to give a brief response to a fundamentally important problem. I am keeping my remarks brief confident in the fact that we shall have another opportunity to debate this matter on Thursday of this week. I hope the Government and the Minister appreciate that we shall have a greater opportunity to deploy our arguments in that debate after we have fully examined the Vickers report and the Government's initial response to it. I look forward to that debate, as I am sure does the Minister.</p>

I am pleased that he recognises the importance of this report; but how he has nerve to stand up and tell this Government that we should be addressing the report with urgency, I simply do not know. I do not want to make cheap points this afternoon when there are much more important things to say.</p>

This is important because it exemplifies what this Government are doing and what the previous Government did not do. There were 18 months between the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the general election in which work such as that which we commissioned could have been commissioned by the previous Government. There were two and a half years after the appalling events following the collapse of Northern Rock in which the previous Government could have looked at the structure of banking, but they did nothing. There were more than 10 years in which they presided over the debt-fuelled boom that led to this disaster that we are now mopping up. So I really do not think that we need lectures about urgency on the follow-up. We are taking the timetable suggested by the independent commission, and that will be our guide.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="11091210000135"></a>I apologise if my droning on with a 2,000-word Statement means that not every sentence or paragraph can be picked up. However, as the noble Lord asked about the use of the existing Financial Services Bill and the international dimension, I remind him that both points are addressed in the same paragraph of my right honourable friend's Statement, which I will read out again:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="11091210000277"></a>"We will consider which changes can be in the existing Financial Services Bill and which will need a new Bill, and we will discuss these changes with international partners to ensure consistency with international agreements and EU law".</p>

<p><a name="11091210000265"></a>So I completely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, on these two points, which is why my right honourable friend has addressed them in his Statement. I look forward to any more constructive thoughts that he and his noble friends may be able to come up with as we go forward discussing these very important matters.</p>

We also welcome the degree of urgency with which the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, wishes the report to be implemented, not least because some of us had to put up with withering scorn from the Labour Benches during the previous Parliament when we suggested exactly the proposals that are now in this report.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="11091210000137"></a>The report says that while the full implementation of the proposals might take a number of years, there is much to be gained by moving quickly to set the framework in place so that the banks know what they are up against. The Minister has already mentioned that the Government will look at the extent to which the Financial Services Bill might be a vehicle for doing that. As we now have a Joint Select Committee on the Bill, of which I have the privilege to be a member under the chairmanship of Peter Lilley MP, would he accept that this offers Parliament a golden opportunity to take evidence quickly on the principal issues that the Vickers report raises and to move with some determination? I am sure that the vast bulk of rule-making that will be required to implement this series of proposals will not need primary legislation but will need FSA regulation or secondary regulation, and that the legislative framework in primary legislation should be relatively short and straightforward.</p>

We will work as hard and as fast as we can now to take forward consideration of the detail. As I have stressed, we have accepted the recommendations of the report in principle, but there is a lot of potential devil in the detail and we need to do a full cost-benefit assessment. Indeed, we need to work through what would be appropriate to introduce into the Financial Services Bill and what would need a stand-alone Bill. I have no idea how the committee may want to proceed, but it now has the Vickers report in front of it and we will get on with sorting out all these issues as quickly as possible. However, we should not underestimate the amount of work for officials and the amount of consultation needed to get the detail right.</p>

I would like to clarify this with the noble Lord. He talked about some of the points and he repeated part of the long Statement about what will happen, but could he clarify how soon he expects the banks to be in a position to do the kind of reform recommended in this report, which is so strongly supported by the Chancellor? Is not the real current danger that, if the eurozone banks collapse, as, regretfully, seems all too likely-recently the Chancellor said that that would not just be disastrous for Europe but for us as well-we could be bailing out banks long before 2019, whether we are in the eurozone or not and we may have to bail some out in the very near future? How would that fit  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_520"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column 520</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in with the reform in the short term that will enable the actions which are strongly recommended by the report to be carried out?</p>

<p><a name="st_99"></a>
<a name="11091210000140"></a><b><a name="110912-0001.htm_spnew95"></a><a name="11091210000457"></a>Lord Sassoon:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, for welcoming the Statement. Clearly, there is a series of different sorts of recommendations in the report. Some of them relate to ring-fencing and the adequacy of capital, where the date of 2019 fits in with the move to implementation of Basel III. So there is a clear logic for making sure that the construct that we are putting in place here is targeted at the same date as the related international recommendations in the same area. On the other hand, of course there are recommendations in areas such as competition, connected, for example, with the ongoing disposal of Lloyd's branches, where the timetable is rather different and where the commission, quite rightly, is looking to see action on a shorter timescale. We need to look at the pacing of some of the reforms in relation to 2019, that being the date of Basel III implementation, and others in relation to the individual merits of the case. That is the approach we will take.</p>

<p><a name="st_100"></a>
<a name="11091210000141"></a><b><a name="110912-0001.htm_spnew96"></a><a name="11091210000458"></a>Lord Higgins:</b> This is certainly a massive and comprehensive report which is rightly welcomed by the Government. I have two questions. First, there is certainly a point of view which says that the right answer is to have complete separation of investment and retail banking. The commission has not come down in favour of that but in favour of ring-fencing. The danger is that there are loopholes in the ring-fence. Could my noble friend say in what circumstances resources might flow from one side of the ring-fence to the other, thereby continuing, albeit perhaps in a more limited form, the dangers which arise if there is a degree of connection between investment and retail banking?</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="11091210000142"></a>Secondly, as far as timing is concerned, I understand the point my noble friend is making about Basel. However, it has also been suggested that, given the state of the economy, it would be dangerous to implement these changes too quickly, because it would inhibit the continued recovery. Would my noble friend agree that it is right to review that aspect of timing as we go along, and not set in concrete the idea that we should wait until 2019 before going ahead with the ring-fencing proposals?</p>

<p><a name="st_101"></a>
<a name="11091210000143"></a><b><a name="110912-0001.htm_spnew97"></a><a name="11091210000459"></a>Lord Sassoon:</b> My Lords, I regret that I may fail to satisfy my noble friend Lord Higgins in my answers. On his first point about the design of the ring-fence, and whether there are loopholes, the commission has been quite clear in relation to one or two major structural elements of the ring-fence. It has recommended that discretion should be allowed to the banks as to whether the lending business to large industrial companies should be on one side of it or the other. That will be the first of a number of detailed issues that need to be looked at in the design work. I would not wish to pre-empt that work, other than noting that my noble friend's question of loopholes and how they might come about will be, I am sure, very much in the minds of those doing the detailed work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="11091210000144"></a>On the speed of implementation, I do think it is important-as it was with the Basel III work, and the European directive that flows with it-that the banking industry, taxpayers and all those who deal with the banks have a clear understanding of what the end position will be. There is a separate question as to what the appropriate implementation timetable will be. I am sure that the commissioners thought very carefully about this when they put forward the date of 2019. I repeat that-as my noble friend will know-it is same date as the Basel implementation. I am sure they thought about that very hard.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="11091210000146"></a>I congratulate my noble friend and the Chancellor on the way in which they have gripped this difficult subject, by appointing the Vickers commission, which has done an outstanding job. Some us may not agree with all of the report, but it is a careful and sensible analysis. Some people have argued that this will damage the competitiveness of the City of London, but does my noble friend not agree that the City of London will benefit from having certainty? The fact that the Chancellor has the courage to take this on will help with the process and help our competitiveness.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="11091210000147"></a>I suggest that if my noble friend is thinking of giving a Christmas present to the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, he might buy him a copy of the right honourable Alistair Darling's memoirs, in which he will find why it is not a good idea to look to the previous Government's behaviour in this area. May I remind the House that it was the previous Government who gave Sir Fred Goodwin his knighthood for services to banking?</p>

It is a fine piece of work that has been done under a lot of time pressure. The commissioners have developed the analysis very considerably from their interim report, and I share my noble friend's conclusion that by coming out now with these reforms to strengthen our banking system, we will place our banks and the City of London in an even better position to compete globally, as the Government want them to be able to do.</p>

However, perhaps the Minister will accept that the seriousness of the situation is illustrated in this way. Section 6 of the Theft Act 1968 defines theft as occurring in circumstances where a person uses the property of another as if that property were his to dispose of, irrespective of the rights of the other. In that way, the revelations of 2008 show quite clearly that in many instances there was moral theft, if not actual legal left.</p>

On the question of moral theft, I look to the Bishops' Benches for guidance. The noble Lord makes the serious point that these events were deeply shocking and needed the sort of serious response that the Government and the commission have given. That is why we will drive through the recommendations that we accepted in principle today.</p>

I particularly welcome the flexibility around the ring-fence, which is a very intelligent response to the dilemma of separation that clearly reflects the reality of modern Treasury management. That is greatly to be welcomed. However, given that a huge component of the problems that we have experienced concerns the misallocation and mispricing of risk, and the failure of regulation, will the Minister say whether, in line with the changes that the commission set out today and that Basel III will introduce, the Government have any proposals for further strengthening the regulatory framework in this country? Banking systems in other countries such as Canada did not fail. I declare an interest: I worked for a Canadian bank in that period. One of the distinguishing features of the Canadian system was the strength of regulation. Are there any plans for further strengthening the regulatory framework in this country?</p>

Clearly it has thought about the arguments that have been put over recent months. In respect of the failure of regulation, on which I completely agree with her, the overhaul of the regulatory structure, which is coming forward in the Financial Services Bill, is very significant. It puts the primary responsibility for looking at the risk in the entire system where it ought to be: that is, with the central bank. That is a fundamental change. The new Financial Policy Committee of the Bank of England is up in effective shadow mode, ahead of the legislation going through. It is able to address-and is addressing-risk issues as we speak, and I am sure that it will take note of whether there is anything further in the report that it ought to pick up on.</p>

However, I am sure that the Minister will agree that those who have suffered the most from the failure of the banks and the depth of the economic crisis that followed have been among the most vulnerable and disadvantaged, along with the smallest businesses. Would he be willing, as he looks to introduce a new bank that will provide more high street competition, to encourage banking services that will address the micro and the very small business, and which will reach out to the economically disadvantaged, who currently get a basic bank account offered with ill grace and very few services?</p>

That is why I welcome the discussion in the report about issues concerning the ability of individuals to switch accounts. There are important recommendations about the Lloyds Bank disposals, which make the point that this is not just a numbers game, of counting the branches that must be disposed of, but about creating another competitor out there. Therefore the report addresses critical aspects of the challenges that she poses, but in addition-whether it is looking at mutual models, credit unions or all the other aspects of a rich and varied banking system-there are significant other channels which the Government continue to address.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="11091210000156"></a>I would like to make three points while generally welcoming the recommendations. First, I remember over 10 years ago, following what I believed then to be the mistaken collapse of Barings, talking to the then Governor of the Bank of England about changes to the lender-of-last-resort doctrine, which had stood this country's banking system in very good order for nearly 100 years. It changed by it being said that it was available only to larger banks, walking straight into the moral hazard problem whereby very large banks were of the belief that they could not be allowed to fail, which was the case, and smaller banks were not able-if there were a banking run-to get lender-of-last-resort support. That is why a whole lot of them wound up. It is very important in achieving competition that, broadly, the lender-of-last-resort doctrine is restored to what it was.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="11091210000157"></a>Secondly, I am slightly worried that increasing banks' capital may be brought forward too quickly. I draw noble Lords' attention to the very convincing writings of Professor Tim Congdon to the effect that if we increase capital requirements very speedily, we will end up shrinking the money supply, which is the last thing we want to do when the country is trying to struggle its way out of recession.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="11091210000158"></a>Finally, one banking system, Lebanon's, escaped all the problems because the governor of the central bank of Lebanon had the wisdom to spot what was coming, to warn the banks and to keep them out of it. There is nothing more important than having a really good central bank governor who actually knows what is going on and blows the whistle in good time.</p>

We believe that it is right that Ministers continue to have such a power once the LDA is abolished. Through the London reforms in this Bill, the GLA will be gaining significant new powers and responsibilities, including activities from the LDA, enabling London itself to meet the strategic challenges facing the capital.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="11091210000164"></a>There may be instances in future where it makes sense for the mayor to play an active role in the delivery of national programmes, through a power of delegation, to ensure that these programmes can be better tailored to London's specific circumstances. However, we are conscious of the concerns expressed in the other place about this power and the risk that it could marginalise the role of London boroughs, and of the amendments tabled in Committee by my noble friends Lord True and Lord Jenkin, which we did not have time to discuss. In response to these concerns, we are proposing through government Amendment 105 to require a Minister to consult London boroughs and the London Assembly before the use of this power to delegate functions. This will ensure an opportunity for debate and dialogue within London about the appropriateness of any proposed delegation of a ministerial function to the mayor prior to the delegation being made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="11091210000165"></a>Amendment 106, which was tabled by my noble friend Lord True, would go further than this by requiring a Minister to consult boroughs specifically about whether the function could be more appropriately and effectively conducted at a more local level and then to lay a Statement before Parliament if boroughs believe that they are better placed than the mayor to undertake the function. While I fully understand my noble friend's reasoning, I do not believe that such detailed stipulation is necessary. It should be readily apparent from the statutory consultation whether boroughs have concerns about the mayor exercising a function that they are better placed to undertake. If the function was of sufficient importance, one could see Members of both Houses wanting to raise the issue with the relevant Minister.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="11091210000166"></a>I reassure my noble friend that this Government have striven to ensure broad consensus between the mayor, the Assembly and the boroughs about the future direction of London's governance and, if I may say so, it is exemplified by the reforms in this Bill. We will continue to do so in future. It is vital that both tiers of London government-the GLA and the boroughs-fully accept each other's democratic mandate and remit and that there is consensus about any use of this power. I therefore ask my noble friend not to move his Amendment 106 in favour of the Government's Amendment 105, which I beg to move.</p>

I listened very carefully to what he said and I have had the opportunity of talking about this matter with my noble friend Lady Hanham. None the less, I must press him a little because, as he acknowledged in his remarks, we discussed the matter contained in this amendment earlier today: it is the localist deficit that remains in London as a result of this legislation. I of course acknowledge the good relations between the mayor, the boroughs and the other London institutions, but these good relations are not fixed for all time. My amendment addresses future arrangements and future occasions on which the Government may decide that they wish to delegate functions. I believe that, where possible, a truly localist Government would wish to delegate those functions to the most local level practical and in London, in many case, that will be London boroughs, although we have heard many times in these debates that Ministers would like powers to be delegated even below the level of boroughs and principal authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="11091210000168"></a>Looking to the future, I am disappointed that there is not a slightly warmer recognition of the possibility that functions could be delegated to London boroughs. I have a further reason for saying this, which is that when functions are delegated to the mayor they have an unfortunate habit of getting stuck. I have referred to a number of examples in previous debates in Committee. I need only mention the battles that various London boroughs have been waging for years with Transport for London to be given the right to manage their own high streets. Does any delegation come? It does not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="11091210000169"></a>My amendment refers to future arrangements. It would have been better had the Government gone a little further in undertaking to act on the presumption that, where possible, delegation should be localist-that is, to the boroughs-and that, when that is not the case, they themselves will take the responsibility of making clear why there should not be that ultimate, localist solution. Everybody else in this Bill has to explain their behaviour. If local authorities do not wish to have a neighbourhood forum or neighbourhood planning, they have to explain why they do not want to delegate. Why should the Government not explain why they are not prepared to delegate functions to a lower level? It is potentially a missed opportunity.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="11091210000170"></a>I will reflect on what my noble friend has said very carefully, but perhaps I could press him a little further in clarifying the reasons. I welcome Amendment 105 and it is all very well that the Minister must consult borough councils, but I believe there should be more public accountability. Perhaps a Statement laid before Parliament is not the right approach but the Government should publicly hold themselves to account to explain why, if they decide to delegate functions in future, they have not delegated them to the boroughs. Perhaps in his response the Minister will be able to explain, or say whether he would be prepared to go a little further-not necessarily on the face of the Bill-in giving undertakings in that area.</p>

He argues powerfully for greater involvement by the London boroughs and for procedure that would facilitate that and indeed put the onus on the Government to prove their case in terms of delegation.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="11091210000172"></a>However, another aspect should be taken into account. The amendment speaks of a requirement to consult,</p>
<ul><a name="11091210000326"></a>"each London borough council ... the Common Council, and ... the Assembly".</ul>
<p><a name="11091210000266"></a>There is, of course, a cross-London body of councils, London Councils. In addition to the individual approaches, which obviously make sense, I would have thought it would be useful for London Councils to express a view as an organisation. The noble Lord is nodding his assent to that. Obviously it would be possible to garner the views of the 30-odd London boroughs, but seeking the view of London Councils itself might facilitate a better dialogue across the capital and, I hope, influence the outcome in directions that might not otherwise arise through separate consultations and responses. I wonder whether, if nothing else is done, London Councils could be added to the list of three given in Amendment 105.</p>

London Councils has made it very clear from the beginning of this Bill that it has been unhappy with the extent to which the regional authority in London-namely, the mayor and the London Assembly-seems to have been more successful in securing powers and opportunities than have London boroughs. Maybe that is their fault, but the fact of the matter is that the point made by my noble friend Lord True is shared by London boroughs as a whole. There  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_527"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column 527</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>needs to be a better balance between the mayor and the boroughs on these sorts of matters. As I have said before, the boroughs are responsible elected authorities and deserve to have a proper consideration on these matters. I hope that the Minister will feel able to give further consideration to this point. Here is another case where the mayor's lobbying seems to have been more effective than that of the London boroughs. I am not sure whether that is right or justified, but that seems to be what has happened.</p>

<a name="11091210000174"></a><b><a name="110912-0001.htm_spnew115"></a><a name="11091210000477"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, as we have heard, the government amendment requires consultation before there is any delegation or variation of a delegation of ministerial powers to the Mayor of London. This consultation must take place with each London borough, the Common Council of the City of London, and the Assembly. The noble Lord, Lord True, requires consultation on whether the function could be more appropriately conducted at borough level and, if a majority thinks so, an explanation has to be given to Parliament. We obviously support the consultation and the government amendment, but there is no specific guidance in the amendment as to what might result from such consultation. There is no specific requirement to publish the results, produce a response or indeed report to Parliament. Could the Minister give us some more details about these matters? If, for example, the consultation were to be overwhelmingly hostile to the concept, would it still proceed? Can he give us an idea of the type of eligible functions likely to be involved in the sort of delegation contemplated?</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="11091210000175"></a>The amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord True, with which, like my noble friend Lord Beecham, I have some sympathy, raises an interesting point about the role of London boroughs and their equivalents under the so-called Core Cities amendments, which we will shortly come to. Should it be accepted at any stage that the boroughs-one or all of them-would be a better destination for such delegation, and what powers in the Bill would allow that to happen?</p>

<a name="11091210000176"></a><b><a name="110912-0001.htm_spnew116"></a><a name="11091210000478"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for bringing all these points to bear on what is actually quite a difficult balancing act, and I think noble Lords will agree. I am not a London person, but I come from a two-tier authority. I live in a county council area and in a district council area, and the responsibilities between those two councils are usually clearly defined by statute. I think the governance of London is more involved. The Government's policy intention is to try to keep an even balance between the democratic mandate, which is vested in the mayor and the London Assembly, and the democratic mandate, which is vested in the London boroughs. I am sure all noble Lords will agree that keeping that balance right is not easy.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="11091210000177"></a>Much of the talk has been about how the consultation might go and the consequences of a consultation where perhaps the proposals do not meet with consensus. These are reasonable challenges. The noble Lord, Lord Beecham, asked whether the joint council body for London would be consulted. It is a matter of fact that they would be consulted; I do not know that they are a statutory body as such, but they are clearly a body that would be validly consulted. This would not, however,

It is very important to place on record that these government amendments seek to enshrine the role of the boroughs themselves. Indeed, they are coloured by the amendment of my noble friend Lord True, which seeks to go further in protecting the interests of the boroughs. I understand that.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="11091210000178"></a>I was asked how Parliament would be able to challenge any decisions that might be made in this area. In reality, Ministers are accountable to Parliament and I cannot imagine a decision considered by any noble Lord to be totally unfair or irrational to go unchallenged, either by question or even debate in this House, let alone down the other end where quite a large number of Members represent London constituencies.</p>

<a name="11091210000180"></a><b><a name="110912-0001.htm_spnew118"></a><a name="11091210000480"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> While I await the answer to that part of the process, perhaps I may continue with the process of consultation. It is important to get this on the record too. The consultation exercise will have to be appropriate to the matter in question. The problem with being too prescriptive about the nature of the consultation is that it does not have room for more flexible responses. Consultation should not be a tick-box exercise. It is a proper dialogue. It should not really be about whether it has majority support or not but about what is right, and consensus should be sought across the boroughs and London in the interests of the people of London. In the end, the governance of London is not for the benefit of the mayor, the Assembly or the London boroughs; it is for the people who live there.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="11091210000181"></a>In response to my noble friend's challenging question, the process is outside the statutory instrument process. It is purely an administrative function. However, the decision is still capable of being challenged in Parliament, as I have said, if it is seen to be perverse. There are no immediate plans to use this power, but it is envisaged that it could be used to delegate the administration of some of the national programmes that may be produced on the horizon. That is why it is important to have this capacity and a process whereby there can be discussions across London as to where a national programme might be best delivered.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="11091210000182"></a>My noble friend Lord True castigated us, in the nicest possible way, as he would, for not recognising that the Localism Bill is the place where, by empowering local boroughs, we would enhance localism within London. The role of the boroughs is clearly laid down by statute, and they are a very important part of London's governance. However, London is an exceptional place-it is the capital city of the country-and a number of services are effectively organised across London. The power to delegate arises only when the Secretary of State considers that the functions can be exercised appropriately by the mayor. We say that this provides the sort of comfort which my noble friend seeks. In effect, only a Minister exercising his powers under this clause can do this.</p>

<a name="11091210000192"></a><b><a name="110912-0001.htm_spnew129"></a><a name="11091210000491"></a>Lord Tope:</b> Amendment 108 would transfer the purpose and functions of the London Transport Users' Committee, which operates under the name London TravelWatch and is the body responsible for passenger representation within London, to the London Assembly. The amendment originates from a review conducted last year by the London Assembly, which showed that such a transfer of functions would save up to £1 million per annum of taxpayers' money. The findings of that review were accepted by all four political parties on the London Assembly. The amendment is therefore supported by all the parties in the London Assembly, the Mayor of London and London Councils, which represents not only the political parties but all 32 London boroughs and the City of London. London TravelWatch was established under the original GLA Act, the purpose of which was to devolve powers and responsibilities to London. That all those elements in London are wholly behind this measure, which saves a significant amount of public money, ought in itself to be enough to persuade the Government to comply with the wishes of London's elected representatives.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="11091210000193"></a>However, I understand that the Government have some concerns. Indeed, during the Recess I had a letter in the name of the noble Baroness the Minister. Let me try to address some of the concerns set out there. Quite rightly, there is a concern to ensure that passenger interests in London are effectively and properly represented by a genuinely independent body. As many of us know, whatever else it is, the structure of London government is unique. The London Assembly is solely a scrutiny body. It has no executive or regulatory powers at all; its function is to scrutinise and hold to account not only the mayor but also the functional bodies. I speak as a member of the London Assembly's transport committee for some years and I do not think it will surprise anyone to learn that a substantial part of that committee's work is holding Transport for London and, to a lesser extent, other transport operators in London, to account. It does so very independently because it has no responsibility for TfL-indeed, exactly the opposite. Its members are directly elected by Londoners, as distinct from the members of London  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_532"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column 532</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>TravelWatch, who do an extremely good job but are appointed by the London Assembly. The budget for London Transport-I am sorry, London TravelWatch-is provided by the London Assembly, so again it cannot be argued that the assembly is in some way less independent than the body it appoints and whose budget it provides.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="11091210000194"></a>I am sure that again it will come as no surprise to noble Lords to learn that a substantial part of the casework of most London Assembly members, particularly those representing constituencies, is on transport-related issues since they relate to anyone who has to live, work or travel in London. Of course a lot of work for members arises from that, and they are in touch with their constituents on transport issues. Making them officially the passenger representative body can only enhance that and join up the two sides.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="11091210000195"></a>The argument was also put that nothing had been said about the workload of the casework. That was because the purpose of this amendment is simply to transfer the function. However, I am sure that if the function were transferred, the wherewithal to carry out that function would follow it. It is not for me to say, but I would assume and expect that the current staff in London Transport-I mean London TravelWatch; I keep making the same mistake-would very likely transfer across under TUPE regulations. That would be a matter for discussion, should this happen. However, without doubt the London Assembly will need to have the capacity to carry out the necessary casework.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="11091210000196"></a>Finally, I make a point for serious consideration by the Government. If changes are to be made to London TravelWatch, we need to remember that it was set up under the Greater London Authority Act 1999 and that primary legislation will be needed to change that. I suspect that we will not see this or any other Government introducing a London TravelWatch Bill in the near future so some other vehicle will need to be found in order to make whatever the changes may be. I think, and dare I say I hope, that that may be some way off and that therefore the opportunity arises in this Bill to carry out the wishes of all of London's elected representatives, to save a substantial amount of public money-more necessary than ever at the present time-and, I would venture to suggest, to provide a strong, independent, directly elected and directly accountable passenger representative body. I beg to move.</p>

However, it may not surprise him to know that I take considerable exception to the case that he, the mayor and the Greater London Assembly are putting forward because I think it is fundamentally flawed. I am aware that it has come about as a result of the review of London TravelWatch carried out last year by the GLA, which did indeed recommend that it be wound up and its functions folded into the assembly. However, that process was seriously flawed. The assembly consulted a number of stakeholders, but then completely ignored what they said. For example, the Association of Train Operating Companies, ATOC, has written to me and said:</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_533"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column 533</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a><a name="11091210000303"></a>"We firmly believe that the functions of a consumer watchdog, in providing impartial casework and research support, and facilitating the resolution of individual complaints with train companies should be demonstrably independent, not under direct political control.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a><a name="11091210000304"></a>Assembly Members are keen to point out that taking on London TravelWatch's activities will help them to provide greater scrutiny of the mayor's and GLA's activities. However, we believe the priority for London TravelWatch should be handling disputes from individual passengers as a consumer champion and undertaking independent research, not being sidetracked on to issues of political or electoral interest to Assembly Members. Passengers will not benefit if London TravelWatch becomes merely a means for point-scoring".</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para73"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="11091210000198"></a>The assembly's review claims-and the noble Lord, Lord Tope, has referred to this-that there is scope for substantial savings. The review is vague about where those savings will come from. There does not appear to be any reference to transitional costs or to the cost of the GLA accommodating the staff, although the noble Lord, Lord Tope, did say that a TUPE arrangement may apply, which would undoubtedly have an impact on whatever savings may be possible.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para74"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="11091210000199"></a>London TravelWatch itself has demonstrated that it can cut its budget by 25 per cent over the next two years, while staying completely independent from politicians and concentrating on its core functions of appeals casework, and policy and investigation. There is a huge danger that the present multimodal work on behalf of the travelling public who use buses, the underground, the Docklands Light Railway, Tramlink, taxis, Dial-a-Ride, and National Rail in and around London would be fragmented if this amendment were adopted. It makes no sense to separate London TravelWatch's rail-related work from its work covering other modes. An example is its excellent, recent report on incomplete Oyster pay, which affects everyone who uses public transport in and around London.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para75"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="11091210000200"></a>I conclude with one further point: the GLA does not speak for those who are not resident in London. Seventy per cent of all rail journeys begin, end, or pass through London and London TravelWatch's remit extends far beyond the boundaries of Greater London, and includes large chunks of Essex, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Surrey and Kent, and it is from there that passengers travel into London for work or leisure purposes.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="11091210000201"></a>This is a really bad idea, which would lead Londoners to be disadvantaged compared with those outside London, who have independent representation on Passenger Focus, looking after their needs, whether they are rail or bus passengers. It is that independence that is important, and that is why I hope the Government will resist this amendment.</p>

The first point, which has been referred to by those who have already spoken in the debate, is that the September 2010 report by the London Assembly was a very substantial document indeed. It was not entered upon lightly and inadvisably. Despite what we have just heard, it was conducted with great thoroughness and we then came to the conclusion that there was no point, if you have an elected assembly already, in having a second,  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_534"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column 534</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>different body dealing with transport. It was a serious piece of work and the degree of support which my noble friend Lord Tope has indicated is sufficient evidence of that.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="11091210000203"></a>My second point is that all local authorities are under stringent spending pressures. Here is a proposal which could save up to £1 million a year for London. In the present circumstances, it is rather unwise not to accept that that is something which should be considered very seriously indeed. I understand the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, and the case that has been made by London TravelWatch. At the same time, there is here a formidable piece of work. It will save £1 million and the proposals in the report should be accepted. I therefore put my name to this amendment in order to give the House a chance to make that change.</p>

Like many here, I have great regard for the individuals at London TravelWatch and the work that they do. However, the very citation from ATOC carries its own message that, of all the groups in London, the train operating companies would prefer the body which they find they can more easily ignore to the one that they must take seriously. That is entirely in character with the functioning of the TOCs and ATOC. It is precisely to have a much bigger impact on behalf of passengers that it makes sense to make this move from TravelWatch, integrating it into the GLA.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="11091210000205"></a>I may have misheard the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, but he seemed to suggest that, if there was that integration into the GLA, there would be a fracturing of the transport voice. Yet the GLA is already holding TfL rigorously to account. I was on the board of Transport for London and I can tell your Lordships which body it was afraid of-it was very much the GLA. It is the ability of that body to pound away on behalf of the passenger that would be gained by this shift, so I support this amendment.</p>

This needs to be rejected. I do not want to repeat everything that my noble friend Lord Faulkner said but I would go for the fundamental point. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, since he is a battle-scarred veteran of the Public Bodies Bill, will probably recall my advocacy of separate representation for the consumer interest in publicly provided bodies and in those which are regulated publicly. The Government wisely backed off from including in lists various bodies, including Passenger Focus, which could have been abolished while for those that they are going to change they have provided an alternative but still independent body, either in another quango or in the third sector. It is a central provision of public services or those that are regarded as public utilities in this country that we have a separate consumer organisation. That applied when we set up the nationalised industries, when we privatised and liberalised those industries and when we passed the Greater London Authority Act to set up that body. It should continue to apply.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_535"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column 535</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110912-0001.htm_para79"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="11091210000207"></a>I suppose that I should apply two past interests here, both as a consumer champion as chair of Consumer Focus and as the Minister who, as the noble Lord, Lord Tope, will recall, brought the Greater London Authority Bill through this House. He will also recall that it was the second longest non-financial Bill ever-the absolutely longest, the Government of India Bill in 1935, was never implemented. The implementation of the Greater London Authority Act has left some problems but I do not believe that this is one of them.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="11091210000208"></a>It is important that we retain the distinction between the provider, and those who oversee the provider, and the consumer interest. The mayor is responsible for the provision and the London authority for overseeing that provision. In that sense, they are not much different from a private sector board as regards their consumers, so I am afraid that it does not impress me that all parties on the Greater London Assembly welcome and support this move. It is no more impressive to me than if there was a unanimous vote on the board of Thames Water to say that it wished to abolish the Consumer Council for Water, or that Michael O'Leary and the board of Ryanair said that they wished to abolish the Air Transport Users Council or-to go back to my past interests-that the boards of British Gas or npower should say that they wished to abolish Consumer Focus and any successor powers.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para81"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="11091210000209"></a>We must distinguish between the role of a consumer interest representative and those who are providing, or are part of the governance structure of those who provide, a service. Indeed, in London, predecessor bodies to this go back to the private company of London Transport, through the nationalisation process, through the GLC, through the abolition of the GLC, into the establishment of TfL and through to the London authority and the 1999 Bill. That was sensible. London Assembly members may well have reservations about aspects of this and may well feel that some changes need to be made-that might be right-but this clause does not say that, nor does it say that there should be some rationalisation between the London authority and Passenger Focus.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para82"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="11091210000210"></a>It might be conceivable that the transfer of this body into Passenger Focus was a rational move; I do not personally think so, but it would still provide an independent consumer voice focus. Actually, however, for the reasons that my noble friend points out, London is unique in this response. London is the only city in this country where the vast majority of people go to work by public transport. TfL has responsibilities way beyond the bus and train area-for roads, taxis and so on. As has also been pointed out, people outside London, and therefore with no voice in the election of GLA members, have an interest in this. So there is no principled argument that would call for the abolition of this body. I would be prepared to consider, and I suspect that the Government would be prepared to consider, something less than that, which allowed for easier changes, but the straight abolition of an independent consumer voice in the most complex, most difficult and in many respects most integrated transport system in the whole country would be a seriously retrograde move and I hope that the Minister will soundly reject it.</p>

As a Londoner, I always thought that the London Transport Users' Committee did quite a good job standing up for Londoners and, as my noble friend Lord Whitty said, for people travelling through London who have no vote in the GLA or any other elections in London. Having proper GLA input into what goes on in London transport is obviously very important. It has not happened in the past and that is very regrettable. What worries me, though, is where people will go to have their voice heard if this body is abolished. I know that the body is appointed by the London authority. I have some concerns, as a south Londoner, that there is very little experience of south London on the board. That needs to be addressed in the next round of appointments. One member may have been to Putney once or twice, but there is very little involvement in south London.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="11091210000212"></a>Another thing that worries me is the performance of London Underground. Noble Lords may not be aware that since April this year performance statistics have ceased to be published, so we have no idea what is going on in London Underground. I think we all know that it is getting worse, for sure, and this is something that needs to be addressed by both the users committee and the London authority pressing the mayor to release those figures again and to say why they have been stopped.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para84"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="11091210000213"></a>In conclusion, I am not against reform at all, but we need to hear more about how this will improve the situation. We in London all find that things are getting much worse, so we need to hear more about improvements. This may be something for the future, but not now.</p>

I am not sure how many of my colleagues behind me would follow me into the same Lobby. Our position was formulated because of strong support from the GLA, but I take it as implicit in my mandate that supporting the amendment would be conditional on the Government being able to answer a lot of the very robust challenges that have come, particularly, from this side of the House during this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="11091210000215"></a>My noble friend Lord Whitty spoke about the importance of preserving a strong consumer interest. Points were also made by my noble friend Lord Faulkner about whether this will benefit passengers, some of whom do not live in London and are not London voters. Indeed, it covers rail travel from such places as Luton. If we were to separate rail from other modes of travel, how would that work? I understand the thrust of the movers of the amendment, but these are questions that need to be satisfied before it could proceed. Perhaps in responding the Government can confirm that there was overwhelming support for the proposition among transport operators and rail user groups. Will the Government let us know, for the record, whether any alternatives to transfer to the GLA have been considered and on what basis they were rejected?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="11091210000216"></a>The Government have acknowledged the considerable amount of casework undertaken by London TravelWatch and are presumably satisfied that this could be handled under the proposed new arrangements. The London Assembly review of TravelWatch, to which the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, spoke, recommended that the reorganisation be folded into the assembly but with rail functions distributed between the assembly and the national independent passenger watchdog Passenger Focus. Have the Government undertaken an analysis and will they support that as an appropriate way forward?</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="11091210000217"></a>I look forward to the Minister's reply and hope that he can dig me out of my dilemma on this issue. Powerful issues have been raised that need to be answered before the proposition can and should proceed, much as we love the thrust of it. In particular, there is a mood that the status quo should not necessarily be accepted. There may be ways in which it can be improved and cost savings may be generated. I would be interested in the Minister's views on that as well.</p>

My officials assured me that this would be an easy amendment to deal with-even I would be able to deal with it. The reality is that I find myself in the middle of a pretty vigorous debate. On the other hand, the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie of Luton, also finds himself in an interesting position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="11091210000219"></a>I regret we did not have time to discuss this amendment in Committee when it was tabled by the noble Lords. As my noble friend Lady Hanham indicated in her subsequent letter, the Government believe that it is inappropriate-at this stage through this Bill-for the London Transport Users' Committee, which is the independent transport users watchdog for London, to be transferred to the London Assembly.</p>

<a name="110912-0001.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="11091210000220"></a>Among other things, the committee undertakes an important and impartial complaints ombudsman role on behalf of London transport users in and around London, and it is vital that any change to the current arrangements ensures that complaints continue to be dealt with in a genuinely independent manner. In particular, there is an EU requirement which mandates the designation of an independent body for complaints for rail transport users. So there is an important question that needs to be resolved about how far the assembly can be sufficiently independent for the purposes of this EU legislation, given its party-political membership, its role in scrutinising the work of the mayor and TfL and its influence over the strategic direction of transport policy in London-especially when this Bill will allow it to reject the mayor's transport strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="11091210000221"></a>Indeed, if the Government had proposed such an amendment, there would have been concerns from many noble Lords about the lack of independent safeguards in the legislation. Therefore, as we have heard from our debate this evening, there are still some important questions that need to be resolved before we can consider legislating for any new

<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="11091210000222"></a>However, as I am sure that noble Lords will agree, it is entirely right during a time of fiscal constraint for the London Assembly to consider ways to achieve best value for taxpayers' money from the London Travel Users' Committee that it oversees. The Department for Transport has already undertaken a review of Passenger Focus, the national rail passenger watchdog, which will deliver significant savings, and DfT will work with the committee, the assembly and other partners to explore ways to deliver an efficient and effective ombudsman function for London transport users.</p>

I am less grateful to him for tempting me to call a vote just to see what happens. We will have to see about that. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, for putting the case from London TravelWatch. I have seen its briefing. It is not surprising that the body which is proposed for abolition is less keen on its own abolition. That is entirely understandable. I hope that I did not say or imply that there is something wrong with the way in which it does its job. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, gave us a brief history of it all. Back in the 1970s, I was a member of its predecessor body. I am grateful to the noble Lord for reminding us of the many happy hours that we spent discussing the GLA Act, as it became.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="11091210000227"></a>A number of points have been made, and I am not going to spend a long time answering them all. We are referring to the abolition of London TravelWatch. Let us be clear: the body that we are talking about may be subsumed in the London Assembly but we are certainly not talking about abolishing the function and representative role of the passenger interest. It is very important that we understand there is no suggestion of that. On the contrary, there is a belief, perhaps not shared by all, that that passenger interest would be enhanced by being represented by people who have been elected. I accept that they are not elected by everybody who ever travels on transport within London; I do not think that will ever be the case. However, I am a little puzzled that members of the Labour Party should say that, because a body is popularly elected, it is therefore not independent. I find that a rather strange argument and one that is difficult to follow. I made very clear-I know this from my eight years' experience of serving on the London Assembly-that this is an independent body. It has no executive functions and does not always love the mayor. None of the members always loves the mayor, whoever the mayor may be. It has no executive responsibility at all for

Indeed, an enormous amount of its time is taken up questioning-sometimes vigorously, as my noble friend Lady Kramer said-and calling to account the principal transport provider within London and, indeed, the train operating companies that appear for questioning. Therefore, there is a vigorous representation of passenger interest on the part of those people whom most of the passengers-but not all-will have elected as their representatives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="11091210000228"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kennedy, referred to himself as a south Londoner. I am more south London than him, certainly in geographical terms, but I share his interest in that regard. That situation would be corrected if it were the London Assembly because, whatever I personally may think of the inadequate electoral system by which that body is elected, it represents the whole of London.</p>

The Minister need not comment on this point now but I believe that discussions are going on about introducing changes regarding greater involvement with Passenger Focus. I hope the Government will ensure to the best of their ability that the London Assembly-I mean the London Assembly, not the GLA, which might well mean the mayor instead-is directly involved in all those discussions. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

It also illustrates the general confusion over the structure of transport in the London area. The purpose of the amendment is to remove from the Department for Transport the responsibility for rail franchising within the inner suburban area of London and transfer it to Transport for London. It is wholly within the spirit of the Bill to take from the centre and give to a regional  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_540"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column 540</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>or more local body powers that it can exercise more effectively and more efficiently for the benefit, in this case, of passengers.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="11091210000231"></a>Noble Lords will know that at present Transport for London effectively either manages or in some way regulates the Tube, the Docklands Light Railway, bus services, river transport services and taxi services, but when it comes to rail, it has only a very limited purview. It directly manages London Overground, which is one very minor line, and it will have oversight of Crossrail once it is completed. However, when it comes to the inner suburban rail services that criss-cross much of the London area, Transport for London's role is extremely limited. The Department for Transport lets and manages the franchises and Transport for London can simply specify and pay for either an increment to that service or-terrible bureaucratic word-a decrement to that service. Essentially, the consequence of that has not been very beneficial to passengers.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="11091210000232"></a>I would argue that London is different from much of the rest of the country when it comes to rail. Fourteen per cent of Londoners use the National Rail network to commute daily to work. Indeed, outside of London proper, in the south-east and east of London there are many more who use that rail network to commute to work within the London area. That makes it distinctly different from any other part of the country. There are 10 train operating companies, so it is a highly fragmented service. Demand in the area is so inelastic that the kind of competitive pressures that have effect in the rest of the country are virtually irrelevant when it comes to London, where demand is so high, capacity is constantly at breaking point and there is always a need for additional capacity. So the competitive issue that exists elsewhere is not relevant within London itself.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="11091210000233"></a>I said that there were 10 different train operating companies. That means 10 different brandings, 10 different fare structures, 10 different forms of marketing, 10 different commercial strategies and 10 different operating time horizons. As noble Lords will know, the McNulty review recommends that more power should go to the train operating companies and franchises should be longer. So trying to create an integrated London Transport service within this environment, where rail is so fragmented and Transport for London has so little direct power, is very significantly undermined. If your Lordships would like an example of what this does to, as it were, disadvantage passengers, I draw your attention to the Oyster card. I should declare that I am a former member of the board of Transport for London and was very involved with the rail side. Rows went on year after year to try to get any form of Oyster card available on National Rail. Then we got "pay as you go", which most people have now enjoyed only for the past couple of years. Technically it could have been done very easily, but the issue was never high on the priority list for the Department for Transport, which had to be involved because of the franchising structure. The TOCs saw it as a way to leverage money out of London Transport. The whole process was very much to the disadvantage of passengers. If your Lordships want another quick example, just go down to Waterloo. The next time you are stuck on a train that is slow  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_541"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column 541</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>because there is no space to get into Waterloo station, you will see that there is an empty platform. When Eurostar moved to St Pancras, one of the international platforms was, at great expense to the Government, converted to domestic use. The department has never managed to get its act together to put that into play for passengers. That is another huge, wasted asset. Frankly, this is repeated all over London.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="11091210000234"></a>Sometimes I seethe with envy when I talk to transport friends in Berlin as they are able to work with the bus and taxi services so that late-night trains are met by a co-ordinated timetable of buses and taxis, ensuring that train passengers have a seamless journey. The battle in London has been to look at travel as a single journey, whether you use one mode or multiple modes to get to your destination, and to create that kind of integration. It has been phenomenally successful, but leaving out rail makes no sense.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="11091210000235"></a>Sometimes people say that people from outside London use the services so they must not be too London biased. We can give them a voice by putting some directors from outside London onto the relevant board within Transport for London. It is also true that the department will continue to have a voice, but the balance needs to be shifted towards an entity which has a genuine interest, in a detailed way, in the quality of service, as Transport for London does.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="11091210000238"></a>I have two more points to make. Some people say that there must have been a lot of thought about how the franchises should be divided up and a reason for not giving far more influence over the rail franchising process to Transport for London. The rationale was, "We don't like Ken Livingstone". When the GLA Bill went through this House, particularly when TfL was under review, there was an attempt to minimise the London influence. We had the disastrous Tube public/private partnership, which was a key part of the structure and which ensured that Transport for London really could not manage the system as a whole.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="11091210000239"></a>There was very little appreciation of the benefits of integration. That is one of the other pieces, if you like, which came out of much of that kind of thinking. We have all moved beyond that and recognise the benefits of integration and the benefits of regional management. I argue that at this time, when the transport infrastructure in this area is desperately overstretched, when we really are in a situation of economic recovery in some areas of London and you practically have to strap people to the roofs of transport carriages, we need to maximise the use of that infrastructure. Therefore, the logic is to change the franchising responsibility, which is what this amendment attempts to do.</p>

<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_542"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column 542</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the previous amendment and the discussion about London Travel Watch-I am sorry that I was not in the Chamber at that time-I was sent a map of the extent of London Travel Watch, which goes well beyond the GLA boundary in many areas. I do not think it goes all the way out to Banbury but it goes quite a long way in that direction; it also goes a long way west and a long way south. It made me think that if this amendment were accepted, one would end up with the same kind of problem. On the main network, not many trains terminate within the GLA boundary. I believe Croydon must be near the edge-I am no expert on Croydon but perhaps some of my noble friends could confirm that-but I do not think that any services that go through East Croydon terminate there. So there will be a debate between those who want long-distance services as frequently as possible, stopping as infrequently as possible, between Croydon and the centre of London, for example, and those who live within the GLA boundary who want a regular stopping service.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="11091210000241"></a>The other problem, which is particularly evident on the lines south of London, is that in many places you can get to two or three different London termini by train. It is a lovely service if it works-it usually does-but it is a very complex network. It compares strongly with the Underground lines which, on the whole-apart from the Northern line-may serve two destinations at each end, but not three or four. I can see a time when Transport for London might say that it would like to rationalise the services south of London, for example, by making them more frequent, but going to fewer destinations, and having cross-platform interchange in some places, because it thought that would be better for its electorate.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="11091210000242"></a>I mentioned the question of through-services and the debate regarding them and the shorter-term. There is also the question of access for freight-I declare an interest as chairman of the Rail Freight Group-although there is not much freight south of the Thames, so we can probably forget about that. However, I also recall a big debate during the many Crossrail debates, because when TfL thought it was in charge of Crossrail and the Great Western, it started off on the basis that it would have the sole use of the slow lines, to Maidenhead or Reading, and all the other trains could have the fast lines. TfL thought that was a brilliant idea, because it would run a very frequent service-there would probably be those lines of heavy cables that you see between London Underground lines-but it completely forgot that those lines are run as a network of four tracks. If anything goes wrong on one track, the trains are immediately switched to the other ones to keep the service going. I did a calculation at the time, which indicated that if Crossrail had got its way the passenger operators would have had to cut their service frequency to places such as Cardiff, Oxford and Bristol by at least 50 per cent, if not more. Only half the freight trains would have gone up that line, and when one of the lines was dug up, they would just have to stop.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="11091210000243"></a>That is the logical consequence of splitting responsibilities. There is work to be done with TfL and the Department for Transport to take into account the needs of people who live within the GLA area and then we can have a big debate on how the available

As for giving the train operators-all 10 of them, as the noble Baroness said-more responsibility, I think that is a bit dangerous when so much co-ordination is needed. It is a debate that we need to have. I am not sure whether this is the right amendment, but I think it is very useful to be having this discussion.</p>

I have a great deal of sympathy with the points she is making. I will start with a correction-also for the noble Lord, Lord Spicer-that it is not only one platform at Waterloo that is out of use; it is platforms 21, 22, 23 and 24. I think I am right in saying that it is 21 and 22 which are being used by the production of "The Railway Children", which I can recommend unreservedly.

As I said, I have a great deal of sympathy with the point she makes but my concern is that the introduction of a new franchising authority, which the amendment proposes, would be in danger of creating greater fragmentation of the railway than we have at present. I agree with her that there are probably too many train operating companies. It is the Government's intention that franchises should be longer than they have been in the past, and I strongly support that. However, to introduce a new franchising operator could lead to confusion and fragmentation. My noble friend Lord Berkeley refers to services that serve London but go well beyond; the classic example of that is the Thameslink line, which starts in Bedford, goes through Luton and St Albans-none of which is covered by Transport for London or the GLA-and then goes south from Croydon to Brighton.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="11091210000247"></a>Services like that need to be looked at in a regional context, and I am not certain that looking at it in a London context would make a great deal of sense. However, I pay tribute to what Transport for London has done in the development of its Overground service. The opening up of the East London line is an extraordinarily successful venture. The trains are very popular and they provide new journey opportunities for people who probably did not make those journeys, or tried to do it by car, or struggled on buses. It deserves to be commended for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="11091210000248"></a>I agree with my noble friend that it is helpful to have this debate, but this amendment is not quite the way that we should go.</p>

As my noble friend Lady Hanham said in her letter following the Committee stage, TfL already plays an important role in relation to London's commuter rail services. It already has, as pointed out by my noble friend, effectively full franchising powers over the London Underground concession, covering a number of key routes across London. It works closely with the Department for Transport in the development of other rail franchises affecting London, with the mayor having the ability to pay for outputs over and above those that the DfT specifies. By the way, I undertake to look up in the dictionary the definition of "decrement".</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="11091210000250"></a>The devolution of other London commuter rail franchises to the mayor and TfL is not a straightforward matter. The geography of London's commuter rail network does not sit well with London's administrative boundaries, with many lines extending well into neighbouring counties, as pointed out by many noble Lords. Furthermore, capacity on much of the London commuter network is limited, and there are inherent conflicts between London-area and non-London services that need to be balanced in the best interests of all users, and to keep overall costs down.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="11091210000251"></a>I am afraid my noble friend did not satisfy me in how the balance would be struck between the needs of commuters who live in London, and who elect the mayor and the Assembly, and those living in Luton, Brighton and Woking, who do not. There is a real question of a democratic accountability deficit if other London commuter rail services were devolved to the mayor, as many commuters do not live in London so do not have the opportunity to participate in the elections.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="11091210000252"></a>Nevertheless, the Department for Transport is happy to engage TfL further about the devolution of local rail services, in the context of Sir Roy McNulty's independent study on rail value for money earlier this year. This study suggested that more local control of rail services could contribute to the development of lower-cost regional railways and, in line with the Government's localism agenda, we are considering options for more local control of some rail services in other parts of England. We will also continue to encourage operators to work more closely with TfL. The new working arrangements, put in place for the South Central franchise which was let in 2009, appear to be working well.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="11091210000253"></a>On this basis, I urge my noble friend to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="11091210000255"></a>I say to those who are concerned about passengers outside the London area that most people have London as their destination, and are therefore intensely important to TfL; they are not marginal. Also, most people who come in contribute in some way to London's economic viability, either through business or entertainment, and so are very much a concern to Transport for London even though they do not actually live within the area.

I did and do welcome the conferring of the power of general competence that the Bill provides, especially in the light of the general perception in the media by such august bodies as the TaxPayers' Alliance and even occasional Ministers that "general incompetence" is the term that should be applied to much of local government-something that I certainly refute. However, there are flaws in the Government's proposals and the amendment addresses at least some of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="11091210000258"></a>The two amendments in this group relate to what can only be described as a dispensing power which the Secretary of State will take to disapply, repeal or amend legislation that he conceives somehow inhibits the exercise of the general power of competence. It is fair to say that in Committee the noble Baroness addressed concerns that had been raised about, for example, the application of human rights legislation on matters of that kind, and indicated that these were not envisaged as being embraced by the Bill. Certainly I accept that point. However, a great many pieces of legislation, on the face of it, appear to fall within the provisions of Clause 5(1) and therefore are subject to amendment, repeal or revocation, in the words of the clause. They extend over a wide area of public policy. A number of them are listed in the proposed new schedule that is the subject of the second amendment in this group. They cover such areas of law as part of the Childcare Act, the Child Poverty Act, the Care Standards Act, disabled persons regulations, carers legislation, parts of the Mental Health Act, the Community Care Act and the Environment Act. The

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="11091210000259"></a>It is a formidable list of legislative requirements that can, simply by order, be revoked. That raises a significant question about the role of the Executive. It is not clear whether Clause 5(1) requires any such changes to be made by affirmative resolution. Certainly that was the view of the Delegated Powers Committee. Other provisions in the clause are subject to affirmative resolution, or would be subject to it. The noble Baroness indicated in Committee that that was probably the case, and it would appear so. However, it does not necessarily seem to be the case in relation to Clause 5(1). Perhaps the noble Baroness will comment on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="11091210000260"></a>Even so, the clause gives very extensive power to the Secretary of State to deal, either by order or perhaps even without the authority of the usual procedure involving statutory instruments and resolutions of both Houses, with significant primary legislation. That does not appear to the Opposition to be an appropriate use of ministerial powers. Dispensing powers have occasionally caused problems in our country's history. I recall that they probably led to the plight that James II faced, because he sought to use dispensing powers to relieve Catholics of their obligations under the Test Acts. It was probably a laudable objective, but certainly was regarded as constitutionally very troublesome and played no small part in his loss of the throne. I am not suggesting that the noble Baroness will be out of a job, let alone that her superiors in the department will be out of a job-much though that might be desirable, except of course in her case. Nevertheless, it is a serious principle that dispensing legislation of this kind should not invest such wide powers in the Secretary of State. The amendment that I am moving would restrict that. Changes in relation to other matters in the Bill that are less controversial would have to be made by statutory instrument and approved by both Houses in what I trust will be regarded as the normal way.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="11091210000261"></a>As I indicated at the outset, the Government's intentions are laudable. In dealing with the next amendment, I will point to provisions that run counter to those laudable aims. Genuine concern about the provisions has been expressed by a wide range of organisations. I hope that the Minister will think again about the necessity of proceeding in particular with Clause 5(1) in the way that the Bill currently provides. We are meeting her tomorrow. There may be an opportunity to take these matters further. I hope that we will have some indication that the Government will be willing to move.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="11091210000262"></a>There is one other aspect of the clause that perhaps is worth mentioning. In a debate in the other place, the Select Committee looking at the Bill considered the general powers of competence and suggested that the Government should consult others, including the Local Government Association, to exemplify ways in which the general powers would go beyond current powers to promote the social, environmental and economic well-being of an area. Perhaps the noble Baroness will

It would be helpful in the context of discussion of these matters for her to give an indication of where the thinking and development of firmer propositions in that respect have been taken so far. In the light of that, I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_156"></a>
<a name="11091232000001"></a><b><a name="110912-0002.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="11091232000383"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Hanham):</b> My Lords, I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, is not seeking to get me out of my job just yet. I thank him for that. There is a little overexcitement about Clause 5(1)-not that the noble Lord ever raises his voice excitedly. However, there are concerns that are not necessary. Amendment 109A would prevent the Secretary of State making any orders under Clause 5(1) and (2). That would mean that he could not even amend the long list of legislation set out in Amendment 119E. However, it would give him order-making powers to add to the legislative list; he would be able to add but not to take away.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="11091232000002"></a>The power in Clause 5(1) is a power to remove restrictions and limitations to the legal capacity of local authorities that prevent them exercising the general power of competence. I think that we all want to see them have this general power. The clause must be read in the context of that power, which is a power to do things that an ordinary individual can do. It is not a power to remove any duty or obligation placed on local authorities, such as many of those listed in Amendment 119E, where such duties or obligations do not restrict or limit the capacity of the local authority to do things that the individual can do.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="11091232000003"></a>Noble Lords must hang on to the word "individual"; that is the important aspect. We do not consider that Clause 5(1) could be interpreted-the noble Lord addressed this and understands it-as allowing the Secretary of State to amend the requirements of, for example, the Equality Act or the Human Rights Act as they apply to local authorities. These Acts place broad duties on public authorities, including individuals, so they cannot be part and parcel of this power of competence. These Acts are not a restriction or limitation in the legal capacity of the local authority, so the power could not be used in the way suggested for these or any other similar legislation, just as it could not be used to exempt local authorities from prohibitions contained in criminal law.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="11091232000004"></a>We have listened to concerns, and amendments were brought forward in the other place, which are now in Clause 6, to place restrictions and limitations on the power in Clause 5(1). We believe these provide additional safeguards so that there can now be no doubt about the scope of the power. It does not permit the removal of essential duties, protections or rights from the Secretary of State. I also confirm that, as part of the consultation required by Clause 5(7), it will be appropriate to consult every person or group of persons, or their representatives, who will be substantially affected by the proposal. The results of any such consultation would have to be presented to Parliament, and then Parliament could veto the order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="11091232000005"></a>The noble Lord asked me whether Parliament would be involved in this. As I said, Clause 5(7) is also modelled on what is in the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act. The procedure to be followed would be negative, affirmative or superaffirmative, and that would be ultimately determined by Parliament. This matter has been put to the Delegated Powers Committee, which has no difficulty with that and has expressed itself on side with the procedure.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="11091232000006"></a>We believe that these amendments are unnecessary. We are trying to give local authorities as much power as we can, but we realise that some of that is going to come eventually from Parliament. There are restrictions on the powers of the Secretary of State in these procedures. Local authorities are not going to have completely unfettered power with the general power of competence, but it will be much wider than it is at the moment.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="11091232000007"></a>I hope that I have answered the noble Lord satisfactorily about the involvement of Parliament if the Secretary of State were to use these powers, so I hope noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendments.</p>

I accept that there now appears to be at least a parliamentary procedure here. I still think it is difficult to accept the notion that primary legislation imposing duties that were imposed for a purpose on local authorities and others should be varied or revoked in the way set out in the Bill. Having noted the point about the affirmative procedure, however, I accept her assurances and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

This is really quite an exceptional provision and is not at all acceptable. The Secretary of State takes upon himself, having conferred or purported to confer this very broad power, the right to,</p>

<p><a name="11091232000018"></a>or, under Clause 5(4), to make that subject to conditions. That is a very far-reaching incursion on the principle that the Bill seeks to advance, and it is simply not acceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="11091232000010"></a>Amendment 109C in this group deals with the rather strange phrase, "any necessary protection", which is contained in the clause and is in no sense defined. It is presumably left to the Secretary of State to determine what a necessary protection is. These are the limits under the power contained in Clause 6. In the absence of any sensible definition, I do not think this is an

I invite your Lordships to agree that these provisions should be left out of the Bill, and I move Amendment 109B accordingly.</p>

<a name="11091232000011"></a><b><a name="110912-0002.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="11091232000387"></a>Baroness Hanham:</b> Amendment 109B, as the noble Lord said, would remove subsections (3) and (4) of Clause 5. These subsections provide reserve powers to allow the Secretary of State to prevent authorities from exercising the general power or to set conditions around the use of this power. We believe that these powers provide a necessary and proper safeguard, given the breadth of the new power-to ensure, for example, that risks to both local government finances and the Exchequer are properly managed. The Government have no plans-I think I said this earlier on-to use the powers in subsections (3) and (4). At present, there is nothing in mind; the Secretary of State is not sitting there with great excitement, his pen poised, waiting to take away what he has already given. The Government actually expect them to be used very rarely, if at all. They are, however, an insurance policy. They might, for instance, have to be used to deal with any risks that might arise from authorities' use of the new general power-I think I said this in Committee-to engage in novel financial transactions using public money. That might require the Secretary of State to step in. The use of the power is subject to consultation and to the affirmative procedure, which would ensure suitable parliamentary scrutiny. I just want to stress that, occasionally in legislation, we need to provide for the very end of the road when something might go wrong, and that is all the clause is for.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="11091232000012"></a>Amendment 109C would remove one of the conditions that place restrictions and limitations on the use of Clause 5(1). The provision in question must not remove, as the noble Lord said very clearly in his opening remarks, "any necessary protection". This condition ensures that protections-which might relate, for example, to the economy, health and safety, civil liberties, the environment or national heritage-are not removed. A similar condition is used in the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006, so this is not new to legislation. It is quite deliberately wide. Any Secretary of State seeking to make an order under Clause 5(1) must be satisfied that the condition is met and must explain why to Parliament. We believe, therefore, that this and the other conditions in Clause 6 are a useful additional safeguard and should be retained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="11091232000013"></a>Before the noble Lord or others intervene, I will speak to government Amendments 234, 235 and 236, because it might help the debate coming afterwards. Amendment 234 gives effect to the recommendations of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in relation to Clause 5(2). Clause 5(2) is entirely benign; it can be used only to remove wholly overlapped, and therefore unnecessary, powers. It cannot be used to remove duties. The amendment ensures that orders made under Clause 5(2), if not made in conjunction with orders under Clause 5(1) and subject to special procedures set out in Clause 7, will have to be subject to an affirmative procedure. We believe that those safeguards, coupled with the intense level of parliamentary scrutiny provided, give sufficient protection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="11091232000014"></a>Government Amendment 235 gives effect to recommendations of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee about the parliamentary procedure for orders made under Clause 5(3) and (4). It removes the exemption that permitted orders made under these clauses to be subject to the negative procedure if they did no more than extend the scope of previous orders. We accept that such an extension could be significant for the authorities concerned and therefore that the affirmative procedure is more appropriate. Government Amendment 236 makes the power of the Secretary of State to extend the general power to certain parish councils subject to an affirmative procedure in line with the committee's recommendation.</p>

However, I continue to have difficulty with the response to my amendment. The Secretary of State is clearly not prepared to trust local government with the powers that he is conferring on local government. He retains significant power to override the exercise of the general power which he has purported to confer or to impose conditions, admittedly subject to a parliamentary procedure. The whole case is redolent of the Government simply not being prepared to trust their partner in local government, a point that was made by the noble Lord, Lord Newton, when he was castigating me for being insufficiently robust on the previous occasion. I hope I have not failed his test today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="11091232000017"></a>On this and on the previous occasion the Minister referred only to some novel financial practices, as if these were the most likely candidates for the invocation of the powers conferred by the Act. So far as financial practices are concerned, if there is any suggestion that they are likely to damage the finances of the local authority, there are existing mechanisms to deal with that within and outside the authority in the proper financial officer and audit, albeit perhaps not for much longer under the auspices of the Audit Commission. There are perfectly proper safeguards, and the additional powers that the Secretary of State seeks to reserve for himself under this Bill are not needed. I still do not understand what is meant by the "necessary protection" to which Clause 6 refers. Protection from what, against what and to what extent it is necessary are entirely opaque. In these circumstances, I must test the opinion of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="11091240000002"></a>In response to the amendment tabled on 20 June by the noble Baroness, Lady Smith of Basildon, I said that it was never the Government's intention to enable charging for all community fire safety or prevention activities and that I would reflect on the best way of achieving that aim. Amendment 113, tabled in respect of England and Wales, retains the existing position that fire and rescue authorities cannot charge for the giving of advice, on request, about preventing fires and means of escape in any premises. The amendment retains the existing ability of fire and rescue authorities to charge for the giving of advice in relation to non-domestic premises unless that advice is requested under Section 6(2)(b) of the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 which sets out the criteria for fire safety; the noble Baroness will know more about this than I do. Fire and rescue authorities will not be able to charge for the

Charging is optional and up to full cost recovery, not for profit. This amendment will replicate existing arrangements on charging for giving advice as set out in the 2004 Act. I await the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness.</p>

<a name="11091240000003"></a><b><a name="110912-0002.htm_spnew18"></a><a name="11091240000080"></a>Baroness Smith of Basildon:</b> My Lords, I rise to speak to our Amendment 112 and comment on the government amendments in this group.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="11091240000004"></a>I welcome the Government's amendments and I am grateful to the noble Baroness for her comments. I appreciate that it caused some confusion when I first raised this. As the noble Baroness generously said, when she first wrote to me, her officials and government Ministers had understood that the legislation as drafted would not allow for charging. It was completely inadvertent, as she said, and they had not appreciated that a consequence of the Government's proposals to expand and increase charges would lead to community fire safety being charged for. Indeed, she wrote to me to that effect. I thank her because, when it was recognised that our concerns on this were justified, she raised the matter in the House and immediately wrote to me as well to clarify the position and agreed to bring forward government amendments to correct the error. I am grateful to her for doing that.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="11091240000005"></a>I have to say to her that this is a fairly large Bill, about 500 pages long. It is very detailed and quite technical in parts, and some of the discussions we have had have sometimes seemed quite complex. We have concerns that some parts of this Bill may have been rushed through to the House before they were fully and properly drafted. It is to the great credit of the noble Baroness that she has been ready to engage and debate on these issues, and at times has been prepared to concede and bring forward amendments to try to improve this legislation. So I am grateful to her for the amendments she has brought forward today, in so far as they go.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="11091240000006"></a>I am sorry to raise the matter in this way, but I am looking at the difference between the amendment in my name and the amendment from the Government, which refers to Section 6(2)(b) of the 2004 Act. Our Amendment 112 would not allow charging for community safety or fire prevention work, whereas the government amendment refers to Section 6(2)(b) of the 2004 Act, which is purely about the fire safety work that a fire authority must undertake as part of its core functions. I entirely agree that that is right and proper in so far as it goes. The last Government recognised that fire safety should be a core function, and therefore placed a duty on fire authorities to undertake fire safety. No fire authority should be allowed to charge for that core function, as the noble Baroness rightly agrees. Where I think there is a grey area-and some clarification on this would be helpful, as this is another unintended consequence-is that many fire authorities have extended this work to the related, but slightly wider, community safety remit.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="11091240000007"></a>I have some particular examples of this work, which I am sure the noble Baroness would never want to see lost to the community. For example, my authority in Essex runs a number of courses for young people, such as one called "Firebreak" and another called  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_555"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column 555</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>"Young Firefighters", and there are similar schemes in other authorities. They do promote fire safety-there are clearly benefits for fire safety-but there are much wider benefits to the individuals taking part and to the community. In Basildon, Essex fire service uses these projects, working with local authorities, councils and other bodies, as part of a team tackling crime and disorder. The fire service is part of the crime and disorder reduction partnerships, and it is very proud of this work. I looked at its website earlier today for examples. It seems to me-the noble Baroness can assure me on this-that from the wording that is taken from the 2006 Act this does not exactly fall under fire safety.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="11091240000008"></a>For example, there is a page on the Essex County Fire and Rescue Service website about Darren, 18, of Ashingdon Road in Hawkwell. He has just joined the crew of his local fire station as the newest recruit, and he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57"></a><a name="11091240000055"></a>"It was Firebreak which really showed me what I wanted to do with life and how I could do it. I had got into the wrong crowd and was getting in trouble with the police and then bringing that trouble with me into school and getting into worse trouble".</p>

<p><a name="11091240000052"></a>His head teacher referred Darren to the "Firebreak" course-it is a long quote but I will read it-and, as Darren says,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58"></a><a name="11091240000056"></a>"When I got back to school I ditched my mates and really buckled down. Almost straight away I saw my grades improving and my predicted exam results shot up. Firebreak made me realise that there is more to life than getting in trouble and mucking about and gave me something to work towards".</p>

<p><a name="11091240000053"></a>That is not technically fire safety, but the benefits to the community are enormous. Another person mentioned is Craig, who is 20 and attended this course in 2005. He says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a><a name="11091240000057"></a>"I was taking drugs, drinking and stealing cars. Basically I was completely off the rails. Firebreak has changed my life, I no longer drink or take drugs and am now working to become a firefighter myself".</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="11091240000009"></a>The Cheshire fire service signs up to missdorothy.com. I do not know whether the noble Baroness is aware of missdorothy.com. When I was Fire Minister I went to see some of the work that it is doing, which is about community safety for younger children. Given the trust placed in firefighters, and their very respected position in the community, they were engaging very young children in community safety. Part of that was about fire safety and being safe, but also about being safe in their broader lives. The Cheshire fire service is also one of the employers involved with the Prince's Trust programme. I certainly think that nobody in your Lordships' House would want to lose the fire service's involvement with the Prince's Trust. There is a 12-week personal development course, and the fire service is one of the employers doing that.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="11091240000010"></a>Devon and Somerset is another authority that has a personal development scheme, also called "Firebreak", for key stage 4 pupils from 14 to 16. Its website says that it provides a</p>
<ul><a name="11091240000073"></a>"themed educational diet designed to complement and enhance the school curriculum. It aims to raise achievement, improve self motivation, increase educational engagement",</ul>
<p><a name="11091240000011"></a>and aims to develop,</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="11091240000012"></a>Looking around the country, I see that Suffolk authority is another one to engage actively with children and young people. One of its objectives is to prevent  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_556"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column 556</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and reduce fire crime and fire, but it also wants to engage young people, and has professional staff working with the authority, to identify good practice in working with children and young people. East Sussex has a "LIFE" project and Chester has a "Respect" project.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="11091240000013"></a>All of those have proven successes in deterring young people not only from a life of crime but from social disorder as well. My fear is, if it was the Government's intention, which I suggest it probably was not, that these should be charged for-and I think that, under the Government's amendments, they would be able to be charged for-then those very young people who can benefit most from these courses would not be able to do so.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="11091240000014"></a>Another issue is that, if these courses were chargeable, who would pay? In many cases it would be another public authority. What we would be doing is introducing a bureaucracy to move money around the system. So it would be helpful if the Minister, perhaps not today, could reflect on the advice she was initially given that this would not be covered by fire safety. Perhaps there may be some kind of guidance that could be issued. I think that this is the kind of work that so many people in the community benefit from.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="11091240000015"></a>In my own authority, at Basildon fire station, Martin Trevillion leads the community safety programme, and it is an exceptional programme. Having spoken to so many young people that have benefitted from it, I would be reluctant for us to lose that programme simply through inadvertent drafting of legislation.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="11091240000016"></a>Finally, I want to raise one other issue, which is that of carbon monoxide safety and awareness. I am also not clear that Section 6(2)(b) of the 2004 Act, which talks about advice on how to prevent fires and on means of escape from buildings, would cover carbon monoxide safety. This is a particular issue: there have been a number of deaths and serious injuries due to carbon monoxide, and it is something that fire authorities are able to take on and work with, and I know that some of them already do so. I would not think that the noble Baroness intended that that should be charged for as well.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="11091240000017"></a>When at Second Reading I first raised the issue of charging for community safety, it was clear that the Government had not thought about the implications, quite inadvertently, and this had slipped through. The Minister was able to respond to those concerns very positively. I hope she understands that my raising these tonight is in exactly the same tone, as this is a service provided by the fire authorities, working with their community, which we really would be very loath to lose, if they had to charge for it. I ask the Minister-I think she has had time to reflect, or to receive enlightenment on this issue quite soon-even if she cannot give me a full answer today, to reflect on that so some guidance can be issued, because this resource that is provided by our fire and rescue services is very valuable for the community.</p>

My experience with such businesses is that it is very hard to start up anyway. I believe that you have to get fire advice in many cases. Having to pay will make life even more difficult. I can understand why the Government want to allow fire authorities to make such charges but to do that for non-profit organisations seems to be a little hard. Perhaps the Minister could reflect on that and consider whether it could be omitted for charities and non-profit organisations.</p>

I understand that we are working within the framework of the fire and safety Act, so whatever that includes will be included. I am very reluctant to answer the noble Baroness today. I do not have the answer. It is quite wide in terms of what we are seeking to do. The same applies to the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley. I always hate having to say that I do not know the response to something, but I will have to do so today. If the noble Baroness and the noble Lord will forgive me, I will write to them before Third Reading to make sure that there is a clear understanding of the answer to both questions. My gut feeling is that probably there is wriggle room here for the fire authorities to decide whether or not to charge, but we should be clear about that. I will write and will make sure that that response is in the Library so that we can come back to it before Third Reading, if necessary.</p>

Given that they each also bear the names of the Minister and the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, I have some expectation that they may be acceptable to your Lordships. The Bill currently includes provisions which enable the Secretary of State by order to transfer a local public service function from any person to its elected mayor. In Committee, we sought to amend that by widening its application to local authorities that operated a leader and cabinet executive model of governance. That amendment was eventually withdrawn.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="11091240000021"></a>Additionally, in Committee, we tabled amendments which were prompted by the Core Cities group. These amendments sought equivalent opportunities for the transfer and delegation of functions as were provided to the Mayor of London under the Bill. It was suggested that this approach had cross-party support among the Core Cities group, growing support from the Members of Parliament of the core cities and support from Ministers. In the event, these amendments were not moved on the final day in Committee. Over the Recess, the Government have taken the issue forward with the Core Cities group, hence the amendments today. They also cover the original proposals for transfers to mayors which are replaced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="11091240000022"></a>Amendment 114 provides for the transfer of local public functions from a public authority to a permitted authority. A public function is a function of a public authority. A permitted authority includes a county council in England, a district council and an economic prosperity board. The transfer is achieved by an order of the Secretary of State and may not be made unless it considered that the order would promote economic development or wealth creation, or increase local accountability in relation to each local public function. The Secretary of State must be satisfied that the permitted authority can exercise the function appropriately and has consented to the transfer.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="11091240000023"></a>Amendment 115 permits the delegation to a permitted authority of a Minister's eligible functions, mirroring the provisions of Clause 210, which cover such delegation to the Mayor of London, and on which we touched on earlier amendments. Amendment 116 allows the Secretary of State to make a scheme for the transfer of property rights or liabilities to give effect to a transfer of functions and a delegation of a Minister's eligible functions or their revocation.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="11091240000024"></a>Amendment 117 imposes a duty on the Secretary of State to consider any proposals for the exercise of these powers which come from a permitted authority and to establish criteria by which they must be considered. Amendment 118 crucially sets out a robust super-affirmative procedure for any order which seeks to transfer functions to a permitted authority. Amendment 119 covers definitions. Amendments 151, 161, 163 and 241 are consequential.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="11091240000025"></a>Core Cities is a network of the local authorities of England's eight largest city economies outside London. It includes Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham and Sheffield. The cities drive their local economic areas and make a significant contribution to the national economy. They work in partnership with government to influence policy and to develop new ideas based on knowledge of what works on the ground to improve economic performance and reduce dependency. The Core Cities group has a track record of more than 15 years led by city leaders across all parties.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="11091240000026"></a>The powers in this amendment could be available to anywhere that meets the criteria. However, England's core cities are the main drivers of the country's economy outside London and the south-east. Together, their primary urban areas deliver 27 per cent of the national economy, more than London, and contain 16 million residents. The role of cities is central to delivering national economic outcomes, reducing dependency on public spending, and in driving growth, productivity and tax revenues. Supporting growth in the core cities is vital to rebalance the UK economy.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="11091240000027"></a>With more decentralised arrangements for governance and public finance, these cities would be able to deliver greater economic outcomes for the UK. Recent independent economic forecasts commissioned by Core Cities have demonstrated that the local enterprise partnership areas, given greater control over the drives of growth, are capable of delivering an additional 1 million jobs and £44 billion economic output over the next decade.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_560"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column 560</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="11091240000028"></a>The Bill offers an opportunity through these amendments to create a binding narrative around other localist and decentralising policy, enabling this Government to deliver a distinctive set of urban policies and a legacy of empowered cities driving private sector growth and jobs. The Bill proposes to transfer powers from the London Development Agency and the Homes and Communities Agency to the Mayor of London, and makes provision for further ministerial delegation. Other major economic areas need the same opportunity to be able to drive growth and prosperity for their business and residents, and for the wider economy. The country needs London to do well but, to create an equitable and multicentred national economic strategy, the same chance needs to be given to other areas that are capable of growing employment. England needs a London-plus national economic policy.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="11091240000029"></a>It is the intention of the Core Cities group to seek these powers for its members but it will not be restricted to the core cities and their urban areas. Any economic area that fulfils the eligibility criteria could be able to request these delegations. The overarching aim of the amendment is to drive economic growth and productivity, and reduce dependency. Now is a critical moment for economic recovery and we need to boost local investment and investor confidence. This amendment would support private sector growth and jobs; create new opportunities for efficiency, innovative finance and investment; enable distinctive urban policy and a legacy of empowered cities; ensure continued buying from private sector partners on LEPs; support the implementation of a local government resource review and further incentivise local authorities and their partners; support the implementation of enterprise zones; clarify existing routes of delegation; support double devolution to local communities; support the wider restructuring of subnational economic development architecture; create a route to delegate to further emerging governance structures; and be a significant-I suggest popular-and symbolic step towards decentralisation and localism. I beg to move.</p>

As he rightly said, my noble friend Lord Shipley has added his name to it and was hoping and expecting to be here to speak in support of it. He has been in Manchester all day on government business. I have just heard that he has only just got on a train in Manchester, so I suspect that he will not be here in time to contribute to this debate. However, I have a fairly good idea of what he would have said had he been here, and I speak on his behalf. As someone who has been a London councillor all his adult life, I must say that I had not expected to be speaking on behalf of Core Cities. It is a rare privilege and something I do enthusiastically because I very much support these amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="11091240000031"></a>Both this Government and the previous Administration have made firm commitments to devolution and decentralisation. The Bill now offers an opportunity to hand decision-making powers from central to local government, working in partnership with the private  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_561"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column 561</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sector. The Government's stated aim is to rebalance the economy, focusing on the whole of our national economic system as well as London and the south-east, enabling other places to develop their economies to boost national growth and productivity.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="11091240000032"></a>Devolution has happened at different speeds in different geographies. London will receive further powers through the Bill, and the devolved Assemblies already have powers that are not available directly to cities in England. Without further decentralisation there is a risk that England's core cities, which generate 27 per cent of England's GVA-my noble friend Lord Shipley points out that that is more than London-and other towns and cities will be unable to perform to their full potential and support nationwide growth and enterprise. Recent independent forecasts by Oxford Economics demonstrate that the core cities' eight local enterprise partnership areas are capable of delivering an additional 1 million jobs and £44 billion GVA over the next decade, given the tools to do so.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="11091240000033"></a>This enabling amendment creates a route to these tools to ministerial delegation and the transfer of public service functions for economic development and wealth creation to single and combined authorities in England. Any such actions would be subject to competency tests, including strong local governance and private sector buy-in, evidence that growth can be delivered and sound arrangements to work across administrative boundaries.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="11091240000034"></a>The potential of the amendment would be open to any place, as the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, has said, that can demonstrate that it can pass the competency tests that the Government will set out. It will ensure that local areas have the powers and financial autonomy to deliver local solutions to their challenges, and that further legislation will not be needed to pass these powers to cities' civic and business leaders. Any major transfers will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="11091240000035"></a>The amendment would support private sector growth and new opportunities for investment, ensure continued buy-in from private sector partners on LEPs, support the implementation of policy to incentivise places to deliver growth, support double devolution to local communities, and be a significant step towards decentralisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="11091240000036"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, has said, these amendments enjoy support from at least three sides of the House and, I hope, passive support from the fourth. Therefore, I am very pleased to be able to support them.</p>

My only comment is to say how much has changed since I was in charge of local authorities back in the 1980s. It is a change that is entirely welcome. This is a far more positive approach than anything I had to deal with at that time. Perhaps a veil might be drawn over that period; it was a very unhappy period for much of local government. I thoroughly support these clauses and I congratulate the core cities on the work they have done to bring all this forward.</p>

I do not want to be a wet blanket but I am slightly concerned about the sweeping powers that will be given to the Minister, and I should like to feel satisfied that the super-affirmative resolution that was referred to will come into force and work. It is very important, particularly as over the years we will get changes of government. The provision is universally approved of, and when I hear my noble friend Lord Jenkin, who has vast experience in this field, favouring it, then I can do nothing but agree.</p>

<p><a name="st_174"></a>
<a name="11091240000039"></a><b><a name="110912-0002.htm_spnew28"></a><a name="11091240000090"></a>Lord Beecham:</b> My Lords, I congratulate my noble friend Lord McKenzie on moving the amendment, working very hard to ensure that it is in an acceptable form and persuading the Minister that it represents the right policy. I must congratulate the Minister and the Government on making the most significant concession, if you will, that we have had so far in terms of the Bill. This is the most localist part of the entire Bill, and the Minister and her colleagues deserve to be congratulated on that. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Tope, also should be congratulated. We have had an almost biblical experience tonight. The voice was the voice of the noble Lord, Lord Tope, but the words were the words of the noble Lord, Lord Shipley-however, they were none the less persuasive for that.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="11091240000040"></a>Incidentally, the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, has done well to be in Manchester today. Were he travelling down by the east coast main line this afternoon he would not get here. I understand that winds have blown down trees on the east coast line and things are massively disrupted. Perhaps one day somebody will do something about the rail network and make sure that these incidents are less apt to cause damage.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="11091240000041"></a>However, I must say in reference to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, that it was my pleasure to work with him, up to a point, when he chaired the Inner City Partnership committee as Secretary of State in Newcastle and Gateshead in the 1980s. I was then the leader of the council, a position that I relinquished-not before time, many people thought-some 17 years ago. It would have been helpful to have had the kind of powers conferred by this amendment-assuming it is passed, as I take it it will be-on local government.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="11091240000042"></a>As some of your Lordships will be aware, I am not an enthusiast for elected mayors by any means. I am therefore glad that the original restriction has been abandoned because it seems to me important that councils with the more conventional model of leader and executive should have this opportunity. Indeed, they have earned this opportunity. I refer particularly to the leader of Manchester City Council and his authority, which has blazed a trail in terms of urban regeneration and activities, not just for its authority but as one of the leading authorities in the Greater Manchester area of the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities, which now has parliamentary authority for a unique structure so far in terms of English local government.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_563"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column 563</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110912-0002.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="11091240000043"></a>Certainly the conferment of these wider powers is very welcome, particularly as I fear that some of the other changes in government policy will have an adverse effect on what everybody intends to happen, which is that the economic prosperity of these areas should be reinforced and, we hope, expanded.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="11091240000044"></a>I think that the Government erred in dismantling the regional structures, acknowledging that much of the work has to be at the sub-regional level, and therefore led by local authorities, in particular by the core cities. The disappearance, certainly in the north-east region of the Regional Development Agency has not been helpful. LEPs may be working in some places, but I do not think that they necessarily fill the gap. While I cannot speak for other parts of the country, certainly in the north-east I am bound to say with regret that an outbreak of parochialism, if not tribalism, is actually diminishing the capacity of what is a fairly compact region to deal with these issues. One hopes that the conferment of powers under this Bill will to a degree remedy that deficiency, but it is not axiomatic that authorities which are not so far being regarded as core cities will either seek these powers or use them in a collaborative way.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="11091240000045"></a>Later in the Bill we will talk about the duty to co-operate. It is a political duty rather than a legal one at the moment, so it remains to be seen how, in terms of planning, that duty can be strengthened. If the good intentions of this amendment are to be implemented, that will require a more constructive attitude on the part of some authorities than has been evident in the recent past. However, more than that is needed; it also requires a buy-in from a range of government departments and agencies. The Department for Communities and Local Government has set out its stall, but it remains to be seen whether other departments will, as it were, shop at that stall. There are some reasons to be concerned about that. One stems from the decision of the Government to abolish the regional offices and take back into Whitehall those civil servants up and down the country who became part of the dialogue between local areas and the Government in Whitehall. In my and others' view, that local intelligence cannot simply be replaced by people sitting, in the case of Newcastle, in an office nearly 300 miles away, although the distances will differ. These people will not have a day-to-day acquaintance with the needs of an area or with local leaders, whether they be political or business leaders. In the north-east and no doubt elsewhere we found over many years that those who served in the Government offices became powerful and useful advocates for the regions and cities with the main departments in Whitehall.

<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="11091240000046"></a>Beyond that, there is the question of what is happening to the community budgets. These are the replacement for the Total Place programme initiated at the suggestion of the Local Government Association, but adopted by the previous Government. The intention has been to pool resources across government departments and work to a common agenda which would differ according to each locality. That is the principle which has been piloted with some success. However, I have been making inquiries through parliamentary Questions about the degree to which there has in fact been any buy-in by government departments to this agenda. It is totally

Apparently no one is even collating this information, let alone trying to ensure that departments are working with each other and their local partners on this programme. If that is the case for the policy that has been deployed until now, one has to wonder whether other departments will, in practice, fulfil the Government's intentions-I repeat, I applaud them on adopting the policy set out in the amendment-in terms of the actual devolution of functions. If they are not prepared to co-operate and pool budgets in a joint way, will they seek to devolve functions to and through local government?</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="11091240000047"></a>One can imagine a range of such functions, not least in the area in which my noble friend will have the good fortune to lead for the Opposition tomorrow and for some time hence, that of welfare reform. There are clear possibilities for much of the work being carried out in terms of employment, benefits and getting people from welfare into work to be done through local government and for responsibilities to be devolved in that respect. I hope that the Government will not simply wait for departments to come forward with proposals, but will positively promote the idea of piloting different approaches and services in authorities with a track record and whose capacity will in any event have to be recognised under the terms of the amendment.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="11091240000048"></a>It seems that this amendment has great potential for changing the way we respond to local needs and circumstances in a manner that reflects the strengths and opportunities as well as the weaknesses of a local and regional economy, and indeed those who make the decisions within it. But it needs to be driven across Whitehall. I do not know whether that would be a function of the Minister for Cities. Potentially it might be one, and I understand that the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, is an unpaid adviser in that department. After spending many years in opposition and a few years in power in Newcastle, he is well qualified to assist the Minister, if that is the position. But again, this really does need to be driven from the top of Government, let alone by the Department for Communities and Local Government, however worthy it is in this respect. It is early days of course, and I do not know whether the Minister will be able to indicate whether there have been any discussions across the departments about how these matters might be progressed. Of course, we have only just had the amendment put before us so these are early days, but it would be reassuring if the Minister could say whether, at the very least, the Secretary of State would seek to work with Cabinet colleagues, the Local Government Association and perhaps a selection of the local authorities to explore in a coherent way how, while allowing for variation and experimentation, the intentions of this very worthy amendment could be implemented. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.</p>

It is very appropriate that something like this is done on a cross-party basis. As the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, said, these are big powers that are very localist in nature and will do precisely what local government has wanted for a long time. It is therefore appropriate that they are now being presented in a way that enables us all to join in.</p>

I hope that I shall be able to answer some of them. However, we have learnt from him that the railway line to Newcastle is not operating because of fallen trees. That is useful to know at this stage in case we all suddenly want to run off and go there. I am also grateful to my noble friend Lord Jenkin for expressing his support. We recognise that things have moved on a long way from the days when he was a very distinguished Secretary of State who was extremely supportive of local government.

They combine the amendments that allowed for the transfer and delegation of functions to local authorities as originally tabled by the Opposition Front Bench in Committee with a power a transfer functions to elected mayors as set out in new Section 9HA which, as a consequence, we are now withdrawing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="11091251000003"></a>We envisage that often proposals for the transfer or delegation of functions will be made in support of local enterprise partnerships-the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, was not quite so keen on that.

That would require that the order be laid in draft for 60 days, during which formal representations would be made. After this the order would have to be approved by a resolution of each House before it could come into being.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="11091251000005"></a>Last autumn we published our <I>Local Growth</I> White Paper, which set out the Government's approach to the delivery of economic development functions following the abolition of regional development agencies. The White Paper stated that while the Government will look to devolve functions to the local level where it makes sense, certain functions are best co-ordinated at a national level. I need to stress to the House that this new power, to which we are all signed up, does not mean that we intend to unpick the arrangements for the national delivery of certain economic development functions as set out in publications such as the <I>Local Growth</I> White Paper and skills strategy. Those would not be able to be devolved.</p>

Accordingly, Amendment 151 deletes Sections 9HA and 9HB from Schedule 2 to the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="11091251000007"></a>I have also asked about other departments' agreement to the transfer of functions and how that would come about. Decisions relating to the transfer of functions would be a collective agreement by all of government; not only individual departments but government as a whole would be willing to take that on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="11091251000008"></a>We expect to respond-the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, asked about this-to proposals from cities for functions and powers that they wish to take on, and each city will need to put forward its proposal and a case for piloting new approaches. Those are the nuts and bolts of how this will work.</p>

However, if at any stage anyone wants to know either from me or from the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, what the amendments achieve, I would be delighted to explain it to them, but I do not think the House need be worried with them all at this stage. I am delighted to support the amendments.</p>

As he said, the climate has changed since he was Secretary of State. I remember some of those days with a district authority in Luton. If I except Newcastle, there was the odd Labour-controlled authority in those days to which we, even on these Benches, would not have been overly keen to transfer these sorts of powers.</p>

I should reiterate that credit for this goes to the Core Cities Group. It originated it and raised it with us. I know that it raised it with the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, and I thank the noble Lord, Lord Tope, for speaking on his behalf today.

<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="11091251000016"></a>The matter was debated in another place and in this House on 20 June. In response to an amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, the Secretary of State for Transport sought agreement to include suitable provisions in the Localism Bill, and this was given. The amendment provides an appropriate broader general power for integrated transport authorities and their passenger transport executives. For consistency,

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="11091251000017"></a>The main reason why these bodies need such a power is that local authorities using similar powers to the ITA's existing incidental and well-being powers have been the subject of successful legal challenge. Integrated transport authorities and their passenger transport executives have therefore been unwilling to undertake activities and enterprises that are not expressly prescribed in law. The view that they could be successfully challenged has been supported by legal opinion obtained by the Passenger Transport Executives Group. An example provided by PTEG of the activities that they are seeking to use the new powers for is the provision of back-office functions for transport smart cards, similar to Oyster cards in London, to local authorities not in an ITA area or in another integrated transport authority area. Because providing and charging for such an activity is not expressly permitted by existing legislation, they fear legal challenge.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="11091251000018"></a>The potential benefits of integrated transport authorities being able to let their passenger transport executives undertake such operations for others is that they will be able to realise the economies of scale from providing similar services to a number of bodies. The bodies wishing to use these services will also benefit from obtaining the service more cost-effectively from an organisation that is already doing something very similar. The cost savings realised by both provider and client can be passed on to council tax payers. In the case of the service provider, this will be the metropolitan district councils in the area concerned. In the case of the client organisations, this will be either local authorities outside an ITA area or the metropolitan district councils within another ITA area.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para91"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="11091251000019"></a>The suggested amendment to government Amendment 119B in the name of the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie of Luton, is unnecessary because we are satisfied that where it serves some purpose in relation to a body's function, collective action is already covered in the drafting of the new broader general power to be found in proposed new Clause 102B(1). Noble Lords will be aware that the parliamentary draftsmen undertake their work with great care. We are at one with what powers we want to grant and we should trust the parliamentary draftsmen to get it right on our behalf.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="11091251000020"></a>On government Amendment 119D, I have just explained to your Lordships our argument for providing integrated transport authorities and PTEs with wider general powers. This amendment seeks to do the same for combined authorities and economic prosperity boards, which are intended to provide stable governance mechanisms for long-term strategic decision-making on economic issues. In bringing groups of relevant authorities together, both are expected to be based upon meaningful economic geography. Where a combined authority is established for an area, it will be responsible for the transport functions in place of an ITA as well as having economic development and regeneration powers. Currently, one combined authority has been established in Greater Manchester. Economic prosperity boards are similar to combined authorities but without the transport functions. There are presently no economic prosperity boards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="11091251000021"></a>Given that broader powers are being given to integrated transport authorities, it is essential that these powers are also made available to combined authorities and economic prosperity boards to ensure that they can effectively discharge their economic objectives. Indeed, given the close interrelationship between economic development and transport, it would be unreasonable not to confer these broader powers upon both bodies and would undermine their ability to deliver sustainable economic growth. I beg to move.</p>

The Minister explained their purpose very well, but it seems to me that the pendulum is swinging from local authorities, PTEs and ITAs et cetera getting a bit frightened of what they are allowed to do to something that is beginning to look like a Henry VIII clause in the transport field. That is probably quite a good thing, actually. It seems that they are going to be given powers to do anything. Perhaps the noble Earl could explain whether this could include, in respect of the integrated transport authorities or the passenger transport executives, things such as operating rail franchises if they felt like it. Could they take a bigger role in sponsoring and deciding how the franchises were run, and what would be the extent of their financial commitment to it?</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para94"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="11091251000023"></a>Could those authorities go as far as was recently planned in Merseyside: for Merseytravel to run a vertically integrated railway and take over the infrastructure from Network Rail? It was interesting that that authority had been lobbying to do this for at least five years, if not 10, but then just as the McNulty report, which might have encouraged them to do it, came out it decided that it was not going to do it because it was too risky. However, it is an interesting option that may be open to other authorities. What will they do in running trams and operating buses? The prospect of even better integration between different types of services would be good, if it happened.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="11091251000024"></a>Would those authorities run something like Crossrail? I do not know, but then comes another question. Since they cannot borrow money-that seems quite clear-could they introduce road user charging or a congestion charging system, as Manchester tried to do? It was a great mistake that that was voted down in a referendum, but then I suppose you do not really need to ask motorists whether they would like to pay more to come into a town. You know what the answer is going to be. If the money was going to be used for some pretty good transport system such as Manchester has, especially with trams, it is a bit sad that it did not go that way. However, those authorities might be able to do this in future if these amendments are accepted.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para96"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="11091251000025"></a>I wonder whether those authorities would be able to become developers in their own right. We know that there will be a few pence on the business rates to pay for Crossrail within London, but one way to earn revenue for what you might call urban transport schemes is to make some money out of the developments that will happen above the interchange points or stations

That has of course been perfected in Hong Kong over many years. We do not seem to be very keen on that, but it would be rather good if some of these authorities could do it. I do not know whether ideas such as that are included in the powers in this Bill.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para97"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="11091251000026"></a>I have one specific point on proposed new Clause 102C(5), on page 15 of the Marshalled List, which I do not quite understand. It says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_105"></a><a name="11091251000232"></a>"Section 102B(1)(e) does not authorise an ITA to do things for a commercial purpose in relation to a person if a statutory provision requires the ITA to do those things in relation to the person".</p>

<p><a name="11091251000194"></a>I am no parliamentary draftsman, but the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, said that they always get it right. If that is the case, and I am sure that it is, perhaps he can explain what it means because it does not mean a lot to me. I also notice that if any local authority gets something wrong, if the Secretary of State does not like what it is doing he seems to be able to stop anything that he wants. However, that could be quite a breath of fresh air to local authorities, and I hope that they will grasp the nettle and try things out. I hope that they will be able to raise money from those who can afford to pay, because we would get a much better transport infrastructure network in these important areas if that happens.</p>

I come from an area that has been well served by a passenger transport authority and executive for many years. We have a pretty good bus system and a metro system, which was initiated by a Conservative Government in the 1970s-ad idem again across the Floor-and extended more recently. It is very successful but its powers in relation to private bus companies are circumscribed. That is a source of frustration, at least to that passenger transport executive, and I wonder whether the Bill will actually open the possibility of a different relationship between the authority and the bus companies. Incidentally, I suppose I ought to declare an interest as the holder of a bus pass and a concessionary metro pass.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para98"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="11091251000028"></a>I know from my own experiences as a ward councillor, but also from general issues arising from transport, that the feeling is that there is insufficient leverage in the hands of the executive in relation to private contractors. That is one question, and, again, if it is not possible to give an answer immediately, subsequently will be quite satisfactory.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para99"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="11091251000029"></a>The other issue relates to the Highways Agency. One can well envisage circumstances in which the role of the Highways Agency may be quite important to the transport plans of an executive, and, indeed, to the delivery of transport services. Again, in my experience, it is not always the most amenable government agency that one has to deal with. I know that the experience of the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, is different-we have had a conversation to that effect-but, certainly, there is at least some potential for a different relationship between an authority with the powers that will conferred on it by this Bill and the Highways Agency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="11091251000030"></a>Going back to where we left the discussion on core cities, the same principle applies. Will there be buy-in not only from the Department for Transport but in particular from that executive agency, which is very influential and needs to co-operate with the body charged with the delivery of local transport? Of course, the Highways Agency does not deal, generally speaking, with the road network in towns and cities. Nevertheless, in a sub-regional area such as Tyne and Wear, Greater Manchester or elsewhere, there is a relationship between their activities and programmes and those of the executive. I wonder whether any enlightenment might be cast upon that issue. Again, I do not necessarily expect a reply off the cuff, and if it is more convenient I would be happy to receive a written communication in due course.</p>

Amendment 119BA seeks simply to ensure that the powers conferred can be pursued either alone or collectively with one or more ITA. I accept entirely the Minister's confirmation that it can and that this amendment is not necessary. I am pleased that that is on the record. As the noble Earl said, we moved amendments in Committee to achieve a general power of competence for ITAs similar to that given to fire and rescue authorities in the Bill. These replicated amendments moved by my honourable friend Barbara Keeley in another place. The Minister there explained that these were matters for the Department for Transport and were under consideration. That, indeed, was the response when we debated the amendments in Committee here, but the Government committed to take matters further, which they have done. They have fulfilled their obligation to the House and we are happy to support these amendments.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, asked about extension of powers possibly covering rail franchising and Henry VIII powers in this amendment. Primary legislation would be required to allow the ITAs to be involved in franchising outside their area. If such changes are required, the Government will look for a legislative opportunity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="11091251000033"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Beecham, mentioned the Highways Agency. He will understand that the Highways Agency is concerned with the strategic road network, but I am confident that it will work closely with local authorities. The noble Lord also asked about powers relating to local bus services in ITA areas. ITAs set a broad strategy for public transport, including buses. Most bus services in an ITA area are run on a commercial basis. ITAs are responsible, where they see fit, for topping up-in other words, adding extra services. There are some detailed questions and I will ensure that we get a full answer to all the questions. A copy will of course be placed in the Library. I beg to move.</p>

The legislation as drafted allows the Secretary of State to make provision for changes in such arrangements. The thrust of these amendments is to ensure that the changes stem from proposals made by the individual authorities affected, rather than are initiated from Whitehall and the Secretary of State himself. The amendments go on to refer to the principles upon which such changes should be made. Clause 9BA(6) says that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_175"></a><a name="11091251000302"></a>"The conditions are ... that the operation by the authority of the proposed arrangements would be an improvement on the arrangements which the authority has in place for the discharge of its functions".</p>

<p><a name="11091251000035"></a>That seems to me an unnecessarily narrow prescription. They ought to be, as the Bill goes on to say,</p>
<ul><a name="11091251000376"></a>"likely to ensure that the decisions of the authority are taken in an efficient, transparent and accountable way".</ul>
<p><a name="11091251000036"></a>My amendment incorporates that phrase, but goes on to say that the arrangements would be appropriate for all local authorities, or for any particular local authority, to consider and-this is the important part of the amendment-that the arrangements are consistent with the principles of localism and representative local democracy, a phrase that, as far as I am aware, does not appear anywhere else in the Bill.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para102"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="11091251000037"></a>In our discussion at Second Reading and from time to time in Committee, noble Lords on all sides of your Lordships' House stressed the importance of representative local democracy as a necessary part of any localism agenda. That should be reflected in the consideration of any Government's arrangements. I do not think that it is necessary to confine any changes to where they would after all, in the view of the Secretary of State, represent an improvement. There is no particular need, in my judgment, for that. They should certainly not represent any lessening of the efficacy of those arrangements, but they could be different without necessarily representing an improvement, in the eyes of the Secretary of State, as long as they meet the criteria of transparency, efficiency and accountability and are consistent with the principles of localism and representative local democracy. That should be sufficient.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para103"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="11091251000038"></a>I hope that the Minister, if she is dealing with these amendments, will regard them as friendly rather than unfriendly. They are designed to reinforce what is said to be the thrust of the legislation but in a way that, first, places the initiative with the local authority rather than the Secretary of State for providing that the criteria are met, but secondly-again, I stress this-emphasises that the principles of representative local democracy should be met in any such change. I beg to move.</p>

We accept that most proposals for additional governance models will come from local authorities. That will be how the impact will go given their expertise as practitioners. However, Amendment 119F still fails to recognise that ideas and proposals about new governance models may also come from other sources. The amendment says that the Secretary of State cannot do anything without having a proposal put to him. We need to make it clear that those proposals could come not only from local government but from local government representatives, think tanks or research units. Therefore, they might not be sufficiently well formed for the Government to take them on board. Saying that the Secretary of State may implement something only after a suggestion has been put forward may be restrictive, although the noble Lord is also saying that the Secretary of State should not be able to dream up a form of governance and then try to implement it. That is not the sense of this legislation. I hear what the noble Lord says, but that is not the intention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="11091251000040"></a>In any case, if the Secretary of State decided to do that, he would be forcing local authorities to do something that they may not want to do and that is not the intention behind these provisions. We are not going to force local authorities. They would not have to adopt arrangements set out in any regulations made under this provision. This is an empowering clause not a diktat clause.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para105"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="11091251000041"></a>In Amendment 119G, the conditions that the noble Lord suggests are, if I may put it politely, less useful for local authorities than the existing ones. It does not seem unreasonable that there should be an explicit requirement that any proposed new arrangements should be an improvement on what is already there. There are three areas of governance listed in the Bill and anything else would have to be an improvement on what is there. I believe that the existing conditions give clarity for local authorities that may be considering submitting a proposal and we would not want to change that.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para106"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="11091251000042"></a>Finally, I remind noble Lords that any regulations made under this provision would simply extend the range of choice of governance models available to local authorities. They would not have to adopt those arrangements. They would be one more in addition to that list of three if somebody can think of something remarkable to do.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para107"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="11091251000043"></a>I hope that with that explanation the noble Lord will be able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

But this is a consolidation Bill. As one who has served on the Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills, I know well enough that on consolidation one is not allowed to change substantive law. I emphasise that the amendments that I have tabled and the comments  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_582"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column 582</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that I am about to make bear no ill reflection whatever on the Bill team or the parliamentary draftsman. Indeed, I have had the utmost co-operation from all of them.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para108"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="11091251000046"></a>However, with a Bill that affects the voluntary sector in particular, one must seek to make that measure as comprehensible as possible. I could not refrain from tabling a set of amendments to attempt to make the crucial definition clauses of the Bill fractionally more understandable to the lay reader. The last thing one wants in the world when legislating for the voluntary sector is to force it into the hands of lawyers who will do their best but who, I am afraid, are expensive beasts. I speak as one of 53 years duration. The amendments taken as a group effect no change but they see the definition of "charitable purpose" or "charitable purposes" brought into one clause, Clause 2, which will then enable Clause 11 to be removed from the Bill. In practical terms, that will be of considerable benefit.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para109"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="11091251000047"></a>Before explaining why, I should say to the Committee that I am aware that Section 73 of the Charities Act 2006 requires a review of the 2006 Act, which is about to commence, which will end with a report being placed before Parliament. Indeed, I was instrumental, with others, in getting that unusual provision written into the 2006 Act. But there is nothing in the Act to say that anything shall flow from the report. I produced this amendment determined that at least in the interim years-one could be talking about quite a few years, even an eternity, before any amendments are made to this Bill-the definition clause should be a little more understandable.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para110"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="11091251000048"></a>Why is it more understandable? I wish sometimes that one could annex to technical amendments such as this a copy of the clause they seek to amend, incorporating the amendments. The amendments seek to get rid of Clause 11, which defines "charitable purposes" or "charitable purpose" differently from the definition in Clause 2. Clause 1 defines "charity" in a way which is difficult to reconcile. It is reconcilable but only by dint of considerable legal subtlety. It is already difficult to reconcile Clause 1 with Clause 2. The last thing in the world one wants is for the unwary reader-that is to say he or she who does not plough all the way through the Bill-then to find that there is a different definition of "charitable purposes" in Clause 11. As I say, that in itself represents a significant practical improvement in the Bill because the definition of "charitable purpose" or "charitable purposes"-those two phrases are used in different places in the Bill-and the definition of "charity" itself are the linchpin definitions of the entire Bill.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para111"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="11091251000049"></a>I had hoped to simplify the Bill further. However, I received a communication from the Bill team which made clear that the extent of the use of the phrase "charitable purposes" or "charitable purpose" is unknown. The Committee may think it rather extraordinary that we have no place to which anyone, including the parliamentary draftsman, can go to be informed about all the uses of the phrase "charitable purposes" throughout our primary and secondary legislation. There is no such source of information. In the age of technical wizardry that defect could and should be resolved, not just for the benefit of the experts but for the many who  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_583"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column 583</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will have to interpret this and many other statutory provisions in the future. As one of the letters that I received from the Bill team stated, there are what they call "known unknowns"-I like that phrase-which is another way of saying "We haven't a clue". The document continues:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_177"></a><a name="11091251000304"></a>"While we are able relatively easily to search the database of General Public Acts for references to 'charitable purposes', the same cannot be said of subordinate legislation (as defined for the purposes of clause 2), not all of which is stored in the available databases, or private Acts, hardly any of which are in the available databases".</p>

<p><a name="11091251000195"></a>I have tabled my modest but, I think, significant amendment in the hope that the Government may say that they think it is an improvement but in the expectation that, given the complexity of the whole-I nearly used a Saxon word-business, they will need further time in order to clear the decks as regards simplifying these crucial clauses. I look forward to hearing what my noble friend has to say in replying to these amendments. I am grateful for the Committee's patience.</p>

There is an enormous number of charities and sometimes it is extremely difficult to be clear whether they truly are charities. I say that as a patron of several small charities from their outset. One often has a sense of when a "charitable purpose" really is a charitable purpose and when it is stretching the limits, but that has implications for donors and the Charity Commission. The reference to "known unknowns" is reasonable. In many aspects of life we know that new situations will arise but we do not know what they will be. The danger is that matters can be contested at a later stage. The noble Lord has thrown down a rather wonderful challenge to the Government. I look forward to hearing their response.</p>

As the Minister knows, we welcome this consolidation. The comments that have been made highlight what the legislation seeks to achieve. The noble Lord raised similar issues at Second Reading. I have to confess that he lost me somewhat when he spoke in that debate. However, I have carefully read the points that he made. It strikes me that we are attempting to make the legislation more straightforward, less complex and easier but we are not making it easy. I noted that the noble Lord mentioned making the measure more understandable to the lay person. I am not sure that we are ever able to make such legislation more understandable to the lay person. This is very much a lawyer's issue. My noble friend Lord Boateng has queried whether people need a lawyer to help them set up a charity. If the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, will forgive my saying so, I fear that we have two lawyers and three opinions on this issue as it seems to comprise an argument between lawyers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="11091251000052"></a>I confess that I do not understand the legal complexities which would allow me to make a distinction between "charitable purpose" or "charitable purposes". I cannot see the difference between those two phrases. However, I fully understand the necessity to get definitions right so as to avoid long drawn out arguments in court. I have carefully read the report of the Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills. We should be grateful to it for considering the points that we put to it. It has also considered the point that the noble Lord has made. All I can do is to seek advice on this from the Minister. I am sure that she has received legal advice on whether this is a justifiable concern. Is she able to share that legal advice with us? If there is an issue around the definition, how significant will that be in terms of interpretation? Her advice would be helpful in enabling the Committee to reach a conclusion on this matter and in reassuring us that the Bill does what it seeks to do and that the definition is satisfactory.</p>

I welcome the opportunity to try to explain the Government's position as clearly as I can.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para113"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="11091251000054"></a>I welcome the knowledge and expertise of my noble friend Lord Phillips in charity law and his assiduousness in scrutinising legislation that affects charities. I know that he has taken a very close interest in the consolidation Bill. Earlier this year he raised a number of points with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Carswell, the chairman of the Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills. He has also since then discussed various points with the Bill team in considerable detail. As a result, we have been able to make some important drafting improvements at the Joint Committee stage and we are extremely grateful to my noble friend for that.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para114"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="11091251000055"></a>The amendments tabled by my noble friend concern the relationship between Clauses 2 and 11. I know that my noble friend's object here is to make further drafting improvements. However, the discussions we have engaged in with him have indicated that his concerns go deeper than that. As a result, we have already undertaken to address the underlying problem that he has raised. This can be done only outside the consolidation process. I shall explain that in a little more detail in a moment but perhaps I may just set the context for this discussion. Clauses 2 and 11 reproduce the existing law as it has stood since the passing of the Charities Act 2006. We are not aware of anyone having expressed concerns about these provisions at the time of the passing of the 2006 Act. Furthermore, at no point in the consultation process on the present Bill has anyone expressed any concerns about the relationship between Clauses 2 and 11. The draft Bill was the subject of full public consultation in 2009 and has the support of the charities sector and the Charity Commission.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para115"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="11091251000056"></a>I should explain that Clauses 2 and 11 contain two subtly different definitions of "charitable purpose", one of a very general application and the other of a much more limited application. Two types of suggestion have been made about the relationship between these clauses. The first involves changing the law; the second aims simply to improve the drafting of the Bill. The suggestion between Second Reading and the Joint Committee proceedings was of the first type. It was  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_585"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column 585</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>suggested that instead of the two subtly different meanings of "charitable purpose" applying in different contexts, there should be one definition of "charitable purpose" applying across the board. Unfortunately, substituting a single definition of "charitable purpose" cannot be achieved without changing the law. It is not permissible within the constraints of the consolidation process for the Bill to change the law. So no amendments were tabled at Joint Committee to Clauses 2 or 11, and the Joint Committee agreed to the clauses as drafted.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para116"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="11091251000057"></a>The amendments that my noble friend has now tabled aim to improve the drafting of the Bill without changing the law. However, we are not convinced that this is the right response to the real issue that my noble friend has raised. The fundamental issue-it is one that we recognise-is that it is awkward to have two definitions of "charitable purpose" applying in different contexts. The amendments that the noble Lord has tabled do not remove this awkwardness; they merely present it differently. We think that the right thing to do is not to make drafting changes to the Bill, but instead to seek to address the underlying issue.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para117"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="11091251000058"></a>We recognise that it could be a desirable simplification to substitute the two definitions applying in different contexts by a single definition applying across the board. However, it is clear that this cannot be done through this Bill. I have therefore already suggested to my noble friend that it can be considered as part of the forthcoming review of the Charities Act 2006. It appears that there is a case for simplification here, and we believe that the review is the right place to explore thoroughly the legal changes that would be required to achieve this simplification.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para118"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="11091251000059"></a>I return to the amendments before us. The drafting of the consolidation Bill is a very technical business and the provisions have already been very clearly considered and given a clean bill of health by the Joint Committee. However, my noble friend has tabled what amount to detailed drafting points so I will explain why we resist these amendments.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para119"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="11091251000060"></a>I will begin by saying that we think that the way in which the definitions of "charity" and "charitable purpose" are structured in the Bill is an improvement on the current legislation. In particular, putting the 1993 Act definitions in Part 1 of the Bill next to the 2006 Act definitions makes them more visible to the reader. In the Government's view, my noble friend's amendments would not improve this drafting. First, we think that the amendments would damage the logical structure of Part 1 of the Bill by taking a definition that belongs in Chapter 2 and putting it into Chapter 1 where it does not belong. I will explain that in a little more detail. As is clear from its title, Part 1 of the Bill is concerned with the definitions of "charity" and "charitable purpose". Chapter 1 of Part 1 deals with definitions that apply generally-that is, in legislation generally and in documents, and in England and Wales as well as, for certain purposes, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Chapter 2 of Part 1 deals with definitions that have a much more limited application-that is, they apply only in England and Wales, and only to provisions deriving from the Charities Act 1993. The different scope of the two chapters is signalled by  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_586"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column 586</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the chapter titles. Chapter 1 is headed "General" and Chapter 2 is headed "Special provision for this Act". It is not a drafting improvement to interfere with this structure.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para120"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="11091251000061"></a>Furthermore, we think it is undesirable to confuse the picture for readers in Scotland and Northern Ireland by injecting into Chapter 1 a definition that concerns the interpretation of provisions that relate only to England and Wales. Chapter 1 affects the law of Scotland and Northern Ireland for certain purposes relating loosely to fiscal matters.</p>

<a name="110912-0002.htm_para121"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="11091251000062"></a>Finally, in our view the amendments would be inconsistent in that they would leave two alternative definitions of "charity" in Chapters 1 and 2. If the two alternative definitions of "charitable purpose" are brought together in the way suggested, it would seem illogical to leave the two definitions of "charity" in separate places.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="11091251000063"></a>I am keen that progress on this Bill is not unduly delayed. I therefore ask the noble Lord to accept the assurances that I have offered him. Of course, he will have a further opportunity to debate this matter when the 2006 Act comes under review later in the year. I am sure that my noble friend's expertise would be very welcome at any further deliberations on the matters of concern that he has raised in his amendments. We are willing to ensure that the underlying issue to which he has helpfully drawn attention is addressed in its proper forum. On that basis, I invite him to withdraw his drafting amendment.</p>

She made the point about Part 1 and Chapter 1 applying to England and Wales generally, although to Scotland and Northern Ireland to some extent. That point is not apparent at all from the way in which Clause 11 is currently drafted. While I will of course withdraw the amendment tonight, as I told her I would, I would like to engage in further discussion on this issue in the hope that something can be done to improve things before we get to Report. I will just tell the House-because it is another measure of what a nonsense we have got our affairs into-that last year the Finance Act created an entirely new definition of "charitable purposes" with a schedule extending that definition that runs to eight pages. I am afraid that our legal system has burgeoned out of all sense and has become counterproductive. With that vindictive spirit, I withdraw my amendment.</p>

Having considered the issues carefully, including with the Centre for Public Scrutiny, I am pleased to bring forward amendments which achieve a number of these aims.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="11091251000071"></a>On the removal of unnecessary restrictions on referral of matters by non-committee members, Amendments 134 to 139 remove prescription about matters which may be referred to a scrutiny committee by councillors who are not members of the scrutiny committee. In future, these councillors will not be restricted to the referral of local government matters only. Instead, they may refer a wider range of matters to scrutiny committees for consideration, thus enhancing their role as advocates of their local communities.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="11091251000072"></a>In terms of referral of matters to the scrutiny committee, the amendments broaden the range of issues that can be brought before that committee by non-committee members. It will, of course, remain for the scrutiny committee to decide what course of action is appropriate following any referral, as is the case now.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="11091251000073"></a>With regard to local improvement targets and local area agreements, Amendments 140, 142 and 147 remove the link between local government scrutiny and local improvement targets in local area agreements. Partner authorities will be required to have regard to the reports and recommendations of scrutiny committees that relate to any of their functions exercised in relation to the committee's area or residents of that area. This empowers local authorities to hold partner authorities to account for wider activities they undertake, thus ensuring that local people have a say on matters that affect them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="11091251000074"></a>On the simplification of local government scrutiny arrangements, our remaining Amendments, 132, 133, 141, 143, 144, 145, 146, 148, 149, 150 and 164, place the scrutiny committees of non-unitary district councils into an equivalent position to those of other authorities. They enable scrutiny committees in non-unitary district councils to hold partner authorities to account, and at the same time the amendments greatly simplify the scrutiny provisions and remove delegated powers of the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="11091251000075"></a>I hope that noble Lords will agree that these amendments represent an improvement to the provisions, and will therefore be happy to accept them.</p>

I hope that noble Lords will forgive me if I have misunderstood something. I say again that I welcome the thrust of the amendments in this group. However, I am not clear about Amendment 133, which refers to page 215 of the Bill. It appears to delete a reference to scrutiny of crime and disorder matters. I may be wrong, but as I read it, the amendment takes out the obligation or possibility of an overview and scrutiny committee scrutinising the police. I may have that wrong: it does not sound right as I say it. However, looking at the drafting, I wonder whether the amendment has that effect. New Section 9F states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_192"></a><a name="11091251000319"></a>"An overview and scrutiny committee of a local authority may not discharge any functions other than ... its functions under this section and sections 9FA to 9FJ, ... its functions under section 19 of the Police and Justice Act".</p>

<p><a name="11091251000196"></a>I would like confirmation that it will still be possible to scrutinise such matters.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="11091251000077"></a>I presume that the passenger transport authorities that we have just referred to, with their extended powers, would potentially be subject to scrutiny as a local authority partner. If that could be confirmed, I would be delighted and would congratulate the Minister on this group of amendments.</p>

I am sure that the intention is to ensure that scrutiny continues, because that is our whole purpose. If I get a note in the coming seconds, I will share it with the noble Lord. If I do not, I will write with the answer and apologise for not being able to respond in person.</p>

It deals with the power of the Secretary of State to make various regulations and prescriptions concerning the election of such mayors, to which new Section 9N of the schedule also relates. I note that the Electoral Commission has taken the view that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_215"></a><a name="11091251000342"></a>"Elections for Mayor are often exciting local affairs, with colourful personalities clashing on issues relevant to their area".</p>

<p><a name="11091251000197"></a>That is an interesting piece of publicity for the concept, which my noble friend Lord Adonis will undoubtedly confirm. However, there are some reservations, to put it mildly, about the strength of the argument behind it, which suggests that elected mayors

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="11091251000080"></a>For the last 11 years, at the request of 5 per cent of the population-and for the last several years, at the request of any council-people have been able to call a referendum to have an elected mayor. Some 39 councils have had referendums: some of them prompted by councils themselves, such as the most recent case of Leicester, and others prompted by popular demand, if such a phrase could be said to extend to a turnout of modest proportions in terms of the required numbers. Looking at the referendums, we can see that the turnout in the vast majority was certainly no greater than normal election turnout. In 12 of those referendums, voters approved the new system. The turnout for the referendums was a modest 20 per cent or thereabouts. In subsequent mayoral elections in those successful authorities, the average turnout was something like 30 per cent. Even in London, where enormous publicity attached itself to the successive elections, the first two turnouts were about 34 and 37 per cent, and the last mayoral election-with two candidates of a particular kind most likely to fit the description provided by the Electoral Commission-produced a turnout of only 45 per cent. So it is certainly questionable whether either the referendum process itself or the eventual turnout in ensuing elections validates the theory that this form of governance is particularly calculated to improve local democracy. The notion that the Secretary of State should prescribe the calling of such referendums and then prescribe in great detail how and when they are to take place is something that needs to be considered against that background.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="11091251000081"></a>The reality is that, when only about 10 per cent of councils actually held referendums and a smaller proportion again-something like 3 per cent of councils in total eligible to have elected mayors-ended up with elected mayors on modest turnouts in those actual elections, one wonders about the thrust of a policy designed to prescribe these potentially everywhere. The Bill does not actually require that at the moment, but it certainly proposes to give the power to the Secretary of State to prescribe elections for mayors all over the country. I do not want to enlarge again on the desirability or otherwise of the mayoral system as opposed to the leader and executive system, but it is plainly wrong for such a decision to be effectively foisted on to communities that have expressed no interest in it.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="11091251000082"></a>What I am not clear about-and again I apologise if I have not detected the relevant clause-is whether, if there is to be a decision to hold a referendum and consequential decisions on how it is to be carried out and how subsequent elections are to be held as provided for in the clause I seek to amend here, those decisions are to be subject to affirmative resolution or are just decisions that the Secretary of State can take without further parliamentary approval. I do not know whether the Minister is able to help; she has, on previous occasions, when that has been an issue, been able to confirm that. I do not know whether she can on this

<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="11091251000083"></a>So far as the powers given to the Secretary of State are concerned, they seem to be excessive. Accordingly, I move the amendment.</p>

<a name="11091251000084"></a><b><a name="110912-0003.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="11091251000425"></a>The Lord Bishop of Birmingham:</b> My Lords, I listened with interest to the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Beecham. I bring before the House an amendment that assumes that there will be a process for elected mayors in the foreseeable future. I was part of a cross-party community group from Birmingham that met the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government last Thursday. We found that our concerns were listened to favourably. They are reflected in the amendment that is before the House this evening. The city of Birmingham is expecting to have a vigorous debate leading up to a referendum in May 2012 on whether to have an elected mayor. As some noble Lords will know, Birmingham has a long tradition of vigorous civic leadership, not least in the past 20 years of the present arrangements. Now, in the largest local authority in the country, in a creative city of many faiths and cultures that trades in a global market, there is a desire for continued and even enhanced strong and vigorous governance.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="11091251000085"></a>In the event of a yes vote, Amendment 151C seeks to have an election for mayor as soon as possible after the referendum. There are two benefits of this that we put to the Secretary of State, which we think he heard favourably, especially when there are vital financial, social and cultural decisions to take. First, we seek to minimise the potential paralysis in leadership over many months between a referendum and an election for a mayor, and secondly-which should be of interest to all of us at this stage-we seek to keep the cost of any mayoral election to a minimum. I do not doubt that there are factors about other elections under consideration, but I ask the Minister to respond favourably to this amendment. If Birmingham and other cities in the country say yes to having a mayor, we expect the mayor to be in post without delay and at minimum cost.</p>

In my role as director of the Institute for Government, I joined the cross-party civic delegation from the city of Birmingham that met the Secretary of State last week and raised the issue that the right reverend Prelate has just described about what will happen after the referendum next May if there were to be a positive vote. The view strongly held in the city of Birmingham, and in other cities where the issue of an elected mayor is being debated at the moment, is that it is unacceptable for there to be a full year's delay between a positive referendum result and the first election of a mayor to take charge of the city's governance. Essentially, we would have a year of paralysis in which the existing administration would be a lame duck. My noble friend Lord Beecham holds strong views against mayors, but I imagine he will agree that it is not a good idea to leave the government of a great city in a state of limbo for a full 12 months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="11091251000087"></a>The purpose of the amendment tabled by the right reverend Prelate, to which I put my name, is to encourage the Secretary of State to align the first mayoral election with any other election that may be taking place in those cities between May 2012 and May 2013, which is fully within the discretion that the Secretary of State has to make regulations specifying the date of the first election. Even if there were not to be an election in those cities earlier than May 2013, it may be that there is a case for the first election of the mayor to take place before that date.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="11091251000088"></a>The Institute for Government published a report a few weeks ago highlighting the paralysis that would follow a positive election result if no election for the mayor were to take place for a year. In that report, we suggested that the first election for the mayor should take place in September 2012. If there is a to be an election for police commissioners across the country in November 2012-a matter to be debated by the House later this week-aligning the first mayoral election with the police commissioner election would make a great deal of sense. It may be that the will of the House and of Parliament will be to move the date of the police commissioner election to a later date. Whatever the date of the first elections to take place in cities with a positive referendum result, the first elections after May 2012 should, by the will of the leaders of those cities, take place a great deal sooner than May 2013, and if it is possible to align them with other elections that would be the best course.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="11091251000089"></a>What we are looking for from the noble Baroness is a sympathetic response to the argument for an early mayoral election where there is a positive vote in the referendums next May and any encouragement that she can give to the concept of aligning the first mayoral election with any election that might take place sooner than May 2013. In particular, if police commissioner elections are to take place in autumn 2012, any words of encouragement she can give as to the willingness of the Government to bring forward regulations that would align the first mayoral elections with those police commissioner elections would be very well received in Birmingham and in the other cities where there may be a positive referendum result next May.</p>

I have an immediate answer to the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, about whether the orders would come to Parliament: where there is a proposal for a referendum, that is an affirmative order in Parliament. I think I explained that in Committee. It is Parliament's decision brought forward at the time of the secondary legislation. Mayors will not be forced on any cities, as I have said on many occasions, but cities will be obliged to take it into consideration in a referendum and those will all come to Parliament.</p>

As the noble Lord,

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="11091251000092"></a>As I have explained previously, the regulating power would allow for an earlier first election than May 2013. Such an approach would be in line with previous practice, where first elections for mayors have on occasion taken place in October, before reverting to the usual May cycle. I know the right reverend Prelate and the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, have had discussions with the Secretary of State about this. The most encouraging I can be is to say that the issue is well understood; no decisions have yet been taken on it but we are due to produce secondary legislation before the end of the year and decisions will be taken before then. I am sure the noble Lords will be involved in some of the discussions on that. I cannot give a firm commitment at the moment that that will happen but, as I say, there is a very clear understanding of the proposals made and the reasons and rationale behind them.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="11091251000093"></a>Those were not very long answers but they were not very long amendments. I ask noble Lords not to press their amendments in the light of my response.</p>

However, I am surprised and disappointed that it should be thought necessary for the Secretary of State to prescribe a referendum when it is evident from the absence of any requisition by a mere 5 per cent of the electorate that there is any such interest from the local community to start with.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="11091251000095"></a>Moving on to the amendment tabled by the right reverend Prelate and supported by my noble friend, I find it surprising that it should be thought that paralysis would ensue if there was a delay of a year between the referendum and a subsequent mayoral election. It could even have been argued that it would have been better to have followed the precedent of the 1973 local government reorganisation, when a shadow authority was elected and did not actually take office for a year. That actually gave the incoming authority time, on new boundaries and all the rest of it, to assimilate the problems of the area and develop an appropriate response, changing structures and the like. To suggest that it is essential to move straight into the position where the nature of the authority changes during the year strikes me as illogical, potentially disruptive and damaging, and in fact onerous for the newly elected incumbent, should there be any newly elected incumbents to that position. He or she would be entering into office half way through the year, unable to do very much at all about the existing budget, and contending with structures that would be difficult to rearrange in a short time.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="11091251000096"></a>Moreover, in terms of cost, surely it would be less expensive to have an election coinciding with the normal municipal election in the following year. I quite take the point made by the noble Baroness that there have been some instances of mid-year referendums, but if one is looking at the issue of cost it is, I should have thought, clearer that there would be a cost saving to have them at the same time as the local election.

In all of the other cities there would need to be a special election held in May 2013 if the election of the mayor were to take place anyway. I assume that my noble friend does not think that paralysis is an issue. I do not understand the read-across with shadow authorities at all-a shadow authority has been created, whereas the mayor by definition has not been elected, so that point does not hold. I assume that my noble friend, in his antipathy to mayors, does not think that it is a good idea to delay by a full two years the interval between a positive referendum result and the first election of a mayor.</p>

In any event, the coincidence of what would be the worst thing of all, I suspect, is the coincidence of a police commissioner election and a mayoral election.

I think that that would be an absolute recipe for confusion and the worst of all possible worlds. We will revert, no doubt in a couple of days, to the issue of the timing of any police commissioner elections, but if the current intention of the Government is to proceed in November, then I think that that makes the proposition advanced by the right reverend Prelate and my noble friend quite difficult and untenable. I hope that the Government will think again, or think further, about the proposition that has been put to them, and will in particular avoid that coincidence.</p>

I think the worst of all possible worlds would be police commissioner elections and mayoral elections in however many authorities there will be-there are 11 authorities coming forward. So I hope that the Government will, on this occasion, prove unbending. I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.</p>

I cannot believe it. It seems an unusual situation, which is why I am commenting. In Committee, my noble friends Lord Tope and Lord Palmer of Childs Hill tabled amendments aimed at removing any delay between the time a local authority resolves to change its governance arrangements and the implementation of that change. During the debate, I stated that I had some sympathy with the points raised by noble Lords, particularly about the time that has to elapse before changes in governance arrangements can be implemented.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="11091251000103"></a>Having taken this matter further, I am happy to tell noble Lords that Amendments 152 to 154 build on their amendments to deliver the desired effect. In essence, these amendments provide that, after a passing of a resolution to change governance arrangements, a local authority can make that change, in the case of moving to the mayoral model, three days after the election of the first mayor; in the case of moving from the mayoral model, three days after the end of the term of office of the serving mayor; and, in all other circumstances, including moving to the committee system, at the first annual meeting after the resolution or such other later annual meeting specified by the local authority itself in its resolution to change governance arrangements. Local authorities therefore will be able to resolve at any time to change their governance arrangements and implement those changes without any unnecessary delay and at a time that best suits their circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="11091251000104"></a>In Committee, there were concerns clearly that there was a hiatus between a proposal put forward for new governance and its being able to be implemented. It seemed quite a long time, so we have taken account of that and I hope the amendments make it clear that there need not be any delay. I beg to move.</p>

We of course welcome these amendments. I had the distinct impression that this not being perhaps a major part of the Bill, the Government had not properly taken account of the effect that if those councils which wished to change their governance arrangements now, as soon as they are able to under this Bill, had whole council elections, as we have in London and a number of other parts of the country, they would be waiting until after 2014 to be able to make the changes. Those councils which had whole-council elections this year would have to wait another four years to do it. That made no sense so I am pleased that the Minister recognised that and I welcome these amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="11091251000106"></a>The amendments will be particularly welcome in a number of councils-certainly in London that I know of-which have, in effect, already changed their governance arrangements but hold meetings of the executive after the committee meetings. The meeting of the executive lasts for five minutes and agrees with every decision just taken by the committee. That is the procedure they use in order to get around the system as it is at the moment. It would clearly be even more of a nonsense if that sort of thing were to carry on for another two or three years. I welcome these amendments very

I certainly welcome this sensible amendment. However, it is timely to say a word in favour of the leader and executive model and, in particular, to draw attention to the one part of the recent publication by the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, with which I agree. In relation to elected mayors, the paper makes a strong point. I told him that I agreed with something he had written and he was surprised. The relevant part is the emphasis that he makes about the need for a strong and independent scrutiny function, with which I entirely agree under whatever system is operated-be it mayoral, leader and executive or a straight committee system.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="11091251000108"></a>There are those who are still in love with the old-style committee system; the notion that you have a collection of Socratic city elders engaged in philosophical dialogue about the affairs of state in a particular borough or authority. I am bound to say that that does not accord with my own experience, particularly after serving for many years as chairman of committees, leader of the council, and so on.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="11091251000109"></a>When I departed to the Siberian power station of the Arts and Recreation Committee, having given up the leadership and any other executive position-by choice I may say; it was self-imposed exile-I discovered that as a back-bench member of the traditional committee system one's influence was pretty limited. When you are in the chair you can move things on quite briskly: you have an agenda and you get it through. When you are a back-bench member you usually have a political group meeting beforehand. It may last about an hour and there are 12 or 15 of you, which gives an average of four or five minutes each. The point of the formal meeting is to get it over with as quickly as possible. In reality, very little of the purported scrutiny takes place in the traditional committee system nor is there very much influence over policy.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="11091251000110"></a>That was summarised for me most effectively one day-I hope your Lordships will forgive this brief anecdote. I had missed a committee meeting of the Arts and Recreation Committee but went to the next one. I read the minutes, which said that a member had raised a question about birds eating the grass seed in the Leazes Park allotments. I thought to myself, "Has it really come to this?". We had an £800 million budget, with goodness knows how many problems and opportunities to debate, and the most the member could think of to raise at a committee meeting was birds eating grass seed at an allotment. I do not say that that entirely characterises the committee system, but there is some danger of that happening.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="11091251000111"></a>The main thrust of my, perhaps somewhat tedious, observations is to recommend that, whatever the circumstances, there must be a strong and independently sourced scrutiny role, not only to hold the executive to account, because perhaps too much of scrutiny has been based on a retrospective look at the actions of an executive, but to look forward, and, as it should be, in

That is not incompatible with a committee system, but in reality, in my experience, it rarely took place that way. It needs a push for strong scrutiny and I hope that irrespective of the provisions of the Bill, the Government will encourage authorities to maintain and enhance that scrutiny role, whatever type of authority they are and whatever model of governance they adopt. I certainly would not oppose these amendments to give councils the option to choose their own system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="11091251000113"></a>I think that the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, would agree that scrutiny is a developing art rather than a science, and that the experience of different systems over the past 10 years has contributed to an extension of that expertise.</p>

My goodness, things have moved a long way since then. I agree with the noble Lord that if scrutiny is to be good, it needs to be much more constructive than simply looking back and commenting on decisions and actions that have been taken.</p>

My main point can be stated very simply: at the centre of Part 1 is the welcome provision that gives local authorities a general power of competence. Whereas  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_600"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column 600</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in the past they could do only what statute allowed them to do, now they will have the same competence as individuals. In other words, at a stroke local authorities can cast off the shackles of government control. Yet at almost every point in this Bill, in every part and schedule, there are pages and pages of directions going into the minutest detail of how local authorities must implement these provisions.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="11091251000122"></a>As I pondered this my mind went back to what is, I am afraid, another anecdote in the form of an old political joke. A communist orator was haranguing the crowd saying, "It's the rich who have their dinners at the Ritz hotel and the poor have to go to Smokey Joe's. But when the red revolution comes and you get your freedom, it will be the rich who will have to go to Smokey Joe's and you'll be able to eat your dinner in the Ritz". The little man at the back put up his hand and said, "I'd rather go to Smokey Joe's". The orator said, "When the red revolution comes and you get your freedom, you'll damn well do what you're told".</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="11091251000123"></a>The local authorities associations have made it very clear that they dislike being told how to do things. They dislike being told how to write letters, how to conduct referendums, how to co-operate and much else besides. I voiced their dissatisfaction and I was not alone. In all parts of the House, noble Lords supported my protests, and at times I became quite heated.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="11091251000124"></a>My noble friend Lord Tope, who is very experienced in these matters, noted that there has been a culture in Whitehall whereby they feel they have a duty to tell local authorities how to carry out their functions. However, he also noted that the local authorities themselves have absorbed that culture to the extent that they now expect to be told how to do things. My noble friend on the Front Bench has already indicated some movement in this and we are very grateful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="11091251000125"></a>Before the Recess, I sought out my right honourable friend Greg Clark, the Minister of State in charge of the Bill. He agreed to meet me with a deputation from the Local Government Association and London Councils. At that meeting, which happened a few days after the start of the Recess, we set out our concerns and provided him with a long list of detailed provisions, which we believed could be dropped without affecting the purposes of the Bill.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="11091251000126"></a>After discussion, the Minister agreed. He agreed that his officials and those of the associations should get together during the Recess with a view to agreeing what might be dropped. Last week I was sent a long letter from the department setting out the amendments whose purpose Ministers were minded to accept, others which they were reluctant to accept, and some where decisions still have to be made. It was not everything but it is a very good start. I expressed my pleasure both to the officials and to the Minister.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="11091251000127"></a>The House has already welcomed Amendments 120 to 131 removing the powers to make regulations in respect to area committees and conditions which apply to the creation of such committees. We have also just accepted Amendments 132 to 150, substantially simplifying the scrutiny provisions, and these certainly stemmed from the discussions.</p>

There are also amendments on the community right to buy, Amendments 203, 203B and 203C.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="11091251000129"></a>These are a very welcome start and there is the prospect of more to come, especially on planning. Some of my amendments in the group, led by Amendment 155, have been dealt with, and I warmly welcome the government amendments in the group.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="11091251000130"></a>I end by picking out two of my amendments-it would be tedious to go through the lot-that have not been accepted so far. They are Amendments 158 and 159 on referendums, and Amendment 204 on the duty to co-operate. On referendums, there are two distinct issues: first, when and in what circumstances a referendum should be held; and, secondly, how they should be conducted. On the first issue, it would seem sensible to deal with that on each occasion that it comes up in the Bill, because they may differ from case to case. On the second issue, however, it really is necessary to stop telling local authorities how to suck eggs. They have great experience in running referendums and they should be trusted to do that properly, not have to be told how to do it.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="11091251000131"></a>Amendment 204 refers to the duty to co-operate set out in Clause 98. I really do not believe that local authorities need to be told how to co-operate. They, after all, have been co-operating with each other for a very long time and it is an impertinence to have to spell out in the Bill how they are supposed to do it. They are well accustomed to doing it and they should be trusted. I hope that my noble friend may be able to comment on both the referendums and the duty to co-operate.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="11091251000132"></a>I referred at the beginning of my speech to the culture-perhaps it might be better called a mindset-whereby Whitehall feels that it has to tell local authorities how to conduct their functions, while the local authorities expect to be told. If the general power of competence is to mean anything in practice, that culture-that mindset-has to be changed. The best way to start changing it is to stop doing it. I beg to move.</p>

I am constantly being reminded about that, and quite rightly too. They are Amendments 156, 157 and 162. In Committee, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, has reiterated, there are a number of provisions in Schedule 2 to the Bill which noble Lords considered were either overly prescriptive or unnecessary. While I have not been able to act on all of their concerns, Amendments 156 and 157 remove provisions in relation to the actions a local authority must take following a referendum about a change in governance model. I hope that that will be another of the deregulatory ways that we deal with today.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_602"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column 602</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110912-0003.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="11091251000135"></a>In doing so, these amendments put beyond any doubt that local authorities must act in accordance with the wishes of local people as expressed at a referendum. In light of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee's comments we have also tabled Amendment 162, which provides that regulations made under Section 9MG in relation to the conduct of governance referendums will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.</p>

<p><a name="st_228"></a>
<a name="11091251000136"></a><b><a name="110912-0003.htm_spnew32"></a><a name="11091251000445"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> My Lords, I was intending to comment on only one of the noble Lord's amendments. I agree very much with the thrust of his comments but I would simply take up with him whether at this point we should be dealing with Clause 98. I am concerned about applying the general points that he has made at this stage to a very contentious part of the Bill. As he said, Amendment 204 would delete the provision for statutory guidance about the duty to co-operate, which is, in full, a:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_224"></a><a name="11091251000351"></a>"Duty to co-operate in relation to planning of sustainable development".</p>

<p><a name="11091251000198"></a>One would have had to be in a very faraway country to be unaware of how contentious "sustainable development" and its application have become-interestingly, led by the <I>Daily Telegraph</I>-over the last two or three weeks.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="11091251000137"></a>I find it difficult to make a judgment about the need or otherwise and the desirability or otherwise of statutory guidance without debating the substantive duty. I have always had a concern about legislation purporting to tell local authorities how to co-operate-I share that very much with my noble friend-but without discussing the whole substantive provision, I find it difficult to come to a view as to whether or not statutory guidance is desirable. It is very difficult to take this proposition along with the others and, as I say, I very much agree with the points that he has made where they arise in other parts of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="st_229"></a>
<a name="11091251000138"></a><b><a name="110912-0003.htm_spnew33"></a><a name="11091251000446"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, I follow the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, on this point. Your Lordships' House should give the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, great thanks for the diligence with which he has pursued this issue right from the start of the Bill. He has been consistent in challenging the unnecessary powers that have littered the Bill and, going through the list before us tonight, I do not have any problem with the amendments, with the possible exception of Amendment 204. As the noble Baroness says, planning has become, almost overnight, incredibly contentious. We are not now going to reach the substantive provisions until October and I think that it would be better to view them in the round and as a whole. It would be quite difficult to see the lack of guidance somewhere in the system relating to the duty to co-operate. It is a departure and a new issue in planning. It is the replacement of regional planning. It is very important that we get it right.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="11091251000139"></a>I accept the noble Lord's point that when an individual authority is going to consult it does not need guidance on that. Local authorities are well experienced in doing that, but this is guidance in the context of some new planning requirements and it would be premature to do away with the prospect of government having some guidance on the generality; not just bilateral consultations and relationships between authorities,  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_603"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column 603</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>but multilaterally and where the sub-region fits. The guidance that might flow from this could be really helpful in that regard.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="11091251000140"></a>I do not wish to detract from the fantastic job the noble Lord has done in leading the charge on these issues. That is the only issue I take with the list that is before us.</p>

<p><a name="st_230"></a>
<a name="11091251000141"></a><b><a name="110912-0003.htm_spnew34"></a><a name="11091251000447"></a>Lord Beecham:</b> My Lords, I warmly congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, on his numerous amendments, particularly those he has moved this evening, with the possible exception-I agree with my noble friend Lord McKenzie-of Amendment 204. It is not that I wish to see detailed prescription about how the duty to co-operate should be exercised. My concern has been about what will happen in the event that local authorities do not co-operate. I have voiced that concern on previous occasions. There are cases where there are difficulties on land allocation for housing and that kind of issue where there needs to be some mechanism to resolve a dispute or to be available when co-operation is not forthcoming. That apart, I certainly endorse the noble Lord's view about the highly detailed prescription around referendums. Indeed, one could go further. I notice in new Section 9MC, for example, that regulations include,</p>
<ul><a name="11091251000378"></a>"the manner in which a petition is to be presented to a local authority".</ul>
<p><a name="11091251000142"></a>That is presumably on one knees, held up on a cushion or something. It is bizarre. There is far too much of all that.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="11091251000143"></a>I also cannot understand how anyone can believe that a change of governance in the town hall is going to excite the local electorate. It is just arguable that the mayoral referendum might, although as I indicated, turnouts would not suggest a huge demand. But if an authority chose to go from a committee system to a leader and executive system, I do not think that that would be much argued about and discussed in heated fashion in the ward that I represent, the one represented by the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, or frankly anywhere.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="11091251000144"></a>This whole referendum process, which we will debate in a different context later on, is going too far. It may be that the Secretary of State now fancies himself as Napoleon III-possibly not. But it is too easy a device to resort to. God help us if we have a series of referendums about this at great cost with very little participation. It is the wrong mechanism. Councils should be trusted in ordinary circumstances-I take the point about a change to the mayoral system-to come to their own conclusions about the form of governance. It is not a matter about which the electorate is in the least concerned. If people were, they could exercise their views at the ballot box in the ordinary way.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="11091251000145"></a>I am very much in sympathy with the noble Lord's amendments and when we return to referendums in a different context later I hope that there will be some cross-party support. I agree with my noble friend Lord McKenzie that we need to look again at the issue of the duty to co-operate, which is in a different category.</p>

My noble friend Lord Jenkin has been very clear all the way through that he thinks that there is too much this prescription within the legislation. Sometimes I have agreed with him as in the area committees on which we have removed all the regulation today and sometimes we believe that there is a rationale for that amount of detail in the Bill. Some of what I will say falls along those lines. Where we have been able to take part out as in my previous amendments we have done so, but there are still areas where-I hate to disagree with my noble friend Lord Jenkin-we are not quite on the same track.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="11091251000147"></a>I will briefly go through the amendments that my noble friend has tabled and give my reasons why we may not be able to accept them. Amendment 155 deletes new Sections 9MD and 9ME from Schedule 2 to the Bill. These new sections replicate the safeguards which the previous Government sought to establish and which this House approved, so I hope that we will have support from noble Lords opposite. They enable the Secretary of State to ensure that local people can have their say on governance arrangements if needed-for example, in cases where referendums have not been held when required or where unreasonable arrangements or timeframes are being proposed.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="11091251000148"></a>It could be argued that these powers are not necessary given the provisions in new Section 9N, but we do not believe that to be the case. Orders under that new section can require only a mayoral referendum and not referendums on any other form of governance-unlike the provisions in new Sections 9MD and 9ME.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="11091251000149"></a>Amendments 158 and 159 would remove the ability of the Secretary of State to make regulations about the conduct of governance referendums. As I have tried to explain, I have listened carefully during the course of our proceedings to concerns about the amount of delegated powers, but I am afraid that I am not going to be able to agree with the amendments. As with many provisions in Schedule 2 to the Bill, the power in new Section 9MG to make provision about the conduct of local governance referendums replicates an existing power in the Local Government Act 2000. Regulations were last made under the 2000 Act in 2007. Our broad intention is to replicate these regulations when bringing forward new secondary legislation under this provision in the Bill. The current regulations cover all aspects of organising and conducting polls at governance referendums, including the opening hours of polling stations and the content of ballot papers, ensuring polls are held in accordance with the practices for an election.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="11091251000150"></a>Given the importance of the referendum's subject matter and the fact that the result will be binding on the council concerned, I think that not only are these regulations needed but that the level of detail about the procedure to be followed is appropriate. It is vital for local people to be assured that robust, fair, open and consistent arrangements are put in place for governance referendums in order for them to feel that their vote will count.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="11091251000151"></a>Should noble Lords accept our Amendment 162, regulations made under new Section 9MG will be subject to affirmative resolution procedure. Accordingly, I hope that noble Lords will have the opportunity to debate and consider the content of the regulations before they are made.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="11091251000152"></a>Amendment 159A seeks to delete the Secretary of State's power in new Section 9N to make an order requiring specified local authorities to hold a mayoral referendum. This power is central to delivering the coalition agreement commitment to create directly elected mayors in the 12 largest cities in England, subject to confirmatory referendums. The power in new Section 9N to provide for mayoral referendums in our largest cities does just that, and nothing more. It will allow for local people to make their choice at a referendum, and in those cities where there are votes in favour of the mayoral model, for the city to be governed by an elected mayor.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="11091251000153"></a>Amendment 204 would remove the requirement-the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, touched on this-for bodies subject to the duty to co-operate to,</p>
<ul><a name="11091251000379"></a>"have regard to any guidance given by the Secretary of State about how the duty is to be complied with".</ul>
<p><a name="11091251000199"></a>The duty to co-operate signals a significant change in the way that strategic planning will happen. There are conflicting views on whether the duty to co-operate will be overly prescriptive-the point my noble friend Lord Jenkin was making-or too flexible. Indeed, we have been criticised by some in the House for the lack of prescription in our approach to strategic planning and have debated amendments to define the outputs, process and boundaries to be used by local councils. We consider that strategic planning needs to be a flexible process that allows councils to decide how best to serve their local communities, businesses and interested parties and we continue to reject prescriptive approaches. A duty to co-operate is intended to drive a culture change and new spirit of partnership working in the ways that councils and other public bodies work on strategic planning matters. It will be vital that councils and their partners rise to the challenge. Any guidance issued will be light touch rather than prescriptive, will focus on ensuring the efficient introduction of new policies and will be produced in consultation. In the light of the explanation I have given, I hope that my noble friend will be willing to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="11091251000155"></a>As regards what amendments should go into the group, I tabled a lot of the amendments and asked the Government Whips Office to put them all together so that we could have a debate. Of course, we will come back to some of these issues at a later stage. I think  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_606"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column 606</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>both the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, and my noble friend have indicated that there are issues to which we shall need to come back. As I understand our rules, when we get to Amendment 204, it is perfectly possible for anybody to move it and speak to it. The fact that it has appeared in an earlier group is not an absolute bar. However, in the light of the publication of the framework planning policy paper, we may well look at some of these issues. As the noble Lord has said, that will be in October on the last two days of our Report proceedings.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="11091251000156"></a>I take the point that some of these amendments may well merit considerably longer debate than we have had today. However, I think that the purpose of this debate has been served. I think that Ministers in my noble friend's department have recognised that the Bill's drafting has gone through the other place apparently without much being said about this. We started the argument in Committee here and it has now been accepted that this is not the appropriate way for the Government to treat local authorities these days, particularly in the light of the general power of competence. Nevertheless, there will be other opportunities to come back to some of these issues, and I hope that those opportunities will be taken. I cannot say that the Bill is going to get any shorter, because in the course of the proceedings of the last two days in Committee we have added a great deal to it, but those measures have been welcomed in all parts of the House.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="11091251000157"></a>I hope that we have now started the process of trying to dismantle this mindset of local authorities having to be told how to do their job. They are responsible, elected bodies, and if they are going to have a general power of competence, let them get on with it. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

We have debated those this evening. Amendment 165 seeks to remove further prescription and restrictions imposed by the previous Government on local authorities in relation to changing their scheme of elections. Amendment 165 inserts a new clause into the Bill that removes in their entirety the current rules that stipulate that district councils may only resolve to change their scheme of elections during permitted periods. Permitted periods would last just over six months and occur only every four years.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="11091251000159"></a>We believe that local authorities should be free to make such decisions at a time that is right for them and their local communities, not during a time period dictated to them by central government. Accordingly, this amendment provides that in the future district councils in England that wish to change their scheme of elections will be able to resolve to do so at any time and will be able to specify the date on which they will hold their first whole council elections. In order to prevent local authorities from repeatedly changing their electoral schemes, and the uncertainty and disruption this may bring, Amendment 165 provides that, once a local authority has resolved to change its scheme of elections, it may not make another such resolution for a period of five years.</p>

This is to ensure that there is clarity among local people about the role and functions of different tiers of local government in their area and to avoid voter confusion. In an area where there is no county council, no such restrictions on the date of the first whole-council election will apply. The decision will be entirely for the council concerned.

The purpose of Amendment 165A is to clarify whether the provisions of Clause 14 change the basic position that, in exercising discretion in making decisions, a councillor must not have a closed mind. This is especially relevant to, but not limited to, matters of planning. It is understood that the purpose of Clause 14 is to seek to clarify the position of councillors who, despite guidance from the Standards Board-which will now disappear-have considered themselves constrained in offering views on matters for fear of invalidating a decision or themselves being subject to challenge.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="11091251000163"></a>There has been a series of legal decisions which have sought to draw the line between legitimate predisposition and unlawful predetermination. The courts have accepted that councillors are likely to have, and indeed are entitled to have, a disposition in favour of a particular decision. An open mind is not an empty mind; it is ajar. Contrast that predisposition with circumstances where a person has closed their mind to all considerations other than an already held view-predetermination. The courts have recognised two types of predetermination: actual predetermination and apparent predetermination. The latter, apparent predetermination, is where a fair-minded and well informed observer, looking objectively at all circumstances, considers that there is a real risk that one or more of the decision-makers has refused even to consider a relevant argument. These matters have previously been commented on also by the Standards Board for England, including how the code might be impacted. Obviously, this all falls by the wayside subject to the outcomes of deliberations that we may have on this issue in due course.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="11091251000164"></a>When we debated this in Committee, we took it that Clause 14 was not intended to change the law and that decision-makers remain required to maintain an open mind in considering views relevant to a decision. Perhaps  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_610"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column 610</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Minister could confirm that that is the Government's position. This is what Amendment 165A seeks to put on the face of the Bill. Assuming we are at one on this issue, what is the position on apparent predetermination? It would seem that Clause 14 changes the law because it precludes a fair-minded, well informed observer from looking objectively at all the circumstances. So can the Minister say what type of evidence would be taken into account when determining whether a person had a closed mind?</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="11091251000165"></a>We do not oppose provisions which seek to enshrine in primary legislation the protections for councillors associated with predisposition-if the noble Lord, Lord Newton, were here, I would say that we accept the Lady Newton test in that regard-and we remain unconvinced that in doing so the Government have not opened the door to undermining the protections of probity long afforded by the concept of predetermination. Of course, this is happening when the Standards Board for England is disappearing from the scene.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="11091251000166"></a>In view of the uncertainty created by what is happening, Amendment 16 simply calls for the Secretary of State to review the consequences of this clause and to report to Parliament within three years. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="11091251000167"></a><b><a name="110912-0003.htm_spnew48"></a><a name="11091251000461"></a>Lord Pannick:</b> My Lords, I have added my name to Amendment 165A. I share the concerns that have been expressed by the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie of Luton. This is not the ideal time of day to discuss the intricacies of local government law, but there are three points that I want to make.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="11091251000168"></a>First, existing case law makes it very clear, and rightly so, that in the context of local government, a predisposition to decide an issue in a particular way is lawful. There is nothing unlawful in a councillor saying to constituents that he or she agrees with or disagrees with a planning proposal, and is minded to support it, or indeed oppose it, in the planning committee, provided that the councillor adds that he cannot commit himself and that he must consider all the points that are raised before he decides how to vote.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="11091251000169"></a>What is unlawful is for the councillor to have or give the appearance of having a closed mind. That is predetermination of the matter, such that he or she will not listen to the arguments that are advanced in favour of or against the planning or other proposal put before the council. The Court of Appeal set out these basic principles very clearly indeed, in 2008, in the case of the Queen on the application of Lewis v Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council [2009], Volume 1 of the <I>Weekly Law Reports</I>, 83.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="11091251000170"></a>Lord Justice Rix stated at paragraph 94 to 96-and the other two judges adopted the same approach-that local councillors who are deciding a planning matter, or any other matter, are not required to be impartial in the sense required of a judge. The law as it is recognises that local councillors have political allegiances, that they have politics, and that their politics involve the adoption of policies. There is nothing wrong with that, and it is highly desirable that it remain the case, so long as there is no closing of the mind before the planning or other committee decision and the vote. The law strikes the right balance.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_611"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column 611</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110912-0003.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="11091251000171"></a>Secondly, although I think the law has the balance correct at the moment, I have no objection to legislation setting out this position and clarifying the matter, removing any doubt. However, it is vital that the legislation must get the balance right. My concern is that Clause 14 as currently drafted does not make it clear that although predisposition is permissible-indeed, may be desirable-predetermination is not permissible. Clause 14(2) is too broadly drafted.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="11091251000172"></a>Suppose the councillor says publicly, a month before a controversial planning application is considered by the planning committee, "I am going to vote against the proposal for the bail hostel. I was elected on a platform to oppose this planning development, and I am simply not interested in the arguments that may be advanced in favour of this proposal." That would be a clear case of predetermination. Clause 14(2) would appear to make such a statement irrelevant in law. If we enact this legislation in this current form, such statements would be said to be, for the purposes of Clause 14(2)(a), something previously done by the decision-maker which,</p>
<ul><a name="11091251000380"></a>"directly or indirectly indicated what view the decision-maker took, or would or might take, in relation to a matter".</ul>
<p><a name="11091251000200"></a>I hope that Clause 14 is not intended to exclude reliance in court on such a statement as evidence of impermissible predetermination. If it were intended to have that effect, it would be a substantial change in existing law and would be very much a change for the worse, because it would allow councillors to predetermine issues.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para73"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="11091251000173"></a>My third point, therefore, is that Clause 14 needs revision to tighten the language and avoid the ambiguity that I have indicated. There are various ways in which this could be done. One is by Amendment 165A. I hope very much that the Minister-I think that it is the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, who will be responding-will tell the House that he will take this matter away and will, with his officials, give further consideration to this important question before Third Reading.</p>

Not justice, which of course is important, but "just because", which is not the sort of language that one normally sees in legislation. However, since the noble Lord has spoken, and having heard what he said, which I found extremely helpful, the word that now concerns me is "might". Clause 14(2)(a) refers to a view that a decision-maker,</p>
<ul><a name="11091251000381"></a>"took, or would or might take".</ul>
<p><a name="11091251000201"></a>How does "might" stand in the context of the distinction between predisposition and predetermination? I am far more confused than I was 10 minutes ago.</p>

We are entering difficult territory, as outlined clearly by the noble Lord, Lord Pannick. At the very least, given the potential difficulties that might arise from a change, there ought to be a proper, evidence-based review, and three years should be sufficient for that. There are

Its provenance lies in political debate, with those on one side claiming that it is improper to prevent councillors campaigning on issues and then voting on them. Of course, that is perfectly legitimate in the context of any council policy such as education, social care or whatever: but not in a situation that is quasi-judicial, which is how planning and licensing decisions should be taken.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para74"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="11091251000176"></a>I am afraid that the rather loose terminology deployed on political platforms colours one's view of the potential impact of the proposal in Clause 14. It also raises the possibility of undue pressure being applied to elected members who will no longer have the defence that, "I must not indicate how I am going to vote because I am obliged to look at all sides of the case". That might be regarded as being swept away. I am not saying that it is the intention of the clause to sweep it away, but that inference might be drawn by those seeking to solicit the support of members. One must not assume that that solicitation will always be on the part of electors. It may be on the part of those on the other side of the proposal: namely, the developers. It is invidious to place members in that position. They need the protection of the kind of approach that the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, has enunciated.</p>

<a name="110912-0003.htm_para75"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="11091251000177"></a>I hope that the Minister will look again at this, particularly at Amendment 165A, and whether that can be deployed to mitigate the impact of Clause 14. In any event, however, I hope he would accept, or just consider accepting, Amendment 165B, which would allow the situation to be reviewed in this rather delicate area on the basis of evidence rather than surmise. We are looking, at this late hour, for some commitment to think again and talk again about this in order to avoid potential future difficulties for elected members and officers of the council as well. It would also provide clarity for public applicants and objectors alike.</p>

Previous position and predetermination can meld into a situation where drafting legislation can be difficult. I want to reassure noble Lords on what Clause 14 is about and what it is not about. The provision in the Bill does not have any effect on the legal effects of a local authority member being predetermined. The legal position is, and will remain, that a local authority member making a decision should have an open mind. Whatever he or she may have said about the way they were going to vote or whatever campaigns there were, we are in practical politics and we know that people will campaign on issues. The clear point of focus of any legislation and the law, currently and as a result of Clause 14, is that the decision should be made with an open mind.</p>

It will ensure that, at the end of the day, prior indications of an opinion will not be treated as evidence of predetermination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="11091251000180"></a>Perhaps I can reassure the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, that the only evidence that can be presented to show that a person does not have an open mind is that which exists at the point of the decision-making process. Therefore, prior comments, commitments and pledges do not matter as long as the local authority member clearly listens to the evidence and makes his decision. It may accord with his prejudice or his predisposition, but any evidence that he has a closed mind can only be made at the point when he makes that decision and not at any point prior to that.</p>

That is the current position in law. There is no suggestion that because somebody has campaigned on an issue they should not be free. Indeed, I think the House would acknowledge that people who have campaigned on issues should be free, as long as they demonstrate at the point at which the decision is being made that they have been prepared to consider opposing arguments. The fact that they have voted in accordance with their previous position does not necessarily mean that they predetermined the decision.

If the Minister thinks through the logic of what he has just said, if you can judge whether somebody had a closed mind only at the point of taking a decision, and if you have to leave aside and close your mind to all the previous evidence, even though any reasonable person might say that in particular circumstances it was abundantly clear that an individual had closed his mind, could that not leave the process open to massive abuse, because all somebody who wishes to thwart or support a decision needs to do is to behave sensibly and appropriately on the day at the point of the decision-making, even though he might have made his position absolutely clear before that? I am not a lawyer, although the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, certainly is, but it seems to me that the position he put in his example-that Clause 14(2) means that you have to exclude all that evidence when it comes to court, if that is where it arrives, and the Minister said that you do-must constitute a change in the law as it is at the moment. I do not think that the Government are in the right place. We are not trying to be difficult. This is not a party political issue, and I understand the Minister trying to get it right for councillors so that they are free of the fear that they may have been subject to to date, but I simply do not think that the Government are right. We are obviously not going to press Amendment 165A tonight, but I urge that we have the opportunity to have some discussion with officials between now and Third Reading-and I would welcome the input of other noble Lords, particularly the noble Lord, Lord Pannick-with the right to bring it back if necessary.

The proposed new Clause 42, which I am moving, ensures that schools cannot be designated as teaching schools by the National College for School Leadership unless they have received an outstanding grade for teaching special educational needs.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000004"></a>The schools White Paper, <I>The Importance of Teaching</I>, made it possible for schools to apply for teaching-school status, allowing them to become centres of best teaching practice in their local area. Schools' ability to apply for teaching-school status was extended to special schools teaching children with predominantly complex special educational needs in the SEN Green Paper, <I>Support and Aspiration: A New Approach to Special Educational Needs and Disability</I>. The eligibility criteria for schools applying for teaching-school status include an Ofsted rating as outstanding for overall effectiveness, teaching and learning and leadership and management. In these days, when so many more children with SEN are educated in mainstream schools, it is hard to see how a school could get a rating of outstanding for overall effectiveness without being able to demonstrate excellence in the teaching of children with SEN. However, given the specialised nature of this work, it would seem sensible to require schools to be able to demonstrate expertise in this area as well as those already listed in  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC110"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC110</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the criteria if schools are to be expected to improve teaching in the area of SEN and improve standards and spread best practice.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000005"></a>The Special Educational Consortium is concerned that under the existing eligibility criteria a mainstream school applying for teaching-school status could achieve this without having the necessary expertise in the teaching of children with SEN. This is a concern because many children and young people with special educational needs are now being taught in mainstream educational settings, where it is essential that schools should be able to recognise the particular challenges they face in accessing the mainstream curriculum. Given the importance of the teaching workforce having the skills to work with children with SEN, it is vital that schools be able to demonstrate their excellence in this area as part of the criteria for achieving teaching-school status.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000006"></a>Having an outstanding rating for the SEN element of a school's work is also important for giving parents and children confidence that the practice being spread through local schools partnerships will help ensure that children with SEN can participate fully in learning. Introducing the additional criterion that schools have an outstanding rating from Ofsted for their SEN teaching will encourage schools considering applying for teaching-school status to address the way they open up the curriculum to children with SEN and, where children are taught in an SEN unit outside the mainstream school, how learning outcomes can be improved. This would help to address a significant barrier across all education settings, and the lack of expertise and understanding around low-incidence impairments such as deaf/blindness where access to communication and other teaching specialisms is necessary if the challenges are to be overcome.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000007"></a>Any sharing of best practice needs to have a well-developed knowledge base to draw on. However, the Special Educational Consortium's experience is that knowledge of SEN and the added difficulties that learners with special educational needs face is lacking in many local areas. Requiring schools desirous of acquiring teaching-school status to be able to demonstrate expertise in teaching children with SEN could help to address this issue. I beg to move.</p>

We have seen a great change in the training of teachers in recent years. In the past, teachers typically were trained for three years to their bachelor educational degree, which was a good long grounding. We have seen that period reduced to one year, and more and more teachers are being trained on the job. I welcome the move to more classroom-based learning for teachers but we have to be sure that it is right. There is a risk to that strategy and I look for reassurance from the Minister that teachers will be getting an understanding of SEN in that training. Perhaps I may make a further comment-we should not forget that more and more classroom assistants are those who work one-to-one with children with SEN. They too need the high-quality training.</p>

<p><a name="11091229000009"></a><b><a name="110912-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="11091229000118"></a>Baroness Morris of Yardley:</b> My Lords, perhaps I may make a brief comment and ask a question. I have some sympathy with the amendment. When I first saw  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC111"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC111</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it I thought that it was perhaps overprescriptive, but having listened to the noble Lord, Lord Low, I have sympathy with it. Throughout the proceedings on the Bill we have understandably heard a lot from the Government about not putting heavy regulatory burdens on schools. Given that that is the direction in which we are going, it is obvious that at some point in the system there should be a fair amount of regulation-otherwise the system collapses and no-one would know what is going on. My understanding from the teaching schools-of which I am a great supporter and I hope that they do very well-is that this is one of those areas where the Government have accepted that there will have to be a lot of monitoring and a fair amount of regulation. You can see that by looking at the criteria for a teaching school. For instance, a head has to have been in post for three years-a matter with which I have always quibbled in my mind. However, I am not going to quibble with it because I accept that this is one of those bits of the education system that the Government really will have to keep their eyes on.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000010"></a>I can therefore see the argument, given that one of the great weaknesses in our education system is the quality of training for SEN that teachers get, that there is never enough time in initial teacher training to do that adequately. It is not properly covered in the induction year-it did not happen when I was in power and there has not been much improvement since. There is a genuine problem and I am persuaded by what the noble Lord says-these are the areas where these institutions need to be properly regulated. Losing this opportunity, which we should seize to raise the standards of teaching those with special needs, would be again to commit the mistake that we have all committed through the years, which is to pass legislation and then in future years see how we can tag SEN on to it. That has been a huge fault of government for decades. We put something in place and a few months later think, "Ah, how can we make this relate to SEN?".</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000011"></a>My question is this-how many schools designated teaching schools have not been awarded an "outstanding" category by Ofsted? What is that overlap, and how many schools not in that category have applied to become teaching schools? Perhaps the Minister can provide a little analysis of the comparison between schools which have been awarded the "outstanding" category as a result of inspections and those that are "outstanding" in SEN.</p>

<p><a name="11091229000012"></a><b><a name="110912-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="11091229000119"></a>Lord Elton:</b> My Lords, regarding the legislation passed in the previous Session, which enabled and made necessary the identification of people suffering from dyslexia and that group of disabilities, it would be helpful if the Minister could tell us to what extent the number presenting themselves as suffering from these disabilities has increased. That would give us an idea of the workload.</p>

<p><a name="11091229000013"></a><b><a name="110912-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="11091229000120"></a>Baroness Jones of Whitchurch:</b> My Lords, again, I rise briefly to support the noble Lord's amendment. Like my noble friend, when I originally read the amendment, I thought that it was self-evident. However, the more I have looked at it and listened to the debate  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC112"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC112</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>this afternoon, the more it seems to me that, once all the other elements have been stripped out of the legislation and the provisions, we increasingly rely on Ofsted as the final fallback to guarantee standards.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000014"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Low, is right to say that if we are not careful SEN provision will be swept under the carpet and will not be seen as a major factor in provision within schools. Looking at this issue in the context of some of the other amendments that we will debate this afternoon, with the new emphasis on PRUs and alternative academy provision, if we are not careful there will, whether the Government had intended it or not, be a move to take a lot of pupils with specialist needs out of mainstream education into other provision, and the expertise that goes with it will be lost.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000015"></a>Therefore, the noble Lord's amendment is helpful. It would be reassuring to have it in the Bill, and it would reassure people who see mainstream schools as having an essential responsibility to provide SEN provision and to make sure that it is high quality and high class. It would also reassure people about the intent in the other sections of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="11091229000016"></a><b><a name="110912-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="11091229000121"></a>Lord Sutherland of Houndwood:</b> My Lords, I sympathise very much with the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Low, but I also sympathise with the tensions expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris. There are difficulties here. This is pretty much a sledgehammer amendment and I am not sure that I would want to go that far. However, I invite the Minister to say that he will take away the spirit of the amendment, as well as the comments, and look at how we can best improve the quality of SEN teaching. It is a very tall order to ask any school to be outstanding in all areas that might have to be dealt with under the general heading of SEN, and we might find a more subtle way of inviting them to apply for an outstanding rating in areas where they show expertise.</p>

However, in the mean time, the important question was that asked by the noble Lord, Lord Elton, regarding number, where there has certainly been an increase. Obviously, as these matters are spread-as they should be, in my view-throughout the education system generally, it is very important that we know that adequate teachers and teaching assistants are trained to see that these children receive the very best education.</p>

<p><a name="11091229000018"></a><b><a name="110912-gc0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="11091229000123"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Lord Hill of Oareford):</b> My Lords, I start by saying that I agree very much with the noble Lord, Lord, Low, about how important it is to make sure that teachers have the skills that they need to teach all pupils in the classroom, including, of course, those with special educational needs, and that it is not something that will be swept under the carpet-a point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Whitchurch.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000019"></a>In our SEN and disability Green Paper, which we published earlier this year, we set out a broad approach to achieving higher standards in the teaching of special educational needs and disability. Those measures included making the highly successful Achievement for All  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC113"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC113</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>approach available to all schools; strengthening the coverage of SEN and disability in initial teacher training-in particular, by giving more trainees the opportunity to undertake extended placements in special provision in mainstream and special schools; continuing to fund the training of new SENCOs; establishing scholarship schemes to give experienced teachers and support staff the chance to undertake continuing professional development in SEN; developing advanced training modules in the most prevalent types of SEN, which will support teachers in developing their own knowledge and skills and in supporting other teachers; developing specialist modules in severe learning difficulties, and profound and multiple learning difficulties; and supporting specialist SEN training across clusters of schools. Those are some of the more general measures that we are taking, which I hope will reassure noble Lords. This is an area that we continue to take seriously. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, that this is not something that one wants to see as an add-on; one wants to see it as integral to training.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000020"></a>Alongside those measures, teaching schools will, we hope, play an important role. We announced the first 100 teaching schools this July. The designation criteria did not include a specific requirement in relation to SEN, but they are intended to ensure that each teaching school has the capacity to improve teaching schools in SEN and disability in its area. I will write to the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Yardley, with the information we have on the teaching schools rated as outstanding. In response to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland of Houndwood, the new inspection framework we are developing with Ofsted will embed the connection between the achievement of different groups of pupils and the school's overall Ofsted judgment. Under that framework, for a school to be outstanding it will need to demonstrate that it is doing well for pupils with special educational needs and other vulnerable groups.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000021"></a>All the first 100 teaching schools have demonstrated that they have a clear track record of collaborative relationships with other schools. Part of that role is to identify and co-ordinate expertise in those other schools to ensure that together they can provide excellence across the board. Teaching schools will also have the responsibility to identify, recruit and designate specialist leaders of education. Specialist leaders of education will be outstanding professionals in middle and senior leadership positions who have the capacity, skills and commitment to support professionals in other schools. Those leaders will include experts in SEN provision. Special schools also have an important role in spreading best practice to other special schools and to mainstream schools. Of the 100 schools designated in the first round, seven were special schools, and I hope that more special schools will be able to join the network soon.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000022"></a>We are working with the national college and the SEN sector to ensure that the next phase of the teaching schools programme also supports improvements for children with SEN-for example, on the designation criteria for specialist leaders of education. I will have to write to my noble friend Lord Elton on his point about the number of people identified with dyslexia.</p>

<p><a name="11091229000023"></a>Overall, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Low, will agree that a lot is being done to build the skills of teachers in supporting children with special educational needs and disabilities. It is an important area. The teaching schools will have an important role. I think that the new Ofsted designation will make that link explicit. We will continue to work with special educational needs charities to ensure that the focus on this important area remains. With that, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Low, will feel able to withdraw his important amendment.</p>

Within the SEN group, I can see those children with emotional and behavioural difficulties particularly profiting from the Government's strategy to increase classroom-based learning. With those children, it is often the case that they can act out, act aggressively towards a teacher or other pupils. That can give rise to an understandable anger or irritation in the teacher which they may feel very moved to act on, but which will not be a helpful or appropriate reply to the behaviour. On the other hand, some children become very depressed, and it is easy to ignore them. Having an outsider observing the class and seeing how the teacher reacts can be a very helpful method to enable teachers to engage with EBD children and help to include them in the mainstream.</p>

<p><a name="11091229000025"></a>Models such as consultation for school staff, such as has been done for many years by the child and adolescent psychotherapist Emil Jackson in north London, is another way to help staff to think more deeply about their relationships with their pupils, particularly those who are challenging. I hope that the Minister will forgive me for making that additional comment.</p>

I am therefore glad to have flagged it up, but I am reassured by what the Minister said about the work going on-in particular what he said to the effect that an Ofsted designation of overall effectiveness will increasingly be difficult to achieve without a demonstration of quality or excellence in the field of SEN. I hope that the Minister and the department will continue to make clear to Ofsted that overall effectiveness requires all-round effectiveness but necessarily includes excellence in special educational needs. With the Minister's reassurance about the work that is going on and the indication that he has given of the work being done to clarify that an Ofsted designation of teaching-school status will increasingly require excellence in special educational needs, I am happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

My noble friend is unable to be in her place today so I speak for both of us.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000028"></a>I thank the Minister for his letter to my noble friend of 19 July, in which he refers to Clause 42. He points out that the ISI already inspects the standard of education of Independent Schools Council member schools. When these education inspections were handed over to the ISI, he reminds us in his letter, safeguards were put in place. Ofsted was required to monitor the work of the independent inspectorates and publish an annual report. Clause 42 provides for Ofsted to monitor welfare inspections as it already does for education inspections. The Minister points out in his letter that the ISI has put in a consistently strong performance in those reports to date. Clause 42 also sets out the matters that the Secretary of State will take into account when approving or withdrawing approval from independent inspectorates.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000029"></a>My questions about this are many, and perhaps we can address them one by one. First, there is a matter of principle. The ISI was originally set up to inspect the ISC's own members. There is nothing wrong with that. Any organisation may legitimately self-inspect in order to achieve higher quality. A public inspection role is something else altogether, though, and to allow the ISI to move from that to the far more rigorous public role of child welfare inspecting and producing reports on which the public are to place reliance is very dubious unless the safeguards are far greater than those that I have heard so far. I remind the Committee that in this context the public have absolutely nothing else upon which to rely.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000030"></a>It is true that Ofsted monitors the work of the independent inspectorates, but the 2009-10 report consisted of nothing more than a letter from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector to a civil servant in the department in which only one paragraph covered safety and welfare, and even that paragraph makes claims that are totally inadequate.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000031"></a>I turn to the independence of these inspectorates from the schools that they are inspecting, and the undertakings and terms and conditions under which they take over this new responsibility from Ofsted. The Minister explains in his letter that since 2007 the ISI has been a subsidiary company of the Independent Schools Council, with an independent board. However, a quick look at the accounts of the company shows that the finances of the two organisations are completely intertwined. The words used in the accounts to 31 December 2010 are that the "ultimate controlling party" is the ISC. That does not make the ISI independent in any shape or form.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000032"></a>I am encouraged by the Minister's statement in his letter of 19 July that the ISI will become fully independent of the ISC from January 2012. However, I understand that the inspectors carrying out these inspections will still all have to be members of the ISC. They are all, indeed, teachers or former teachers or heads of ISC schools, so exactly the same board will remain in place. Therefore, how the organisation can, in practice, possibly be considered independent, even under these new arrangements, is something that I struggle with.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC116"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC116</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000033"></a>What then become even more important are the undertakings and terms under which the ISI takes over this duty from Ofsted. When Ofsted took over the inspection of welfare and safeguarding from CSCI, we were assured that it was under the very same conditions under which CSCI operated. Can the Minister assure me that, when the ISI and the other inspectorates take over from Ofsted, they will again operate under the very same conditions and to the same standards? This is very important for the simple reason that none of these organisations is subject to the Freedom of Information Act, and it can be very hard to get out of them any information that they do not wish to give. In earlier years the CSCI inspection reports and, before that, those of county councils, did a good and thorough job-reliable, conscientious and carried out by those with the right skill set and experience. They were good precisely because they contained no element whatever of educational inspection. Welfare was not bolted on to the end of an education report; the two matters are totally different.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000034"></a>I turn now to the stability of the ISI. During the Recess there was considerable reporting of the fact that the Headmasters' Conference voted to leave the ISC. It takes with it most of the larger and more influential independent schools, and about £600,000 of the ISC's annual £1.4 million income. The reason given was that some head teachers are unhappy because the ISC has lost its focus on defending the interests of the independent sector. It is perfectly appropriate for a group to have an organisation to protect its interests, but it is not appropriate for the same organisation to be totally in control of the organisation that inspects child welfare in its schools on behalf of the public. However, the exodus from the ISC creates an organisation the stability and financial viability of which are in question. Taking away the subscriptions of the larger schools leaves it with a large number of smaller schools to support and inspect, and a smaller pool of inspectors from which to draw. Let us recall that all ISI inspectors must be from ISC schools under the current rules.  Will the Minister assure us that this aspect of its  operation, at least, will change if Clause 42 is implemented?</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000035"></a>Another matter that the Government are currently considering impinges on this issue. Clause 39 exempts outstanding schools in the maintained sector from educational inspections. Consequently, there is an impending separation of the child welfare school inspection role from the education inspection role. Clearly, welfare inspections will have to continue in those schools that do not have inspections for their education standards. There will be an unavoidable divergence of inspection cycles, which will have the effect of making integrated inspections impossible in the maintained sector. One of the reasons given for Clause 42 in my noble friend's letter is that it would give independent schools the benefit of a single inspection event. Leaving aside the fact that welfare inspection is not for the benefit of any school but for the safety and protection of vulnerable children, it will be impossible to do a single inspection anyway. Also, there will to be pressure to relieve independent schools of the burden of inspection at all. Are we seriously to entertain the notion that the best of our maintained schools are to   


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC117"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC117</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be relieved of the burden of the usual inspection cycle but Winchester, Eton, Harrow and Westminster, with their unarguable high education standards, are still to be inspected? It is obvious that they will want to be relieved of the burden as well. Where will this end? You would have the ISC arguing strongly for its schools to be relieved of the very inspection regime that its own inspection arm is charged with carrying out. This has not been thought through.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000036"></a>Finally, although most independent schools care for and protect their pupils very well, as parents would expect, there have been some appalling cases of abuse, which, when they eventually see the light of day, we discover have been going on for a very long time. I have had conversations with some victims of such long-term abuse. That is why my noble friend Lord Phillips of Sudbury, the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, and others are very sceptical about the measures in Clause 13 to restrict the reporting of allegations against teachers. It has been far too easy in the past for people to close their eyes to abuse or make it easy for the perpetrator to resign quietly and go somewhere else. I am anxious to ensure that welfare inspections are done rigorously and that vested interests do not get in the way. We must always bear in mind that independent schools are commercial organisations. Even those run by charities make surpluses, which the charities can use for legitimate purposes. Therefore, there is the potential to lose a lot of money if the school is found wanting in the safeguarding department.</p>
<h5><a name="11091229000109"></a><I>4 pm</I></h5>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000037"></a>I would also like to ensure that, where there has been abuse, the subsequent inspection overtly inspects what action has been taken, and openly reports whether the failures that allowed the abuse to occur have been put right. I hope my noble friend the Minister can assure me that, if the arrangements in Clause 42 are ever implemented, he will ensure that all these things happen. Parents expect it, and children deserve it, as do the very many good and responsible teachers and heads in the sector. We must remember that in exposing malpractice in these matters we are protecting the reputations of all the good schools which do these things well.</p>

<p><a name="11091229000038"></a><b><a name="110912-gc0001.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="11091229000127"></a>Lord Lexden:</b> My Lords, following my noble friend's powerful speech, I want to make just a few points on inspection arrangements for independent schools. I do so as a former general secretary of the Independent Schools Council. It was during my  time that the Independent Schools Inspectorate assumed its early shape, before being put on a firmer basis by the Secretary of State, and being given responsibilities which were clearly delineated, and  approved by the Secretary of State, under the Education Act 2002.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000039"></a>One point that I would like to make is that the Independent Schools Council is not quite in the state of flux that my noble friend suggested. The Headmasters' Conference has had disagreements with the Independent Schools Council, which acts on behalf of a number of independent schools associations. There have been detailed inquiries as to how the Independent Schools  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC118"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC118</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Council might operate more effectively in the future. I understand that those negotiations and discussions have reached a satisfactory conclusion, and on that basis the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference will be remaining one of the constituent elements of the Independent Schools Council.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000040"></a>There is no doubt at all about the independence with which the ISI operates. This was clearly laid down in the terms of reference that the then Secretary of State gave the ISI in 2002. It is becoming stronger and more manifest next year, as my noble friend mentioned, since the ISI is going to be reconstituted as an independent trust. At no time has the ISC sought to influence, directly or indirectly, the work that independent schools inspectors have done. This has been clearly shown by Ofsted's monitoring of the education inspections, which has been conducted since 2002 under the terms of reference laid down by the Secretary of State. Not one cause of complaint or censure has ever been laid against the ISI by Ofsted during its monitoring of education inspections. Indeed Ofsted's report last year praised the "excellent dialogue and communication" with schools, the "clear and authoritative" feedback, the "inspectors' courtesy and professionalism", and the "rigorous" checking of schools' "compliance with the regulations". I know from my own experience the seriousness with which Ofsted undertakes these duties, which are recorded publicly. Also, there is close Ofsted involvement in the everyday work of the ISI, since representatives of Ofsted-very senior figures indeed-come to the meetings of the committees which oversee the ISI's work.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000041"></a>As things stand at the moment, independent boarding schools are subject to two separate inspections, causing a great deal of duplication, and of course extra expense. The monitoring arrangements, having worked so well as far as educational inspections are concerned, are now going to be put-and this is a wholly new aspect of things-on a firm, statutory basis as, under  Clause 42, the power to inspect welfare arrangements will pass to the Independent Schools Inspectorate as well.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000042"></a>The work done by the ISI is rigorously overseen. High standards have been maintained by the Independent Schools Inspectorate. There is a wide feeling that it is fit to carry out boarding welfare inspections, the quality of its inspectors and the rigour of its work having been clearly supported and underlined by Ofsted. To the extent that there is concern about the ISI's position, Clause 42 should increase confidence in that it puts into primary legislation a duty on Ofsted to monitor and oversee the ISI's work. This is something that already works well in practice for the educational aspect of school inspections. The clause will remove any doubt as to Ofsted's role and the quality assurance and oversight of the ISI's work, and it should lower costs to schools by substituting two inspectorates with one, with no lowering of regulatory standards. I believe that it is a welcome clause and that it should receive support.</p>

There are cycles in which the inspections take place. The inspectors do not suddenly arrive at schools unannounced.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000046"></a>Education inspections in most independent boarding schools are carried out by independent inspectorates. Boarding schools, unlike day schools, are also subject to welfare inspections, which are carried out by Ofsted, as my noble friend set out. Where possible, Ofsted and independent inspectorates carry out joint inspections to minimise disruption to the schools concerned, but there are two separate inspection reports, published on two different websites, and that information is readily available on those websites.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000047"></a>The Secretary of State already has a power to appoint an independent inspectorate to undertake boarding welfare inspections in England. We intend to use this power to appoint the Independent Schools Inspectorate, which will mean that schools affiliated to the Independent Schools Council will be subject to a single inspection, covering both education and boarding welfare, which will be followed by a single published report. However, I stress that there will be two reports-one for education and one for welfare.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000048"></a>The clause replicates the measures that are already in place on education inspections to ensure that any independent inspectorate appointed operates effectively. It allows Ofsted to monitor inspections by independent inspectorates of the welfare of children in independent boarding schools and requires the chief inspector to prepare an annual report on those inspections. It also gives the Secretary of State a power to direct Ofsted to undertake a boarding inspection of any school at any time, including where the boarding provision would normally be inspected by an independent inspectorate. This is the same power as he has in relation to other types of inspection, but in practice we would expect this power to be used only in exceptional cases.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000049"></a>I hope that my noble friend will agree that these measures, when taken together, provide transparency, accountability and confidence in the arrangements for independent inspectorates to carry out welfare inspections in independent boarding schools. I reassure her that welfare inspections will continue in all schools, whether they are outstanding or not.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000050"></a>I also reassure my noble friend that safeguards for welfare inspections will be as robust as they are for education inspections, and that regulations will set out criteria for the appointment of independent inspectorates and for terminating any such appointment, if need be. The criteria in respect of boarding will mirror the criteria for appointment in respect of education.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000051"></a>My noble friend mentioned the HMC vote to leave the ISC. I hope that she has been reassured by the point made by my noble friend Lord Lexden. I suspect that I will not have covered other points in my reply, in which case I will write to my noble friend, but, meanwhile, I hope that she will feel free to withdraw the amendment.</p>

As she knows, I edit the <I>Good Schools Guide</I>, and therefore have a long-standing and unhappy relationship with the Independent Schools Council inspection service, which has yet to return even one of my e-mails. Although I agree that it is inspecting much better than it used to, it still seems to take the school's side rather more often than I find comfortable. I think that, because a lot of the people doing the inspecting suffer the same problem with difficult parents as the people who they are inspecting, they do not pay the attention that they ought to occasional signals of distress and therefore fail to spot underlying problems.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000053"></a>I am very dubious about mixing education and welfare; they are different concerns and different skills. How is a young boy in distress going to talk to someone who appears to be a schoolmaster if he will not talk to his schoolmaster? You need a completely different character, training and skill-set to be a good inspector of welfare-to understand what is going on in a family, if you are in a local authority context, or in a school. I am not anticipating great disaster. Schools are light years away from what they were when I was a child and there is no general problem, but we all know that a lot of girls' schools have eating disorder problems. There is certainly still bullying in some schools to an unacceptable level. Spotting those things requires someone to go round the school who pupils who have not talked to and who people at the school feel able to take into their confidence. As I said, that is a different character of person. For myself, I would be surprised if the ISC does that well. It may be a long while before we have a problem arising from it, because problems are mercifully rare.</p>

If I remember correctly, the Children's Commissioner for England, Professor Al Aynsley-Green, when he was in office, was particularly enthusiastic about his power to make unannounced inspections. Professor Eileen Munro, in her final report on safeguarding children, recently advocated the use of unannounced inspections, principally because they relieved organisations of a bureaucratic burden. She felt that that would be less burdensome to them than announced inspections. I would be interested to hear from the Minister what is the current situation with regard to those two kinds of inspection-announced and unannounced.</p>

That remains a difficulty, and I should be grateful if the Minister would look at that again. The other key point that has not been covered is access to information. Having bits of a report somewhere is not the same as freedom of information on the detail of a report. As I mentioned in my speech, many schools in the independent sector would not be happy to have details such as that published and it might be pushed to the back. I am very grateful for the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. I am sure that the <I>Good Schools Guide</I> would be interested in ensuring that parents have access to information for all the reasons I explained.</p>

The key point that I was trying to make earlier is that inspections under CSCI were clearly about welfare, as opposed those of the old-style Ofsted-if I can call it that-which were clearly about education. They require different professionals with different attitudes. It might be possible in some circumstances to run the inspections side by side, as has happened in local government, where there has been a plethora of inspections. However, the inspections are not the same, because they look at different things with different people. I should be grateful if the Minister would write to me on that point as well.

<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC122"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC122</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>more swiftly than hitherto-to close schools. In  response to that proposed new power, I shall move Amendment 122ZC.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000063"></a>Currently, the Secretary of State can direct the closure of a school only if it has already been categorised by Ofsted in its independent inspection as requiring special measures. Clause 43 will allow the Secretary of State to step in and close schools on the basis not of an independent, standardised assessment but of any judgment that he comes to that that route of closure is required. Under subsection (3), he will be able also to direct a local authority to issue a performance standards and safety warning notice where it has decided against it. Then, when a warning notice has been given for whatever reason, and the school has not complied, the school will automatically become eligible for intervention and it will be open for the Secretary of State to close it.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000064"></a>Closures of schools could therefore be triggered in this way by the Secretary of State, and not on the basis of an independent assessment by Ofsted. That is a serious extension of power. Closing a school is a nuclear option and has serious implications for parents and an area. The provision would also mean a transferring of schools into academy status by diktat of the Secretary of State without the normal processes having been gone through. I shall explain shortly what I mean by that.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000065"></a>Will the Minister set out his thinking on how closures allowed under the clause would take place and how they would contribute to increasing standards and meeting parents' and pupils' needs? Under what circumstances would the Secretary of State step in to close a school that was not in special measures rather than, as is the case at the moment, help drive improvements in the school as a first option? How would such closures that the Secretary of State could simply enforce enable a local authority, for instance, to plan strategically to meet pupil place needs?</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000066"></a>As noble Lords may gather from our amendment, which is different from those that will be moved by Liberal Democrats, we do not have a particular problem with the power contained in the clause giving the Secretary of State the power to direct a local authority as there may be circumstances in which local authorities are or have been slow to act in relation to schools where improvements are required. However, we do have a problem with the uncircumscribed and unfettered power of the Secretary of State himself to close a school, and there are two reasons for that. First, there is an issue of principle relating to such a serious option in an area; that if a school is not in special measures, it is right that parents, teachers and locally interested parties are able to play a part in determining what happens to it. There ought also to be an independent assessment by Ofsted on the need for that option. Secondly, I question whether the clause is something of a Trojan horse to accelerate the establishment of academies. The clause, coupled with Clause 36 on the establishment of new schools and the presumption in the Bill that any new school will be an academy, will mean that where, outside an Ofsted inspection and the conclusion of special measures, the Secretary of State decides to close a school-he can do so for a whole variety of reasons-the new school that takes its place  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC123"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC123</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will, by default, be an academy. It will not have to go through the normal processes that schools are now required to go through to become academies. It is conceivable that even some relatively well-performing schools could be required to close by the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000067"></a>I would therefore be grateful if, in addition to dealing with the points I raised earlier, the Minister could reassure us on this point. Will he set out the vision for the future education system and say whether the Government see a place for maintained schools in that? Is it the case that this provision and Clause 36, and the presumption that all new schools will be academies, are designed to ensure that the Secretary of State can accelerate the establishment of academies, irrespective of the views of parents and teachers, by closing schools directly himself and then reopening them as academies?</p>

<p><a name="11091229000068"></a><b><a name="110912-gc0001.htm_spnew21"></a><a name="11091229000141"></a>Baroness Sharp of Guildford:</b> My Lords, I, too, want to speak to Amendments 122A and 122B.  Clause 43 gives the Secretary of State powers to intervene and close schools that are in special measures. That widens the powers of intervention to schools causing concern. Subsection (3) strengthens the Secretary of State's powers so that where a local authority, having been directed to consider set performance standards and to issue a safety warning notice, has decided not to do so, the Secretary of State may direct the local authority to give such a warning notice. If such a warning notice is issued to a school and it fails to comply, it immediately makes itself eligible for intervention. As the noble Baroness explained, that may well mean that it is closed and an academy is opened in its place. Under the Education and Inspections Act 2006, the warning notice gives the school the right to ask the chief inspector whether the warning notice is justified and the chief inspector may confirm it or otherwise.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000069"></a>Our problem with the subsection is the degree to which it removes all discretion from local authorities. The problem is that a local authority is asked to consider whether to give a warning notice and to set performance standards. If, having looked at the school it decides that other measures might be more appropriate and it therefore does not issue a warning notice or the appropriate performance standard, the Secretary of State may now just peremptorily intervene. At a time when the Government are anxious to try to devolve responsibilities-the Localism Bill is going through the main Chamber today-it is against the whole spirit of localism that the Secretary of State should be given these somewhat draconian powers.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000070"></a>Amendment 122B is to some extent a probing amendment. It suggests that we want to know, if academies fail in the same way as some schools fail, whether they have to obey the same rules as maintained schools have to. Is it appropriate that there should be intervention in exactly the same way and that they might be closed down? If they are closed down, the obvious solution would be for the local authority to have the power to step in and open a maintained school in its place-a sort of quid pro quo for the shutting down of a maintained school and the opening

Here we would have the equal and opposite effect. We would like to know a little more about what happens if an academy fails.</p>

<p><a name="11091229000071"></a><b><a name="110912-gc0001.htm_spnew22"></a><a name="11091229000142"></a>Lord Hill of Oareford:</b> My Lords, none of us wants to see underperforming schools letting down pupils year after year. To answer the question put by the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes of Stretford, it is to tackle that entrenched underperformance in certain areas that we are keen to take these measures, which are similar to measures that the previous Government intended to take. We know that out of the 200 worst performing primary schools in the country, over half have been below the floor standard for over 10 years, and 112 of the 200 worst performing primaries are in local authorities that have never issued a warning notice. I know that the previous Government were keen to tackle underperformance, and so are we.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000072"></a>Our starting point would certainly be that underperformance should ideally be addressed by locally developed and agreed solutions, and we are seeing more and more examples of local authorities working with the Government and schools to come up with agreed sponsored-academy solutions. Where there is consistent underperformance, however, and the school and local authority seem unable or unwilling to tackle it, we think that the Secretary of State needs to be able to intervene. This is an urgent and important issue so we intend, subject to the passage of the Bill, to commence the provision on Royal Assent.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000073"></a>The Secretary of State already has a range of intervention powers. Where schools are eligible for intervention-because they have failed to comply with a warning notice or have been judged to require special measures or to require significant improvement by Ofsted-the Secretary of State can appoint additional governors, impose an interim executive board or make an academy order. The Secretary of State can also require the closure of a school in special measures and direct a local authority to consider issuing a warning notice. It is these two powers that the previous Government's Children, Schools and Families Act sought to extend, and which Clause 43 of this Bill also seeks to extend.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000074"></a>We believe that there is an inconsistency in the current law that means that one intervention option, directing closure, is available only for schools in the Ofsted category of special measures. Where the Secretary of State needs to intervene, he should be able to choose a form of intervention that is most appropriate for the circumstances. If he chooses to direct closure, he has a duty to consult, including with the local authority and the school, and he will have to take account of the views expressed in reaching a fair and reasonable decision.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000075"></a>Warning notices are a well established legal tool for addressing underperformance. They can help schools to recognise and address their problems or, if the school is not capable of addressing the action, they can enable further intervention by either the local authority or the Secretary of State. However, it is the case that local authorities use their power to issue warning notices inconsistently. Two-thirds of them have never issued a warning notice at all. That is why  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC125"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC125</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Secretary of State needs to be able to direct the local authority to issue a warning notice: so that they can be used where they are necessary, as opposed to being dependent on the practice of the local authority. However, we accept that there need to be checks and balances. Therefore, we have included a provision giving the governing body a right to appeal to Ofsted against a direction to issue a warning notice. It would remain the case that the Secretary of State would first have to direct a local authority to consider giving a warning notice. It is only if the local authority decided not to do so that the Secretary of State, having considered the reasons given by the local authority, could then direct it to issue a warning notice, subject to that check of the appeal to Ofsted.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000076"></a>My noble friend Lady Sharp mentioned underperforming academies. I agree with her that, where an academy is failing, the same kind of tough and decisive action should be taken against it. If such action is necessary, we will take it. The Secretary of State's recent letter to academies that were below the floor standard and to local authorities with schools below the floor standard demonstrates our sharper focus on underperforming academies. However, as she might expect, we do not believe that the solution should be to withdraw an academy's freedoms. Those schools would need support to make better use of the autonomy that academy status brings, and we should look at why it has not happened. In the case of an underperforming academy, that would mean ensuring that effective leadership and appropriate support are in place. Through the funding agreement, we can ultimately use our powers to replace the sponsor to make sure that there is a suitable one to take that academy forward.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000077"></a>While I accept that no programme will ever be infallible, the evidence shows that academy status and autonomy are working. From 2009 to 2010, results in academies improved by an average of 7.8 percentage points, compared with a national increase of 4.5 percentage points for all maintained schools. Again, this year chains of academies have reported some impressive results. The measures that we propose are a logical extension of the current powers. They follow the direction that the previous Government intended to take but with some added safeguards. With that information, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

I certainly recognise the concerns about failing schools that have continued to fail children over long periods. However, I am reminded of something that a young man who grew up in a non-functioning family said to me a little while ago. He said, "I have issues of trust". It is very hard for families who are struggling to trust individuals or institutions. Their relationship with their school can become very important. I can imagine that it might be enormously disruptive to such families to find that their school is being turned upside down. Therefore, I will listen to the response of the noble Baroness. I am reassured to a large degree by what the Minister said, but I say to him

I absolutely agree with the Minister that underperforming schools cannot be allowed to continue underperforming indefinitely. I feel as passionately about that as he does. So do many Members of the Committee, I suspect. However, the key question is: how effectively can we drive that improvement in performance, particularly when underperformance has been persistent over a period? Sadly, it is also generally the case that underperforming schools are not distributed evenly around the country. They tend to be concentrated in areas where local authorities are weak or where there are endemic problems and so on. There is often a concentration of underperforming schools. That issue needs to be grappled with. The route that the Government are taking is different in some respects from the one that we were proposing. The previous Government wanted powers to direct a local authority to act, but not necessarily the sweeping powers that this Government are taking to allow the Secretary of State to make the judgment directly about closing the school. That is a key difference. I can entertain the possibility that  there may be a place for the Secretary of State to have that power but, in deciding this in Committee and on Report, we ought to have a much clearer idea of the criteria that the Secretary of State would use to  make the decision for direct closure and the kind of circumstances in which those powers would be  used.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000080"></a>There are other powers that it may be more constructive to use. For instance, there are powers to intervene directly with the local authority. As a Minister, I did that in a number of local authority areas in setting up performance management boards. Sometimes it was with representation from a Minister, chaired by a Minister with Department for Education officials with independent representation, with experts, with the chief executive of the local authority, with the director children's services and with head teachers, charged with driving up performance, not in 10 years but demonstrably in one or two years. That method might not be suitable everywhere, but where it is appropriate it drives up performance in schools without the nuclear option of closing local schools with the uncertainty that that creates for parents.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000081"></a>In that system, if maintained schools improve, they will stay as maintained schools. That is another key difference between our vision and that of the Government; we saw a place for diversity in having schools of high standards both in the maintained sector and, where this was necessary to drive up standards, as academies, with the freedoms that academies have. I do not think that is the case here, and my concern, as I have voiced before, is that the different measures taken together in the Bill will actually enable an acceleration of academies simply by diktat when the Secretary of State closes schools. The schools that will replace those schools will by definition be academies, not maintained schools, so I still have concerns.</p>

<p><a name="11091229000082"></a>I saw the Minister and his officials nodding. It would be helpful if it were possible for him to write to me before Report with some idea of criteria and the circumstances in which these powers to close schools and reopen them as academies would be used, so that we could make a judgment on what is on the Government's mind on this issue. With that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Parents will instead have to complain directly to the Secretary of State, a remedy that is widely perceived to be slow and ineffective. Indeed, when we were discussing the question of complaints to the Secretary of State when dealing with the Academies Bill last year, it was clear that the system was creaking, with the standard time taken to deal with complaints averaging as much as 18 months.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000084"></a>The Local Government Ombudsman has always considered complaints about a wide range of education matters as they relate to local authorities, including concerns about special educational needs. However, until recently the ombudsman was unable to consider complaints about internal school matters. This meant that the complaints process was fragmented, with parents taking their complaint about the local authority to the Local Government Ombudsman but having to take their complaint about the school to the Secretary of State. Parents understandably felt surprised and frustrated when the Local Government Ombudsman was unable to pursue a complaint further once it became a school matter, and would be disappointed when they discovered that their only recourse was to complain to the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000085"></a>In order to deal with this unsatisfactory state of affairs the last Government, in the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009, extended the Local Government Ombudsman's powers to cover complaints from parents and children about a range of non-teaching matters concerning the internal management of schools by governors and head teachers. In April 2010, the Local Government Ombudsman launched a pilot phase of the new school complaints service. These pilots are taking place in 14 local authority areas, and are being used to shape the design and delivery of the new service. The Local Government  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC128"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC128</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Ombudsman has also been providing training and information sessions on the new processes, which were due to be in place nationally by this month, September 2011. I understand that the feedback from these pilots has been extremely positive, and indicates a strong level of satisfaction from schools and parents with the conduct and outcomes of the investigations. There have been no challenges by schools to the remedies proposed by the Local Government Ombudsman.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000086"></a>In these circumstances, I am at a loss to understand why the Government want to put the clock back, revert to the previous, fragmentary and unsatisfactory system, and remove the Local Government Ombudsman's power to investigate complaints about schools as well as local authorities. I am grateful to the Minister for his letter of 8 September, in which he set out the department's thinking very fully, but I am bound to say that I did not think it altered the case very greatly. Indeed, to my mind, it only underlined the need for a more concerted route for complaints.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000087"></a>I focus my remarks on the impact on children with SEN and disabilities. I recognise that complaints about a school's failure to deliver the content of a statement of SEN will still be covered by the Local Government Ombudsman. However, I also understand that the most common single school-level issue investigated by the Local Government Ombudsman in the pilots has been bullying, something which will be removed from his purview if this clause goes through. A literature review carried out by the University of Cambridge recently stated that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11091229000104"></a>"There is a great weight of evidence that confirms that children with SEN and/or disabilities are significantly more likely to be bullied or victimised than their non-disabled peers".</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000088"></a>The Local Government Ombudsman is able to consider policies and practices of schools, and ensure that they are correctly following their own procedures on things like bullying. The Secretary of State has a much weaker set of investigatory powers, which focus only on breaches of the law, which means that he will be unable to go into matters which involve school policy rather than law, such as bullying. I had understood that the Government wanted to ensure that parents of children with SEN and disabilities are not hampered by bureaucracy, and bureaucratic and complex processes, when all they want to do is make sure that their child gets the help they need. This is one of the guiding principles underpinning the SEN and disability Green Paper, with a view to making a system which is more user-friendly and works better for parents. I therefore believe the Government should think again about whether the handling of complaints against schools should be taken back into the Department for Education, and particularly whether this is the quickest and most accessible way of ensuring parents get the right support for their child. As the Lamb inquiry stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11091229000105"></a>"The Local Government Ombudsman represents the potential for a unified route for individual complaints about SEN at both a school and local authority level, with more appropriate forms of redress available to parents".</p>
<h5><a name="11091229000112"></a>4.45 pm</h5>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000089"></a>I realise that the department has published standards it will seek to comply with for dealing with complaints, but it is highly questionable whether the DfE has the  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC129"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC129</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>capacity for this. No additional resources have been allocated to deal with this additional work and there are a number of further responsibilities that the Secretary of State is taking on as a result of the Bill for which provision will need to be made. I am sure that Minister will agree that cases where children do not get the help they need often arise because a school and local authority have not been working effectively together. I do not therefore understand why the Government are proposing to go back to a system where parents have to complain to the ombudsman about the failure of the local authority and to the Secretary of State about the failure of the school-even when the failures relate to the same child. Parents want a single unified complaints process and they want their complaints to be dealt with quickly and effectively by a single body.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000090"></a>The National Deaf Children's Society has sent me details of a case in Leeds, where a deaf child with additional disabilities was badly let down by the council and the school. The ombudsman found that, for example, staff caring for and educating the child did not know sign language and could not communicate with the child. Communication was further hampered by the poor acoustics in the school, and expert advice from an audiologist on this was not acted upon. There were not enough staff to help the child to use the toilet. The child sometimes returned home in wet trousers, developed blisters and suffered urinary tract infections. The ombudsman identified several other serious failings, but Leeds was not one of the pilot areas in which the ombudsman was able to investigate the school He regretted that he did not have the power to investigate the actions of the school and that he could not give a complete and comprehensive account of how the situation arose or was allowed to continue. The parent could complain to the Secretary of State, of course, but I am sure that the Minister will appreciate that having fought one battle she did not wish to have to start all over again. The parent wants and needs a single unified complaints procedure in order to ensure that swift and comprehensive action is taken to help her child.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000091"></a>I should be grateful if the Minister could say something to dispel my perplexity as to why the Government are pushing ahead with a proposal that will inevitably make the complaints process more complex and bureaucratic for parents. I should also be grateful if he clarified some points on Clause 44 made in the impact assessment. According to the assessment, the rationale for the Secretary of State taking this part back from the Local Government Ombudsman is that take-up has been low in the pilot areas. However, in those areas, the ombudsman has taken 200 complaints about schools. The assessment also states that the Secretary of State would expect to receive 200 additional complaints when the pilot ends and the Secretary of State again takes on responsibility for complaints about schools. It would therefore seem that take-up is absolutely in line with what the Government were expecting. Does the Minister agree?</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000092"></a>Of course, take-up is a crude way of assessing the success of the pilots. Can the Minister tell us what steps the department has taken to assess the response from parents to the unified complaints procedure in the pilot areas? How have the pilots been evaluated? Have the views of parents in the areas where the new  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC130"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC130</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>service has been piloted been taken into account when deciding to scrap it? We need to hear more about this before we agree to Clause 44.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000093"></a>There is something else that undermines confidence. Previous assurances regarding parents' ability to complain about academies would appear still not to have been met. During the passage of the Academies Bill commitments were made that a robust complaints procedure for academies would be developed by the Young People's Learning Agency. I do not believe that this has happened. Parents have called the YPLA, only to be advised that complaints against academies were not within its remit. This is still happening a year after the YPLA was given this responsibility.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000094"></a>It is in the interests of parents that the Local Government Ombudsman be able to investigate complaints against schools as well as against local authorities. Taking away this accountability mechanism before it has been fully evaluated, and at a time when the DfE is already facing a significantly increased workload, is something the Government should reconsider very carefully. Accordingly, I strongly urge the Minister to reconsider Clause 44.</p>

<p><a name="11091229000095"></a><b><a name="110912-gc0001.htm_spnew25"></a><a name="11091229000146"></a>Baroness Hughes of Stretford:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Low, has articulated clear and comprehensive arguments for Clause 42 not standing part of the Bill. I shall make three brief points in support of those arguments.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000096"></a>First, as the noble Lord said, the power of the Secretary of State to intervene in complaints is currently very limited. He is able to address only a very small number of complaints. The 2008 consultation document on complaints made this clear, stating:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11091229000106"></a>"In practice, this means that except where there is a clear breach of a specific duty (for example, a school failing to have a complaints policy or a behaviour policy) there are few occasions when the Secretary of State is empowered to intervene".</p>

<p><a name="11091229000100"></a>It does not seem very constructive to argue that parents can appeal to the Secretary of State. Let us be clear, we are talking about unresolved complaints. We all agree that complaints should ideally be resolved at the lowest level, with the school, the head teacher or the governors, but where they remain unresolved after going through those processes, it does not seem reasonable to argue that parents can go to the Secretary of State when, in practice, the number and nature of complaints that the Secretary of State can hear in law is very limited. Where would parents with complaints outside that limited ambit go?</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000097"></a>Secondly, the Secretary of State does not in practice investigate those complaints in person; they are investigated by civil servants in the department. There is an unhappy record of civil servants making decisions on individual cases whatever their nature. That is understandable because they neither know the detail nor have the local knowledge. We do not see consistency of decision-making across cases which are similar with such a system. It is not good practice for civil servants to make decisions on individual cases, but that is what happens in practice. A recommendation is then made to the Secretary of State, who also lacks any detailed knowledge with which to approve it or not. It is not a very satisfactory system from a parent's point of view.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC131"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC131</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000098"></a>Thirdly, because of those deficiencies, an attempt was made, as the noble Lord, Lord Low, outlined, to see whether there was a better way. A pilot was launched whereby parents were able to take unresolved complaints to the Local Government Ombudsman. This started only a little more than a year ago-in April last year. We may well hear from the Government that take-up has been low. The scheme has not been very well publicised and, as the noble Lord, Lord Low, said, we have had little information on its impact-anecdotal evidence shows that it has been rather positive. We need clearer and more reliable information about the impact of the system, particularly parents' and schools' views. It seems premature to abandon that new method before we are clear whether it offers a more effective, more efficient and more satisfactory way forward.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="11091229000099"></a>If Clause 44 were to stand part of the Bill, we would be left with a very unsatisfactory situation. It was because of the problems with the system of parents going to the Secretary of State that there was an attempt to find another route. We should surely see whether the other system can be made to work more effectively from parents' and schools' point of view before we abandon it.</p>

<p><a name="11091249000001"></a><b><a name="110912-gc0001.htm_spnew26"></a><a name="11091249000260"></a>Lord Lucas:</b> My Lords, I found the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Low of Dalston, immensely persuasive. Bullying in schools has been a problem without a solution for a long time, as I am sure my noble friend Lord Elton would agree. It is very hard for a parent who has gone through the procedures outlined by my noble friend in his response to the noble Lord, Lord Low, and not achieved any success to be stuck in a position where their child continues to be bullied and there is nothing more that they can do about it. There is, in effect, nowhere else for them to turn. The experiment started by the previous Government of giving this responsibility to the Local Government Ombudsman must be worth pursuing and evaluating.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000002"></a>I have recent experience of trying out both the department and the ombudsman with a complaint, although not in this area. Someone who lived in Lambeth was referred to me because he had been unable to find a school place for his child. Lambeth had failed in its duty to the extent that, when this man went to the appeal tribunal for places at a couple of schools, Lambeth said, "You don't need to bother. We've found him somewhere", which turned out not to be true. Not only had Lambeth not found him somewhere but it destroyed the chance that he had of getting his child into a school. I have talked to the department about that. It has been perfectly courteous but ineffective. When I discovered that this was something that the Local Government Ombudsman could take up, I referred my contact to it and it has been wonderful. It immediately put someone on the case and gave him someone to talk to day to day. He feels totally cared for and supported. It is a completely different experience from dealing with a government department. That is no surprise; government departments are not set up to do this. I did not know that the Local Government Ombudsman was as good as this but it has clearly developed an extremely good service.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC132"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC132</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000003"></a>The other difficulty that I have come across recently is rather from the other side of the fence. I shall read something that was written to me by a local authority that was trying to deal with academies in its area:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11091249000199"></a>"I am concerned that academies may not be complying in full with the provisions of the Pupil Registration Regulations. Some academies have withdrawn from Education Welfare Services, rather preferring to address matters of non attendance 'in house', however in certain circumstances they should, in accordance with the Pupil Registration Regulations, inform the Local Authority. For example, when a child has had 10 days or more continuous absence, and in other matters that are of concern to those in the Local Authority charged with safeguarding the welfare of children.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11091249000200"></a>In addition, I would like to seek some clarity with regard to Free Schools and their obligations in keeping pupil registers, publishing attendance policies and advising other agencies when there appear to be concerns".</p>

<p><a name="11091249000004"></a>Communication between schools and the welfare authorities is vital. If a local authority feels that a school may not be complying with its obligations, what is it supposed to do? Is it supposed to write to the Secretary of State, who is then supposed to chase individual academies? This is not the business of a government department, particularly when there is an agency that apparently does these things so well.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000005"></a>Home education is the other area in which I come across this. There are many people for whom home education is a choice. They prefer to look after their own children and educate them in their own way. However, there is also a large number of people who have been forced into it and have, particularly if their child has SEN, come to the end of their tether with the non-compliance of schools and local authorities in dealing with their children's problems. To date there has been no good place for them to go. If the Local Government Ombudsman is to offer that sort of resource, it will be enormously appreciated. I could understand abandoning it because it had proved ineffective but to abandon it now is a great mistake.</p>

<p><a name="11091249000006"></a><b><a name="110912-gc0001.htm_spmin7"></a><a name="11091249000261"></a>The Earl of Listowel:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, persuasively supports the persuasive case made by the noble Lord, Lord Low. I shall put two quick questions to the Minister. One concerns the admissions of looked-after children. I have been very grateful to him for the constant reassurance that these children will continue to feature at the top of the admissions criteria. However, who will enforce that duty on academies? Who will check that that happens, particularly in this case? I can see that there may be a virtue in this strong local ombudsman, who could take up cases of failure to meet this requirement.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000007"></a>Secondly, the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes, emphasised the value of local ombudsmen's local knowledge. I join her in saying that I have great respect for the men and women of the Civil Service. However, there are tasks which they are very well suited to do and tasks which they may not be so well suited to do. Therefore, I ask my noble friend Lord Low whether he can produce a little more information about the professional background of local ombudsmen. Perhaps that is something that we can discuss outwith the Chamber.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000008"></a>I think, for example, about the success of the Youth Justice Board. In recent years, I have seen great improvements in an area where in the past there has  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC133"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC133</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>been a lot of difficulty in dealing with children involved with the criminal justice system. The board consists of, for example, the director of the Children's Society and a judge from a youth court. There is a great pool of expertise at the top of the organisation and it draws in experts throughout the organisation. There is a lot to be said for choosing experts as advocates, thereby improving outcomes for children. I look forward to the Minister's response.</p>

I think that it is a step too far to assume that the route for dealing with problems of this kind must inevitably flow through the Secretary of State's office. I support the amendment.</p>

Indeed, it is strongly reinforced by other experts in the field. It is clearly unacceptable for there not to be any method of redress for parents of children who are not having their needs met. Children taken into care have been given a lot of attention and it very much looks as though they will be a high priority for school placements and so on. That is right and proper because they are firmly the responsibility of the state. However, that does not mean that there should not be an equal method of appeal for those who fall into a lesser category of concern.</p>

<p><a name="11091249000011"></a>I am very impressed by the Local Government Ombudsman, as the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, has clearly been. I am certainly not going to complain because it is part of a government department, but it is equally important that it has local knowledge and can understand local situations.</p>

<p><a name="11091249000012"></a>Therefore, I hope that we shall hear that the Minister has a very definite concern about what he has heard and that he will be taking away the whole matter and coming back with something more positive on Report.</p>

I was expecting the Minister to remind us that in effect the Secretary of State is no such person and that, when a complaint is made to him, someone quite different, more junior and perhaps more approachable manifests himself or herself. However, if that is not how the system works and if the only way to get a personal, sympathetic hearing is through the local ombudsman, I am very interested in hearing it.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para74"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000014"></a>For years I have been concerned about bullying in schools and about the extent to which the psychology of it is not understood. I know of children who do not feel that they can report that they are being bullied for a variety of reasons, one of which is that they think they should not be in that position. They think that they will be letting their parents down and they do not tell them about it at all. So when they go to the parent and the parent cannot get an answer, and the great strong arm of mother or father is unable to protect the

I was somewhat moved by the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Low, and was greatly concerned by what my noble friend said. I hope that the Minister will be able to give substantial reassurance on this issue before we get to Report.</p>

I recently came across a case of a mother whose son was excluded. He was bullied at school and the SEN provision at that school was not particularly good, but because he was bullied he responded and got excluded. The mother thought that he was being treated unfairly but did not know who she should complain to. She wrote to her MP and me, and I could not tell her the best route to take. We therefore have to consider educating parents on who they need to complain to, and I support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Low.</p>

<p><a name="11091249000016"></a><b><a name="110912-gc0001.htm_spnew31"></a><a name="11091249000266"></a>Lord Hill of Oareford:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Low, for tabling the amendment and for enabling us to have this conversation. My noble friend Lady Benjamin ended on a good point because getting a perfect complaints system that is able perfectly to deliver everything for everyone is an extremely tall order, but I am sure that there is more that we can do in terms of people being aware of the routes of recourse. One of the challenges for the Government and the department in thinking how to take this forward is making sure that there is clarity about the routes of redress and about the way that different routes of redress fit together, because confusion is part of the issue and my noble friend is right to say that it is not a sensible way forward to expect a parent who is concerned about their children to know how a complaints service works in every regard. I will therefore certainly reflect on that point.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para75"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000017"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Sutherland of Houndwood, has talked about the peaks of Whitehall and the Secretary of State sitting on his peak. It is worth emphasising that what we are talking about is returning to the situation that existed until April 2010. It is not therefore the case that we are proposing a leap into unknown territory and are striking out in some unknown way. The situation that we are seeking to return to is one that obtained until April 2010. Until then the Secretary of State had always considered unresolved complaints and, of course, the point was made that the Secretary of State is, in such cases, a manner of speaking and it is officials who consider the complaints on his behalf.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000018"></a>The LGO service was, as has been pointed out, established in only 14 local authority areas. My first point is that the vast majority of parents and pupils will see no change to the current arrangements in their areas. The Government are very grateful for the work of the Local Government Ombudsman in the 14 local authorities in which the schools complaints service has been operating. It is clear that the intention behind the creation of the service was a good one, but we are not convinced that the LGO school complaints service is the right way to ensure that issues that cannot be

The LGO service is a good service, but is expensive, relatively speaking, and was described by the Association of School and College Leaders as being a sledgehammer to crack a nut-that was its phrase, not mine. We believe it is preferable to return to a system in which complaints about schools which cannot be resolved locally come to the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000019"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Low, spoke particularly about special educational needs complaints. I agree with him that the present system and arrangements are far from clear. That is in part due to the complex nature of the current system, which, as he will know, the Green Paper is seeking to address. Parents do have a number of routes of complaint in relation to the SEN assessment and statementing process, depending on the precise nature of their complaint and the remedy they seek. He argued that it would be preferable for all complaints relating to SEN in schools and local authorities to go to the Local Government Ombudsman. However, I think it is fair to say that there may be complaints for which the power of the Secretary of State to direct compliance with legal duties can provide a swifter and more effective remedy for a parent who is frustrated by the failure of a school or local authority to take action. It is the case that intervention by officials in the department can be the prompt that resolves a difficult situation. Appeals about SEN assessment and statementing can also go to the First-tier Tribunal, which will remain. I think that it is hard, under the current arrangements, for there to be a single route of complaint. I accept that what is needed is clear information for parents on which route is most appropriate. Parents certainly want clarity. The department should work closely with the sector over the coming months to look at how the process for considering complaints about SEN provision works coherently for parents.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000020"></a>I accept that noble Lords have concerns about the capacity and capability of the department to provide a first-class complaint-handling service for parents. There was also a point raised about the YPLA. My honourable friend the Minister of State for Further Education, Skills and Lifelong Learning has made a commitment that the department will publish a set of standards on the timescales, clarity, transparency and accessibility of its consideration of complaints. With this in mind the department has started work to review the way that complaints are considered and to establish appropriate safeguards. The policy statement on Clause 44 that we circulated on 12 July outlines the draft standards that the department is developing, and I would welcome views on those standards from noble Lords. Through that work, we will ensure that the department has processes in place to consider complaints on behalf of the Secretary of State to the high standards that parents rightly expect.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para79"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000021"></a>Given the particular concerns relating to special educational needs complaints, officials recently met both the Special Educational Consortium and the National Deaf Children's Society, which has been mentioned this afternoon, and will be meeting them again with the Local Government Ombudsman. Alongside

I would like to extend an offer to the noble Lord, Lord Low, to discuss the improvements that we are seeking to make.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000022"></a>There was a specific question from the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, about the admissions arrangements for looked-after children. Complaints about admissions policies will go to the adjudicator. We are proposing to extend the groups of those that can complain. In terms of the refusal of a place to an individual child, there are the local admissions appeal panels. If there is further information I can send him, I will.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para81"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000023"></a>I recognise the views that have been expressed this afternoon, and I do think that this is an important area. I hope that I have provided the noble Earl, and other noble Lords, with some reassurance about the importance we attach to this, and at the moment I would ask the noble Lord, Lord Low, to withdraw his opposition to the clause.</p>
<h5><a name="11091249000250"></a>5.15 pm</h5>

<p><a name="11091249000025"></a><b><a name="110912-gc0001.htm_spnew32"></a><a name="11091249000267"></a>Lord Griffiths of Burry Port:</b> Before the Minister sits down, may I probe a little further? He says that, in so far as 14 areas are currently exposed to the new method that has been applied since April 2010, most parents will not notice any difference. Of course they will not; there are only 14 areas where the trial is being implemented. The more important point is what results are coming out of that trial. From what the noble Lord, Lord Low, was telling us, there are quite important, positive and affirmative messages about the success of this new system that should, if the logic were applied, be made available to the whole country instead of just 14 areas. Certainly, proper time for evaluation is necessary before taking a draconian measure of this kind, which subverts something that has been argued for and put in place and is being accepted as a reasonable way forward-especially by a Government who tell us time and again that they want smaller government and for fewer things to happen from Whitehall rather than more.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para82"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000026"></a>I have one further thing to say. The Minister introduced one word in his summing up that has not been mentioned at all in the debate apart from in his speech. We have all talked about the arguments and argued the case, reason has been invoked and we have appealed to experience and the history of this problem as it moves forward, but I want the Minister to give me an assurance regarding the word that he introduced: finance. Is it for financial reasons that we are moving from one system to another? Is that the driving force that would stop something so logical, appropriate and appreciated from taking place?</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000028"></a>These are long-standing problems, particularly when it comes to bullying, SEN and children getting into home education when they do not really want to be there. I am conscious that this has happened over a long period and in quite a high volume without any indication that the current methods, which we are to go back to, have provided an adequate answer. What was proposed by the previous Government and is now being trialled is a transfer from one set of officials who are not specialised and have limited powers to another set of officials who are specialised and have better powers. That seems to be worth trying. That is not to say that this is something that should not be done by Government; rather, it is to say that if we do it in a slightly different way, it could be done better.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para84"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000029"></a>I am conscious of the suffering that is caused by the current system and its inadequacies, and I do not want to go back to it. I do not mind going back to it if the system being trialled turns out to be no better and more expensive, but we ought to know what the evaluation is.</p>

<p><a name="11091249000030"></a><b><a name="110912-gc0001.htm_spnew34"></a><a name="11091249000269"></a>Lord Low of Dalston:</b> My Lords, the Minister has asked me to withdraw my amendment and my opposition to Clause 44 stand part. I will do that for the moment but a number of points have been made around the Committee to which we may want to return on Report, if it has not been possible for the Minister to give us greater satisfaction on them. I thank all noble Lords who have spoken on all sides of the Committee.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para85"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000031"></a>I shall clarify a couple of points. I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes, for making the point that we are talking here about unresolved complaints-complaints that have not been able to be resolved at local level. We all agree that complaints should be resolved at the lowest level possible, and it is only the unresolved ones that we are talking about referring to either the ombudsman or the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para86"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000032"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, asked me to say a bit more about the Local Government Ombudsman. I cannot say an awful lot, but I imagine that his office is staffed by people who are versed in the law, administration and local government. That is what I would expect.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000033"></a>Like others, I am bound to say that I have not been completely persuaded by the Minister's arguments. As the noble Lord, Lord Griffiths, pointed out, the desire to bring everything back to the Secretary of State comes rather oddly from a Government who preach so much localism but practise so much centralism. That we are merely returning to the situation as it was before 2010 may very well be true, but it was the pre-2010 situation which was found to be unsatisfactory. That is why the move to the Local Government Ombudsman was made.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para88"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000034"></a>It may be that, because the pilots have operated only in 14 areas, the great majority of people have not seen the benefits of the ombudsman's style of hearing complaints, but those who have not known anything better and are still mired in the pre-2010 situation might be pleased to experience the service that is offered under the 14 pilots.</p>

<p><a name="11091249000035"></a>Ministers have told us that bringing the investigation of complaints back to the Secretary of State would enable a quick resolution, but, as I said when opposing the clause, it has not been everybody's experience that the procedure of the Secretary of State's office has been all that expeditious in the past. It is clear that a lot of work still needs to be done before that route is fit for purpose.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000036"></a>It would be best if the Government were to put this on hold. If they can satisfy us by giving us the results of the evaluation before Report, that would be very helpful. If that is not possible, I would ask that the matter be taken back until there can be a proper evaluation. We might then be able to consider it again in future when another education Bill comes before the House.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para91"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000037"></a>The Minister kindly invited me to discuss the matter further with him, which I am happy to do. I would be very happy to join the discussions that he is having with the Special Educational Consortium and the National Deaf Children's Society if that would help to see whether we can clarify the procedures at least in relation to children with special educational needs in the context of the implementation of the Green Paper.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000038"></a>Although, as I have indicated, there are a number of unresolved issues here to which we may wish to return on Report, I no longer wish for now to oppose that the clause stand part of the Bill. I do so in the hope that the matter can be progressed on the basis of further discussions between now and Report or, if not then, when the Bill comes back before us on Report.</p>

This clause amends Section 456 of the Education Act 1996, on the regulation of permitted charges, to achieve two objectives-first, to allow a charge for the cost of buildings and accommodation when a school provides an optional extra, and, secondly, to make an exception for early years provision whereby a charge can be made only for teaching staff engaged under contracts for services and allow a charge to be made for employed staff. It is a rather technical issue.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000040"></a>I have a number of concerns about the way in which these provisions might operate. I am very grateful to the Minister for two letters that he sent me, on 21 June and 20 July this year, clarifying the way in which the Government envisage these measures operating. The assurances depend to a large extent on the regulations behind the provisions, which cannot be made totally clear to me today, but I should be grateful if the Minister could put the position on record in her reply, which would at least give me and other Members some assurance about the operation of these measures.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para94"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000041"></a>Without delaying the Committee further I ask the Minister, first, to confirm that through regulations the measures will not enable schools to delay entry into the reception class, keep children in nursery classes longer, and therefore charge. Secondly, can she confirm that the measures will not enable schools to charge for any child in reception class, even if they are still aged four? Thirdly, will the measures enable charging only for teaching staff over and above the free entitlement? Fourthly, can the Minister also assure me that there will be some protection for the additional free hours that many local authorities currently provide for disadvantaged and vulnerable children; and, fifthly, that there will be some attempt to specify some concept of reasonableness in the charges that schools can make and how the regulations might define how the charges to parents may be made up so that they are reasonable? If we can get those assurances on record today, I am sure that it will take us forward.</p>

<p><a name="11091249000042"></a><b><a name="110912-gc0001.htm_spnew36"></a><a name="11091249000271"></a>Baroness Garden of Frognal:</b> My Lords, many schools provide high-quality early education provided by parents that is good for getting children ready for school. However, schools can currently effectively offer only the free entitlement-the 15 hours a week, 38 weeks a year-that all three and four year-old children are entitled to. This is because they cannot charge for extra early years education that they provide during school hours for three and four year-old pupils over and above the 15-hours' free entitlement.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para95"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000043"></a>The previous Government took a power in the Childcare Act 2006 to make regulations enabling schools to charge for additional hours that they might wish to offer parents. The Bill, therefore, does not seek a power for schools to charge. It enables schools to reflect the costs of their provision in that charge. It is, in effect, a technical clause. It is about ensuring that charges for optional extras can include a proportion of building and accommodation costs and, for early years provision, the time of qualified teachers.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para96"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000044"></a>Why are we proposing this change? Because making school-based early years provision sustainable will create greater choice for parents about the type, quality and flexibility of early years provision that they can take up for their child. We want to enable parents to take up provision above their free entitlement in the maintained sector, if they wish to, as they already can in private, voluntary and independent providers.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para97"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000045"></a>Enabling schools to charge appropriately will help them to remain financially viable, but I stress that schools will not be permitted to make a profit from charging and will be able to charge only up to the costs of delivering the provision. I reassure the noble Baroness that that will of course be a reasonable charge and it must be within boundaries.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para98"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000046"></a>Furthermore, it will not be permissible in any way for schools to charge for early education that is part of the free entitlement, including-I reassure the noble Baroness on this point, too-the new entitlement for disadvantaged two year-olds, or for reception provision. The Government remain committed to reception classes being free, with full-time provision of 25 hours a week from the September after the child turns four. The noble Baroness referred to the letters from my noble

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para99"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000047"></a>There is no ability for schools to charge for education during school hours for pupils of compulsory school age, and there is no ability for them to charge for hours provided to parents for free under the early years entitlement-a measure which the noble Baroness introduced and which we have extended in this Bill. We are committed to ensuring that reception provision is free, and there will be no ability to hold children up in reception classes, as she feared. Through the Bill, we want to ensure that schools can charge for additional, optional provision in a way that enables them to cover their costs and provides greater choice of provision for the parent and a consistent and high-quality early education for the child.</p>

<p><a name="11091249000048"></a>If the noble Baroness raised other points which I have not covered, I will of course write to her, but I hope that, with those reassurances, she will feel happy to withdraw her objection to the clause standing part of the Bill.</p>

I warmly welcome the purpose of the clause, which is to allow an extended offer of high-quality early years care in nurseries attached to schools. We all know how important high-quality early years care is in regard to outcomes for children, so this is welcome news. Particularly in nurseries attached to schools one finds a high level of stability in the staff, with turnover being only about 4 or 5 per cent, compared with in the region of 15 per cent in some day centres.

This follows directly from last November's two White Papers on skills-<I>Skills for Sustainable Growth</I> and the accompanying strategy document. Both these White Papers proposed a considerable freeing-up of colleges from the micro-management  of the Learning and Skills Council, and this is  now embodied in many of the amendments to  Schedule 12.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para103"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000053"></a>The aim is essentially to free colleges to take their own decisions. There is particular emphasis on their working for and in partnership with local employers on the one hand and individual students on the other, and on making sure that they meet the needs of these two groups. However, the White Papers also refer to colleges meeting the needs of their local communities. Implicit in the deregulation is that the needs of employers, individuals and local communities vary from area to area and, therefore, that what is required also varies from area to area. My job in chairing the commission of inquiry is to put a bit of flesh on what the notion of serving the local community might mean for such colleges. We published an interim report in July and our final report is due in November. The outcome of our inquiries has been to highlight the potential of further education colleges to play a vital role within their communities in all kinds of ways.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para104"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000054"></a>For example, the provision of youth activities might be seen as important in relation to the riots that we saw this summer. Some colleges link up with local authorities to provide imaginative and extensive youth activities, ranging from sport and motor mechanics to drop-in clubs. These bring young people into the college to see the facilities and use the canteen. They then learn that the college is not such a frightening place. The evaluation of these experiments is that they have been very positive in reducing the number of local NEETs, drug-taking and youth crime. Likewise, in some areas colleges play a major part in outreach activities for ethnic minorities. They provide English classes for speakers of other languages, parenting, home-making and cookery classes, and classes in basic numeracy and literacy. These lead to other college courses and often to higher qualifications, so that many people in these communities move from being dependent on welfare benefits to sometimes quite substantial jobs.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para105"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000055"></a>On a different tack, some colleges run consultancies for small and medium-sized businesses, helping them with business planning, financial management and even a limited amount of R&amp;D. The activities vary from community to community, depending on local needs. Many are run in partnership with other organisations. We have coined the phrase "colleges as a dynamic nucleus within their communities". They are proactive, forming partnerships and companies and leading consortia. The Minister of State for Skills and Further Education, Mr John Hayes, is anxious to see colleges pursue this role, particularly in disadvantaged communities, to provide a focus for regeneration and generate a sense of pride in their local communities. Therefore, from the point of view of my commission, I am very anxious that this duty to promote well-being  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC142"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC142</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in a local area should remain. The best of our colleges do it already but it is very useful that there should be a statutory obligation to promote well-being to put pressure on those colleges that do not. I know that the Association of Colleges took the view that any good college would do it. Yes, good colleges do it, but it is those that do not that we want to put pressure on.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para106"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000056"></a>I turn now to Amendments 122BZB and 122BZC, which concern a different issue. The passage of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Learning and Children Act 2009, with which many of us around the Table were involved, established sixth-form colleges as separate entities. On examining the Act, the Office for National Statistics decided that both sixth-form colleges and further education colleges had been wrongly classified back in 1992 as being part of the non-profit sector, rather than as public sector institutions, and that the right classification for them was as public sector institutions. The deciding factor was that it is the Secretary of State who ultimately agrees and sets their articles of governance and has the right to dissolve them. If further education colleges are, however, classed as public sector, they will be required to obey all kind of Treasury rules about managing their finances. This effectively stops them from doing all the enterprising things-like setting up subsidiary companies and forming partnerships in their communities-that I would like to see them doing, in order to satisfy my remit in leading this commission, and in order to get things moving after that. The Office for National Statistics is sympathetic to this, and has allowed time for the legislation to be amended in this Bill, so that further educational colleges remain, as they have been, classed as non-profit institutions. The purpose of these two amendments is to have a shot at doing this, by helping to change their status.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para107"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000057"></a>Amendment 122BZB is about altering the articles of governance. The present legislation gives the Secretary of State-in the form of the Skills Funding Agency, the appropriate authority-powers to modify the articles of governance. The amendment shifts the ultimate decision-making power to the corporation itself, and makes the SFA's role merely that of having to be consulted. Likewise, Amendment 122BZC places the ultimate decision on winding up the corporation on the corporation itself, although the Secretary of State, through the SFA, may have considerable influence on that decision, not least in refusing funds.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para108"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000058"></a>I am aware that these two amendments are not sufficient in themselves. My aim was to get this issue on to the agenda, because I am anxious that colleges should have the power to go ahead and be entrepreneurial in their own right. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="11091249000059"></a><b><a name="110912-gc0001.htm_spnew39"></a><a name="11091249000275"></a>Baroness Jones of Whitchurch:</b> First, my Lords, we accept the Government amendments which have been tabled. As the Minister set out in his letter to me, they correct what ended up being an unintentional consequence of previous legislation, as it affected voluntary sixth-form colleges. On the presumption that these amendments have been the subject of consultation with the Catholic Education Service, which raised the concerns in the first place, if it is now content with the proposed changes, we echo that contentment.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC143"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC143</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para109"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000060"></a>Secondly, going back to the intent of the changes set out in Schedule 12, I have a number of concerns which I want to share with noble Lords today. First, on the issue of promoting economic and social well-being in their areas, I agree with the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp-there is a strong argument for sixth-form and FE colleges to play a role in their wider communities, and to link with local youth services. I was very interested in her concept of colleges as a dynamic nucleus in the community, a concept which I think is worth exploring. As she identified, one of the lessons of the recent riots is surely that those areas with the strongest embedded youth provision, providing positive alternatives to gang culture-something in which colleges can play a part-can be the most resilient to unrest and destruction, as they were over the summer. FE colleges have worked hard in recent years to develop robust partnerships with employers in their areas, knowing the local employment market, and tuning the curriculum offers to the needs of local employers. As the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, says, a number of them already do that, but if we start to remove this provision of promoting economic and social well-being, there is a danger that we will be sending the wrong message: rather than encouraging that development, it will become a licence for colleges to turn inward and insular again, instead of embracing that new role.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para110"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000061"></a>Furthermore, on acquiring land and borrowing money by using existing property as collateral, while I would not claim to be an expert on the issues that the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, was raising, I do have concerns about some of the provisions set out in Schedule 12. I am concerned about the consequences of some of these new freedoms. It is not absolutely clear to me where the demand for this is coming from. It seems to me that the managers of FE colleges have many skills, but intervening in money markets is probably not one of them. My fear is that some well meaning college leaders will quickly find themselves out of their depth.</p>
<h5><a name="11091249000251"></a>5.45 pm</h5>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para111"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000062"></a>I shall make an analogy. I happen to chair a housing association and we constantly borrow money on the financial markets-we take out bonds and such like and have a dedicated treasury team that does that sort of work-but then we lend money against our housing stock and use the money to build more properties so that we can expand the amount of social housing in the market. That is our core business. The core businesses of FE colleges, though, is providing education, not becoming experts in property and land.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para112"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000063"></a>There are some issues that flow from that. Will there be lending against property that is essentially owned by the public sector, and what happens to the land or property if they then default? Who will be held accountable for those financial dealings? The most obvious stark spectre is that some colleges could go bankrupt. What would the consequences of that be? However, the more likely commonplace scenario is that they would just make less than optimum-mediocre or poor-commercial decisions. How would they be held accountable for those relatively poor decisions?  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC144"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC144</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Will this be part of the Ofsted inspection in future? Again, I am not quite sure where the impetus for this initiative is coming from. We need to be clear where the proper checks and balances are to ensure that they will exist in any subsequent system.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para113"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000064"></a>My noble friend Lord Knight cannot be here so I am moving Amendment 122C, which again raises the issue of intervention by the Secretary of State, not the local authority. This is becoming a bit of a hardy annual, which we have debated in a number of other contexts throughout this Committee. Once again, this is about the conflict between national and local power.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para114"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000065"></a>We believe that local authorities are best positioned to intervene when colleges have cause for concern. They are likely to be one of the first bodies to become aware of any issues that arise because of their local knowledge and connections, they will have the means and accessibility to act quickly if necessary and they will have the local credibility and accountability to justify their actions. It is still not clear to us whether the Secretary of State will have the resources to monitor effectively the performance of colleges nationally or the staff to intervene. A possible result of this is a fall in standards rather than an increase.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para115"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000066"></a>We are not convinced that parts of the reforms in this schedule concerning the management and governance of colleges are justified, the risks have been properly assessed and the consequences properly thought through. We hope that the Minister will take these issues away and reflect on them further.</p>

<p><a name="11091249000067"></a><b><a name="110912-gc0001.htm_spnew40"></a><a name="11091249000276"></a>Lord Hill of Oareford:</b> I am grateful to my noble friend Lady Sharp for moving this amendment and for the work that she is doing on leading her commission. She brings a lot of experience to this debate. Central to our reform of the education and skills system, as the Committee know, is our belief that we should trust professionals. That is just as true for colleges as it is for schools. We all know the excellent work done by colleges as independent institutions, and my noble friend gave a number of excellent examples of colleges being dynamic nuclei, as I think the plural is, and being entrepreneurial. We know that last year's Ofsted annual report showed that sixth-form colleges are the highest performing sector in providing further education, so we want them and FE to have greater freedom to build on their track record and raise achievement still further.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para116"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000068"></a>As well as some non-legislative changes that we are making, such as simplifying the 16-to-19 funding system, the Bill aims to remove the kind of unnecessary regulation that we believe holds colleges back from deciding how to manage their own affairs. That includes things like removing the power to direct a college to consider disciplinary action against a member of staff, reducing the restrictions on sixth-form colleges' ability to form or invest in a company or removing the duty on colleges in England to have regard to guidance on consultation with students and employers.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para117"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000069"></a>In response to the concerns raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Whitchurch, regarding the capability of FE to manage borrowing and investments, I think that in some ways her questions highlighted a difference between us. Our starting point is that colleges  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC145"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC145</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are responsible, high-performing institutions, and we do not think that there is a reason to believe that they will borrow more money just because they no longer need to consult the relevant funding body. We expect them to take steps to ensure that their borrowings are proportionate to their business, as well as affordable. The financial health of a college should be the responsibility of its governing body. However, there are safeguards of the sort that the noble Baroness was seeking. Both the <I>Financial Memorandum</I> and the <I>Financial Planning Handbook</I> set out the mechanisms to ensure the continuing viability of their institutions, the conditions of borrowing, and the controls and monitoring arrangements in place to protect public money and the interests of students.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para118"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000070"></a>As my noble friend Lady Sharp argued, colleges make an extremely important contribution to the social and economic needs of their local communities. They do it in many of the ways that she outlined, and they also do it through the education they provide, the skills with which they equip young people, the jobs they create and through their links with local businesses, for example. Therefore, I think that the question is: given that they are doing this, do they need to have a legal duty to do so? The provision to remove the duty has been welcomed by the sector, including the Association of Colleges and the Sixth Form Colleges' Forum, and we think that it is recognition of the trust that we have placed on the ability of institutions to take well-informed, rational decisions without the need for there to be too much direction from government.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para119"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000071"></a>The other amendments in the name of my noble friend Lady Sharp raise the question of freedoms that FE colleges have. The intention behind her amendments is to remove the Secretary of State's powers to modify a further education corporation's instrument and articles of government and to place a condition on the Secretary of State to secure the consent of the corporation's governing body before making an order to dissolve the corporation. My noble friend mentioned two phrases to which I always respond in a Pavlovian way. She referred to Treasury rules and wanting to encourage FE colleges to be enterprising. I am sympathetic to the intention behind these amendments as the Government are committed to trying to reduce the level of external control. Her amendments raise an important issue. It is one that I am very happy to take away and consider further before Report. Perhaps we could discuss that further.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para120"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000072"></a>So regards the Government's amendments, the noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Whitchurch, was kind enough to make the point that in effect we are trying to do what the previous Government attempted, but did not have the opportunity, to do. The aim of the amendments is to reinstate the statutory safeguards relating to voluntary sixth-form colleges. I provided information in the letter that I sent to noble Lords on 13 July. As the noble Baroness said, it was the Government's view that legislation should reflect the distinct constitutional position of voluntary sixth-form colleges, and they confirmed that they would look to reinstate those protections through legislation. We agree with that view and, through these amendments, we seek to reinstate the statutory position. This includes ensuring consultation with all persons who may appoint or  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC146"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC146</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>nominate foundation governors before the Secretary of State exercises his intervention powers. It will include consultation with the bishop where the bishop appoints or nominates foundation governors. To answer the noble Baroness's question, I think that it reflects the concerns of the CES-a point about which she asked me.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para121"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000073"></a>So far as concerns the amendment that the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, moved on behalf of the noble Lord, Lord Knight, we are keen to place accountability for student performance and an institution's own improvement firmly within that institution. Therefore, the Bill seeks to replace the current complex intervention arrangements, which involve both the YPLA and local authorities, with simpler arrangements where the Secretary of State has reserve powers of intervention. We are lucky to have a high performing college sector and we foresee these powers being used very rarely. These arrangements and the role of the Secretary of State have been welcomed by the Association of Colleges.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para122"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000074"></a>I hope that noble Lords will agree that the provisions contained in Schedule 12 and proposed in the government amendments are necessary to support the continued success of the college sector. They will ensure that providers are free to deliver high-quality education. They replace the current, complex arrangements for intervention in colleges with reserved powers and ensure that legislation recognises the specific governance and constitutional arrangements of voluntary sixth-form colleges.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para123"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000075"></a>As I said, I will pursue further the points made by my noble friend Lady Sharp. With that in mind, I ask her to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="11091249000076"></a><b><a name="110912-gc0001.htm_spnew41"></a><a name="11091249000277"></a>Baroness Sharp of Guildford:</b> I am extremely grateful to my noble friend for his sympathetic reply to the amendments. I am sorry that we have not had a little more movement on the amendment concerning well-being. Although in some senses, as my noble friend says, it is unnecessary, because a lot of colleges are doing it and I know that the Association of Colleges and the sixth-form college group welcome that, my point was that it helps to reinforce the issue. However, that is a background issue.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para124"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000077"></a>To pursue the other, rather esoteric issue, I know that the team in the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills is working hard on it, and I hope that we can get some changes to the Bill that will satisfy both the Treasury and the Office for National Statistics. With that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I thank my noble friend Lord Hill for his helpful letter to the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, who, as I mentioned earlier, cannot be in her place today. I and my colleagues are concerned that in the bifurcated schools funding system that academies and free schools are now part, they should not be at any advantage over a community or maintained school, nor should the funding mechanism  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC149"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC149</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>make it more beneficial for an academy or a free school to exclude a pupil long-term, which would necessitate a move to a PRU. My noble friend's letter is partially helpful, and I am grateful for that. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11091249000238"></a>"PRUs are centrally funded within a local authority's Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG). When a maintained school converts to Academy status, no funding for local authority places is deducted from the local authorities DSG and the Academy receives no additional funding for this function. So Academies and maintained schools are in the same position in this respect".</p>

<p><a name="11091249000196"></a>One reason that we have concerns is that academies have consistently had a higher exclusion rate of pupils than community schools. The figures for 2008-09, published under the Freedom of Information Act earlier this year show that on average academies permanently excluded 82 per cent more students- 3.1 per 1,000 compared to 1.7 per 1,000 for non-academy schools. I know that that figure is beginning to reduce, but there is still more than 50 per cent disparity between academies and the community schools.</p>
<h5><a name="11091249000252"></a><I></I>6 pm</h5>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para125"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000079"></a>The figures also demonstrate that there is only a small effect on exclusions from academies in deprived areas and I would not therefore want us to go down the argument that because academies originally were set up in deprived areas you would expect a high level of exclusion. The figures show a slight distortion there, but it does not account for the substantial difference. The general facts are that academies exclude permanently more pupils than their non-academy counterparts.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para126"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000080"></a>While I am reassured that the PRU funding itself is ring-fenced, I should like to ask the Minister if the local authority funding takes account of how many academies there are in an area in the allocation of PRU funding to compensate for this distortion. It seems wrong that the deliberately meagre funding allocated to local authorities for their essential strategic services such as PRUs should be penalised simply because many of their schools have chosen to convert to academies. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="11091249000081"></a><b><a name="110912-gc0001.htm_spnew47"></a><a name="11091249000283"></a>Baroness Jones of Whitchurch:</b> My Lords, we have three amendments in this group that I should like to address.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para127"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000082"></a>First, on the Question that Clause 49 stand part of the Bill, this clause was introduced during Commons Report stage and has not been properly scrutinised. It aims, as I understand it, to give PRUs more autonomy over their budgets and staffing. It also enables a majority of pupils to be referred by schools rather than local authorities. I acknowledge receipt of the Minister's letter to my noble friend Lady Hughes but, nevertheless, we have a number of concerns that I hope the Minister will be able to address convincingly-particularly regarding the new management and funding arrangements, and whether they will perhaps be perverse incentives for pupils to be kept at PRUs far longer than is in their educational or personal self-interest.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para128"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000083"></a>Will the Minister clarify what safeguards will be put in place to stop these autonomous PRUs from keeping hold of the young people for as long as possible, rather than seeking to return them to mainstream education? Secondly, what safeguards will exist to prevent schools from referring to the PRUs children  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC150"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC150</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>who would not previously have met the criteria for referral by local authority? Does the Minister acknowledge that there was a risk within a federational chain of schools that financial drivers could lead to more pupils being referred to PRUs. Thirdly, to avoid the danger of perverse incentives to keep pupils over-long in PRUs, will the Government ensure that there will be incentives, including financial incentives, for PRUs to help young people back into mainstream education, which I hope is what we should all hope would be their ultimate goal? Finally, can the Minister explain how the funding flows will work, particularly where there is dual registration of a pupil at their old school and the PRU? How will the funding be allocated and who will hold the ultimate responsibility for the expenditure?</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para129"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000084"></a>We remain concerned that the transfer of power to schools to decide whether pupils should be sent to PRUs will lead them too easily to become dumping grounds for children with behavioural problems or complex disabilities, and we seek reassurance from the Minister that the appropriate checks and balances will be put in place to prevent this happening.</p>

<p><a name="11091249000086"></a><b><a name="110912-gc0001.htm_spnew48"></a><a name="11091249000284"></a>Baroness Jones of Whitchurch:</b> My Lords, I turn to Amendment 124A. Clause 52, among other things, allows for the creation of alternative provision academies, which are defined as institutions,</p>
<ul><a name="11091249000247"></a>"principally concerned with providing full-time or part-time education for children of compulsory school age who, by reason of illness, exclusion from school or otherwise, may not for any period receive suitable education unless alternative provision is made for them".</ul>
<p><a name="11091249000197"></a>Currently, pupil referral units perform that role, so the Bill effectively allows them to become academies.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para130"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000087"></a>Our concerns about these new proposals echo those that we raised in previous debates relating to excluded pupils; for example, the repeal of the duty of schools to enter into behaviour and attendance partnerships and the removal of appeals panels that can reinstate wrongly excluded pupils. They also mirror our concerns regarding Clause 49.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para131"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000088"></a>Pupil referral units which become academies could grow more isolated from other schools and be cut off from current partnership working, including with local authorities. I ask the Minister again how he thinks this will help excluded pupils to re-enter mainstream schools as soon as possible.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para132"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000089"></a>Our Amendment 124A would provide a fallback position whereby pupils could not stay in alternative provision academies for more than six months. If the Minister is going to argue that a time limit of this kind is overly rigid, what alternative safeguards will he propose to stop children being referred early or inappropriately and returned to the mainstream late? How long will they be left to languish in units because it is financially desirable for the institution concerned that they do so?</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para133"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000090"></a>A different issue is covered by our Amendment 124C. As it stands, the clause includes a Henry VIII provision which gives the Secretary of State a wide-ranging  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC151"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC151</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>power to amend by order any legislation passed prior to this legislation to achieve the objective of establishing the two new types of academy; that is, 16-19 academies and alternative provision academies. It appears that the Government have not thought out the necessary consequential amendments for introducing 16-19 academies and are relying on a Henry VIII provision to do so. As I am sure noble Lords around the Room will agree, such powers should only ever be used sparingly and in exceptional circumstances. When does the Minister envisage the provision being used and for what purpose?</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para134"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000091"></a>The amendment, which would remove the Henry VIII provision, is probing. Colleagues tabled a similar amendment in the Commons but, as the Minister there was unable to give a full account of the reasons for the provision, we have tabled it again here. In the Commons, Nick Gibb explained that the power would be used to make provision for which bits of existing legislation would apply to these new models of academy and which would not. He went on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11091249000239"></a>"How the new educational institutions will fit into the existing legal framework is complex".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Education Bill Committee, 5/4/11; col. 893.]</p>

<p><a name="11091249000198"></a>In short, it is not yet clear which legislation will apply to these new types of academy, yet we are being asked to pass the Bill regardless.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para135"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000092"></a>Nick Gibb also promised to provide more details of the Government's proposals as the Bill passed through the House. Since then, we have had a number of government amendments tabled and a letter from our own Minister on the subject. However, as his letter confirms, despite the extra information that the Government are now able to provide, the Henry VIII provision remains necessary for the making of further amendments by order. The letter explaining the government amendments is not an explanation of each amendment but more a background note on the Government's general approach. This is not the right way to go about making and scrutinising legislation.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para136"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000093"></a>If the proposals are too complicated for the Government to bring the details before us now, surely there is a real danger that they will be too complicated to be implemented effectively. We should have the complete legislation before us today so that we have the chance to debate and amend it with the thought and diligence that this Committee has already demonstrated.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para137"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000094"></a>I am not sure that the Henry VIII provision was ever intended to provide a way out when the Government had not got all their amendments written in time for the passage of the Bill. I therefore hope that noble Lords will support our amendment to delete the Secretary of State's powers in Clause 53 to this effect.</p>

<p><a name="11091249000095"></a><b><a name="110912-gc0001.htm_spnew49"></a><a name="11091249000285"></a>Lord Hill of Oareford:</b> My Lords, we know that at any one time around 40,000 to 70,000 pupils are in some form of alternative provision. We know that there is an iron-clad correlation between those who are excluded, those who attend alternative provision, those who come into the youth justice system and those who go on to offend and reoffend in their adult lives. No one here accepts that it has to be like that.  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC152"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC152</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Alternative provision should provide an opportunity to support more young people to turn their lives around. That is why we are taking a number of steps to help to achieve this, including the changes in Clause 49. The Secretary of State has asked the department's behaviour adviser, Charlie Taylor, to conduct a review to identify what further changes may be needed.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para138"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000096"></a>We are keen to give PRUs more of the freedoms that other schools enjoy to allow the professionals who run them to drive their own improvement. This clause will allow PRUs to manage their own budgets in a similar way to mainstream schools. Through regulations we are also giving PRU management committees powers over staffing similar to those that school governing bodies already have. Professionals working in PRUs have welcomed these changes.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para139"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000097"></a>In addition to these freedoms, our exclusions trials, in which schools will retain responsibility for excluded pupils, will assess how a new approach to managing exclusions could contribute to improving standards in alternative provision. I hope that this point answers a number of concerns raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Whitchurch. If schools retain responsibility for the education and outcomes of excluded pupils, PRUs and AP providers will need to be more responsive to demand from schools for high-quality education. That should help to deal with the perception, raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, that there are perverse incentives. We do not want perverse incentives for schools to exclude. We want, as I know she does, the right kind of provision to be made in a way that is suitable for individual children. By allowing for the creation of alternative provision academies and free schools, we also aim to bring the benefits of the academies and free schools programmes to the alternative provision sector.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para140"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000098"></a>Turning to Amendment 124A, I agree with the noble Baroness that returning a child to a mainstream school as soon as possible is, in most cases, the best thing for a pupil attending alternative provision. Like her, I do not want alternative provision to be seen as a dumping ground where children are put out of sight and out of mind. We know that some of the best PRUs have a strong focus on reintegration. They constantly monitor and review when it is appropriate for a pupil to be supported to return to mainstream education. We want to see all AP providers, including alternative provision academies and free schools, learning from this kind of good practice. However, in some cases it is possible that a longer period in alternative provision may be appropriate. For example, continuity can be important at key stage 4. A young person whose education has been disrupted or who has become disengaged might benefit from a longer period in AP, especially if they are responding well to this provision. Therefore, we argue, as the noble Baroness predicted, that professionals managing and delivering alternative provision, including in AP academies and free schools, are best placed to make judgments about the best time for a pupil to return to mainstream education. There should not be an arbitrary cut-off date that cannot take account of individual circumstances or that would trump the judgment of professionals who know the needs of pupils in their care.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC153"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC153</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para141"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000099"></a>My noble friend raised points about funding and her desire to make sure that academies and free schools are funded on a comparable basis. As she pointed out, PRUs are centrally funded within the local authority's dedicated schools grant. When a maintained school converts to academy status, no funding for PRUs is taken from the local authority's DSG and the academy receives no additional funding for this function. Therefore, maintained schools and academies are on the same footing in this respect. If a pupil is excluded permanently from a maintained school or an academy, the local authority is responsible for securing suitable education for them. Schools-maintained schools and academies-are responsible for securing full-time education for a pupil from the sixth day of a fixed-term exclusion. Some providers of alternative provision also provide early intervention places for pupils with behavioural issues. Local authorities and schools can agree between them how places in PRUs may be made available for pupils who are the responsibility of schools. This would include if and how the authority would charge schools for places, and we would expect them to do that on an equitable basis for all schools. With regard to safeguards on referrals by schools, I set out the position in detail in my letter of 8 September.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para142"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000100"></a>On the government amendments, I recognise the concerns that the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, raised about the powers contained in Clause 53. They allow us to make changes to primary and secondary legislation that we think are needed in consequence of the creation of new types of academy under Clause 52. In the light of the concerns expressed in the other place, we have drafted and tabled as many of the amendments to primary legislation as we can, and I have written to try to explain those amendments in detail.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para143"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000101"></a>These are complex legislative issues and I concede that we have not resolved them all. We think that we need to take a residual power to amend primary and secondary legislation by order. The exercise of that power is subject to the affirmative procedure, so both Houses of Parliament would have the chance to debate the legislation when an order was laid. There is a precedent for taking this approach-there is a much broader power to make consequential amendments in Section 265 of the previous Government's Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para144"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000102"></a>In addition, we have tabled minor amendments to Clause 52 of the Bill. Amendments 123A and 123B amend new Section 1A so that an academy school cannot be an alternative provision academy. Further amendments give the Secretary of State flexibility to apply legislation to this diverse sector.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para145"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000103"></a>Overall, as is the case for the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, we are keen to ensure that alternative provision meets the needs of the vulnerable children that it serves. It is important that funding should be on an equitable basis. With some of the assurances that I have given about the changes we are making, the funding and the Government's intentions, I hope  that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

I wondered what the history to that was. I do not want an answer now but, if there is anything of interest in it, I should like to know what it is.</p>

There is a great deal at stake here and getting it right is very complex. Some children benefit from a smaller environment.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para146"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000106"></a>One does not want all the worst children in one place; some of them need to be a bit healthier. The last time that I visited a pupil referral unit, there was a fire alarm and we all had to file out to stand outside. It was the third time that day that this had happened, and it was chaos. The staff were good but it was a very difficult environment to work in. I welcome the Minister's action on this.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para147"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000107"></a>I am very pleased that Charlie Taylor, whom we have met and in whom we all have confidence, is taking charge in this area. I wonder whether any noble Lords might be interested in visiting a pupil referral unit with him soon to see what is going on. I certainly would be, and I will get in touch with him about that.</p>

I am sorry to say that, with the noise of the helicopters overhead, I was not quite sure whether he had answered the very specific question I raised in my amendment, about the disparity of funding for PRUs in a local authority area where there is a larger number of academies. I accept that he may not have the details to hand, but I would be grateful if he could let me know whether that is something that could be considered.

<p><a name="11091249000109"></a>I also understand the points he has raised about limiting the time for which a pupil could stay within a PRU. I certainly take the point that there are some times where it needs to be more than just six months, to maintain continuity. I do not know if noble Lords opposite would take the point as well; however, I believe they said that that was as much a probing amendment as anything else, so I hope that will be acceptable. I remain concerned as well about the Henry VIII provision, and hope that some of the detail can be sorted out before this Bill proceeds into an Act. It is important that the Secretary of State-especially as we are talking so much about localism these days-does not reserve a large number of powers to himself or herself.</p>

The group that I am specifically concerned with, as your Lordships may be aware, is that of Gypsies and Travellers. I declare an interest, as president of the Advisory Council on the Education of Romany and other Travellers, ACERT.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para150"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000112"></a>Statistics show that GRT children are severely deprived. They are in fact the most vulnerable of any ethnic group by a long way. The National Foundation for Educational Research showed, in a report produced last October for the department, that absence rates in primary schools were between 19 and 24 per cent, compared with the national average of 5 per cent. In secondary schools it was between 23 and 27 per cent, compared with a national average of 7 per cent. There were more than eight permanent exclusions for every thousand GRT boys, compared with less than two per thousand of all boys nationally. The figure for fixed-term exclusions of boys, mainly for persistent disruptive behaviour, was a staggering 25 per cent, compared with a national average of 10 per cent. Some 20 per cent of GRT pupils failed to make the transfer between primary and secondary education. For every 100 GRT pupils in year 6, only half get to year 11, compared with a national average of 92.4 per cent. From the cohort that did get to take GCSEs, the number achieving five A to C grades at that level in 2010 was 8.3 per cent, compared with a national average of 55 per cent.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para151"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000113"></a>These appalling figures do not tell the whole story by any means. More than half of all the children belonging to these communities do not identify themselves as such, fearing the discrimination and bullying of which they are unfortunately likely to be victims if they are known to be Gypsies or Travellers. Obviously they do not include, either, the high proportion of children from these communities who are not on school rolls. The children in these two groups are likely to be at the bottom end of the scale of vulnerability, and if they could have been included the record would almost certainly have been worse. Manifestly we have failed to do enough educationally for GRT children in the past, and that is one of the reasons why they are also at the bottom of society in every other respect as well.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para152"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000114"></a>Let us next see whether these children are likely to be picked up by the definition of vulnerable children who are covered by the coalition's statutory framework, as was set out in the Minister's very helpful letter to me of 31 August, which I hope that some other noble Lords will also have seen.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC156"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC156</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para153"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000115"></a>SEN children are covered by a code of practice that details what should be done to ensure that they get an appropriate education. They will be assessed by a statutory education, health and care plan, which was outlined in the recent Green Paper. A revised legal framework will deal with about 87,000 looked-after children, on which there is also statutory guidance to local authorities. For those looked-after for six months or more, the pupil premium of £430 will chip in.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para154"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000116"></a>Children in need-those who are unlikely to achieve or maintain a reasonable standard of health or development, including the disabled-are supported under a general statutory duty laid down in the Children Act 1989. Again, that is reinforced by a range of guidance.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para155"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000117"></a>The Minister concludes by saying that he hopes that those statutory frameworks and their associated guidance make clear the importance of local authorities and others with duties to improve the educational outcomes of vulnerable children, but, unfortunately, there are some gaps for GRT children. I shall try to explain why that is so.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para156"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000118"></a>Under previous legislation, the Traveller Education Support Service was ring-fenced, but after 2007 the sums previously allocated to that service were subsumed into general grounds aimed at disadvantaged children. Local authorities have therefore been dismantling the TESSs. It is predictable that, with the pressure on educational budgets, they will disappear altogether in a few years, despite their considerable achievements, particularly in getting a higher percentage of GRT children to attend and stay on in schools. The specific expertise that they have amassed over the years will not be inherited by the mechanisms that already exist or are being developed to cope with the needs of the three categories of vulnerable children cited by the Minister in his letter. Nor will the staff concerned with vulnerable children generally be likely to devote the same amount of time and effort to the specific problems affecting the GRT children as TESSs have done.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para157"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000119"></a>I now come to the special needs that are not covered by any of the three categories of vulnerable children in the Minister's definition. There is undoubtedly a much higher proportion of children missing education among GRT communities than in any other sector of the population. Those children are exceptionally vulnerable, as an Ofsted survey in June 2010 concluded. It referred to the former DCSF's statutory guidance for local authorities on the circumstances in which a child may not be receiving suitable education. They included membership of the GRT ethnic groups. Ofsted looked at 15 authorities, large and small, urban and rural. It found that none of the service departments in the authorities was confident that it was aware of all the children living in its area. The consistent response from officers was, "We don't know what we don't know".</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para158"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000120"></a>However, in a <I>Times Educational Supplement</I> survey last February, 12,000 children were listed as officially missing, and it was clear that the number would have been much higher if all the authorities had made as much effort as Leicester, which employs a full-time member of staff to trace CME, assisted by 20 educational welfare officers. Martin Narey, the former chief executive  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC157"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC157</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of Barnardo's, said that the situation was deeply troubling. If my noble friend is not prepared to add CME to the categories of vulnerable children, I hope that he can tell your Lordships what alternative solution he has to offer. The Government acknowledge that the current guidance on CME is defective, because they are planning new guidance to be issued by the end of the year, but if that is all that my noble friend has to say on this after the Government have had the devastating Ofsted information for well over a year, I shall be very disappointed.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para159"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000121"></a>In the case of GRT children in particular, who must make up a significant element of the <I>TES</I> numbers, in the response by the inner London consortium co-ordinator, Brian Foster, to the Ofsted survey, it was pointed out that the TESSs' relationship of trust, developed with those communities over time, had made it more likely that they would get information and that their development of a cross-borough database of families minimised the number of unidentified CME. Such arrangements may be discontinued with the disappearance of TESSs and the lack of any local authority responsibility for CME who are not covered by any of the three headings.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para160"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000122"></a>One thing that the local authorities covered by the Ofsted survey knew was that excluded pupils' vulnerability was significantly increased because of their potential exposure to drugs, alcohol, crime, pregnancy or mental health problems. It is not clear whether excluded pupils are included within children in need. Without explicit guidance they may not be covered. Nor are local authorities obliged to keep a register of children in need, as they should be required to do in guidance. Here again, GRT pupils are far more likely to be excluded than any other ethnic group, with over one-fifth of Gypsy or Roma boys and one-quarter of Irish Traveller boys excluded in the course of an academic year. Ideally, CME should be added to the Minister's three categories of vulnerable children, but if that is unacceptable because it is too broad, a way of picking up some-perhaps most-of the CME would be to add a category of "mobile child", meaning a child who starts other than at the beginning of their phase. These are defined by authorities such as the London Borough of Hackney as "mid-phase admissions".</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para161"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000123"></a>The pupil premium of £430 in the current year does not necessarily cover these children who dip into education from time to time, including not only those of GRT origin but, for example, asylum seekers or the dependent children of migrants coming here for work. The proposal in the schools funding consultation to extend the payment from children currently in receipt of free school meals to those who have done so in the past three or six years would dilute the per capita grant because the total sum available would not be increased. It still does not necessarily cover these mobile children, who are disadvantaged because they are engaging with school for the first time or after an absence.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para162"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000124"></a>Some GRT parents say that they electively home educate their children just to give a reason why they are not attending school. It is very doubtful that the parents are competent to teach or that the lessons they give, if any, would enable the children to participate effectively in wider society or to earn a living in any  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC158"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC158</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>skilled employment. They are likely to remain in the closed communities of their families, cut off from the rest of the population. Graham Badman's recommendations-that parents should register a child who is to be home educated, submit a yearly statement of their educational approach, intent and planned outcomes, and accept home visits by the local education authority-might have focused more attention on these children and enabled local authorities to offer parents advice and assistance. However, as the Committee will recall, the report stirred up a hornet's nest among parents who were effectively home educating their children as measured by their outcomes, and it sank without trace. I take it that the Government have no intention of revisiting the question of what to do about EHE, although some of the children ostensibly being home educated-not only those in the GRT communities-may be extremely vulnerable.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para163"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000125"></a>A further suggestion would be to add those who cease to attend at any point in their school career, particularly at the point of transfer between primary and secondary school, to the list of vulnerable children. We need to make far greater efforts to improve the attendance of secondary school-age GRT children, considering that one in five drop out at the end of primary school and just over half drop out before school-leaving age. Only 38 per cent of Irish Travellers go all the way through school so the disadvantages that they suffer, and their lack of affinity with the social system, are being transmitted to the next generation.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para164"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000126"></a>A final thought that I offer the Minister is that virtual schools should be given a chance to cover children missing education. Local authorities have a duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of a child looked after by them. By virtue of Section 52 of the Children Act 2004, that includes a duty to promote the child's educational achievement. Outcomes were driven up by virtual schools for children in care in the pilot authorities, and the idea was rolled out in all but three local authorities by July 2010. If the virtual schools continue to benefit children in care, is it not likely they could do the same for CME?</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para165"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000127"></a>I am not optimistic that the Minister can give your Lordships much reassurance on this amendment, which asks so little in the face of a task that has been ducked by successive Governments throughout the half-century of my political life. Gypsy, Roma and Travellers belong to a minority that clearly is not popular, as evidenced by the racism in the comments threads of the media whenever they publish articles on the subject. Now, having at least prided ourselves in the past on our human rights and equality law, we are under fire from the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the UN rapporteur on the Right to Adequate Housing over the inhuman eviction of Travellers from the Dale Farm site, due to start a week today.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0001.htm_para166"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000128"></a>We are also at risk of adverse comment from the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, which already said in its draft report on the UK three years ago that significant inequalities persist with regard to school achievement of children living with their parents

Several groups of these children have problems being enrolled in school or continuing or re-entering education, either in regular schools or in alternative educational facilities, and cannot fully enjoy their right to education, notably, among others, children of Travellers, Roma children, drop-outs, non-attendees and so on.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000129"></a>The Committee will no doubt want to be convinced that in the Bill the Government are taking positive and constructive steps to meet this criticism. I hope that they will not only accept this amendment but set out a convincing case that will satisfy this Committee and the Committee on the Rights of the Child that they mean business in satisfying the needs of vulnerable children. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="11091249000130"></a><b><a name="110912-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="11091249000291"></a>Baroness Whitaker:</b> My Lords, in following the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, on the amendment to which I have put my name, I wish to say how grateful I was to the Minister for rapidly arranging a meeting to amplify the points that he made in his letter to the noble Lord on 25 August. He and his team, in the person of Angela Overington, have been helpful in sending us again the current guidance to local authorities.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000131"></a>The amendment refers to vulnerable children of any kind, so I should make it clear that one group or another is not being singled out. The essential point of any guidance, and the reason why it should be mandatory, is that it must be specific about the different kinds of children who miss out on education and how differently to target them. Of course, as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said so tellingly, Gypsy and Traveller children are perhaps the most significant of such groups in terms of the extraordinarily high proportion who do not get to school in the first place, especially secondary school, and drop out or are excluded if they are there. As the Minister knows, the Children's Commissioner is looking at Gypsy and Traveller children as part of her first inquiry into exclusion.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000132"></a>This apparently discriminatory outcome needs specific attention. As long ago as the Plowden report on primary education-is that over 40 years ago?-targeted measures in respect of Gypsy and Traveller children were called for, and they seem to come and go in fits and starts, which do not achieve an acceptable solution. I need hardly describe in this place the importance of school education for finding work, fitting into society and becoming useful, law-abiding citizens, quite apart from self-fulfilment. The Ofsted report, <I>Children Missing from Education</I>, published last August, suggested that local authorities struggle to track pupils who are out of school.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000133"></a>The rapidly disappearing Travellers Education Service had some success. In 1997 it was estimated that only 5 per cent of Gypsy and Traveller children stayed on for key stage 4. The figure now is closer to 50 per cent, but schools that are focused on "the importance of teaching", which we all support, cannot reasonably be expected also to secure the inclusion of all marginalised children, some newly arrived, some unfamiliar with or fearful or mistrustful of education. If local authorities had the sort of safety-net responsibility that the amendment provides, schools would remain free to concentrate on their core business.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC160"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC160</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000134"></a>The Minister told us in his letter that local authorities have a statutory duty to ensure the education of some vulnerable children-those with SEN, looked-after children and children in need, which is now a developmental criterion. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, pointed out, there is no duty to tackle the missing education of all vulnerable children, which would include Gypsy and Traveller children and others not in the above three classes. The current statutory guidance has a few passing references to Gypsy and Traveller children. Among 26 groups of children who might miss out, it lists mobile children such as those of families in the Army or of Gypsies, Roma and Travellers. However, by no means all Gypsies, Roma and Travellers are mobile, especially Roma. There are some other reasons why Gypsy, Roma and Traveller children who do not live in caravans still do not get schooling.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000135"></a>Therefore, I hope that the Minister will accept this amendment and undertake that the accompanying guidance will define vulnerability so as to include Gypsies, Roma and Travellers as a specific group, as they are in law, and set out more developed measures to get them the education to which they have a right.</p>

<p><a name="11091249000136"></a><b><a name="110912-gc0002.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="11091249000292"></a>The Earl of Listowel:</b> My Lords, I support the amendment and pay tribute to the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, and the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, for their longstanding advocacy for Gypsy and Roma children. I recall the noble Lord tabling a debate  on the education of Gypsy and Traveller children  10 years ago.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000137"></a>I am also reminded by this debate that I once taught a nine year-old Traveller boy. What really comes back to me is how enthusiastic and keen he was to be a part of the group and one of the boys. I imagine that many of these young boys and girls want to be a part of a group, and it is tragic that this opportunity to bring them into society is so often lost.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000138"></a>If I understood correctly what the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said, I was concerned to hear that specialist services for these children may be being lost. Trust is very important. If these services have developed trust with those communities, it is very important to maintain that relationship.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000139"></a>There are also things that schools, if they are well informed, can do. For example, the special experience of Gypsy and Traveller children can be a bonus for the pupils generally. A boy from a Traveller community can talk about the involvement with animals or other activities that his community has and celebrate that with the other children. Alternatively, for example, a head teacher can involve the mother-it would usually be the mother-of a Gypsy or Traveller child. Even if she cannot write, she can help the child with his homework. The head teacher can ask the mother to put a sign by her son's work to say that that boy sat quietly for half an hour to do his homework. That is her job and she can communicate that to the head teacher. Therefore, it is possible to engage with those parents. It is possible to think about these things in a very constructive way, and I hope that the Minister can give a positive response to the amendment.</p>

The very important question is: who will be responsible for looking after the very small groups of children who are, by definition, not very visible because they are small in number but are none the less, for all kinds of reasons that noble Lords have identified, very disadvantaged when it comes to taking up opportunities for education? Given that local authorities will not have any locus in local areas if the Government's objective of the majority of schools being academies and free schools comes to fruition, I should be grateful if, in responding, the Minister could say where responsibility will lie for looking at the achievement, or lack of it, of these small groups of children, working with schools in some way but without the power and leverage to do so. Who will ensure that schools do better by these very small groups of children? In the new world that the Government will take us into where academies are going to be everywhere and will not be focused on disadvantaged children, I cannot see where that responsibility will lie and where the leverage with individual schools to do better by these children will come from.</p>

<p><a name="11091249000141"></a><b><a name="110912-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="11091249000294"></a>Lord Hill of Oareford:</b> My Lords, it is clear from this debate-as has often been the case-that promoting the highest possible quality of education for the most vulnerable children in society is a subject dear to the heart of the Committee. We have set out in our schools White Paper, published last year, and more recently in our Green Paper on special educational needs and disability, our overall plans on how we want to achieve this,. These include the pupil premium, which will deliver an extra £2.5 billion a year by 2014 to support the education of the most disadvantaged children. My letter to my noble friend Lord Avebury on 25 August set out the overall the statutory framework and range of measures in place to support vulnerable children. In response to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes of Stretford, the White Paper was absolutely clear that the local authority retains its responsibilities for vulnerable children, and the Bill does not affect its statutory duties in any way.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000142"></a>However, the nub of this debate is around Gypsy, Roma and Traveller children, who are of particular concern to the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, and to my noble friend Lord Avebury. He is absolutely right that Gypsy, Roma and Traveller pupils continue to underachieve significantly relative to their peers and are still much more likely to leave school without completing their formal education. This year, under one-quarter of Gypsy, Roma and Traveller pupils achieved level 4 in English and maths at the end of key stage 2, compared with 73 per cent of all pupils. At key stage 4, just 10.8 per cent of Gypsy, Roma and Traveller pupils achieved five or more good GCSEs, including English and mathematics, compared with about 55 per cent of all pupils. These are stark differences. Gypsy, Roma and Traveller pupils have the worst attendance of any minority ethnic group and there is a marked decline in enrolment between primary and secondary school level, a point that has been made. They have the highest levels of permanent and fixed-term exclusions.</p>

<p><a name="11091249000143"></a>Local authorities have a key role to play in addressing this issue. They are under a statutory duty to ensure that education is available for all children of compulsory school age that is appropriate to their age, ability, aptitudes and any special educational needs they may have. This duty applies regardless of a child's ethnicity, immigration status, mother tongue or rights of residence in a particular area.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000144"></a>Along with schools and colleges, local authorities have a range of safeguarding duties for vulnerable pupils, as well as duties to establish as far as possible the identities of those children of compulsory school age who are missing education. We are currently revising statutory guidance to clarify how local authorities can best carry out their duties to identify children who are missing education. I say to my noble friend that we expect to strengthen current references to Gypsy, Roma and Traveller pupils in the revised guidance and I should be happy in due course to share that in draft form with him, the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, and anyone else who is interested.</p>

That working group expects to publish before the end of the year a report on how the Government will tackle the issue, including a package of measures designed specifically to raise educational aspirations, attainment and attendance. We are grateful to the work carried out by the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller education stakeholder group, chaired by my noble friend Lord Avebury, for the contributions that it has made so far, and I look forward to working with the group over the coming weeks to develop further plans in that area.</p>

Crucially, under the 2006 education regulations, all schools are required to inform the local authority where a pupil fails to attend school regularly, where a pupil has been absent from school continuously for at least 10 days without permission or where a pupil has been removed from the school roll in specific circumstances. Indeed, failure by a school to comply with these provisions is an offence.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000147"></a>My noble friend is right to cite some concerns about how well these arrangements are working, so the Government are committed to reviewing those regulations and to tightening up and extending the circumstances in which schools must inform the local authority when a child is missing school or removed from the register. We will revise the statutory guidance to clarify how local authorities can best carry out their duties to identify children missing education.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>

With that, I hope that my noble friend feels able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

Perhaps my mind was drifting as I listened to the Minister's reply but I did not hear him address that subject. Virtual schools provide an interesting way of dealing with genuine Traveller education and providing them with a consistent relationship with school that is not disrupted every time they move, and we should look to encourage that. Does the Minister have a view on this?</p>

I think that my noble friend has an amendment on the subject so we can return to it then. I can respond more fully to my noble friend Lord Avebury at that juncture.</p>

Parents are the key to the problem of these children not attending school. They are essential to making this successful. In my experience as a governor and a chair of governors of an academy where we had Gypsy and Roma children, the parents were the stumbling block. If you can get to them, part of this problem will be solved.</p>

It is good to hear about the work that his department is undertaking. I think that I heard the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, talk about the demise of specialist Gypsy, Roma and Traveller education services. Maybe the Minister briefly said something about that at the end of his response but, I am sorry, I did not quite catch it. If he could clarify what is going on with those services, I would be grateful.</p>

<p><a name="11091249000153"></a>I apologise if I misled the Committee in any way by describing myself as "teaching" this boy. I was running workshops in a school environment. I am not a teacher; I should make that quite clear.</p>

It was from that point onwards that local authorities started to see that there was money that they could use for other purposes and either made officials in the service redundant, in some cases, or did not replace them when they left. There has been a gradual process of running down that, as I said, if it is allowed to continue, will result in the complete disappearance of specific Traveller education services in a few years' time.</p>

<p><a name="11091249000155"></a>What the noble Earl and my noble friend said about contact with parents is important. It was an essential feature of the Traveller education services; they managed to link the parents, the children and the schools, which is why they were effective. In the absence of these specialist services, I am afraid we will not have that advantage.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000156"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, also reinforced the point about mobile children. We are talking not simply about those who still live in caravans and are peripatetic-that is a declining number. What I was talking about when I defined what I hoped the Minister would pick up on-the term "mobile child"-was a child who enters at a point other than the beginning of an academic phase and is therefore potentially disadvantaged because he or she has not hitherto received education or has received it very intermittently. If we could add such children to the definitions that were specified in the Minister's letter, it would go some way towards covering the children about whom we are particularly concerned.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000157"></a>However, I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. We acknowledge the benefits of the pupil premium, which will cover many of the GRT minority. We believe that the revision of the guidance on CME will be effective but we have not seen it yet. I am grateful to my noble friend for mentioning the work of the DfE's stakeholder group, which has a meeting in the coming week at which I am sure we will want to discuss some of the matters that have been covered in today's debate. We are in the course of responding to the department's educational funding consultation. That will also have an impact on how we treat this group. I cannot promise that we will not return to this subject on Report. We have not dealt with all the matters that have been raised. Perhaps we shall cover some of them in the later debates, particularly on virtual schools, which have an important role to play here. However, for the time being, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC165"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC165</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="11091249000158"></a><b><a name="110912-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="11091249000302"></a>Lord Blackwell:</b> My Lords, in moving Amendment 124 I shall speak also to Amendments 125 and 139 in the same group. These amendments return to the subject of providing appropriate education to meet the needs of pupils with a high ability or aptitude in learning or other specialist skills. We had a brief debate on this in the last day in Committee before the summer Recess. There was general support on all sides of the Grand Committee for the view that, despite the importance of providing appropriate education for high-ability children, the education system does not do this particularly well at the moment. We could do better.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000159"></a>It is important for several reasons. First, all children deserve the opportunity for educational excellence. It is also important for the national interest. The top few per cent of our children in ability and aptitude are those who go on to be, in many cases, the leaders in business, the arts and the sciences. If we are to compete globally, we cannot afford not to have our most able children educated to the highest international standards for the good of society as a whole.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000160"></a>It is also important for social equity reasons because, at the moment, we have an education system where the most able children from poorer backgrounds are often unable to achieve entry to schools that can meet their expectations, and the better schools in many parts of the country are accessible only to those who can afford to pay for them.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000161"></a>For all those reasons, it is important that we provide for the needs of the most able children. The amendments that we discussed at our last sitting concerned ways of imposing an obligation on schools to meet the needs of high-ability children and the possibility that academies might group together to provide common facilities and classes for groups of high-ability children-were there insufficient numbers in any one school to make that effective on a single-school basis.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000162"></a>My amendments take the same principle a step further by recognising that the needs of those children may be best be met by having an academy, covering an area, which specialises in providing for the needs of high-ability children. If we take a year group in any school of 150 to 200 and the top 5 per cent of the ability range, we are talking about seven to 10 children. Seven or 10 children are not enough to form a class that can devote the appropriate skills and resources to teaching that top-ability range. Academic research suggests that high-ability children perform best when they are taught in peer groups where the class size is 20 or more, but to achieve the appropriate use of resources, you often need a much larger group to devote the specialist teaching from which they can benefit.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000163"></a>The simple notion here is that the academies framework should be flexible enough to allow schools which are specialist academies providing for high-ability and high-aptitude children. They would not be narrowly defined by a local catchment area, because we would not want many of them, but I can imagine major cities or large towns having one or two. That would cope with those of the top few per cent of children who wanted to apply to go to those schools. There would not be a compulsory 11-plus; there would not be  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC166"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC166</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>compulsory entry; but they would be available for children of high ability who could benefit from them. That would enable children of whatever income level or background to have access to schools that could fulfil their potential.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000164"></a>I stress that I am thinking particularly about children from the less advantaged parts of our cities and country, who are at the moment disadvantaged. They are the children who may have high potential but whose local school is likely to be one of the less-well performing schools just because of the peer group and the circumstances of the school, whereas children of better-off parents may well be able to afford to move to a postcode where the average level of schooling is higher-or, of course, may be able to take advantage of private education. It is the children from poorer backgrounds whom our current system disadvantages, because in many parts of the country there is no provision for high-ability children to have a first-class academic education within a peer group of similarly able and motivated children within the state sector.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000165"></a>It is not just academic provision which is important here. We all know that children need confidence from the support of being in an environment where they are encouraged to raise their aspirations and lift their eyes to what they may achieve. What many of the grammar schools and direct-grant schools provided in the past for many of our generation was the ability for children from those less advantaged backgrounds to mix with children in a peer group that enabled them to realise that their horizons could be wider. They could aspire to reach the top of our professions and businesses, and, indeed, aspire to political careers. It is important that such academies are provided to meet the needs of able children from less privileged backgrounds.</p>
<h5><a name="11091249000258"></a>7.15 pm<I></I></h5>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000166"></a>The amendment talks about aptitudes other than just for learning, and I mentioned in the amendment,</p>
<ul><a name="11091249000248"></a>"aptitude in musical, artistic or other specialist skills."</ul>
<p><a name="11091249000167"></a>As noble Lords will know, a number of specialist independent schools in the country provide excellent education for children with, for example, high musical ability. Those schools are available only to those pupils whose parents can pay the fees, or who are able and lucky enough to get a scholarship. Presumably we would all think it is a good thing that there are specialist music schools in the country which provide for those very able children; why should those schools not be available-again, we would not need very many of them-for children with high musical or artistic skills whose parents cannot afford for them to go to the current independent schools?</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000168"></a>Amendment 124 allows for the possibility that schools could be specialist in either academic or other skill areas. I should point out that the wording on the paper here, as it reached the list of amendments, has the word "and" at the end of it-"at end, insert ', and'". I only noticed going through it today that that word should probably have been "or". The amendment is not intended to limit the previous conditions under which academies can specialise: it is an additional opportunity. I hope noble Lords will not mind if I speak to it on that basis.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC167"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC167</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000169"></a>Amendment 139 is a consequential amendment: if we are going to have schools which specialise in providing for high-ability children or children with specialist skills in some areas, then clearly those schools have to be able to select those children on the basis of their ability or aptitude. It does not require, and I would not specify, any particular age group. I think it is important that these schools can be flexible in terms of the age group in which people are recognised as having the appropriate talent. It does not specify how they select them. Obviously one would hope that they would be as innovative as possible in recognising underlying aptitude rather than just demonstrated results. However, it is important that schools which focus on the needs of high-ability children have some means of selecting them from those parents who wish to apply to have their children go to a free state school.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000170"></a>The last of the three amendments is Amendment 125. It goes one step further, in recognising that there are indeed many such schools in existence in the country, some of which were available to children paid for by the state in the past, but which moved into the private sector with the ending of the direct grant school system. Where such schools exist, if they want to return to the state sector and provide this kind of specialised selective education or academic education for children of high ability, why should we not allow them to move back, and into the status of academies? This amendment would allow them to do so. It seems to me almost beyond argument that, if we have schools that provide very high quality education for children of high ability which at the moment are available only to children whose parents can pay fees for that education, it must be hugely socially beneficial to allow those schools to be open to children whose parents cannot afford the fees. Why should we exclude 90 per cent of the children in the country from the best schools, if those schools want to open their doors and become part of the state sector? I hope that will have universal support.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000171"></a>My noble friend Lord Lucas has another amendment that I shall let him now speak to, which has a similar objective, although a different wording. I should be happy to support that also, and I look forward to hearing the Minister's response on how the Government view such arrangements. I hope that it will be positive and that at Report he will be able to come back with the best form of wording to enable these objectives to be met. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="11091249000172"></a><b><a name="110912-gc0002.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="11091249000303"></a>Baroness Hughes of Stretford:</b> My Lords, I am sure that all Members of the Committee are considering these issues because they share with me a desire to improve the opportunity of outcomes for all children, including high-ability children. However, there may well be-I think there is-a difference between some Members of the Committee about the most effective ways of doing that. In this sense, Amendment 124D, to which I am speaking, takes the opposite view to that just expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000173"></a>Under the Academies Act 2010, a selective school converting to academy status can maintain its selective admissions policies. Amendment 124D would remove the ability for selective schools to maintain selective  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC168"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC168</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>policies on conversion. It would require any schools converting to academy status in future to have a comprehensive admissions policy upon that conversion.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000174"></a>I shall to cite three arguments in favour of our amendment. The first is on the basis of some of the evidence from international countries that are performing better than we are in education. Secondly, I wish to raise a point of principle and, thirdly, to look at the practical implications of the Government's proposals on the issue-and whether as a result of the Bill the current ability of schools to retain selection in moving to academy status would lead to an extension of schools with selection policies. I question whether that is what the Government want.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000175"></a>First, in terms of the evidence, particularly from Finland-one of the highest performing countries on the educational spectrum in the western world-it is interesting that the Minister, following a previous debate, sent me a letter talking about the evidence for reform at some length. He cited Finland and some of the attributes of its system, particularly school autonomy and accountability for performance. However, that letter did not in particular mention the important context of the Finnish system, as well as some other systems-for autonomy and accountability. It is a system that the Finnish Government and people take very seriously, whereby schools are comprehensive and that you can achieve improvements in the context of a system in which schools take from a broad spectrum of pupils and overlay on that system powerful mechanisms for autonomy and accountability. That is what produces the substantial improvements that have been seen in Finland. Therefore, if we are going to use evidence-and I support an evidence-based approach to policy-we ought to take all the evidence we have, including that evidence from Finland.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000176"></a>The second point is one of principle. The idea of a selective academy-not just what the previous Government were trying to achieve but what the current Government profess to want to achieve-is something of a contradiction in terms. Under Labour, academies could select only 10 per cent of their pupils-not on the basis of ability but of aptitude if the academy had a particular specialism. We believe-and in terms of what the Government have said to date, I cannot believe that they would not share this view; but I would welcome any contradiction to that effect-that academies should be comprehensive. If a selective school is to have the freedoms of an academy, it should by definition make a commitment to all the children in the local area and not simply cream off those whom it thinks are the most able. It should be committed to driving up the levels of attainment of all students, which means admitting those children whose backgrounds are such that they have further to go in reaching their potential because of some of the barriers that they face. That is a principle with which some Members of the Committee may not agree, but I put it forward to the Minister as a principle that I thought the Government shared.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000177"></a>The third issue is one of practical implication. Academies are their own admissions authorities. Research in this country has already suggested that, without checks and balances, academies have a greater opportunity  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC169"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC169</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>covertly to select than perhaps we all would wish. Leaving that point aside, however, there must be concern under the Bill that if selective schools become academies it will lead in practice to an extension of selection. Clause 58 will allow selective schools becoming academies to widen the age range of their intake. This could lead to a state education system which allowed selection at primary as well as secondary level. Under the Government's draft admissions code, popular selective academies can expand without agreement from the local authority or the Secretary of State. I should like the Minister to comment on whether that means that a selective academy could not only expand in size but also, as has been commented on, establish a cluster school elsewhere which would be managed by the head teacher and senior management team and thereby extend selection to a larger number of pupils.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000178"></a>That is the reason for my amendment. I should be grateful if the Minister could respond to the points that I have raised. First, do the Government want to see an extension of selection, or are they neutral about it? Secondly, do they believe that academies should serve the whole community and, if so, why are selective schools which become academies being allowed to retain selection? Thirdly, does not the Minister share my concern that that provision, together with the two elements of the Bill which I have identified, could-however inadvertently on the Government's part-lead to an extension of selection? Would the Government be happy if that were the case?</p>

<p><a name="11091249000179"></a><b><a name="110912-gc0002.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="11091249000304"></a>Lord Lucas:</b> My Lords, I shall speak to Amendment 126A. The previous Government made a good deal of progress in closing the gap between state and independent schools, to the extent that two or three independent schools crossed back into the state sector. This Government have made considerable further progress in that direction. It is clear that the institution of free schools and the freeing-up of obligations on academies generally will reduce the demand for independent education and bring children back into the state sector. The pressures now imposed by the Office for Fair Access will have a similar effect.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000180"></a>There is a question to be asked of the Opposition. Do they share my ambition to see over time some of the independent sector reabsorbed back into the state sector? If so, how far are they prepared to go to achieve that? It does not seem to be going very far to allow a selective independent school to come back into the state sector as a selective state school.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000181"></a>I do not share my noble friend's views on selection. I rather like the Toby Young form of selection-that is, that every child should learn Latin. That seems to be an academic equivalent of university technical colleges. You set out to be a different kind of school, but it is the parents who choose whether to send their child to that school, not the school that chooses whether to accept the parents. I very much hope that that form of differentiation will prove to be stable and will be a pattern to which schools that are presently selective will find themselves able to adapt once they see that it produces a workable and fine school. We are indulging in a very interesting set of experiments.</p>

<p><a name="11091249000182"></a>In my amendment, what I am interested in is not the bottom end of the independent sector, which has been crossing the divide until now and, I suspect, will continue to do so as financial pressures mount, but whether we can move far enough to allow some of the cream of the independent sector to come back to the state sector. What I have set out here-not with anyone's particular permission but having talked to a lot of people about it-is a way in which we might achieve that, and I do not think that that would be a bad thing for the state sector. One of the problems of the division that we have at the moment, with 7 per cent independent and 93 per cent state is that the 7 per cent is sufficient to allow a lot of institutions and professions to headhunt and recruit principally in that sector. They can get all they want from there. It would be much healthier if we could reduce that percentage and have a number of stellar schools come back into the state sector to change fundamentally the attitude of recruiters, particularly in the professions, to the question of where they get their recruits.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000183"></a>The Labour Party has had several chances radically to undermine the independent sector but has never done it, so why do we not move rather more gently to achieve what should be a common objective between me and the Opposition? Given all the progress that those in the Labour Party made in their years in office, I do not think that it is that big a step.</p>

<p><a name="11091249000184"></a><b><a name="110912-gc0002.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="11091249000305"></a>Lord Hill of Oareford:</b> My Lords, we discussed back in July how important it is that schools should be able to meet the needs of the most able children, and we talked then about some of the ways in which that could be done.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000185"></a>I shall try to answer some of the questions put to me about my view of the situation. The current position on the number of schools that may select by ability or aptitude strikes me as being one that we have arrived at in a typically English and messy way over many years. Our position is that it should continue as it is. These amendments seek in different ways to use the process of conversion to academy status as a catalyst for either increasing or decreasing the number of selective schools in the state sector, and the Government are opposed to a move in either direction.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000186"></a>We think that academies, with the freedoms and flexibilities that academy status brings, should be well placed to provide stretching and demanding provision for pupils with a particular ability or a general aptitude for learning. Our policy is to ensure that as many schools as possible are able to take up these freedoms, and that includes grammar schools and independent selective schools. However, we have been clear that we do not intend to increase the number of selective schools in the state system. Therefore, we have been clear that when independent schools convert to academy status, we do not think they should be able to bring their selective admission arrangements with them.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000187"></a>My noble friend Lord Lucas's amendment would allow independent schools to become academies but continue to charge parents fees, though not, I appreciate, those who could not afford it. However, the principle that state-funded school education should be available free of charge to all children is one with which most noble Lords would agree.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC171"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC171</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000188"></a>We also know, however, that where there are selective schools in the state system they are often highly valued by local parents and are part of the education landscape, and we are equally clear that that state of affairs should continue. That was the position of the previous Government and it is one that we want to continue, so we do not think that those schools should lose their right to select simply because they become academies.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000189"></a>We support the right of state-funded schools that selected by ability prior to the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 to continue to do so, but it is not our intention to increase the number of selective schools. However, existing selective maintained schools and academies may expand-as they were permitted to do under the previous Government-where there is demand, where funding is in place and where such proposals have been agreed locally.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000190"></a>Rather ingloriously, perhaps, I find myself arguing for the status quo. I assure the Committee, however, that we are taking steps to ensure that as many children as possible have access to a good local school and that all those schools, whether they are academies or maintained schools, provide a stretching education for all their pupils. As my noble friend Lady Garden said in a previous debate on these issues, these steps include promoting free schools to increase good places, allowing good schools to expand and taking the limit off the published admissions number, freeing head teachers to take decisions on how to spend that money and slimming down the national curriculum so that schools can design a curriculum that best meets their pupils' needs.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000191"></a>I know that my noble friend Lord Blackwell believes strongly in the case behind the amendments and that his concern is to try to increase social mobility and achievement for children from the poorest backgrounds so that they have the opportunity to flourish in a way that we would want to see. I am aware of his commitment to social mobility and the sense of moral purpose that he brings to this argument, which is not the preserve of one side in this debate. Saying what I have said about the Government's position of leaving things as they stand and preserving the status quo will disappoint my noble friend. In spite of that, I hope that for the moment he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="11091249000192"></a><b><a name="110912-gc0002.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="11091249000306"></a>Lord Lucas:</b> My Lords, I am not sure that I understand the moral difference between allowing a grammar school to expand and allowing an independent school to join the state sector as a selective school. Both have the effect of increasing the number of selective places in the UK state system. Why is one good and the other bad?</p>

<p><a name="11091249000193"></a><b><a name="110912-gc0002.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="11091249000307"></a>Lord Hill of Oareford:</b> I do not think that it is a point of merit, as it were, and I would not claim that it were. It is a practical point. There are a number of schools in the maintained sector where selection already takes place. We think that it is right that they should  


<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC172"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column GC172</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be able to become academies and that, as has always been the case, they should be able to expand. The point about independent schools coming into the maintained sector and retaining selective arrangements is that it would increase the number of selective schools in the system. For reasons of practicality rather than anything else, the Government have come to the view that we do not want to increase the number of schools where selection takes place.</p>

<p><a name="11091249000194"></a><b><a name="110912-gc0002.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="11091249000308"></a>Lord Blackwell:</b> My Lords, I thank everyone who contributed. As the Minister suggests, I am not entirely happy with his answer. The status quo may be a pragmatic English outcome but it is difficult to defend a situation where in certain parts of the country grammar schools still exist and children from modest-income or low-income families have the opportunity to get some of the best education on offer, but in large parts of the country there are no grammar schools and children from similar backgrounds do not have that opportunity. Despite all the years of effort to ensure that all schools provide the best education for children of high ability, we know that it is very difficult to get that to work. There are many areas where those children are therefore destined not to fulfil their potential because they do not have access to the kind of education that many of our generation had, and which enabled us to move up the social structure. I find that difficult to accept as a pragmatic outcome, although I understand the reasons for it.</p>

<a name="110912-gc0002.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="11091249000195"></a>The second reason why this disappoints me is that we might be missing just how important it is to the future prosperity of this country that we educate our top-ability children to their full potential. We will be competing in a world where our brain power and skills are among the main factors that will allow us to prosper. To have a large part of our population without access to the best education and the best opportunities to develop is to throw away our chances of national growth and prosperity. This is not a position that will sustain for very long as a messy compromise. I shall reflect on what the Minister has said before we come back to this on Report, and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="110912-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="1109121000004"></a>Today Ofsted publish its third report on welfare and duty of care in Armed Forces initial training, copies of which have been placed in the Library of the House. Following visits to 11 Armed Forces initial training establishments, Ofsted reports that recruits and trainees feel that their welfare needs are met and well supported.</p>

<a name="110912-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="1109121000005"></a>The Armed Forces remain committed to ensuring that the training they provide is both efficient and effective, recognising the need to continuously evaluate what works well and areas that need improvement. Ofsted inspection suggests that review processes in training establishments are improving and in one location the overall effect is judged to be outstanding.</p>

<a name="110912-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="1109121000006"></a>We need to continue to provide effective training in the face of resource and operational pressures, whilst providing a supportive training environment that enables instructors to bring out the best in young recruits and trainees without lessening the tough nature of Armed Forces training.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="1109121000008"></a>The Treasury has laid before the House of Commons a report required under Section 231 of the Banking Act 2009 covering the period from 1 October 2010 to 31 March 2011. Copies of the document are available in the Vote Office.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="1109121000009"></a><b><a name="110912-wms0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="1109121000085"></a>The Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord McNally):</b> The answer I gave on 7 September 2011 following Lord Rambotham's question about what action Her Majesty's Government are taking to speed up the ending of slopping out in prisons in England and Wales (<I>Official Report</I>, col. 280) contained two inaccuracies, which I would like to correct.</p>

<a name="110912-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="1109121000010"></a>Only nine prisons in England and Wales have cells without integral sanitation facilities. This constitutes a total of 1,973 prison places or less than 3 per cent of the overall capacity.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS36"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column WS36</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110912-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="1109121000011"></a>Prisoners have access to wing recess facilities during the day, but during lock-up they can access the facilities only via an electronic unlock system. Those wishing to use the facilities can access them several times during the evening for a specific period. The number of times and the duration vary from prison to prison. By way of example, at HMP Albany during evening lock-up, prisoners are able to use the electronic unlock system to gain access to sanitation facilities on three occasions for a period of up to nine minutes on each visit (total up to 27 minutes).</p>

<a name="110912-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="1109121000012"></a>A bucket with a lid is issued to each prisoner in case of an emergency, and I emphasise that it is very much an emergency measure and they are rarely used. Should the electronic unlock system break down, every effort is made to repair the system as quickly as possible and, where resources allow, alternative measures are put in place to enable prisoners to access the wing facilities. At Albany, when technical difficulties have arisen in the past, additional staff have been brought in to ensure prisoners could be manually unlocked to use the facilities.</p>

<a name="110912-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="1109121000013"></a>Therefore prisoners do not have to use the bucket when there are technical difficulties with the unlock system. The bucket remains an emergency measure only.</p>

<a name="110912-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="1109121000014"></a>Should prisoners use the bucket, they are required to empty it themselves either on their next visit to the facilities during evening lock-up or the following day.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_3"></a>
<a name="1109121000015"></a><b><a name="110912-wms0001.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="1109121000086"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord Freud):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Iain Duncan Smith) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="110912-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="1109121000016"></a>Following the spending review and development of this coalition Government's programme for welfare reform, the Department for Work and Pensions has reviewed from first principles its organisational structure and governance to ensure it is best placed for the future.</p>

<a name="110912-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="1109121000017"></a>Subject to the Welfare Reform Bill achieving Royal Assent, universal credit (UC) will, for example, require DWP to deal not only with those out of work-where the existing Jobcentre Plus network and brand is strong and effective-but with those in employment, which will account for approximately half the UC case load in steady state. Starting from 2013, this approach requires a different organisational structure.</p>

<a name="110912-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="1109121000018"></a>Furthermore, a consistent message that work will always pay can also be reinforced by managing claims for disability living allowance (and, in due course, subject to safe passage of legislation, the personal independence payment) for people of working age alongside those for universal credit. This reform will also mean that support for housing costs are incorporated with pension credit, once universal credit is established and local authorities no longer administer housing benefit.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS37"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column WS37</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110912-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="1109121000019"></a>These structural reforms illustrate the extent to which traditional boundaries, within and beyond the DWP, will change. The breadth of the reforms also puts a premium on the flexibility that comes from removing some of those boundaries, as we build a welfare system fit for the future.</p>

<a name="110912-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="1109121000020"></a>At the same time, the department will deliver a 40 per cent reduction in the cost of the corporate centre, including the centres of Jobcentre Plus and the Pension, Disability and Carers Service.</p>

<a name="110912-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="1109121000021"></a>Reflecting all this, the department will:</p>
 bring all its day to day operations under the leadership of a chief operating officer, within a smaller executive team led by the Permanent Secretary; make more transparent, and manage as a single entity, the portfolio of reform to which the Government are committed; andto facilitate this, remove the formal agency status of Jobcentre Plus and the Pension, Disability and Carers Service from Monday 3 October.
<a name="110912-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="1109121000022"></a>By creating a single integrated, senior management structure, the department has been able to reduce the number of senior Civil Service roles by almost a third since May 2010.</p>

<a name="110912-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="1109121000023"></a>With the departmental board, now chaired by the Secretary of State and with four non-executives all appointed since May 2011, the removal of formal agency status also enables the removal of separate management boards for each agency. The finances of each agency are already consolidated with the department's accounts, but the changes will also avoid two sets of subsidiary accounts, each separately prepared and audited.</p>

<a name="110912-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="1109121000024"></a>I would like to put on record my appreciation for the ongoing efforts of DWP's front-line staff. They continue to deliver important services in local communities and will continue to do so with the introduction of universal credit under this new DWP organisational structure.</p>

<a name="110912-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="1109121000025"></a>Current arrangements for parliamentary questions, correspondence and inquiries from Members will continue unaltered as we deepen our commitment to transparency and professional communications in DWP.</p>

<a name="110912-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="1109121000026"></a>Taken together, this new structure will ensure DWP is well placed to deliver reform for a welfare system fit for the 21st century.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="1109121000032"></a>Ministers had a broad discussion covering the EU's relationships with emerging powers. The discussion focused largely, although not exclusively, on relations with India, Brazil and South Africa. This continued a process set in train at last September's European Council. This is an area where we welcome the External Action Service's efforts to define clearer collective EU priorities, common objectives, and methods for using member states' collective weight to advance our security and prosperity objectives.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="1109121000033"></a>Ministers agreed on the importance of the EU's economic and trade relations with these strategic partners. They also discussed how to enhance our engagement on political and security issues, complementing our national diplomatic efforts. And there was general agreement on the need to use the EU's collective voice better to influence some of our strategic partners on areas such as human rights.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="1109121000038"></a>The Gymnich discussion came a day after the Paris conference co-chaired by the Prime Minister and President Sarkozy. Baroness Ashton set out proposed priorities for the EU's post-conflict assistance. There was general agreement that any potential EU financial and post-conflict stabilisation assistance should respect the need for National Transition Council ownership and a UN lead.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="1109121000040"></a>The discussion on Syria took place in the presence of EU candidate countries (Iceland, Montenegro, FYROM, Croatia and Turkey) and focused on EU measures against the regime. On 2 September, the  EU agreed a collective ban on imports of Syrian crude oil products. By doing so the EU made clear that it will continue to increase the pressure on President Assad until he steps aside and allows a transition to a different type of regime. The horrific scenes of brutality throughout Ramadan were unacceptable, and the ban on all EU imports of Syrian crude oil products will help constrict the regime's funding and reduce its ability to fund the repression of innocent civilians.</p>

On Ukraine, concern was expressed about the trial and subsequent detention of Yuliya Tymoshenko and other opposition leaders. On Belarus, Ministers stressed the need to maintain the EU's firm position on releasing and rehabilitating all political prisoners. I underlined the importance of progress on implementing the revised European neighbourhood policy. Baroness Ashton and Stefan Fule (Commissioner for Enlargement) reiterated their commitment to deliver results.

This is a committee of officials from the member states, with attendance from the Commission, to prepare and discuss aspects of the next Multiannual Financial Framework. The Commission proposals (linked here: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/budget/reform/">http://ec.europa.eu/budget/reform/</a>) were published in June 2011 and are unacceptable to the UK. The UK Government have been clear that, at a time of ongoing economic fragility in Europe and tight constraints on domestic public spending, the Commission's proposal for the Multiannual Financial Framework is unrealistic. It is too large; it is not the restrained budget the Commission claims and it is incompatible with the tough decisions being taken in countries across Europe. The negotiations are at a very early stage and discussion is expected to be general.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a><a name="1109121000062"></a>I am today announcing the Government's intention to ban referral fees in personal injury cases. This complements our wider plans for civil litigation funding and costs, including fundamental reforms to no-win no-fee conditional fee agreements.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="9" year="2011" textMonth="Sep"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS41"></a><b>12 Sep 2011 : Column WS41</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110912-wms0001.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a><a name="1109121000063"></a>Referral fees are usually paid by solicitors to third parties, usually claims management companies or insurers, who refer business to them. But current arrangements have led to the growth of an industry that actively encourages individuals to bring cases, regardless of the merits of their claim.</p>

<a name="110912-wms0001.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a><a name="1109121000064"></a>The Government strongly believe that it is not in the public interest for potential claimants to be sought out and encouraged to make claims by people who profit from their claims being pursued. We believe that referral fees add to the high costs and volume of personal injury litigation, one of the factors underpinning increases in insurance premiums. As Lord Young recognised in his report, <I>Common Sense, Common Safety</I>, last year, referral fees also contribute to the risk of corrosive compensation culture.</p>

<a name="110912-wms0001.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a><a name="1109121000065"></a>Lord Justice Jackson, in his review of civil litigation funding and costs, which was published last year, recommended that referral fees should be banned or capped in personal injury cases.</p>

<a name="110912-wms0001.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_56"></a><a name="1109121000066"></a>Our aim is to reform the system to end the abuses that have occurred while ensuring that victims who have suffered a personal injury through someone else's negligence remain able to make a claim for damages where they have an appropriate case. Alongside the planned reforms to conditional fee agreements, the ban on referral fees will contribute to the Government's plans to tackle the compensation culture by discouraging unmeritorious claims and controlling the disproportionate costs of personal injury claims, without denying access to justice.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_63"></a><a name="1109121000075"></a>The Government response confirms our commitment to the creation of a New Waterways Charity in England and Wales, subject to parliamentary approval. It details the main points raised by stakeholders during the consultation exercise, and the Government's proposals in the light of those comments. The response has been developed by working closely with the transition trustees of the new charity. Key points addressed in the response include:</p>
local partnerships will be named waterways partnerships to reflect their strategic role and size; each partnership will develop a localism strategy;fair representation of different groups on the council will be prioritised. Private boaters, boating businesses and NWC employees will directly elect their representatives from the outset. We will progress to 50 per cent of the council being directly elected over time;in addition to the waterways partnerships that cover the waterways in England, and those that cover the waterways straddling England and Wales, there will be a separate all-Wales partnership, with representation from associated bodies with a Welsh remit; we are publishing a revised and enhanced draft of the charitable purposes; andmore detail is available on how the Government will work with the charity to secure and safeguard public benefits, including free pedestrian access to the towpaths, through the charitable purposes, trust obligations, legislation and government funding agreement.
<a name="110912-wms0001.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_64"></a><a name="1109121000076"></a>Government believe that the move to civil society will secure the long-term financial sustainability of the waterways. We have already announced plans to transfer all of British Waterways' property assets to the charity, as an endowment, and to commit to a long-term funding agreement. The length and terms of the agreement will be subject to negotiation and final agreement between Government and the transition trustees, this autumn.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_65"></a><a name="1109121000077"></a>The further consultation on legislation deals with the content of the proposed transfer order under the Public Bodies Bill, which will, subject to parliamentary approval, transfer the functions of British Waterways in England and Wales to the new charity. The document provides further information about the legislation that currently relates to British Waterways, the principles underpinning the functions to be transferred, and proposed amendments to legislation. It invites comments

<p><a name="wms_stpa_67"></a><a name="1109121000080"></a>The Government are committed to providing certainty to taxpayers and acknowledge the concerns raised in the responses to the consultation. They have therefore decided not to proceed further with the consultation on the proposed legislation and will not include it in Finance Bill 2012.</p>

<a name="110912-wms0001.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_68"></a><a name="1109121000081"></a>The Government will continue to challenge specific arrangements that clearly seek to abuse provisions in a DTA.</p>

<a name="110912-wms0001.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_69"></a><a name="1109121000082"></a>This decision reaffirms the Government's commitment to open and transparent consultation and demonstrates the value of consultation. The Government's approach set out in their tax consultation framework has been widely welcomed by business and others as providing a much improved basis for developing new legislation. If the Government conclude in the future that alternative approaches for legislating against treaty abuse are necessary, it will consult on these alternatives in line with the tax consultation framework.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a><a name="1109129000010"></a>Reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are collected by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and Commission for Human Medicines through the spontaneous reporting scheme; the yellow card scheme. The scheme collects ADR reports from across the whole United Kingdom and includes all medicines, including those from prescriptions, over-the-counter or general retail sales. Reports are also received for herbal medicines and other unlicensed medicines.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a><a name="1109129000011"></a>As of 6 September 2011, the MHRA has received a total of 29 UK spontaneous suspected ADR reports associated with pyridostigmine. These reports describe a total of 77 reactions, two of which had a fatal outcome. A complete listing of all UK spontaneous suspected ADR reports associated with pyridostigmine is available to view on our website at: <a href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk/daps">www.mhra.gov.uk/daps</a>.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_3"></a><a name="1109129000012"></a>It should be noted that healthcare professionals and patients are asked to report suspected adverse reactions on a voluntary basis and the submission of a report does not mean that the reaction cited was definitely caused by the medicine. Many factors have to be taken into account in assessing causal relationships including temporal association, the possible contribution of concomitant medication and the underlying disease being treated.</p>
